40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the regulation and coordination of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> in international investment arbitration. The paper first focuses on Lauder/CME v. Czech Republic, a recent case of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{that resulted in}} conflicting decisions, and identifies problems raised therein. Then, it examines the legal rules applicable to arbitral proceedings governing <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> and explores legislative solutions at the international treaty level to regulate and coordinate the <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> <b>Parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> can be classified in two types. The first type is the "objective consolidation" type in which multiple proceedings, including those alleging breach of investment contract {{in addition to those}} charging violation of the investment treaty between the investor's home and host states, are filed between the same investor and the host state. The second type is the "subjective consolidation" type which involves multiple proceedings between more than one party on the investor's side and the host state. This latter type, as exemplified by the Lauder/CME case, typically takes the form of two arbitration proceedings - one initiated by an investor and the other by its subsidiary under the investor's control - seeking compensation for damage resulting from measures or acts of the host government. This type of parallel proceeding would not give rise to the issue of res judicata, but it could create a burden on host states if they are forced to face multiple proceedings based on essentially the same facts, diseconomies associated with the duplication of proceedings, and the possibility of conflicting awards. Thus, from these perspectives it is considered necessary to regulate and coordinate <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The need of such regulation and coordination is recognized internationally. At the moment, however, there exists no dominant view concerning legal rules governing <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> and no relevant rules are provided in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention). Meanwhile, all arbitral and court precedents concerning <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings,</b> including those in the Lauder/CME case, dictate that in order for a court or tribunal to prevent the commencement of a second proceeding its subject matter must be identical to that of an earlier proceeding before another court or tribunal. However, with such a stringent requirement, it is difficult to regulate and coordinate <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> in reality. In international investment arbitration, which is subject to the application of national law, given this commonality in nature, i. e., the presence of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings,</b> it may be considered reasonable to apply the rules regulating concurrent litigations in different jurisdictions to international investment arbitration. However, unlike concurrent litigations it is impossible to fulfill the same-subject-matter requirement in international investment arbitration and no rules exist for consolidating parallel arbitration proceedings. Also, consideration must be given to the need to ensure the remedy of the party's rights. As such, it is difficult to address problems arising from parallel arbitration proceedings by uniformly applying the legal principle that regulates overlapping proceedings. Therefore, it would be more appropriate for an arbitral tribunal to decide on a case by case basis whether or not to stay its proceeding based on the balance of various interests involving the case, thus treating the issue as a matter of procedural authority concerning case management. In legislative attempts {{to solve the problem of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings,</b> provisions such as a fork-in-the-road clause, a waiver clause, and consolidation provisions that are designed to regulate and coordinate <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> have been incorporated in the ICSID Convention and some international investment treaties. None of these provisions provide a perfect solution. However, by making modifications to the waiver clause and applying it in combination with the consolidation provisions it would be possible to regulate and coordinate most of the problems arising from <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Such attempts to regulate and coordinate <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> will result in fewer dispute settlement options for investors seeking the remedy of their rights; thus making it unlikely that concerned countries will work together and take a concerted legislative step to regulate and coordinate <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> However, since such regulation and coordination should be based on the universal value of the fundamental principle of procedure and there exists the potential risk of conflicting awards as exemplified by the Lauder/CME case, it is desirable to include provisions for regulating and coordinating <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> in investment treaties. This paper also examines whether national law - the Arbitration Act (Act No. 138 of 2003) in case of Japan - is applicable to investment arbitration that {{concerns the}} regulation and coordination of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> and constitutes a prerequisite to deal with such issues, and whether the resulting arbitral award is subject to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention). It is concluded that both national law and the New York Convention are applicable. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a debate in the European Union over the need to provide a {{transparent}} and predictable interface between international arbitration and cross-border litigation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I closely scrutinize the legal {{relationships}} between investment arbitration and local remedy {{procedures in the}} global "network" of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) /economic partnership agreements (EPAs), examining the desirable {{ways in which the}} two relationships should be regulated. When investors refer disputes to investment arbitration (procedures for international arbitration between investors and states) they are not required to exhaust local remedies, {{but on the other hand}} investment treaties contain certain restrictions on the simultaneous use of local remedy procedures and investment arbitration. The extent to which investors are permitted procedural choices is a factor that determines whether foreign investment protection is effective, and with regard to cases of investment arbitration in recent years, the issue of whether "parallel proceedings" at both the domestic and international level by investors (and their subsidiaries) are allowed has been an important point of contention at the jurisdiction phase. An exhaustive study of the provisions of model BITs and of BITs/FTAs (EPAs) that have actually been concluded shows that, from the perspective of the relationship between investment arbitration and local remedy procedures, arbitration clauses can be placed in five categories: (1) those that have no stipulations on this matter ("no reference" type), (2) those that offer a choice between the two ("fork in the road" type), (3) those that require investors to waive local remedies, in order to submit their claims to international arbitration ("no U turn" type), (4) those that permit <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> ("parallel proceedings" type), and (5) those that give priority to local remedy procedures ("local remedy first" type). Under the "no reference" type and "parallel proceedings" type provisions, there are no restrictions as regards pursuing <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Also the procedural options for investors are quite broad under the "fork in the road" and "local remedy first" clauses, since, if the causes of action or the disputing parties are different at the domestic level and at the international level, the dispute at the former are distinguished from the disputes at the latter, and <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> are permitted. Under these provisions it is permissible for multiple <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> to be carried on simultaneously with regard to a series of situations relating to one particular foreign investment, raising the risk that investors may reap the "double benefit. " On the other hand, since no <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> whatever are allowed under the "no U-turn" clauses, there is no risk of double relief, but that also means that when investors file for international arbitration they have to waive all methods of obtaining local remedies, thereby severely limiting the procedural choices open to investors. However, if "no U-turn" clauses enable not only claims based on treaties, but also those based on investment agreements and/or investment authorizations, to be referred to international arbitration, they provide foreign investors with appropriate and fair protection, at the same time removing the legal uncertainty associated with <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Study should be pursued on the inclusion of arbitration provisions of this kind in EPAs and BITs concluded by Japan in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the problem of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the {{research}} starts, in Chapter 1, with a description of the taxonomy of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> (Paragraph 1. 1) and with an analysis of the most likely reasons behind the growth of this phenomenon (Paragraph 1. 2). Chapter 1 deeply analyses the already mentioned policy considerations at the basis of the research (Paragraph 1. 3). The following structure of the research follows the temporal sequence of the various phases of arbitration where the problem may emerge, namely jurisdiction, admissibility and post-award. The analysis starts – at Chapter 2 – by examining the jurisdictional stage, where, as it is demonstrated, there are no solutions to the problem of <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Indeed, this phase is based on the grundnorm of consent and there are no available legal tools that allow arbitrators to decline jurisdiction disregarding party autonomy (Paragraph 2. 1). Similarly, remedies based on a sole exercise of discretion (such as comity) are not reliable in order to find a predictable {{solution to the problem of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> (Paragraph 2. 2). The research then moves to the analysis of the remedies available at the stage of admissibility. This methodologically imposes to preliminary deal with several other questions, such as the legal foundation of the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility (Paragraph 3. 1), the analysis of the inherent powers (if any) of arbitrators to safeguard the interests of justice while administering their proceedings, and the law applicable in international investment arbitration (with a particular focus on the applicability of general principles of international law) (Paragraph 3. 2). We first of all demonstrate that international law provides us with some instruments in order to avoid <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> (not including lis pendens, as demonstrated in Paragraph 3. 3), namely the principles of good faith and finality (Paragraph 3. 4). These principles respectively furnish the grounds for the doctrine of abuse of process, on the one side, and res judicata and collateral estoppel, on the other side. It is then necessary to understand how and whether these tools may be applied in investment arbitration (Paragraphs 3. 5, 3. 6 and 3. 7). This requires, firstly, an analysis of these doctrines in international law and, secondly, a comparative analysis of how they have been applied in different municipal systems (with a particular focus on the distinction between civil law and common law systems). It finally emerges that such doctrines have been applied also in a flexible and substance-oriented way, which would be very helpful in order to limit <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings.</b> This approach is, indeed, highly desirable. Chapter 3 also demonstrates how these doctrines may operate in concrete (Paragraph 3. 8) and put forward a proposal of amendment of rules of international arbitration in order to limit <b>parallel</b> <b>proceedings</b> and, at the same time, ensure the respect of due process (Paragraph 3. 9). Finally, remedies available at post-award stage will be examined in Chapter 4. These remedies are different with regard to ICSID awards – being ICSID a self-contained regime – and with regard to non-ICSID awards, which shall be enforced according to the provisions of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. In the former case, we try to understand whether the remedy of annulment provided by the ICSID Convention may be useful in order to avoid the existence of two duplicative awards (Paragraph 4. 1). In the latter case the only available means to preclude the enforcement of a duplicative award is the public policy exception set forth in Art. V(2) (b) of the New York Convention. The analysis of the public policy exception involves several difficulties due to the involvement of municipal laws and courts and will require an examination of the national rules of private international law regulating the problem of conflicting judgments (Paragraph 4. 2). Finally, Paragraph 4. 3 tries to understand whether the existence of duplicative awards may be a ground for annulment at the place of the seat of arbitration...|$|E
