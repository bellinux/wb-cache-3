50|$|Photometers {{are used}} to {{determine}} the correct exposure in photography. In modern cameras, the photometer is usually built in. As <b>the</b> illumination <b>of</b> different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> varies, advanced photometers measure the light intensity in different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential <b>picture</b> and use an algorithm to determine the most suitable exposure for <b>the</b> final <b>picture,</b> adapting <b>the</b> algorithm to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> intended (see Metering mode). Historically, a photometer was separate from the camera and known as an exposure meter. The advanced photometers then could be used either to measure the light from <b>the</b> potential <b>picture</b> as a whole, to measure from elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> to ascertain that <b>the</b> most important <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> are optimally exposed, or to measure the incident light to the scene with an integrating adapter.|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} of the known artists of the older generation is the Inscription Painter, of the younger representatives the Phineus Painter. The former is presumably the originator of the style; some 170 of the surviving vases are attributed to the very productive workshop of the latter. He is probably also the last representative of this style. The images are usually more decorative than narrative. Riders, animal friezes, heraldic pictures or groups of people are shown. A large lotus-palmette cross is frequently <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Mythological scenes are seldom, but when they occur they are in general of exceptionally high quality.|$|E
500|$|Whistler's Nocturne series {{achieved}} notoriety in 1877, when influential critic John Ruskin visited {{an exhibition}} of the series at the Grosvenor Gallery. He wrote of the painting Nocturne in Black and Gold– The Falling Rocket, that Whistler was [...] "asking two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face". Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878. The judge in the case caused laughter in the court when, referring to Nocturne: Blue and Gold– Old Battersea Bridge, he asked Whistler [...] "Which <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is the bridge?"; the case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one farthing.|$|E

500|$|Other critics admired Etty's unusual {{interpretation}} of apocalyptic religious imagery, {{his ability to}} give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination. The Morning Post particularly praised Etty's ability to convey [...] "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" [...] by combining the [...] "dauntless spirit of a sketch" [...] with the [...] "powerful impression of a finished picture". The prominent art critic William Paulet Carey (writing {{under the name of}} 'Ridolfi') championed The Destroying Angel, and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and The Destroying Angel as evidence of Etty's [...] "redeeming grace and spirit". Etty's long-standing adversaries at The Morning Chronicle found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that [...] "The upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing." [...] The reticence of The Morning Chronicle prompted Carey to comment that they were in [...] "envious silence".|$|E
500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{received}} mixed praise from trade publications. The Mirror commended the film for the clever adaptation which preserved coherency in the story, the good acting and adequate costuming despite a few {{flaws in the}} production. Among the errors highlighted by the Mirror was Eliza's ice scene and another scene where the black actors wore inaccurate attire such as a laborer who wore a fine shirt and tie. The Morning Telegraph reviewer did not care for the production much, finding issues with the adaptation, the acting and the scenes. The Moving Picture News was more positive in its review, praising the photography and the sensible adaptation of the book to the film format. Three different reviews in The Moving Picture World were published, each of which were positive. In contrast to the fault found in the Mirror, one of the reviewers specifically praised the ice scene by stating, [...] "This <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{seems to have been}} conceived and carried out with extraordinary realism. You see the snow falling, the ice floes cracking and moving, you felt the danger that the woman and child were running as they made their escape across the ice, pursued by their remorseless enemy through the blinding snowstorm. This is one of the finest effects I have seen on the moving picture screen, and the whole story, so far as I have seen it, is worked out with wonderful realism, effect and verisimilitude. It's as good a rendering of the subject as I have ever seen, and I have seen Uncle Tom's Cabin played several times." [...] The Leavenworth Times of Leavenworth, Kansas had an article reviewing the production and offered much praise for adaptation.|$|E
500|$|The film, which premiered in Los Angeles at the Carthay Circle Theatre, was {{the first}} musical film in history for which one of its cast members won an Academy Award. Luise Rainer {{received}} the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Ziegfeld's first wife, Anna Held. The film, the pride of MGM {{at a time when}} Warner Brothers and RKO Pictures were the leading studios in Hollywood for musical production, was a major commercial and critical success {{and one of the most}} successful films of the 1930s, grossing US$4,673,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) worldwide at the box office. It was acclaimed upon release as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. At just short of three hours, The Great Ziegfeld was also the longest talking film of the time. (D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, both silent films, had each run over three hours.) TCM has acclaimed the [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" [...] sequence as one of [...] "the most famous musical numbers ever filmed". Thomas S. Hischak has said that the film has rarely been topped for pure showmanship and glamor, [...] and Variety considered it an [...] "outstanding picture", a [...] "symbol of a tradition of show business". Variety praised the performances of the cast, remarking that as Ziegfeld, William Powell [...] "endows the impersonation with all the qualities of a great entrepreneur and sentimentalist without sacrificing the shades and moods called for" [...] and noting that Luise Rainer is [...] "tops of the femmes with her vivacious Anna Held". Stanley Green cited The Great Ziegfeld as [...] "the first of a number of elaborate show-business screen biographies". Otis Ferguson, writing for New Republic magazine, remarked that the [...] "musical numbers seem as irresistible as Ziegfeld himself". The New York American said that the film is [...] "pretty nearly everything such an extravaganza should be", with [...] "romance and reality, song and dance, gaiety and beauty, pathos and bathos". Time magazine qualified it as [...] "Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment." [...] A reviewer for the Spokane Chronicle praised the film for its superb acting, writing that [...] " [...] the great producer [...] would have been unable to produce scenes of magnitude and splendor that are given as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> telling his life." [...] Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times was also highly praising of the film, noting that it had [...] "more stars than there are in the heavens" [...] and remarking that [...] "the picture achieves its best moments in the larger sequences devoted to the Girls — ballet, chorus and show. At least one of these spectacular numbers, filmed to the music of Irving Berlin's [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody", with overtones of [...] "Rhapsody in Blue", never has been equaled on the musical comedy stage or screen." [...] John Mosher of The New Yorker called it [...] "the most lavish display the screen has had to offer" [...] with chorus numbers that were [...] "gigantic and effective", though he found the romance to be [...] "peculiarly average screen-story stuff." [...] Both The New York Times and Film Daily rated the film in the [...] "Ten Best" [...] of the year.|$|E

2500|$|According to Cogniat, in all Chagall's {{work during}} {{all stages of}} his life, it was his colors which {{attracted}} and captured the viewer's attention.

He adds, [...] "The colors are a living, integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> and are never passively flat, or banal like an afterthought. They sculpt and animate the volume of the shapes... they indulge in flights of fancy and invention which add new perspectives and graduated, blended tones...

2500|$|Most of the deleted scenes feature {{additional}} {{characters from}} the television series who ultimately did {{not appear in the}} finished film.

We thought it might be good sometime to do a longer version with these other things in, {{because a lot of the}} characters that are missing in the finished movie had been filmed. They're <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> they're just not necessary for the main story." [...] According to Lynch, had the film included these scenes, it [...] "wouldn't have been quite so dark. To me it obeyed the laws of Twin Peaks. But a little bit of the goofiness had to be removed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrument}} that was {{installed at the}} Pacoima Dam recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of 1.25g, a value that was {{twice as large as}} anything ever seen from an earthquake. The extraordinarily high acceleration was just one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> considering that duration and frequency of shaking also play a role in how much damage can occur. The accelerometer was mounted on a concrete platform on a granite ridge just above one of the arch dam's abutments. Cracks formed in the rocks and a rock slide came within [...] of the apparatus, and the foundation remained undamaged, but a small (half-degree) tilt of the unit was discovered that was apparently responsible for closing the horizontal pendulum contacts. [...] As a result of what was considered a fortunate accident, the machine kept recording for six minutes (until it ran out of paper) and provided scientists with additional data on 30 of the initial aftershocks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{workshop}} {{tradition and}} {{division of labour}} within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings.
