5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation <b>Production</b> <b>System</b> (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E
40|$|In this {{extended}} abstract, {{we propose}} Structured <b>Production</b> <b>Systems</b> (SPS), which extend traditional <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> with well-formed syntactic structures. Due to {{the richness of}} structures, structured <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> significantly enhance the expressive power {{as well as the}} flexibility of <b>production</b> <b>systems,</b> for instance, to handle uncertainty. We show that different rule application strategies can be reduced into the basic one by utilizing structures. Also, many fundamental approaches in computer science, including automata, grammar and logic, can be captured by structured <b>production</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|The vocal <b>production</b> <b>system</b> is {{controlled}} by the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E

As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases them back to the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E

5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation <b>Production</b> <b>System),</b> a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} of H.M.S. Pinafore {{relied on}} stock character types, {{many of which}} were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and <b>production</b> <b>system</b> was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.|$|E

To meet these targets, Fraunhofer IPA has some research activities in this area. It develops frugal mechanical, mechatronic, control and software components and will build up a Center for Frugal Products and <b>Production</b> <b>Systems.</b> The knowledge transfer into mechanical engineering companies will be executed by workshops and conferences.
