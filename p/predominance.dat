5|$|Subtype 1: {{favorable}} neuroblastoma with near triploidy and a <b>predominance</b> of numerical {{gains and}} losses, mostly representing non-metastatic NB stages 1, 2 and 4S.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorder}} has {{a female}} <b>predominance.</b> The typical age of adolescent onset is 12.9, {{give or take}} 0.4 years (±), with males affected sooner than females (11.0 ± 0.8 for males versus 13.8 ± 0.5 for females).|$|E
5|$|Fruit trees do {{not appear}} to be {{selected}} by species, but by availability and accessibility of edible fruit. And despite <b>predominance</b> of a few plant species in the ruffed lemur diet, the remainder of their diet consists of between 80 and 132 other species from 36 plant families.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy {{ethnic group}} forms over 90percent of Madagascar's {{population}} and is typically divided into eighteen ethnic sub-groups. Recent DNA research {{revealed that the}} genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Southeast Asian and East African genes, although the genetics of some communities show a <b>predominance</b> of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, Indian or European ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The <b>predominance</b> of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) {{forms an}} {{extensive}} family of oxyanions. The interrelationships {{in this family}} are described by the <b>predominance</b> diagram, which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration. The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, , is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. Orthovanadate V is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate. The tetrathiovanadate 3− {{is analogous to the}} orthovanadate ion.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of {{practical}} training and the <b>predominance</b> of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the <b>predominance</b> of {{orthodox}} Islam in Palestine, the region contained numerous domed structures dedicated to Muslim patron saints, among {{which was the}} Mosque of al-Khidr in Deir al-Balah. In March 2016, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in the Gaza Strip began {{the restoration of the}} Mosque of al-Khidr with financial support from UNESCO and the Nawa Foundation. The project aims to convert the mosque-tomb into a children's cultural library.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, {{as shown by the}} <b>predominance</b> of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional <b>predominance</b> of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E
5|$|The Amorites in Qatna spoke {{their own}} language, but kings communicated with their {{counterparts}} using Akkadian, {{which was the}} language of writing in the city. Qatna's Akkadian became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special AkkadianHurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was prominent among scribes, but its <b>predominance</b> as a spoken language {{by the general public}} cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). The {{study found that the}} sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its <b>predominance</b> in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study did not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the <b>predominance</b> of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed <b>predominance</b> in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of <b>predominance</b> on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic <b>predominance</b> among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a <b>predominance</b> of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|In the Kingdom of Mysore, the Veerashaiva {{literary}} {{school was}} {{challenged by the}} growing influence of the Srivaishnava intelligentsia in the Wodeyar court. The Srivaishnava writers (followers of a sect of Vaishnavism) of Kannada literature were also in competition with Telugu and Sanskrit writers, their <b>predominance</b> continuing into the English colonial rule over the princely state of Mysore. Meanwhile, the radical writings of 16th-century poet Ratnakaravarni had made way for {{a new kind of}} poetry heralded by those who were not poets in the traditional courtly sense, rather itinerant poets who travelled across the Kannada-speaking region, cutting across court and monastery, writing poems (in the tripadi metre) and influencing the lives of people with their humanistic values which overcame the social barriers of caste and religion. Sarvajna (often compared to Telugu poet Vemana), Sisunala Sherif, Mupina Sadakshari, Navalingayogi and Kadakolada Madivalappa are the best-known among them. These maverick poets heralded yet another epoch of unconventional literature in Kannada language, free of courtly conservatism and established literary tastes.|$|E
5|$|Phase IV: As Rome {{began to}} {{struggle}} to keep control over its sprawling territories, military service continued to be salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded {{to such an extent}} that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a trend in the late empire of an increasing <b>predominance</b> of cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.|$|E
5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns {{had been able to}} resist Mongol attacks, {{following}} the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of urbanization was characterized by the <b>predominance</b> of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine naval <b>predominance</b> {{lasted until}} the early 9th century, when a {{succession}} of disasters {{at the hands of}} the resurgent Muslim fleets spelled its end and inaugurated an era that would represent the zenith of Muslim ascendancy. Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the Gulf of Antalya, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809). Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the Carolingian Empire, while in 803, the Pax Nicephori recognized the de facto independence of Byzantine Venice, which was further entrenched by the repulsion of a Byzantine attack in 809. At the same time, in Ifriqiya, the new Aghlabid dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Huns {{destroyed}} Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527565). Eastern Roman coins {{from the}} first half of the 6thcentury suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by the <b>predominance</b> of pottery with shapes of Roman tradition. Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the peace in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s. The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597, but Tomis, which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a <b>predominance</b> of Halophila), and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
5|$|The long {{nineteenth century}} saw {{profound}} {{cultural and economic}} changes in Belgium. The Industrial Revolution, which began to take effect in Belgium {{during the period of}} French rule, transformed the region's economy {{over the course of the}} period. By 1914, Belgium was acknowledged as one of the most densely industrialized countries in Europe, with notable coal mining and manufacturing industries. The period saw the gradual decline of the various dialects spoken in the country and the establishment of two distinct language groups, French in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders. French, traditionally spoken by the elite, was given legal <b>predominance</b> across the country. During the nineteenth century, both linguistic groups witnessed a cultural resurgence and developed separate traditions in literature and culture. By the end of the period, the Flemish Movement, seeking legal equality for Dutch language and even regional independence, had emerged in Flanders and a similar movement developed in Wallonia.|$|E
5|$|Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) {{are located}} {{close to the}} banks of the Irwell, near to its {{confluence}} with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, a 88 800 m² site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the <b>predominance</b> of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} <b>predominance</b> of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the nature and}} {{limitations}} of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true thalassocracy. Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and {{were not able to}} play a truly independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses. Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals. Combined with the traditional <b>predominance</b> of the great Anatolian land-holders in the higher military and civil offices, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. This fact is clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the <b>predominance</b> of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E
25|$|The first ground, {{owing to}} a <b>predominance</b> of ratnas or jewels, is called Ratnaprabha. Similarly, the second, owing to a <b>predominance</b> of sarkara or gravel, is called Sarkraprabha. The third owing to a <b>predominance</b> of valuka or sands, is called Valukaprabha. The fourth, owing to {{an excess of}} panka or mud, is called Pankaprabha. The fifth, owing to an excess of dhuma or smoke, is called Dhumaprabha. The sixth, owing to a marked {{possession}} of tamas or darkness, is called Tamahprabha, while the seventh, owing to {{a high concentration of}} mahatamas or dense darkness, is called Mahatamahprabha.|$|E
25|$|Urbanisation {{after the}} Second World War led to {{widespread}} language shift from Māori <b>predominance</b> (with Māori the primary {{language of the}} rural whānau) to English <b>predominance</b> (English serving as the primary language in the Pākehā cities). Therefore, Māori-speakers almost always communicate bilingually, with New Zealand English as either their first or second language. Only around 9000 people speak the Maori language only.|$|E

25|$|The inter-governmental Pacific War Council was {{established}} in Washington on 1 April, but remained largely ineffectual due to the overwhelming <b>predominance</b> of U.S. forces in the Pacific theater throughout the war.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{baseball}} historians, Robinson and {{the other}} African American players helped reestablish the importance of baserunning and similar elements of play that were previously de-emphasized by the <b>predominance</b> of power hitting.|$|E
25|$|Pectus excavatum {{occurs in}} an {{estimated}} 1 in 150 to 1 in 1000 births, with male <b>predominance</b> (male-to-female ratio of 3:1). In 35% to 45% of cases {{family members are}} affected.|$|E
