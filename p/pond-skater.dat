5000|$|Many were {{directly}} inspired by Symphosius's, but overall, Aldhelm's collection {{is quite different}} in tone and purpose: {{as well as being}} an exposition of Latin poetic metres, diction, and techniques, it seems to be intended as an exploration of the wonders of God's creation. The riddles generally become more metrically and linguistically complex as the collection proceeds. The first eight riddles deal with cosmology. Riddles 9-82 are more heterogeneous, covering a wide variety of animals, plants, artefacts, materials and phenomena, but can be seen to establish purposeful contrasts (for example between the light of a candle in Enigma 52 and that of the Great Bear in 53) or sequences (for example the animals of Enigmata 34-39: locust, screech-owl, midge, crab, <b>pond-skater,</b> lion). Riddles 81-99 seem all to concern monsters and wonders. Finally, the long hundredth riddle is [...] "Creatura", the whole of Creation. His most prominent themes were 'the natural world, daily life, church furniture, and the classroom. A bookish quality is evident in many of the other topics addressed, which would certainly have been outside the daily experience of Anglo-Saxon England'. Aldhelm may have known the passage through his teacher Hadrian.|$|E
