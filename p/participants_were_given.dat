In a series of individual challenges, the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a sample audio piece, {{with one of the}} watermarks embedded. If the participants sent back the sample with the watermark removed (and with less than an acceptable amount of signal loss, though this condition was not stated by SDMI), they would win that particular challenge.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, {{the results showed}} a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E

The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside {{the boundaries of the}} square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.|$|E
25|$|Adequately {{controlling}} for experimental bias includes a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design (DBPC) and administration by capsule, {{because of the}} unique aftertaste of glutamates. In a study by Tarasoff and Kelly (1993), 71 fasting <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred. A study by Geha et al. (2000) tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple DBPC trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two {{people out of the}} 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not reproducible.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative study (WHI), {{which was}} {{designed}} to demonstrate additional benefits for conventional hormone therapy (study <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> Prempro or a placebo), was terminated prematurely after preliminary data indicated small increases in the risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in older women using Prempro. The early termination of the WHI study (which used conjugated equine estrogens) and the subsequent publicity about these previously unappreciated risks led to a decline in prescriptions for CHRT. The results of the WHI were used by BHRT prescribers to promote bioidentical hormones as safer than the FDA-regulated preparations despite a lack of evidence; according to the FDA, the results found by the study apply to all estrogens. BHRT has since been strongly promoted as a natural alternative with fewer risks than CHRT, though {{there is no evidence to}} support this claim. BHRT practitioners recommend compounded products due to their claim that they more closely mimic the composition and ratio of circulating hormones in a woman's body than do commercially manufactured products.|$|E
25|$|Stereotype threat {{has been}} shown to affect {{performance}} and confidence in mathematics of both males and females. In another experiment conducted on 80 Cornell University undergraduates, participants were taught how to perform a new task in gender salient (male advantage) versus gender-neutral conditions. Participants in the gender salient condition were told, “males on average perform better on such tests.” Even though <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> identical scores {{at the end of the}} task, women in the gender salient condition rated their ability on the task significantly lower than those in the gender-neutral condition, and even reported reduced interest in related occupations. While these two studies highlight the effect of stereotype threat on self-perception, another experiment by Rydell and colleagues found that stereotype threat can actually impair women’s ability to learn new gender-typed material. Women in the stereotype threat condition had difficulty encoding math-related information into memory and, therefore, learned fewer mathematical rules and showed poorer math performance than did controls. Stereotype threat reduced women’s, but not men’s, ability to learn abstract mathematical rules and to transfer these rules to a second, isomorphic task. The researchers concluded that negative stereotypes about women in math reduce their level of math learning, which then leads to poorer performance in negatively stereotyped domains.|$|E
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E

2500|$|In this study, {{two groups}} of {{participants}} {{took part in a}} two night counterbalanced [...] study. [...] Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm. [...] The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs. [...] The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task. [...] At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either physostigmine or a placebo. [...] Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the synapses. [...] The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake. [...] Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS). [...] Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected recall memory (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo. Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 ± 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 ± 0.6 words when <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. [...] Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered. [...] This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus –dependent [...] declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study done}} using cued recall found that {{learning}} occurs during test trials. Mark Carrier and Pashler (1992) {{found that the}} group with a study-only phase makes 10% more errors than the group with a test-study phase. In the study-only phase, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> Ai-Bi, where Ai was an English word and Bi was a Siberian Eskimo Yupik word. In the test study phase, participants first attempted to recall Bi given Ai as a cue then they were shown Ai-Bi pair together. This result suggests that after participants learn something, testing their memory with mental operations helps later recall. The act of recalling instead of restudying creates new and longer lasting connection between Ai and Bi. [...] This phenomenon is {{commonly referred to as}} the testing effect.|$|E

One category of questions was about how the word was presented visually ("Is the word shown in italics?"). The second category of questions was about the phonemic qualities of the word ("Does the word begin with the sound 'bee'?"). The third category of questions was presented so that the reader was forced to think about the word within a certain context. ("Can you meet one in the street [...] "?) The result of this study showed that the words which contained deep processing (the latter) were remembered better.|$|E
