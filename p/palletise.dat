50|$|Soon {{the small}} side doors were {{replaced}} by large, sliding sides (index letter i), in order to enable loading and unloading of <b>palletised</b> goods by forklift trucks.

Freight is mostly bulk traffic geared towards export industries, with general freight being largely restricted to containerised and <b>palletised</b> products on the trunk route.

40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} robots of today are programmed by using programing units or designated software programs on separate computers (off-line). Despite {{the fact that}} manufacturers of {{industrial robots}} offer a very capable simulation software, off-line programing is not commonly used for <b>palletising</b> with industrial robots. One of the reasons are also {{the costs associated with}} the purchase of the simulation software. The aim of our investigation tries to establish when using the simulation software in projects, involving <b>palletising</b> with industrial robots, is cost-efficient. Each of the variables significantly affecting projects are specified. Project phases in which using software has an important role are the phase of line building, to be validated from supplier’s point of view and the phase of production running, to be validated from the customer’s point of view. A threshold calculation is made in three parts. Recommendations for the robot solution providers are given with the goal of increasing the use of the simulation software in robotics applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} multiple, large scale, make [...] to [...] order assemblies is considered. Beside "classical" precedence [...] and resource constraints as known from resource constrained project scheduling we take spatial resource and part availability constraints into account.

A practical application is a German company which manufactures customized <b>palletising</b> systems for the chemical and food industry.

50|$|The present-day {{standard}} wagon for moisture-susceptible <b>palletised</b> goods has sliding sides rather than fixed side walls, which enables {{access to the}} entire loading area for loading and unloading. These wagons with sliding walls or sides did not evolve from the original covered wagon, but were derived in the 1950s from wagons with sliding roofs and sides, {{which is why they}} used to be grouped in Class K.|$|R

50|$|In {{industry}} {{the most}} common attachment for a tele-handler is pallet forks and {{the most common}} application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift. For example, telehandlers {{have the ability to}} remove <b>palletised</b> cargo from within a trailer and to place loads on rooftops and other high places. The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient.|$|R
50|$|Palvans were {{designed}} for <b>palletised</b> loads and loading by forklift truck. Whereas most vans had small doors centrally positioned on the van sides, Palvans had large doors half {{the width of the}} wagon on the left hand side of each side (i.e. diagonally opposite each other). Although palletisation was the future, these early Palvans were found to be very sensitive to unbalanced loads and prone to derailment at higher speeds.|$|R
40|$|A Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) {{occurs when}} {{identical}} rectangular boxes {{are to be}} stacked and packed on a rectangular pallet. The problem has many practical applications in distribution and logistics in packaging industries. An {{increase in the number}} of boxes that can be shipped on a pallet directly reduces the cost. In automated manufacturing <b>palletising</b> operations, the Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) usually deals with generating optimal pallet patterns of boxes on a pallet but a purely mathematical solution does not consider the physical aspects and restrictions encountered when using the robot and the gripper to implement these patterns. Therefore, merely getting an optimal pallet pattern does not guarantee an optimal pattern placement strategy. Very few published literature is available to address this problem, there is a need to develop a methodology that considers the palletisers physical characteristics and limitations in robotic <b>palletising</b> systems. This paper presents the development of a pallet pattern placement strategy with practical implementations for five-block patterns with the aim of improving the operational efficiency in robotic palletisation...|$|R
50|$|In 1967, a small {{section of}} the fleet was {{separated}} out from the rest. 24 wagons, numbers 121 to 144, were reclassed back to BLF and used exclusively for <b>palletised</b> cement traffic from Fyansford to Melbourne and some country depots. All vans had stencils on the left end to indicate the restricted use, and the change from BLX to BLF was to ensure they did not end up back on the standard gauge system.|$|R

Via taut weather proof vinyl side curtains, these wagons allowed easy access to load a number of <b>palletised</b> engines.

5000|$|Bulk cargo is {{commodity}} cargo that is transported unpackaged {{in large}} quantities. It refers to material in either liquid or granular, particulate form, as {{a mass of}} relatively small solids, such as petroleum/crude oil, grain, coal, or gravel. This cargo is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car/railway wagon, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered [...] "bulk") can be boxed (or drummed) and <b>palletised.</b> Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.|$|R

5000|$|Port Centric Logistics as {{a concept}} in supply chain {{management}} has developed since {{around the turn of}} the millennium. Multimodal transport driven container logistics operations typically utilise ocean-going vessels for long-distance movements, with inland movements undertaken by barge, rail or truck. Conventionally the container is unloaded from the ship at the port and transported to an inland destination by intermodal freight transport. In the port centric approach, the container is unloaded (or [...] "unstuffed") at the port and its contents are then transported inland e.g. as <b>palletised</b> freight.|$|R

The control configuration consists of a graphical application running on a human-machine interface (HMI) touch screens interfaced to a programmable logic controller (PLC), and a servo system that executes palletiser reconfiguration and makes high-speed robotic palletizing possible. Significant downtime reduction during batch changes is achieved due to simplification of operator tasks, which makes the configuration and control method ideally suitable for production environments with frequent batch change...|$|R

50|$|Protective {{packaging}} {{of components}} or items in a ration that are typically {{in contact with}} the product or food items is referred to as primary packaging. Secondary packaging is that packaging which is outside the primary packaging layer {{and in the case of}} general purpose individual operational rations this packaging is used to group several primary packages together. Lastly, tertiary packaging is that used to support bulk storage, shipping, and handling of product in the distribution supply chain. Rations are grouped at this level in fibreboard boxes or cases and subsequently <b>palletised</b> as unit loads for ease and efficiency of handling and distribution.|$|R
50|$|The port centric {{approach}} is not appropriate for all supply chains, but due to the complexities of modern logistics networks {{it can be difficult}} to quantify the benefits for each case. Operationally, port centric logistics offers significant benefits but also presents a number of planning and management issues which need to be overcome. For example, increased storage of goods, and corresponding handling activity could lead to increased congestion around the port. On the other hand, the greater flexibility for distributing the goods in (e.g.) <b>palletised</b> form can lead to savings in the relatively costly inland transport section of the supply chain.|$|R
