40|$|UK {{accounting}} practice differs from International Accounting Standards (IASs) {{particularly with regard}} to amortisation of goodwill, <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred <b>taxation</b> and the accounting treatment of pension costs. Under the core standards programme of the IASC the IASs have emerged closer to US practice. This paper evaluates the profit of those UK companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1988 and 1994, spanning a period which saw the establishment of the ASB and the implementation of the IASC's comparability project. An increasing gap was found between the reported profit under UK accounting principles and that restated under US GAAP. The difference lay most frequently in accounting <b>for</b> goodwill, <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred tax, and the accounting treatment of pension costs, with accounting for goodwill showing a particularly significant impact in 1994. Notwithstanding the introduction of FRS 10, an overall impression of increasing disharmony could continue to cause reconciliations to be required of UK companies seeking full listing on a US stock exchange, with consequent disadvantage relative to companies in other European countries seeking international capital in the US...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} short-run sectoral and economy-wide {{effects of the}} introduction of a carbon tax in Australia. The results are derived using an enhanced version of the ORANI multi-sectoral model of the Australian economy. We simulate {{the introduction of a}} carbon tax at a rate of 1991 - 92 $ 25 per tonne, designed to achieve the Toronto target of a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions below the 1988 level by 2005. We find that the macroeconomic impact would depend critically {{on the extent to which}} price rises flowed through into wage rates. Assuming fixed money wages, real GDP would be decreased by an estimated 0. 9 per cent, and employment by 1. 2 per cent. To maintain a given employment level in the face of the carbon tax would require a reduction in the foreign-currency-equivalent wage rate estimated at 2. 8 per cent. This would also entail a decrease in the real wage rate (defined with respect to the consumption price deflator) of 2. 8 per cent. Government could promote lower wage outcomes by returning the carbon tax revenue to the community through reductions in other taxes. Enhancements to ORANI used in this simulation include disaggregation of the fossil fuel sector and <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> carbon <b>taxation.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In a group structure, {{individual}} companies comprising a {{group are}} effectively managed {{as a single}} 'economic unit'. The economic unit concept refers {{to a group of}} companies that are collectively integrated on a financial, an organisational or an economic basis by virtue of common control, so that they are working towards a common purpose or goal. The South African income tax dispensation currently makes no <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> group <b>taxation.</b> Each legal entity within a group is taxed as a separate taxpayer. This study aims to evaluate whether {{there is a need for}} a system of group taxation in South Africa. In order to do so, the definition of a group was considered, the different tax treatment of divisions as opposed to a group structure were investigated, the current income tax dispensation for inter-group transactions was analysed, and anomalies arising from that were highlighted. The recommendations of the Katz Commission in its Third Interim Report, which addressed the issue of group taxation, were also examined to determine whether the report supports the implementation of a system of group taxation in South Africa. The impact of a system of group <b>taxation</b> <b>for</b> meeting the requirements of the canons of taxation, as well as the implications for the fiscus and the taxpayer, were also examined. The analyses and the conclusions clearly show that the status quo with regard to the inherent tax anomalies arising from the taxation of intra-group transactions is unsustainable, and that a system of group taxation should be implemented in South Africa...|$|R

5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by <b>provisions</b> that allowed <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|R
