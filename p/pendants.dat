5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold <b>pendants,</b> two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The <b>pendants</b> and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon <b>pendants</b> inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the Viking Age, {{personal}} names {{containing the}} theonym Thórr are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. Thórr-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, {{similar to the}} wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer <b>pendants.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Muisca {{society was}} in essence egalitarian with slight {{differences}} {{in terms of}} use of jewelry. The guecha warriors, priests and caciques were allowed to wear multiple types of jewelry, while the common people used less jewels. Golden or tumbaga jewelry existed of diadems, nose pieces, breast plates, earrings, <b>pendants,</b> tiaras, bracelets and masks.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise {{was very}} {{important}} to the people of Chaco. Around 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon, and workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. The turquoise was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. Over 15,000 turquoise beads and <b>pendants</b> accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof <b>pendants</b> because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E

5|$|Other discoveries include various {{plants and}} animals that {{are thought to have}} formed part of their diet, e.g. wild banana, breadfruit, and fish bones, and {{articles}} that were used as personal ornaments such as shell <b>pendants</b> and shark beads, indicating occasional contact with the coast around 40km away. It is also likely that Balangoda Man visited Horton Plains in the central highlands of Sri Lanka during their annual cycle of gathering foods such as cereals, and hunting animals, most likely wild cattle, sambur, and deer.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{are only}} worn at coronations (StEdward's Crown {{being used to}} crown the monarch) and the annual State Opening of Parliament (the Imperial State Crown). At other formal occasions, such as banquets, the Queen wears the {{jewellery}} in her collection. Elizabeth owns more than 300 items of jewellery, including 98 brooches, 46 necklaces, 37 bracelets, 34 pairs of earrings, 15 rings, 14 watches and 5 <b>pendants,</b> the most notable of which are detailed in this article.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} church {{interiors}} {{went through a}} final stage that lasted into the 16th century. This was the development of fan vaulting, first used in about 1370 in the cloisters at Gloucester, then in the retrochoir at Peterborough in the early 15th century. In a still more elaborate form with stone <b>pendants</b> {{it was used to}} roof the Norman choir at Oxford and in the great funerary chapel of Henry VII at Westminster Abbey, at a time when Italy had embraced the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted <b>pendants</b> branching out of the corners of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone <b>pendants</b> and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|Link, {{who is the}} {{apprentice}} of a blacksmith, goes to deliver a sword to a captain at Hyrule Castle, only to encounter a mysterious figure named Yuga, who transforms a descendant of a Sage, Seres, into a painting. After being knocked out during the fight, Link is found by a merchant named Ravio, who gives him a bracelet in exchange for being allowed to stay in his home, and tells him to report {{what had happened to}} Princess Zelda. After going to Hyrule Castle, Zelda gives Link the Pendant of Courage and instructs him to seek out the <b>pendants</b> of Power and Wisdom in order to gain the power of the Master Sword. Along the way, Link encounters Yuga again and is turned into a painting himself. However, thanks to Ravio's bracelet, Link is protected from Yuga's spell and gains the ability to merge with walls and move around as a painting. After finding the other <b>pendants</b> and obtaining the Master Sword, Link returns to Hyrule Castle where he witnesses Yuga transform Zelda into a painting. Link pursues Yuga through a dimensional crack, arriving in the twisted decaying kingdom of Lorule. There, Yuga uses Zelda and the descendants of the Seven Sages, who he had all trapped inside paintings, to revive Ganon and fuse with him, obtaining the Triforce of Power in the process. Just then, Link is assisted by Princess Hilda, the ruler of Lorule, who traps Yuga in magic bonds.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no <b>pendants</b> {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pendants</b> in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pendants,</b> ear-rings, bangles, discs and combs {{from the}} Neolithic period were found. 400 bone tools, mostly used for hunting, made from antler and long bones of deer and cattle {{were found in}} Chirand and at Burzahom from Period II and Period III. Terracotta figurines {{included}} humped bulls, birds, snakes, and human female figurines. The snake figures are indicative of existence of Naga cult among the Neolithic people. The human female figurines possibly relate to either a mother goddess, a goddess of fertility, or both. Ornaments made from tortoise and ivory were also found. A painted motif of the sacred peepal leaf (Ficus religiosa) was found. A foot stand of large sarcophagus indicates mortuary rites of the Neolithic people.|$|E

5|$|The archaeological name of {{the site}} is Twyfelfontein 534. It is {{subdivided}} into 15 smaller sites as described by Scherz in 1975. Objects from the site include a variety of stone tools made mostly from quartzite. Type and shape of these tools indicate not only the use on rock but also the prevalence of wood and leather working. Artwork such as <b>pendants</b> and beads from ostrich eggshell fragments have been found at several places. Of the items of daily use charcoal and bone fragments have been excavated as well as undecorated pottery fragments, although the pottery might have originated from early farmers rather than the Stone Age culture that produced the rock art.|$|E
5|$|They {{were created}} either as <b>pendants,</b> that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like <b>pendants,</b> ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E
