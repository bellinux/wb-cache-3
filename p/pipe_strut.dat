5000|$|The RMIT Building 8 {{built in}} 1993, {{is one of}} Corrigan’s most {{recognised}} buildings. It is located in Swanston street Melbourne at the University of RMIT. The building creates characteristics of its own along with its structure, several colours and situated materials.Built on a budget with tough constraints, the designing of building 8 needed to accommodate buildings below and next door as it is currently {{sitting on top of}} John Andrew’s unfinished union building. Following the construction of building 8 it was found necessary to include a [...] "new lift and service core" [...] to allow access to the upper floors. In addition to this [...] "the deep floor plate" [...] was also maximised allowing further developed for rooms located on the upper floors. Detail within the interior such as [...] "balustrades and hand railing" [...] have been positioned in a way giving the building a unique yet chaotic sentiment.Noticeable along the streetscape of Swanston street, Building 8's roof gives the building part of its individuality. The positioning of the multiple roof structures, form and materiality make this building unique. The building structure also provides examples of many different uses of materials for different areas, some of which include [...] "coloured stone facades, steel <b>pipe</b> <b>strut</b> supports and a polychrome and polygon brick" [...] shown within parts of the building. All of which affect RMIT’s atmosphere.|$|E

H shape steel strut, {{which is}} the most {{commonly}} used material in traditional braced wall system (TBWS), has some disadvantage such as narrow strut spacing and cost ineffectiveness. Therefore, a newly retaining wall system with pre-stressed (PS) wale and square <b>pipe</b> <b>struts</b> is developed for widening strut spacing and saving construction costs. In this study, three cases, which are changed from TBWS with H shape steel strut to retaining wall system with PS wale and square <b>pipe</b> <b>struts,</b> are compared construction costs and constructability. This results reveal that construction costs is decreased by 46. 9 % on average and constructability is improved by decreasing the amount of material and widening the strut spacing...|$|R

50|$|The Sepung {{bridge is}} a curved {{one with a}} radius of 2000m. In {{order to reduce the}} {{deformation}} of the pylons {{toward the center of the}} circle, two cables are established from the top to the bottom of the pylon. It is also effective for increasing the torsional rigidity. This bridge is designed to accommodate dual four-lane traffic; its design incorporates a curved stiffening girder and additional transverse cables to stabilize each tower. The striffening girder is designed as a PC box using reinforced concrete of grade 40MPa; It is 3.3m deep and almost 24m wide, and incorporates steel <b>struts</b> and FRP <b>pipe</b> <b>struts</b> filled with concrete in the internal and external box respectively, to resist the local tensile stress. These internal and external struts are placed at typical centers of 6m and 3m respectively and give the stiffening girder and increased torsional rigidity and make the decks 20% lighter than a traditional concrete box girder. In this bridge, a single plane multiple cable system with harp arrangement was chosen in order to reduce the longitudinal and transverse deformation of the towers. As the shear center deviates from the center of the stiffening girder due to the application of the asymmetric cable forces and self-weight, twisting and transverse deformation may occur.|$|R

40|$|Jaws and linkage {{accommodate}} various sizes. Robot hand {{includes two}} pairs of parallel jaws that grasp rods, <b>pipes,</b> tubes, <b>struts,</b> and other long, heavy cylindrical objects. Hand features compact rotary drive and butterfly configuration simplifying approach and gripping maneuvers of robot. Parallelogram linkages maintain alignment of each jaw with other jaws. One bar of each linkage connected {{to one of two}} concentric, counterrotating shafts; rotation of shafts moves jaws in each pair toward or away from each other to grasp or release workpiece. Each jaw includes rigid gripping pad lined with rubber to give firm grip and to prevent damage to workpiece. Inner cylindrical surface (corner) of each jaw tapers off to flat sides. Enables jaw to grasp workpieces with diameters larger than or equal to twice the corner radius...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the chassis}} monocoques for 701/2 and 701/4 had been {{manufactured}} by March, the final buildup {{of the cars}} was by Tyrrell mechanics. As a result, the blue Tyrrell cars incorporated {{a significant number of}} differences and tweaks in their configuration to the cars run by the works March team and those supplied to other customers. The first major difference was the specification of Dunlop tyres, rather than the Firestone rubber with which the works cars were equipped and the 701 had been designed around. In an attempt to develop the car and improve its handling the Tyrrell team made adjustments to the position of the suspension mounting points and added a damper to the steering system. More subtle variations related to the positioning of exhaust <b>pipe</b> brackets, wing <b>struts,</b> the oil radiator, and the pipe runs for lubrication and coolant fluids.|$|R
