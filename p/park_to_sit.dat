Using her vast wealth, the manipulated Kinukawa began taking those whose friends had been changed by Imaginator to help find it.|$|E

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for <b>Parker</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|R

5000|$|Desmond {{is often}} {{compared}} <b>to</b> Rosa <b>Parks,</b> given they both challenged racism {{and contributed to}} the rise of the Civil Rights Movement. At the same time, there are {{significant differences between the two}} figures. Desmond lived in a different legislative context than Parks, given there were no Jim Crow laws in Canada. [...] <b>Parks</b> decision <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at the front of the bus was an act of civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws that supported segregation on public transit. In contrast, Desmond was protesting a private theatre owner's efforts at segregation, which were not supported by provincial laws.|$|R

5000|$|Joseph Jackson (1874-1961) MLA {{represented}} the state Electoral district of Nepean for 33 years. He donated the {{land on which}} Jackson <b>Park</b> <b>sits</b> <b>to</b> {{the people of the}} Blue Mountains in 1933 for use as a public park. At that time Jackson owned the former home of Sir Henry Parkes and was an ardent admirer of his. He conceived the idea of an avenue of oak trees to be planted by all the Prime Ministers of Australia or their nearest surviving relative. [...] He hoped that the avenue, growing opposite the Parkes home, would become a national memorial. Planting commenced in 1934.|$|R
50|$|Stielike {{made one}} {{change to the}} line-up that saw off Iraq in the semi-finals, calling up Jang Hyun-soo to partner Ki Sung-yueng in the middle <b>to</b> allow <b>Park</b> Joo-ho <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in front of Kim Jin-su on the left, while Ivan Franjic was passed fit for an {{unchanged}} Australian side. The game opened at a frantic pace and, {{by the end of}} the half, Australia had taken the lead against the run of play after South Korea had spurned several opportunities to put themselves on the scoreboard. It was Son Heung-min who caused the greatest threat to the home side’s goal, volleying just wide in the 37th minute after impressive work down the left from Park Joo-ho and Kim Jin-su while, less than a minute later, the South Korean was denied what looked a certain goal by Luongo’s outstretched foot. Tim Cahill had earlier forced Kim Jin-hyeon into action in the South Korean goal, the keeper diving to his left to push the Australian’s effort around the post after holding off the challenge of Kwak Tae-hwi, who had sent his own header just wide mere seconds later at the other end.|$|R
50|$|The Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement, {{was another}} early Mitterrand-era park. It was {{designed}} by architect Francois Debulois and landscape architect Paul Brichet, and built on a steeply-sloping site that covered 4.5 hectares, on the hill of Belleville, the highest point in the city. The park was located {{not far from the}} Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, and shared some of the same picturesque elements as that Second-Empire park, including a terrace and belvedere {{at the top of the}} park with a panoramic view of the city, winding paths along the hillsides, abundant flowerbeds and groves of trees, and a series of cascades from the top of the hill down to a semi-circular basin, then under Rue Julian Lacroix to a circular basin in another garden in the jardin de Pali-Kao, a miniature park of three thousand square meters opened in 1989. Visitors <b>to</b> the <b>park</b> are invited <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the abundant lawns of the park, a practice long discouraged in Paris parks. Like Buttes-Chaumont, the Parc de Belleville originally had a grotto, built into the side of the old stone quarries, but it had to be closed because of vandalism and security concerns.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} the Yankees to advance to their second {{straight}} World Series, {{they would have to}} win again at the Royals' home <b>park.</b> <b>To</b> do that, they would have to beat their Game 1 nemesis, Paul Splittorff. Given that, Yankee manager Billy Martin decided <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out Reggie Jackson on the grounds that he was 1-for-15 so far in the series and, in his own words, [...] "can't hit Splittorff." [...] Paul Blair started in right field and batted eighth.|$|R
