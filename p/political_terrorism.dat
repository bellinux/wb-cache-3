25|$|Villarroel {{was overthrown}} in 1946. He {{had been unable}} to {{organize}} popular support and faced opposition from conservative groups and increasing <b>political</b> <b>terrorism</b> that included murders of the government's opponents. Rivalry between the MNR and the military in the governing coalition also contributed to his downfall. In 1946 mobs of students, teachers, and workers seized arms from the arsenal and moved to the presidential palace. They captured and shot Villarroel and suspended his body from a lamppost in the main square, while the army remained aloof in the barracks.|$|E

2500|$|Common to the {{political}} purges of the left-wing and right-wing belligerents were the sacas, the taking out of prisoners from the jails and the prisons, who then were taken for a paseo, a ride to summary execution. Most {{of the men and}} women taken out from the prisons and jails were killed by death squads, from the trade unions, and by the paramilitary militias of {{the political}} parties (the Republican CNT, UGT, and PCE; the Nationalist Falange and Carlist). Among the justifications for summary execution of right-wing enemies was reprisal for aerial bombings of civilians, other people were killed after being denounced as an enemy of the people, by false accusations motivated by personal envy and hatred. Nevertheless, the significant differences between White <b>political</b> <b>terrorism</b> and Red <b>political</b> <b>terrorism</b> was indicated by Francisco Partaloa, prosecutor of the Madrid High Court of Justice (Tribunal Supremo de Madrid) and a friend of the aristocrat General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Sierra, 1st Marquis of Queipo de Llano, who witnessed the assassinations, first in the Republican camp and then in the Nationalist camp of the Spanish Civil War: ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the post-war}} {{economic}} boom, a large wave of internal migration (especially {{from rural areas}} of Southern Italy) moved to Milan. [...] The population grew from 1.3 million in 1951 to 1.7 million in 1967. During this period, Milan was largely reconstructed, with the building of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower. The economic prosperity was however overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called Years of Lead, when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence, labour strikes and <b>political</b> <b>terrorism.</b> The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when a bomb exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing seventeen people and injuring eighty-eight.|$|E
2500|$|Hostilities {{between the}} radical rural {{supporters}} of the WCU and the conservative forces of the towns of the region ran high, with dynamite used against cattle dipping-vats late in 1915 in protest of a mandatory use of costly insecticide that some felt was as lethal to dipped cattle as to the ticks and other parasites they carried. The controversy was punctuated by a shotgun blast fired {{through the window of}} the Pontotoc County Attorney early in 1916. Conservative voices declared the action to be an act of <b>political</b> <b>terrorism,</b> while radicals charged the shot to be a provocation, [...] "part of a concocted plan {{on the part of the}} officials and two or three newspapers to wreck the Socialist Party by pulling off a fake attempted assassination." ...|$|E

40|$|Looking at {{the current}} {{political}} turmoil across the globe, this study aims to analyze the effects of interaction between <b>political</b> instability and <b>terrorism</b> on tourism development using panel data from 139 countries for the period 1999 - 2009. The study measures {{the extent to which}} a country 2 ̆ 7 s <b>political</b> conflicts and <b>terrorism</b> can negatively impact its tourism industry. The results reveal that the effect of political instability on tourism is far more severe than the effects of one-off terrorist attacks. Surprisingly, the findings suggest that terrorist attacks increase tourism demand for those low- to moderate-political-risk countries. However, countries that experience high levels of political risk witness significant reductions in their tourism businesses. In addition, <b>political</b> volatility and <b>terrorism</b> together can cause serious damage to the tourism industry...|$|R
