500|$|Pernick and Wilder explain that, in the 1970s, clean {{technology}} was considered “alternative,” {{the province of}} back-to-the-land lifestyle advocates, altruistic environmentalists, and lab scientists on research grants. [...] Such technology was in {{an early stage of}} development, was too expensive, it did not have widespread political support, and very few large, established companies were embracing the sector. Even {{at the start of the}} 21st century, the term clean tech was not yet in the financial or business community’s vocabulary. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is [...] "the beginning of a revolution that is changing the <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe." ...|$|E

According to him, Gaga was tired from playing bigger venues, and wanted to have the tour visit smaller venues for at least three-four days, or for three-six weeks. Bennett also {{explained that he was}} accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had been looking at such options. [...] "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [...] finding <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> could work for three or four days, or three or four weeks, in one place at a time. That's how she wants to work with me.", the singer concluded. On New Year's Eve 2014, the duo started the Cheek to Cheek Tour by performing at the Cosmopolitan Casino of Las Vegas, making it their first concert in US following the album's release. They also performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and its scheduled a post-Grammy concert on February 8, 2015, at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, just after the conclusion of the ceremony. More shows were scheduled in 2015, including Hollywood Bowl on May 30; the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 8; and Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 19. Jesse Lawrence from Forbes reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary. He also noted that the concerts had a much higher ticket price than the average, especially in the secondary markets.|$|E
