By late August, Bell slipped in the <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> third place, with O'Malley and Stokes tied. Bell and O'Malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early August, while Stokes did not begin to air commercials until September. O'Malley also advertised on the radio.|$|E

50|$|Cal rose in {{the polls}} one spot in the AP <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #21, and two spots in the Coaches <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #21, after this win.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the loss}} was so lopsided, and because Cal was {{expected}} to do highly well this season, many immediately dismissed Cal from any type of national discussion. Cal dropped 13 spots in the AP <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #22 and 11 spots in the Coaches <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #23, while Tennessee rose twelve spots in the AP <b>poll</b> <b>to</b> #11 and six spots to #17 in the Coaches Poll.|$|R
50|$|This win {{propelled}} the Bears four {{spots in}} the AP <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #16, and shot them up three {{spots in the}} Coaches <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #17. Their record stood at 4-1, with a 2-0 Pac-10 record, while the Beavers left with a 2-2 record, 0-1 in the Pac-10.|$|R
5|$|Basketball {{today is}} played by more than 300 million people worldwide, {{making it one of}} the most popular team sports. In North America, {{basketball}} has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. ESPN and the Associated Press both conducted <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> name the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Basketball player Michael Jordan came in first in the ESPN poll and second (behind Babe Ruth) in the AP poll. Both polls featured fellow basketball players Wilt Chamberlain (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the Top 20.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians went to the <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E

5|$|The next title, Tomb Raider Chronicles, {{depicted}} the late Lara Croft via her friends' flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would {{carry over to}} the next game, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. While the original development team worked on Chronicles, Core Design assigned a new team to develop Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to reinvent the character {{to keep pace with}} the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan <b>polls,</b> <b>to</b> aid in Angel of Darknesss development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft's model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft's portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue control stick to provide more precision. After the original team finished Chronicles, it joined the development of Angel of Darkness. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos's desire to time the game's launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 Tomb Raider film resulted in a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.|$|E

For the only time in its history, however, the team won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and share a national championship title with Auburn. Hayes was also named Coach of the Year.|$|E
25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E
