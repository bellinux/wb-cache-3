50|$|Bearings {{of modern}} wind {{turbines}} are often affected by false brinelling. Especially the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{which is used}} under oscillation, shows often false brinelling damages.|$|E
50|$|In simple designs, {{the blades}} are {{directly}} {{bolted to the}} hub and are unable to pitch, which leads to aerodynamic stall above certain windspeeds. In other more sophisticated designs, they are bolted to the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing,</b> which adjusts their angle of attack {{with the help of}} a pitch system according to the wind speed to control their rotational speed. The <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> is itself bolted to the hub. The hub is fixed to the rotor shaft which drives the generator directly or through a gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|Rotor overspeed, {{which can}} over-stress the rotor hub <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> (brinelling) and, if severe enough, cause blade {{separation}} from the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example in}} which {{fretting}} corrosion may occur are the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> of modern wind turbines, which operate under oscillation motion {{to control the}} power and loads of the turbine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{load and}} {{operating}} situation of <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable. The bearings {{are exposed to}} high loads and small reciprocating movements created by the pitch system or vibrations from the wind profile. The small reciprocating movements between rolling elements and raceway can lead to wear phenomena like false brinelling and fretting corrosion. Furthermore, the high loads can lead to truncation of the contact ellipse. Due to the small reciprocating movements calculation methods to estimate the bearing service life [...] and the friction torque are not useable for <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings.</b> Newer controlling concepts of pitch control, like individual pitch control, will lead to smaller and more frequent oscillation amplitudes which could favor false brinelling and fretting corrosion.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{also named}} blade bearing, is a {{component}} of modern wind turbines which connect the rotor hub and the rotor blade. The bearing allows the required oscillation to control the loads {{and power of the}} wind turbine. The pitch system brings the blade to the desired position by adapting the aerodynamic angle of attack. The pitch system is also used for emergency breaks of the turbine system.|$|E
50|$|Mostly large {{rolling element}} bearing are used as pitch bearings. The bearing is {{subjected}} to high bending moments, radial and axial loads in both directions. Therefore, the rolling elements for {{state of the art}} wind turbines are ball bearings, which are used in a double rowed four-point contact. This means each raceway carries on two points, and in sum four points are carrying. Other possible options are different arrangements of the rolling elements or multirow cylindrical roller bearings. <b>Pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> of modern wind turbines can reach diameters of more than 4 meters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> of wind {{turbines}} are large, grease-lubricated rolling bearings that connect the rotor blades with the rotor hub. They {{are used to}} turn the rotor blades to control the power output and/or structural loads of the turbine. Common actuators turning the blades are hydraulic cylinders or electrical motor / gearbox combinations. In order to design pitch actuator systems {{that are able to}} turn the blades reliably without imposing an excessive power demand, it is necessary to predict the friction torque of <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> for different operating conditions. In this paper, the results of torque measurements under load are presented and compared to results obtained using different calculation models. The results of this comparison indicate the various sources of friction that should be taken into account for a reliable calculation model...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatigue life}} {{calculation}} of bearings under rotating conditions {{has been well}} researched and standardized. In contrast, for bearings in oscillating applications no international standards exist. As a result, <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> in wind turbines are designed with different, non standardized approaches. Furthermore, the impact of individual pitch control on <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> {{has not yet been}} studied. In this paper four approaches for fatigue life calculation will be applied and compared under individual pitch control conditions. For comparison, the loads and the bearing geometry of the reference turbine IWT 7. 5 MW, which is individual pitch controlled, are used. This paper will show how the bearing life calculated by different approaches reacts to individual pitch control conditions. Furthermore, the factors for the modified rating life, according to the ABMA and ISO standards, which implement different operation conditions on the bearings in rotating applications, are calculated for the given loads and the given bearing geometry in oscillating applications...|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} articulated {{rotor blade}} has mechanical flap and lag hinges, a lag damper, and a <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing.</b> In connection {{with an interest}} in designs of greater mechanical simplicity and increased maintainability, hingeless and bearingless rotors have been developed. A hingeless blade lacks the hinges and is cantilevered at the hub. It does have a <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> for pitch control.

In the present investigation of bearingless rotor blade characteristics, finite element analysis has been successfully applied to determine the solutions of the nonlinear trim equations and the linearized flutter equations of multiple-load-path blades.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} parametric variation in individual rotor/wing design variables on whirl flutter stability improvements of a soft in-plane tiltrotor. This {{is followed by the}} use of formal gradient-based design optimization. The simulations are based on a full-scale soft in-plane Boeing model 222 rotor on a semispan wing. For this baseline configuration, the flatwise flexibility and chordwise flexibility are both outboard of the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> and produce destabilizing pitch-flap and pitch-lag couplings. The most influential rotor parameter in improving flutter stability characteristics is the distribution of flatwise flexibility vis-Ã -vis the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing,</b> and large improvements are observed when flatwise flexibility is moved inboard. However, this can result in a large increase in lag frequency and turn the design into a stiff in-plane configuration. Using frequency constraints during optimization of rotor parameters and carefully selecting the airspeed range over which optimization is conducted results in improvement in subcritical wing mode damping and increase in critical flutter speed. Other rotor parameters changes that have some benefit are reduction in overall chordwise stiffness, positive increase in pitch-flap and pitch-lag coupling, and increase in control system stiffness. Wing design parameters are unable to increase the critical flutter speed but can improve the subcritical damping, primarily through an increase in wing torsion frequency and a simultaneous reduction in wing beam mode frequency. Optimization using a combination of rotor/wing design parameters yields a 35 kt increase in whirl flutter speed (from 390 to 425 kt) and an increase in subcritical damping from less than 1 % t...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the <b>bearings</b> used in <b>pitch</b> control system of a wind turbine which enables the blades {{to have an}} optimum angle of attack for efficient power generation and to prevent over-speeding of the blades. Large forces and moments act on the <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> causing significant wear and deformations of the bearings. In this study, the wear pattern in the <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> has been simulated using discrete element method and deformations in the bearings have been investigated using finite element software ABAQUS. ^ A six degree freedom dynamic bearing model (DBM) was developed for analysis of four point contact bearing which are commonly used in wind turbine pitch control. DBM for four point contact bearings was tested for accuracy under simple loading conditions. The model was also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of four point contact bearings to resist moment and axial loads. The model was validated by comparing velocities of bearing elements obtained from DBM for four point contact bearings with those from kinematic model which considers pure rolling conditions between ball and the races and neglects the effect of external forces. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect of changes in bearing geometry and operating conditions on the bearing performance. Further, the ball motion causing mechanical wear in <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearing</b> raceways was simulated using the DBM for four point contact bearings. ^ Finite element analysis was performed on a model of wind turbine hub with three <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> using ABAQUS. Initially, a model was developed to calculate the loads (forces and moments) acting on <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> {{as a function of}} wind speed, wind turbine blade properties (geometry, weight), angular velocity, pitch angle and angular position of the blade. These loads were applied on the inner race of the bearings modeled in ABAQUS and the deformations and stress in the bearing raceways were investigated. The bearings modeled in ABAQUS were four point contact and double row bearings. ABAQUS / Explicit finite element analysis which is well-suited for non-linear problems such as contacts observed in bearings was used. ^ Due to the large axial loads and moments acting on the <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings,</b> the bearing races undergo large deformations. The <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> have large diameter (approximately 2 meters) and as the loads on the outer race vary over its surface, the outer race acquires a shape similar to that of a potato chip. These deformation characteristics of the <b>pitch</b> control <b>bearings</b> were simulated using ABAQUS. The finite element analysis also provides magnitude and locations of maximum stress and deformation in the bearing raceways. Further, the locations of maximum deformation were verified analytically to validate the finite element analysis results. A parametric study was also performed to investigate the effect of wind speed, pitch angle and blade rotation speed on the deformations of the bearings. ...|$|R

The rotor head incorporates elastomeric bearings for hub springs, and flapping and <b>pitch</b> change <b>bearings.</b> The system {{is similar in}} design to that used by the AH-1 Cobra. Rotor speed at 100% engine speed is 348 RPM.|$|R
40|$|The <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing,</b> which {{connects the}} hub and the blades, allows the {{required}} oscillating {{movements of the}} blade, to change the angle of attack thus reducing the lift and drag coefficients there by controlling power and loads of the wind turbine. During the service life of the turbine of approximately 20 years the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> is loaded dynamically. In a double row four-point contact ball bearing, which is often used for this application, the described loads lead to radial and axial displacements between {{the inner and outer}} ring and deformations. These displacements and deformations lead to contact angles which vary from the mounted contact angle which is given by the supplier of the bearing. These divergent angles are called free contact angles. For a four-point contact ball bearing the mounted contact angle in the presented example is 45 Â°. Deviations from the mounted contact angle can lead to reduced fatigue life of the bearing and increased wear, arising from the modified contact behavior. Under axial loads and bending moments the contact area shifts perpendicular to the rolling direction. In the worst case the contact area is truncated, which leads to concentrated and comparatively high stresses. This paper shows how the free contact angles of a double row four-point contact ball bearing of a modern wind turbine with 7. 5 MW behaves during the service life and the effects of contact angle variations to the stress distribution. For the analysis a FE-Model of the bearing which includes the stiffness of the bearing and adjacent components is used...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted examining the feasibility of a swashplateless rotor controlled through two trailing edge flaps (TEF), where the cyclic and collective controls were provided by separate TEFs. This analysis included a parametric study examining the impact of various design parameters on TEF deflections. Blade <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness; blade pitch index; and flap chord, span, location, and control function of the inboard and outboard flaps were systematically varied on a utility-class rotorcraft trimmed in steady level flight. Gradient-based optimizations minimizing flap deflections were performed to identify single- and two-TEF swashplateless rotor designs. Steady, forward and turning flight analyses suggest that a two-TEF swashplateless rotor where the outboard flap provides cyclic control and inboard flap provides collective control can reduce TEF deflection requirements without {{a significant impact on}} power, compared to a single-TEF swashplateless rotor design...|$|E

Utilizing the constitutive law of the curvilinear coordinate system, the typical moderate deflection beam theory is reformulated. In addition, the Leishman and Beddoes unsteady and dynamic stall model is incorporated and the inflow is evaluated with the free wake analysis. The derived nonlinear ordinary differential equations with time-dependent coefficients of the rotor blade are given {{in the sense of the}} generalized forces.

40|$|Individual {{pitch control}} {{is seen as}} a {{promising}} control technique for load reduction of the rotor blades in megawatt wind turbines. As the rotor blades are getting bigger and bigger, the asymmetric loads due to wind speed variations across the rotor area are increasing, too. Modern wind turbines include individual pitch actuators for every blade and the control effort is also reasonable. This is why a lot of research has been done on individual blade pitch control strategies and their impact on load reduction and further stress of the mechanical components, such as <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings.</b> The present work shows that individual pitch control is able to reduce mechanical fatigue loads, however, it affects the dynamic loads of the pitch motors and might lead to an increased overall stress of their power electronic converters...|$|R

Tiltrotors are {{susceptible}} to whirl flutter, an aeroelastic instability characterized by a coupling of rotor-generated aerodynamic forces and elastic wing modes in high speed airplane-mode flight.

40|$|Manufacturers of wind {{turbines}} have observed {{a new phenomenon}} that appears in high power {{wind turbines}}: excessive wear in the teeth located at 0 Âº in the <b>pitch</b> <b>bearing.</b> In order to design more efficient wind turbines, manufacturers are increasing the rotor diameter to capture more kinetic energy from the wind to generate more energy, therefore the stress in the joints/unions is increased, {{which leads to the}} elastic deformation of the system. These stresses and deformations increase {{in all parts of the}} wind turbine, the foundations and the tower, yaw, nacelle, drive train and blade unions. All these cases are mainly static unions, except the drive train that transmits torque, the yaw system that turns the nacelle and the pitch system that turns each blade around its axis. The weight of the blades under movement, always working in the most efficient position, causes micro-movements allowed by the elastic deformations and the backlash of the gear transmission that induce an excessive wear at the zero degree position. The same phenomenon is observed in the yaw system, though to a lesser extent. Despite the manufacturer's efforts, a solution that could be implemented in the near future or easily retrofitted in the wind turbines does not yet exist. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the lubrication of the pitch and yaw gear systems of wind turbines through the use of a novel lubrication system based on an array of micro-fabricated channels fitted at the gears' root (dedendum). A micro-nozzle to continuously inject fresh grease in between the teeth in contact has been designed, manufactured and installed in a test bench of a 2 MW wind turbine pitch system. The test bench has been used to characterize the fatigue behavior of the gear surface using conventional wind turbine greases under real cyclic loads, showing a delay of 2 x 10 ^ 4 cycles in the appearance of wear. The proposed micro-nozzle is expected to be compatible with and easily implemented into both newly designed and in-market models. This novel lubrication system will inject fresh lubricant to the gear contact area even when the wind turbine is generating electricity. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|During wind {{turbines}} operation, yaw and <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> suffer from sequential traction-compression stresses causing millions of micro movements per cycle between the gear teeth. This situation reduces the lubricant thickness between the teeth until metal contact appears causing excessive wear. The pitch gear lubrication at the zero degree position {{is carried out}} during unwind periods or programmed stops that cause important losses in electricity generation. Moreover, low efficiency of current lubrication systems generates the need of a preventive maintenance plan to avoid that the abrasive particles accelerate the premature failure due to wear.

40|$|Manufacturing and {{maintenance}} costs {{arising out of}} wind turbine dynamic loading {{are one of the}} largest bottlenecks in the roll-out of wind energy. Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is being researched for cost reduction through load alleviation; it poses a challenging mechatronic problem due to its multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) nature and actuation constraints related to the wear of <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings.</b> To address these issues, Subspace Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC), a novel repetitive control strategy based on the subspace identification paradigm, is presented. First, the Markov parameters of the system are identified online in a recursive manner. These parameters are used to build up the lifted matrices needed to predict the output over the next period. From these matrices an adaptive repetitive control law is derived. To account for actuator limitations, the known shape of wind-induced disturbances is exploited to perform repetitive control in a reduced-dimension basis function subspace. The SPRC methodology is implemented on a high-fidelity numerical aeroelastic environment for wind turbines. Load reductions are achieved similar to those obtained with classical IPC approaches, while considerably limiting the frequency content of the actuator signals...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multi-body {{analysis of the}} 1 / 5 scale wind tunnel model of the V- 22 tiltrotor, the Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Testing System (WRATS), currently tested at NASA Langley Research Center. An original multi-body formulation has been developed at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. It {{is based on the}} direct writing of the equilibrium equations of independent rigid bodies, connected by kinematic constraints that result in the addition of algebraic constraint equations, and by dynamic constraints, that directly contribute to the equilibrium equations. The formulation has been extended to the simultaneous solution of interdisciplinary problems by modeling electric and hydraulic networks, for aeroservoelastic problems. The code has been tailored to the modeling of rotorcrafts while preserving a complete generality. A family of aerodynamic elements has been introduced to model high aspect aerodynamic surfaces, based on the strip theory, with quasi-steady aerodynamic coefficients, compressibility, post-stall interpolation of experimental data, dynamic stall modeling, and radial flow drag. Different models for the induced velocity of the rotor can be used, from uniform velocity to dynamic in flow. A complete dynamic and aeroelastic analysis of the model of the V- 22 tiltrotor has been performed, to assess the validity of the formulation and to exploit the unique features of multi-body analysis with respect to conventional comprehensive rotorcraft codes; These are the ability to model the exact kinematics of mechanical systems, and the possibility to simulate unusual maneuvers and unusual flight conditions, that are particular to the tiltrotor, e. g. the conversion maneuver. A complete modal validation of the analytical model has been performed, to assess the ability to reproduce the correct dynamics of the system with a relatively coarse beam model of the semispan wing, pylon and rotor. Particular care has been used to model the kinematics of the gimbal joint, that characterizes the rotor hub, and of the control system, consisting in the entire swashplate mechanism.

40|$|A heavily {{instrumented}} 1 : 5 scaled {{model of}} the ERICA tilt-wing configuration has been tested in the DNW-LLF wind tunnel {{as part of the}} EU co-funded NICETRIP project. Tests were made for a variety of conditions ranging from pure helicopter and conversion corridor cases up to a low speed aircraft mode, with appropriate changes in tilt rotor and outer wing pitching angles. In total over 400 test conditions were measured. Rotor forces and moments have been measured with rotor balances. Blade bending moment and torsion as well as rotor shaft bending and torque were measured with calibrated strain gauge sensors. Measurements were made for fully trimmed and for non-trimmed conditions. The four bladed rotors are counter-rotating, are rigid in plane and allow cyclic blade pitch control through a remote controlled swash plate. Since cyclic pitch control caused damage to the blade <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings,</b> most of the test conditions had to be done without cyclic blade pitch control, leading to a large in-plane moment in the rotor plane and high bending moments in the rotor shaft. Some test cases were both measured with and without cyclic pitch control. The present paper analysis the rotor induced forces, moments and nacelle vibrations for the trimmed conditions. Both steady and dynamic contents of the signals are analyzed. It is found that with cyclic blade pitch control the time mean rotor in-plane forces and moments and the 1 /rev rotor shaft and blade bending moments are effectively suppressed, but the dynamic components of the rotor in-plane forces and moments become larger than without cyclic blade pitch control. Without cyclic blade pitch control the 1 /rev blade and rotor shaft bending moments become quite large and, rather surprisingly, for some of these test conditions also a large 2 /rev blade bending moment is observed. Careful analysis of the data suggests that the 2 /rev flap bending is caused by a 1 /rev excitation (in the non-rotating system) of both nacelles, caused by the proximity of the nominal rotor rpm frequency to symmetric and anti-symmetric nacelle torsion eigen-frequency and probably also in combination with other nacelle related eigen-modes. The measured data are well suited to validate or verify existing semi-empirical or CFD methods to predict the steady and unsteady loads of the rotors. A correlation between rotor dynamics and (outer) wing dynamic loading and the influence of the outer wing and/or flaperon setting on the rotor forces and moments is left for future anal-ysis.

40|$|Wind {{is arguably}} the most {{promising}} source of sustainable energy. However, it is still considered to be an expensive option compared to fossil fuels. Recent developments have achieved significant cost reductions and increased the reliability on wind energy. The main reason for this has been the application of innovative and effective control strategies. All turbine designs over time have been involved in reducing the overall cost of energy by either maximizing energy yield or minimizing the effect of loads to increase the life of the wind turbine. Minimizing the effect of loads is the main focus in this thesis. Control strategies currently used in the industry involve changing the pitch angle for each individual blade to reduce the loads and are called Individual Blade Pitch Control (IPC). However, this strategy causes considerable wear and tear to the large <b>pitch</b> <b>bearings</b> in the wind turbines due to high frequency pitch control action. Thus, control strategies which not only reduce loads, but also provide smoother pitch control action are investigated in this report. It is observed that periodic loads faced by the blades of the wind turbine can be represented by a limited number of parameters such as rotor speed, they are slowly changing and more importantly, account for much of the fatigue causing loads. Thus, this thesis report focuses on applying suitable control strategies to primarily reduce periodic loads. Moreover, since the loads are periodic and slowly varying, the use of basis functions as the input space of a feedforward controller can result in smoother pitch activity. The aforementioned strategy has previously been applied on the "Smart Rotor" concept which is a mechanism where each blade is equipped with trailing edge flaps similar to an airplane wing to change the lift profile of the blade to reduce loads. This strategy has been successfully applied to the IPC mechanism and has resulted in lower pitch activity. The control methodology applied to IPC discussed above is a feedforward controller which consists of parametrized basis functions. The algorithm discussed involves a learning technique where the control parameters are calculated through successive correction in each trial period by ensuring that the wind turbine does not repeat its "mistakes". Consequently, the feedforward control is adaptive as it can adjust the controller parameters to compensate for changes in plant dynamics during operation. However, since the controller is based on a model linearized for a particular set of operating conditions such as wind speed, the performance of the controller deteriorates during turbulent wind conditions. Additionally, since it takes a few revolutions for the control parameters to converge and that if the rotor speed changes during this time, the parameters calculated are no longer optimal.
