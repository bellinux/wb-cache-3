25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, <b>polyacrylic</b> acid, {{tannic acid}} and {{polyphosphates}} can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
2500|$|MSG {{has been}} {{produced}} by three methods: hydrolysis of vegetable proteins with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds (1909–1962); direct chemical synthesis with acrylonitrile (1962–1973), and bacterial fermentation (the current method). Wheat gluten was originally used for hydrolysis {{because it contains}} more than 30 g of glutamate and glutamine in 100 g of protein. As demand for MSG increased, chemical synthesis and fermentation were studied. [...] The <b>polyacrylic</b> fiber industry began in Japan during the mid-1950s, and acrylonitrile was adopted as a base material to synthesize MSG.|$|E

50|$|Sodium polyacrylate, {{also known}} as waterlock, is a sodium salt of <b>polyacrylic</b> acid with the {{chemical}} formula −CH2−CH(CO2Na)−n and broad application in consumer products. This superabsorbent polymer {{has the ability to}} absorb as much as 200 to 300 times its mass in water. Sodium polyacrylate is an anionic polyelectrolyte with negatively charged carboxylic groups in the main chain. While sodium neutralized <b>polyacrylic</b> acids are the most common form used in industry, there are also other salts available including potassium, lithium and ammonium.|$|E
50|$|Polycarbophil calcium (INN) {{is a drug}} used as a stool stabilizer. Chemically, it is a {{synthetic}} polymer of <b>polyacrylic</b> acid cross-linked with divinyl glycol, with calcium as a counter-ion.|$|E
50|$|Thiomers {{are able}} to {{reversibly}} open tight junctions. Due to thiolation the permeation enhancing effect of polymers such as <b>polyacrylic</b> acid or chitosan can be up to 10-fold ımproved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyacrylic</b> {{acid and}} its {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} disposable diapers, ion exchange resins and adhesives. They are also popular as thickening, dispersing, suspending and emulsifying agents in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and paints.PAA may inactivate the antiseptic chlorhexidine gluconate.The neutralized <b>polyacrylic</b> acid gels are suitable to obtain biocompatible matrices for medical applications such as gels for skin care or skin disease treatment products. For the development of polymeric matrices which allows controlled delivery rate of active substances, the recent investigations aimed towards the clarification of the conformational changes of the polymeric gel during neutralization, light irradiation and embedment of gold nanoparticles.|$|E
5000|$|GIC {{solution}} is <b>polyacrylic</b> acid. GIC is alumino-silicate (glass) bioceramic cement. As MTA is mainly composed of calcium-alumino-silicate, PAA (<b>polyacrylic</b> acid) is an accelerant for MTA. PAA set MTA within 15-18 minutes. More aluminate, faster set. Also high concentrated calcium chloride (CaCl2, 70% more) {{is well known}} as accelerator of Portland cement. So high concentrated -over 70%- Calcium Chloride solution sets MTA within 12 minutes. Or Pozzolanic reaction is also faster set chemical reaction of calcium silicate hydrate[...] But pozzolanic reacted cement has lower compressive strength at 15 MPa maximum. Easy broken and easily removable property of pozzolanic MTA.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Chemical {{structures}} of two synthetic polyelectrolytes, as examples. To {{the left is}} poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) (PSS), {{and to the right}} is <b>polyacrylic</b> acid (PAA). Both are negatively charged polyelectrolytes when dissociated. PSS is a 'strong' polyelectrolyte (fully charged in solution), whereas PAA is 'weak' (partially charged).|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{polymers}} produced {{using this}} method are polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and <b>polyacrylic</b> acid (PAA).The major disadvantage {{of the solution}} polymerization technique is that however inert the selected solvent may be, chain transfer to the solvent cannot be completely ruled out and, hence, {{it is difficult to}} get very high molecular weight product ...|$|E
50|$|Acrylic {{acid and}} its esters readily combine with {{themselves}} (to form <b>polyacrylic</b> acid) or other monomers (e.g. acrylamides, acrylonitrile, vinyl compounds, styrene, and butadiene) by reacting at their double bond, forming homopolymers or copolymers {{which are used}} in the manufacture of various plastics, coatings, adhesives, elastomers, as well as floor polishes, and paints.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Glass ionomer cement: It {{is based}} on alumino-silicate based {{bioceramic}} material. Most cytotoxicity is caused by <b>polyacrylic</b> acid. So current GIC as root-end filling material is reducing the cytotoxic acclerator's concentration. - calcium alumino-silicate - MTA (calcium alumino-silicate) + GIC (alumino-silicate), calcium reinforced glass ionomer cement is developed. It's a promising material.|$|E
50|$|A 2016 Cochrane Review {{seeking to}} compare the {{effectiveness}} of various over the counter artificial tears in treating dry eye. While the review stated that is unclear which artificial tear formulation works best, two trials found that 0.2% <b>polyacrylic</b> acid-based tears were more effective in treating dry eye symptoms over 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based tears.|$|E
50|$|GIC {{materials}} bond both to enamel and dentine {{after being}} cleaned with <b>polyacrylic</b> acid conditioner. Some other advantages GIC’s {{have is that}} they contain fluoride and are less moisture sensitive, with suggestions being made that despite having poor retention, they may prevent occlusal caries even after the sealant has fallen out due {{to their ability to}} release fluoride.|$|E
50|$|As the {{platinum}} metal precursor {{is reduced to}} neutral {{platinum metal}} (Pt0), the reaction mixture becomes supersaturated with platinum metal and the Pt0 begins to precipitate {{in the form of}} nanoscale particles. A capping agent or stabilizing agent such as sodium <b>polyacrylic</b> acid or sodium citrate is often used to stabilize the nanoparticle surfaces, and prevents the aggregation and coalescence of the nanoparticles.|$|E
50|$|Thickening agents used in {{cosmetics}} {{or personal}} hygiene products include viscous liquids such as polyethylene glycol, synthetic polymers such as carbomer (a trade name for <b>polyacrylic</b> acid) and vegetable gums. Some thickening agents may also function as stabilizers {{when they are}} used to maintain the stability of an emulsion. Some emollients, such as petroleum jelly and various waxes may also function as thickening agents in an emulsion.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, a new 225ci slant six {{replaced}} the 251ci six used in 1961 & 1962 W100 & W200 Power Wagon Trucks. The Power Wagon W300 {{continued to use}} the 251ci. L-6 engine. The new 225ci engine (the 225-2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to; a roller timing chain, bi-metal connecting rod bearings, stellite-faced exhaust valves, roto caps on exhaust valves and <b>polyacrylic</b> valve stem seals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyacrylic</b> acid is a weak anionic polyelectrolyte, whose {{degree of}} {{ionisation}} {{is dependent on}} solution pH. In its non-ionised form at low pHs, PAA may associate with various non-ionic polymers (such as polyethylene oxide, poly-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide and some cellulose ethers) and form hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexes. In aqueous solutions PAA can also form polycomplexes with oppositely charged polymers (for example, chitosan), surfactants and drug molecules (for example, streptomycin).|$|E
50|$|A graft-and-block {{approach}} {{might be}} useful for solving problems encountered {{by the use of}} a common bioadhesive polymer, <b>polyacrylic</b> acid (PAAc). PAAc adheres to mucosal surfaces but will swell and degrade rapidly at pH 7.4, resulting in rapid release of drugs entrapped in its matrix. A combination of PAAc with another polymer that is less sensitive to changes at neutral pH might increase the residence time and slow the release of the drug, thus improving bioavailability and effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|In 1971 the {{processing}} of polypropylene for production of embroidery and foil was started, and in 1979 the factory expanded {{with the opening of}} a new section for production of yarn based on: polypropylene, polyester, <b>polyacrylic</b> and fibers. On October 10, 1955 the first textile Secondary Technical School of fiber was opened in Odžaci, at the instance of the jointed textile professions of Yugoslavia, which contributed for the further development of textile industry in the municipality. The cultural life of the municipality became richer and diverse.|$|E

50|$|Polyaspartic {{acid and}} its {{derivatives}} are biodegradable alternatives to traditional polyanionic materials, in particular <b>polyacrylic</b> acid. PASA has ability to inhibit deposition of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, and calcium phosphate {{and can be}} used as an antiscalining agent in cooling water systems, water desalination processes, and waste water treatment operations. In addition and due to its ability to chelate metal ions, it provides corrosion inhibition.It can act as a super-swelling material in diapers, feminine hygiene products, and food packaging. It can also be used as biodegradable detergent and dispersant for various applications.|$|E
50|$|Smart polymer {{matrices}} release drugs by {{a chemical}} or physiological structure-altering reaction, often a hydrolysis reaction resulting in cleavage of bonds and release of drug as the matrix breaks down into biodegradable components. The {{use of natural}} polymers {{has given way to}} artificially synthesized polymers such as polyanhydrides, polyesters, <b>polyacrylic</b> acids, poly(methyl methacrylates), and polyurethanes. Hydrophilic, amorphous, low-molecular-weight polymers containing heteroatoms (i.e., atoms other than carbon) have been found to degrade fastest. Scientists control the rate of drug delivery by varying these properties thus adjusting the rate of degradation.|$|E
50|$|The acid base setting {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the mixing of the components. The {{first phase of the}} reaction involves dissolution. The acid begins to attach the surface of the glass particles, as well as the adjacent tooth substrate, thus precipitating their outer layers but also neutralising itself. As the pH of the aqueous solution rises, the <b>polyacrylic</b> acid begins to ionise, and becoming negatively charged it sets up a diffusion gradient and helps draw cations out of the glass and dentine. The alkalinity also induces the polymers to dissociate, increasing the viscosity of the aqueous solution.|$|E
50|$|Lower {{critical}} solution temperatures {{also occur}} in many polymer-solvent mixtures. For polar {{systems such as}} <b>polyacrylic</b> acid in 1,4-dioxane, this is often due {{to the formation of}} hydrogen bonds between polymer and solvent. For nonpolar systems such as polystyrene in cyclohexane, phase separation has been observed in sealed tubes (at high pressure) at temperatures approaching the liquid-vapor critical point of the solvent. At such temperatures the solvent expands much more rapidly than the polymer, whose segments are covalently linked. Mixing therefore requires contraction of the solvent for compatibility of the polymer, resulting in a loss of entropy.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic nanochains are a {{new class}} of magnetoresponsive and superparamagnetic {{nanostructures}} with highly anisotropic shapes which can be manipulated using magnetic field and magnetic field gradient. Such nanochains consist of self-assembled nanoparticle clusters which are magnetically assembled and fixated into a chain. Among the various linking methods used are silica coating, <b>polyacrylic</b> acid (PAA) coating, tetraethoxysilane condensation, biotinylation or glucose decomposition. Typically, the primary building blocks of these nanostructures are individual superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Nanoparticle clusters which are composed of a number of individual magnetic nanoparticles (ca. 100 SPIONs) are known as magnetic nanobeads with a diameter of 50-200 nanometers.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical fouling inhibitors {{can reduce}} fouling in many systems, mainly by {{interfering with the}} crystallization, attachment, or {{consolidation}} steps of the fouling process. Examples for water systems are: chelating agents (for example, EDTA), long-chain aliphatic amines or polyamines (for example, octadecylamine, helamin, and other [...] "film-forming" [...] amines), organic phosphonic acids (for example, etidronic acid), or polyelectrolytes (for example, <b>polyacrylic</b> acid, polymethacrylic acid, usually with a molecular weight lower than 10000). For fired boilers, aluminum or magnesium additives can lower the melting point of ash and promote creation of deposits which are easier to remove. See also process chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|Many methods, {{have been}} devised for {{synthetically}} producing ACC since its discovery at 1989, however, only few syntheses successfully stabilized ACC for more than several weeks. The best effective method to stabilize ACC lifetime is by forming it {{in the presence of}} magnesium. Also, ACC crystallisation pathways have been observed to depend on its Mg/Ca ratio, transforming to Mg-calcite, monohydrocalcite or dolomite with increasing Mg content. Huang et al. managed to stabilize ACC using <b>polyacrylic</b> acid for several months, while Loste et al. showed that magnesium ions can increase ACC stability as well. But only the discovery that aspartic acid, glycine, citrate [...] phosphorylated amino acids can produce long term stable ACC have opened the door for production commercialization.|$|E
50|$|Scale inhibitors are {{specialty}} chemicals that {{are added to}} oil production systems to delay, reduce and/or prevent scale deposition. acrylic acid polymers, maleic acid polymers and phosphonates have been used extensively for scale treatment in water systems due to their excellent solubility, thermal stability and dosage efficiency. In the water treatment industry, the major classes of SIs have inorganic phosphate, organophosphorous and organic polymer backbones and common examples are PBTC (phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid), ATMP (amino-trimethylene phosphonic acid) and HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid), <b>polyacrylic</b> acid (PAA), phosphinopolyacrylates (such as PPCA), polymaleic acids (PMA), maleic acid terpolymers (MAT), sulfonic acid copolymers, such as SPOCA (sulfonated phosphonocarboxylic acid), polyvinyl sulfonates. Two common oilfield mineral SIs are Poly-Phosphono Carboxylic acid (PPCA) and Diethylenetriamine- penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP).|$|E
50|$|Dentine surface treatment, {{which can}} be {{performed}} with glass ionomer cements as the cement has adhesive characteristics which may be useful when placed in undercut cavities. The surfaces on which the glass cement ionomers are placed would be adequately prepared by removing the precipitated salivary proteins, present from saliva as this would greatly reduce the receptiveness of the glass ionomer cement and dentine surface, to bond formation. A number of different substances {{can be used to}} remove this element, such as citric acid, however the most effective substance seems to be <b>poly(acrylic)</b> acid, which is applied to the tooth surface for 30 seconds before it is washed off. The tooth is then dried to ensure the surface is receptive to bond formation but care is taken to ensure desiccation does not occur.|$|E
50|$|In this process, {{the shell}} and seeds are removed, and the pulped fruit is {{made into a}} fruit {{concentrate}} or puree. Additional juice may be extracted from the remaining pulp by hot water. The juice is homogenized, slightly acidified to prevent gelling and improve the flavor, then treated with pectinase or other enzymes {{to break down the}} pectin. Most of the off-flavor agents are then removed with ion-exchange resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer or <b>polyacrylic</b> acid. Alternatively, the off-flavors can be adsorbed by agents like charcoal or bentonite, which are removed by filtration; or precipitated with gelatin or other gelling agents. Most of the remaining sulfurous volatiles are then removed by low-pressure evaporation. The juice is then pasteurized to inactivate remaining natural enzymes and kill micro-organisms. The process is claimed to preserve a substantial fraction of the mogrosides present in the fruit.|$|E
