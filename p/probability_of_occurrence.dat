5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Niño would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the El Niño effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence,</b> the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} El Niño would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E

2500|$|A neurochemical process {{involving}} dopamine {{has been}} suggested to underlie reinforcement. [...] When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, dopamine pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways [...] "releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons." [...] This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, {{the most likely to}} have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.|$|E

Entropy is also commonly computed using the natural logarithm (base , where [...] is Euler's number), which produces a measurement of entropy in [...] "nats" [...] per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas.

However, conservationists have begun to ask whether representing species in reserve networks is sufficient to avoid local extinctions within selected areas. An attractive, but previously untested idea is to model current species' <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> as an estimate of local persistence in the near future. Using distribution data for passerine birds in Great Britain, we show that (i) species' <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> are negatively related to local <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> extinction, at least when a particular 20 -year period is considered, and (ii) local extinctions can be reduced if areas are selected to maximize current species' <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> We suggest that more extinctions could be avoided if even a simple treatment of persistence were to be incorporated within reserve selection methods...|$|R
