2500|$|Newspaper {{reporter}} William Burke [...] "Skeets" [...] Miller from The Courier-Journal in Louisville {{reported on}} the rescue efforts from the scene. Miller, of small stature, was able to remove a lot of earth from around Collins. He also interviewed Collins in the cave, receiving a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage and playing a part in Collins' attempted rescue. Miller's reports were distributed by telegraph and were printed by newspapers {{across the country and}} abroad, and the rescue attempts were followed by regular news bulletins on the new medium of broadcast radio (the first broadcast radio station KDKA having been established in 1920). Shortly after the media arrived, the publicity drew crowds of tourists to the site, at one <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> in the tens of thousands. Vendors set up stalls to sell food and souvenirs, creating a circus-like atmosphere. The Sand Cave rescue attempt grew to become the third-biggest media event between the world wars. (The biggest media events of that time both involved Charles Lindbergh — the trans-Atlantic flight and his son's kidnapping — and Lindbergh actually had a minor role in the Sand Cave rescue, too, having been hired to fly photographic negatives from the scene for a newspaper.) Since the nearest telegraph station was in Cave City, some miles from the cave, two amateur radio operators with the callsigns 9BRK and 9CHG provided the link to pass messages to the authorities and the press.|$|E

50|$|Above {{method of}} {{representing}} the floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> is complex method of representing the floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> but with it we can represent {{wide range of}} floating <b>points</b> <b>numbers</b> by this method. As well as it is convenient to manipulate the floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> by this method. It is difficult for a human being to convert floating <b>point</b> (real <b>numbers</b> in mathematical language) number into the format {{in which they are}} stored into the memory. As well as it is difficult to convert back floating point, looking its hex or binary value, into the real number. Due to the conversion problem fixed floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> are used. Fixed floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> could be easily converted by the human into its memory representation and from memory representation into the actual number.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for privacy-preserving outsourced calculation on floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> (POCF). Using POCF, a user can securely outsource the storing and processing of floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> to a cloud server without compromising on {{the security of the}} (original) data and the computed results. In particular, we first present privacy-preserving integer processing protocols for common integer operations. We then present an approach to outsourcing floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> for storage in a privacy-preserving way, and securely processing commonly used floating <b>point</b> <b>number</b> operations on-the-fly. We prove that the proposed POCF achieves the goal of floating <b>point</b> <b>number</b> processing without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties, and demonstrate the utility and the efficiency of POCF using simulations...|$|R

Moore kept a library, {{and had a}} {{collection}} of original paintings at the station, including one by Peter Paul Rubens. She entertained many visitors to the island, at one <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> over a thousand in one year. During her time at Fayerweather Island she saved 21 lives; she once said that {{she wished she could}} have saved double that number.|$|E
50|$|By convention, the bicyclic β-lactams are {{numbered}} {{starting with the}} position occupied by sulfur in the penams and cephems, regardless of which atom {{it is in a}} given class. That is, position 1 is always adjacent to the β-carbon of β-lactam ring. The numbering continues clockwise from position one until the β-carbon of β-lactam is reached, at which <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> continues counterclockwise around the lactam ring to number the remaining to carbons. For example, the nitrogen atom of all bicyclic β-lactams fused to five-membered rings is labelled position 4, as it is in penams, while in cephems, the nitrogen is position 5.|$|E
50|$|The main {{goals of}} Spain were, {{as in the}} Seven Years' War, the {{recovery}} of Gibraltar and Minorca from the British, who had owned them since 1704 and to damage British trade through the actions of privateers. The siege of Gibraltar, June 16, 1779 to February 7, 1783, was the longest lasting Spanish action in the war. Despite the larger size of the besieging Franco-Spanish army, at one <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> 33,000, the British under George Augustus Elliott were able to hold out in the fortress and were resupplied by sea three times. Luis de Córdova y Córdova was unable to prevent Howe's fleet returning home after resupplying Gibraltar in October 1782. The combined Franco-Spanish invasion of Minorca in 1781 met with more success; Minorca surrendered the following year, and was restored to Spain after the war, nearly eighty {{years after it was}} first captured by the British. In 1780 and 1781, Luis de Córdova's fleet captured America-bound British convoys, doing much damage to British military supplies and commerce.|$|E

25|$|To do this, the FidoNet {{addressing}} scheme was extended {{with the addition}} of a final address segment, the <b>point</b> <b>number.</b> For instance, a user on the example system above might be given <b>point</b> <b>number</b> 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address 1:170/918.10.|$|R
5000|$|Malleson {{had spent}} some time {{planning}} how to extricate the British forces, which was a complex task. He had told the Committee confidentially that he was withdrawing; they {{had decided not to}} tell the public for fear it would cause panic. The Committee itself was alarmed at the news, though they had been making an effort to work with Denikin and the White Russians [...] With Denikin's involvement in the Transcaspian, they now had a new sponsor. In order to safely withdraw, Malleson spread a rumour that the withdrawal was a feint for a flanking attack. The Bolsheviks were fooled by the ruse, and responded to the rumour by reinforcing their positions rather than pursuing the withdrawing British forces. The British forces, at this <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> 950, began their withdrawal early in March. They had all left by mid April 1919. However, with the British gone, the Bolsheviks launched new offensives, gradually pushing the Transcaspian forces back. They were defeated by 1920, and the Bolshevik Tashkent Soviet regained control of the territory.|$|E

Their second was in 2005 where they defeated the Longstanding Nô Pintcha who won the most titles, the club was placed in Group B and did not won a match. For their next four appearances, the club only played in the group stage. Again the club was in Group B in 2007 and Morabeza had only two draws with {{in the last two}} weeks with Maio's Académica da Calheta and São Nicolau's Ultramarina. In 2008, they were for the third time in Group B and made their first win of the century in the first round where they defeated Santiago North's Estrela dos Amadores 2-0, then they defeated Fogo's Vulcânicos 2-0 in the second round, in the third round, a scoreless draw was made with Boa Vista's Académica Operária, they had the highest <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> seven. In 2010, after their second consecutive win for the island, the club had their last national appearnance and was placed in Group A for the 2010 season, the first match with Boavista was a scoreless draw in the first round, then Morabeza had their only loss with Marítimo do Porto Novo. Morabeza's only win was over Solpontense 3-1 on May 23. The remaining two matches had a goal draw with Batuque and Botafogo.|$|E

40|$|A PRNG {{specialized}} in double precision floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> using an affine transition Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto Abstract We propose a pseudorandom number generator specialized to generate double precision floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers.</b> It generates 52 -bit pseudo-random patterns supplemented by a constant most significant 12 bits (sign and exponent), {{so that the}} concatenated 64 bits represents a floating <b>point</b> <b>number</b> obeying the IEEE 754 format. To keep the constant part, we adopt an affine transition function {{instead of the usual}} F 2 -linear transition, and ex-tend algorithms computing the period and the dimensions of equidistribution to the affine case. The resulted generator generates double precision floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> faster than the Mersenne Twister, whose output numbers only have 32 -bit precision. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} three four-node quadrilateral axisymmetric elements. The {{first one}} is an incompatible element while the second one is a modification of the first element by an extended Hellinger-Reissner principle. The second element is then simplified by incorporating the conceptual idea of free formulation and thus forms the third element. All of the three elements {{are found to be}} invariant, insensitive to nodal <b>point</b> <b>numbering,</b> free of locking for nearly incompressible material, able to pass the patch test and do not exhibit the false shear phenomenon.

40|$|We {{describe}} a general algorithm to produce compatible 3 D triangulations from spatial decompositions. Such triangulations match edges and faces across spatial cell boundaries, solving several problems in graphics and visualization including the crack problem found in adaptive isosurface generation, triangulation of arbitrary grids (including unstructured grids), clipping, and the interval tetrahedrization problem. The algorithm produces compatible triangulations on a cell-by-cell basis, using a modified Delaunay triangulation {{with a simple}} point ordering rule to resolve degenerate cases and produce unique triangulations across cell boundaries. The algorithm is naturally parallel since it requires no neighborhood cell information, only a unique, global <b>point</b> <b>numbering.</b> We show application of this algorithm to adaptive contour generation; tetrahedrization of unstructured meshes; clipping and interval volume mesh generation...|$|E

We {{start out with}} a short discussion of arbitrary precision integers and rationals. The bulk of the lecture will be about floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers.</b> Floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> are of the form s · m · 2 e where s is a sign bit (− 1 or + 1), m is a non-negative number called mantissa and e is an integer called exponent. The number of digits available for the mantissa is either fixed (all hardware floating point systems) or arbitrary (most software floating point systems). The exponent either comes from a fixed range (hardware floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> and some software floating point systems) or is arbitrary (some software floating point systems). Already the first programmable computer offered floating <b>point</b> <b>numbers.</b> In 1938, Konrad Zuse completed the ”Z 1 ”, the first programmable computer. It worked with 22 -bit floating-point numbers having a 7 -bit exponent, 15 -bit significant (including one implicit bit), and a sign bit. The Z 3, completed in 1941, implemented floating point arithmetic exceptions with representations for plus and minus infinity and undefined.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the formulation of}} a hybrid stress quadrilateral Kirchhoff plate bending element based on an extended complementary energy functional first proposed by Tong. With {{the inclusion of a}} Lagrange multiplier in the functional to enforce a constraint on the assumed moment space, the construction of the C 1 deflection profile inside the element is no longer necessary. The continuity requirement on the deflection across the element interfaces is fulfilled by interpolating the generalized nodal displacements over the element boundary in the usual way. Special attention is paid to the selection of assumed moment space such that the element stability, convergency, invariance and nodal <b>point</b> <b>numbering</b> insensitivity are secured while the implementational cost of the element is kept low. Quadratic serendipity interpolation of the transverse deflection is adopted to discretize the distributed transverse loading. Numerical examples are presented and the accuracy achieved is found to be satisfactory. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A spatial–structural {{design process}} can be {{investigated}} via a so-called research engine, in which a spatial design {{is transformed into a}} structural design and vice versa. During the transformation from a spatial into a structural design, it is necessary to obtain a stable structural model, so that a structural analysis can be carried out. This article presents four methods to automate the (normally carried out intuitively) stabilisation process, using data related to a structural design’s geometry and its instability modes. The methods all use the null space and associated null vectors of the structural stiffness matrix. Then each null vector is resolved by either (a) rod addition, (b) plane addition, (c) hinge fixation by single rod substitution, or (d) hinge fixation by coupled rod substitution. The methods have been implemented in C++ and several test cases have been carried out. The test cases explain why (a) rod addition provides the most realistic solutions, (b) if several methods are used subsequently for one problem, superfluous elements are inevitable, (c) there is a serious influence on the performance for various systems of key <b>point</b> <b>numbering,</b> (d) the efficiency of the methods is not optimal and may be improved by some suggested strategies...|$|E
