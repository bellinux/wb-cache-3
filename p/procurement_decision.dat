40|$|Fragmentation of {{production}} into {{more and more}} complex supply chains is a prominent feature of globalisation. Transaction management purports to minimise the transaction costs associated with this fragmentation {{of production}}. In this era of globalisation, transaction costs carry a large weight in total costs of ownership which is the relevant cost function in <b>procurement</b> <b>decisions.</b> This article discusses how transaction management can be helpful to these <b>procurement</b> <b>decisions.</b> An analysis of {{the various types of}} transaction costs is essential in the 'make or buy' and location decisions in global sourcing. In general, a distinction can be made between 'hard' and 'soft' transaction costs when making strategic <b>procurement</b> <b>decisions.</b> Soft transaction costs are difficult to quantify but become more important now that formal trade barriers gradually disappear and transport costs are reduced. Business strategies to keep transaction costs low in the long run can also, to a considerable extent, explain socially responsible business conduct from the perspective of rational economic behaviour.

40|$|The {{gap between}} social {{activities}} and technology is widening {{particularly with the}} advent of new and innovative methods of computing within a complex socio-technical divide. This gap has been partly attributed to the technical limitations arising from the complexity of the environment where these decision supports are needed. <b>Procurement</b> <b>decisions</b> are faced with several challenges such as selecting the right mix of product, price and method to procure it. However, how to marry this divide between decision support theory and the people this theory or technology actually support in practice has been the major challenge. In order to bridge this socio-technical divide, we have proposed the use of AHP technique to develop a framework for <b>procurement</b> <b>decisions</b> using University of Babylon, Iraq as a case study. The proposed decision support framework will attempt to address issued regarding information fusion by automatically integrating multiple information sources to enhance the decision making process through empirical and theoretical findings, the interdependencies that characterize the relationships between information fusion, and management decision making. A pre-implementation study was carried out in order to ascertain the usefulness of this framework in promoting user-centered decisions by explaining the various influences of different decision making on information systems and procurement processes in the University of Babylon, Iraq.

This research focuses on the key techniques used in strategic sourcing departments and issues faced in making a strategic sourcing <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> in South Africa. Large South African industrial and resource companies that are acknowledged leaders in strategic sourcing in South Africa were interviewed. The data gathering consisted of structured interviews with the overall leader, or their deputies, of strategic sourcing in each company. The research objective was broken down into a number of different propositions, supporting the techniques used in sourcing departments and issues faced when making a strategic sourcing <b>procurement</b> <b>decision.</b> The results showed relatively strong support for the identified techniques (from a review of literature) that strategic sourcing departments use, including crossfunctional sourcing teams, sourcing information systems, alignment with corporate strategy and the use of a formal sourcing process. There was little support for value chain mapping and formal supplier relationship management. There was poor support for the issues identified in the literature as affecting a strategic sourcing <b>procurement</b> <b>decision.</b> Core competencies, the external environment, product and process and technology and demand variability did not play a significant role in a strategic sourcing <b>procurement</b> <b>decision.</b> The only strongly supported area was around cost management.

In particular, the opportunity cost due to customer mismanagement, which is related to the performance of the CRM system, is used as a key cost factor to reflect the financial impact of the system. We employ an engineering economy model to compare various systems with different life spans.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years the {{construction}} industry has developed a myriad of alternative procurement routes to offer its clients. As a result of this vast quantity of options it has become imperative that construction industry clients utilise a set of well defined criteria or parameters to assess the merits of the various procurement routes available. The interior fitout sector is characterised by its tight time frames, challenging work environments where construction operatives often have to work around fully functioning offices, tight budgets, the prevalence of third parties in the form of building managers and tight budgets. Relatively little prior research has been conducted into the specific procurement selection criteria of Auckland interior fitout clients. This study’s objectives are to evaluate how influential pre defined procurement selection criteria or parameters are on the procurement decisions of Auckland interior fitout clients. The results obtained from this study will then be partially compared to the results of a similar study conducted in Australia (Thanh Luu, Thomas, & Chen, 2003). A semi structured interview incorporating a questionnaire facilitated the collection of specific data addressing backgrounds of respondents, current procurement selection practices, influence of 34 procurement selection parameters in terms of <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> making and open ended questions around overall impressions of construction procurement. The results show that cost related criteria and time related criteria are by far the most influential parameters in terms of <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> making. The findings of this study support the findings of numerous previous studies that time and cost are the primary initial indicators of project success of failure and therefore most prevalent in <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> making. Furthermore results from this study suggest that interior fitout clients utilise consultant advice to determine a procurement path. Responses to open ended questions indicate contradictory thinking amongst research participants as the same clients who overwhelmingly rated time and cost as the most critical procurement selection criteria feel that too much emphasis is placed on cost factors {{at the expense of other}} valid considerations.

40|$|For {{any given}} reason, every year many {{countries}} {{spend a lot}} of money purchasing at least one weapon. Due to the secret character of the military, the decision process for specific weapon procurement is shrouded. Moreover, there are several funds loss cases due to mistakes in weapon contractions. Weapon procurement requires very large amounts of money which comes from tax payers. Therefore, an effort to reduce a possible monetary loss is needed. A decision process based on an analytic model can present a better chance to decision makers for better weapon decisions. In general, weapon <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> is a multi criteria environment. Decision making in such environments is defined as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). MCDM is broadly classified into two areas: Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) and Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM). MADM methods are used for selecting an alternative from a small explicit list of alternatives. MODM methods are used for designing problems involving an infinite number of alternatives implicitly defined by mathematical constraints. This research is intended to be used by the South Korean Navy when there is a need to select one weapon type among several candidate types. Therefore, MADM methods are used in this research. Many researches for developing an analytical model for better decision-making have been done. However, there is no research for a generalized weapon <b>procurement</b> <b>decision</b> model that is easy to implement. For this reason, whenever there is a need for weapon <b>procurement</b> <b>decision,</b> the Navy has to {{spend a lot of}} effort in determining the best weapon.
