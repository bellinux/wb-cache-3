AIB owned 70.5% of the combined bank, which is a leading bank in Poland in terms of asset size and key <b>product</b> <b>market</b> shares. On 9 September 2010 AIB reached agreement to sell a 66% stake in BZ-WBK to Santander for 3.1 billion euro, the balance of the shares to be sold on the open market.

50|$|There {{appears to}} be {{agreement}} among economists on the positive correlation between <b>product</b> <b>market</b> and employment regulation. Although employment protection legislation is {{only one aspect of}} the wide range of regulatory interventions in the labour market, Nicoletti et al. (2000) find evidence suggesting that, across countries, restrictive regulatory environments in the <b>product</b> <b>market</b> tend to be associated with restrictive employment protection policies. They claim that the indicators presented in their paper are closely related, with a statistical correlation of 0.73 (significant at the 1% level). In other words, according to these results, restrictive <b>product</b> <b>market</b> regulations are matched by analogous EPL restrictions to generate a tight overall regulatory environment for firms in their <b>product</b> <b>market</b> {{as well as in the}} allocation of labour inputs. The strong correlation between regulatory regimes inthe <b>product</b> <b>market</b> and EPL also suggests that their influence may have compounded effects on labour market outcomes, making regulatory reform in only one market less effective than simultaneous reform in the two markets.|$|E
