50|$|Launched in 2009, the Marin 1 {{features}} Speake-Marin's first in-house movement, a grade 5 titanium case, flame-blued hands, two-piece oven-fired enamel dial and {{stainless steel}} Piccadilly case. Its three concentric rings for the minutes were inspired by early pocket watch chronographs. Marin 1 Mk I was the first Speake-Marin model to feature the SM2 calibre, an in-house calibre, designed and manufactured by Speake-Marin. It took three years to develop. The SM2 Calibre {{has been described as}} a “watchmaker’s movement” The balance wheel is large (weight of balance is 0118gr inertia 25 mg.cm2) and oscillates at 21,600 vph. The <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> are made in untreated German silver. All bridges, levers and the mainplate are finished by hand (circling, spotting and polished). The rotor wheel angles are hand-finished then the surface is mirror-finished. All pivots are burnished. The SM2 has a power reserve of 72 hours, features 29 jewels and contains 211 components altogether.|$|E

With the new shields the torpedoes could be worked in all weather conditions thus extending the useful life of the class.|$|R
40|$|AbstractINSET company {{developed}} a unique measurement system DYNAMAG® which allows non-contact mechanical tension measurement in prestressed steel parts of concrete constructions like beams, plates etc. Principle of measurement method {{is based on}} the magnetoelastic effect of ferromagnetic materials. There is an interaction between the magnetization and the strain of a magnetic material. DYNAMAG® measures the change of relative permeability of the material during its mechanical load. DYNAMAG is suitable for both checking the quality of prestressing process during construction and for long term monitoring. Typical applications are:•in geotechnical structures like tunnels, anchored pile walls, and embankments (tension measurement in ground anchors) •in bridge structures for monitoring prestressed beams <b>and</b> <b>plates,</b> cable-stayed <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> extradosed <b>bridges</b> (tension measurement in steel strands, cables and rods...|$|R

5|$|The {{zygomatic}} {{plates are}} almost completely vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the antorbital <b>bridge</b> is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward <b>and</b> the zygomatic <b>plates</b> are bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|R

50|$|The MSHD {{standardized}} {{the designs}} of steel stringer <b>bridges</b> in 1905-06 <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> girder <b>bridges</b> in 1907-08. However, {{it was not until}} 1926, the year this bridge was built, that the department began encasing the steel girder webs in concrete. Why they did so is not entirely clear, and indeed the department abandoned the practice of encasing interior girders soon after. However, they continued encasing the exterior beams in concrete, and continued using the concrete balusters pioneered with this <b>bridge</b> design, <b>and</b> this <b>bridge</b> can be considered a prototype for numerous, similar bridges built by the department in the next decade.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{soundboard}} plays an increasingly important role compared to the sound hole, back <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>bridge</b> at high frequencies. The frequency spectrum of investigation can be extended to 5 kHz. Design of bracings and their placements on the soundboard increase its structural stiffness as well as redistributing its deflection to nonbraced regions and affecting its loudness as well as its response at low and high frequencies. This paper attempts to present a review of {{the current state of the}} art in guitar research and to propose viable alternatives that will ultimately result in a louder and better sounding instrument. Current research is an attempt to increase the sound level with bracing designs and their placements, control of natural frequencies using scalloped braces, as well as improve the acoustic radiation of this instrument at higher frequencies by deliberately inducing asymmetric modes in the soundboard using the concept of “splitting board. ” Various mathematical methods are available for analysing the soundboard based on the theory of thin plates. Discrete models of the instrument up to 4 degrees of freedom are also presented. Results from finite element analysis can be utilized for the evaluation of acoustic radiation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} coupled flutter {{mechanism}} of <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> long span <b>bridges</b> based on step-by-step analysis (SBS).

In the process of SBS analysis, some torsional divergent velocities where the torsional rigidity becomes zero can be defined. Finally, the flutter-behavior of an elastic model of the complete Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge, which is the longest suspension bridge in the world, is studied {{from the point of}} view of flutter in 2 degrees of freedom, namely heaving and torsional motion, taking into account the structural coupling effect of additional torsional displacement induced by horizontal displacement as a structural coupling property...|$|R

Second, the partial differential operator that arise from vibrating plates is the biharmonic operator, which one does not encounter often in a first course on numerical partial differential equations, and which is more challenging to discretize than the standard Laplacian seen in most textbooks. In addition, the history of vibrating <b>plates</b> is interesting, <b>and</b> we will show both spectral discretizations leading to small dense matrix eigenvalue problems, and a finite difference discretization, leading to large scale sparse matrix eigenvalue problems.
