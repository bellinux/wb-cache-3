5|$|Following his release, Isaac Desha {{traveled}} to Texas under an alias, where he robbed and killed another man. He was identified based on family resemblance {{and the silver}} <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> had earlier saved his life. After being arrested, he confessed to both murders. He died of a fever the day before his trial in August 1828.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E

5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

Fixed Uprights refer to one piece vertical <b>pipes</b> <b>that</b> cannot break down in to smaller sections or otherwise adjust in height. Telescopic Uprights refer to two piece vertical <b>pipes</b> <b>that</b> are adjustable in height between a designated range (for example, 6 feet to 10 feet tall), allowing for more versatility if different events require varying heights.|$|R

25|$|TEPCO {{states that}} there was a {{temporary}} oil leak into the sea near the plant, from an oil <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> may have been damaged in the March disaster. It is stated as being an extremely small leak, possibly caused by recent rainy weather from Typhoon Songda. TEPCO says that the leak has stopped and oil fences have been installed to prevent the liquid from spreading into the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Skylit Bowl {{combines}} three deep bowls with a ¾ <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> has {{a large-scale}} skylight type opening on top (the {{first of its}} kind). This area of the park is inspired by the backyard pools that skaters rode {{in the early years}} of the sport. The bowls range in depth from 8' to 11' and incorporate various horizontal radii to facilitate rider circulation. The edges of the bowls are round steel pipe and granite pool edging.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the three}} most {{important}} catchments (Maldonado, Medrano and Vega) are drained by a large drainage <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> follows {{in the direction of the}} former watercourses. Typical dimensions range from 15m to 20m wide and 3m to 4m high with an internal supporting structure of columns and beams that results in interference of stormwater flow and can cause back up and increased flooding. The city counts approximately 1400km (870mi.) of stormwater conveyance covering an area of 30,000ha (74,000 acres) with 7,000 sub-catchments structures, 12,000 street-level storm drains, and 6,000 sewer drains.|$|E

25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|At Pixy Cove, Poirot {{and police}} find {{a pair of}} new scissors, a {{fragment}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> could belong to many smokers, and heroin hidden in a cave (which turns out {{to belong to the}} heroin-smuggling Sir Horace Blatt). Inside the cave, Poirot also sniffs a delicate exclusive perfume only used by Arlena and Rosamund. Poirot invites everyone on a picnic to test their vertigo. Christine and Emily both claimed fear of heights (acrophobia), but Christine easily traverses the bridge – thus she lied. After the picnic, Linda is found overdosed on six of Christine's sleeping pills, and almost dies. She has written a confession but Poirot finds her library book about magic, melted wax and a pin, and realises she mistook piercing a voodoo image for murder. Christine made sure her tablets were handy, provoking the guilt-ridden Linda to take them.|$|E
25|$|Improvised {{firearms}} are {{not solely}} {{the province of}} the criminal element. They are also used by insurgents. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, the paliuntod, a type of improvised shotgun, was commonly used by guerrillas and the joint American and Filipino soldiers who remained behind after Douglas MacArthur's withdrawal. Made of two pieces of <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> fit snugly together, the paliuntod was a simple, single shot open-bolt design. The shell was placed in the breech of the barrel, which was then fitted into the larger-diameter receiver. The receiver was capped at the breech end, and had a fixed firing pin placed to strike the primer of the shell. When the barrel was pulled sharply to the rear, the firing pin would strike the primer and fire the gun. These improvised firearms are still in use by both criminals and rebels in the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|Early on, the Germans {{experimented with}} the idea of the Schnorchel (snorkel) from {{captured}} Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The Schnorchel was a retractable <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The Schnorchel also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the Schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Sydney City Council, L'Estrange sought {{permission}} {{for the use of the}} Exhibition grounds in Prince Alfred Park, behind Central railway station for his first attempt. L'Estrange struggled to fill the balloon through the afternoon of 17 November 1878, with gas supplied by the Australian Gas Light Company. By 5pm, the crowd was getting restless and L'Estrange decided to attempt liftoff, despite the balloon not being fully inflated. To lighten the load he removed the car in which he was to sit and instead sat in a loop of rope. The balloon managed only to drag him across the park before clearing the fenceline and landing on a railway truck in the yards of Central railway station next to the park. L'Estrange blamed the failure on having been supplied with [...] "dense" [...] gas and a filling <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> was too narrow and leaky.|$|E
500|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) {{represented}} {{the men and}} women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms—a cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a section of pipe in a trench parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, [...] "Must be able to sit on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up." [...] More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that there was nothing more terrifying than to be in a trench and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the <b>pipe</b> <b>that</b> was being laid in the trench.|$|E
