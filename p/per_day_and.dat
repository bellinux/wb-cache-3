5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> <b>and</b> increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E

5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections.

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{viewed as}} an expensive white elephant, within 10years the station was working at capacity (about 600 trains <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> <b>and</b> the GER was acquiring land {{to the east of}} the station for expansion. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1888 and work started in 1890 on the eastward expansion of Liverpool Street by adding eight new tracks and platforms. This gave the station the most platforms of any London terminus until Victoria station was expanded in 1908.|$|E
5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail train on Sundays.

In 1901 there were four passenger trains <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> one goods train, which increased to five passenger trains per day by 1903.

The station broadcasts 24 hours <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> is completely staffed by volunteers who produce features, interviews and music shows. In 2009, FromeFM commenced a service to stream the broadcasts to mobile phones. In late 2011 FromeFM was granted a broadcast licence and on 16 July 2012 began broadcast on 96.6FM in the Frome area.

5|$|In 1961 U.S. {{intelligence}} analysts estimated that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved {{south on the}} trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity of the trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon estimated that communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> that 195 tons were moving through Laos.|$|E

5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> <b>and</b> Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E

5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske Ceste. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Jankomir - Zaprešić, {{is not included in}} this report, as it is not tolled. However, since the section is a part of Zagreb bypass, it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any other section of the A2 motorway. In 2006, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E
