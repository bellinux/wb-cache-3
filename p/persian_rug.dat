25|$|The Kurds are {{an ethnic}} group, mostly inhabiting the area {{spanning}} adjacent parts of southeastern (Turkey), western (Iran), northern (Iraq), and northern (Syria).

2500|$|In {{his dream}} he was {{shutting}} {{the front door}} with its strawberry windows and lemon windows and windows like white clouds and windows like clear water in a country stream. [...] Two dozen panes squared round the one big pane, colored of fruit wines and gelatins and cool water ices. [...] He remembered his father holding him up as a child. [...] "Look!" [...] And through the green glass the world was emerald, moss, and summer mint. [...] "Look!" [...] The lilac pane made livid grapes of all the passers-by. [...] And at last the strawberry glass perpetually bathed the town in roseate warmth, carpeted the world in pink sunrise, and made the cut lawn seem imported from some <b>Persian</b> <b>rug</b> bazaar. [...] The strawberry window, best of all, cured people of their paleness, warmed the cold rain, and set the blowing, shifting February snows afire.|$|E

2500|$|When Dean Amos died in 1941, the new {{quarters}} {{were still}} unfinished. The Alumnae Association created the Thyrsa W.

Room 1217 was never finished, but after World War II the other rooms on the twelfth floor were completed including room 1201, {{now known as the}} Braun Room. Mrs. A. E. Braun donated the furnishings and floral carved mahogany wood paneling which she had purchased in 1941 from the library of the home of Grant McCargo in the East End of Pittsburgh. The Braun Room was dedicated in 1946 and serves, along with its furniture, {{as an example of a}} modern reproduction of Louis XV design. Original blue carpeting was replaced in 1955 with a <b>Persian</b> <b>rug,</b> named [...] "The Iron Rug of Persia", that was donated by the daughter and son-in-law of A. E. Braun. Restored in 2015, the rug was made for a regional Khan in the northern part of Iran around 1810. Other features of the room include a low bookcase, bordered and topped with classic carving, that was crafted by university carpenters to replace the original fireplace whose inclusion was impractical on the 12th floor, along with two crystal drop chandeliers.|$|E

60|$|Thus speaking, the king, {{with another}} {{magnificent}} bow, {{led the way}} upstairs to a little turret-room, in a deserted part of the palace. Bidding the tradesmen enter, he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things: an old cap or two, a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion, an old broadsword, a shabby old <b>Persian</b> <b>rug,</b> an ivory spy- glass, and other articles.

60|$|It took Philip's breath away. Mildred {{had left}} no letter, nothing but this ruin to mark her anger, {{and he could}} imagine the set face with which she had gone about her work. He {{went back into the}} sitting-room and looked about him. He was so {{astonished}} that he no longer felt angry. He looked curiously at the kitchen-knife and the coal-hammer, which were lying on the table where she had left them. Then his eye caught a large carving-knife in the fireplace which had been broken. It must have taken her a long time to do so much damage. Lawson's portrait of him had been cut cross-ways and gaped hideously. His own drawings had been ripped in pieces; and the photographs, Manet's Olympia and the Odalisque of Ingres, the portrait of Philip IV, had been smashed with great blows of the coal-hammer. There were gashes in the table-cloth and in the curtains and in the two arm-chairs. They were quite ruined. On one wall over the table which Philip used as his desk was the little bit of <b>Persian</b> <b>rug</b> which Cronshaw had given him. Mildred had always hated it.|$|E

6000|$|Prayer concluded, a chamberlain {{whispered the}} Gerad, who arose, {{deposited}} his black coral rosary, took up an inkstand, donned a white [...] "Badan" [...] or sleeveless Arab cloak over his cotton shirt, shuffled off the Dais into his slippers, and disappeared. Presently we were summoned {{to an interview}} with the Amir: this time I was allowed to approach the outer door with covered feet. Entering ceremoniously as before, I was motioned by the Prince to sit near the Gerad, who occupied a <b>Persian</b> <b>rug</b> on the ground {{to the right of the}} throne: my two attendants squatted upon the humbler mats in front and at a greater distance. After sundry inquiries about the changes that had taken place at Aden, the letter was suddenly produced by the Amir, who looked upon it suspiciously and bade me explain its contents. I was then asked by the Gerad whether it was my intention to buy and sell at Harar: the reply was, [...] "We are no buyers nor sellers [38]; we have become your guests to pay our respects to the Amir--whom may Allah preserve!--and that the friendship between the two powers may endure." [...] This appearing satisfactory, I added, in lively remembrance of the proverbial delays of Africa, where two or three months may elapse before a letter is answered or a verbal message delivered, that perhaps the Prince would be pleased to dismiss us soon, as the air of Harar was too dry for me, and my attendants were in danger of the small-pox, then raging in the town. The Amir, who was chary of words, bent towards the Gerad, who briefly ejaculated, [...] "The reply will be vouchsafed:" [...] with this unsatisfactory answer the interview ended.|$|E
60|$|Philip had {{a little}} {{furniture}} which he had gathered as he went along, an arm-chair that he had bought in Paris, and a table, a few drawings, and the small <b>Persian</b> <b>rug</b> which Cronshaw had given him. His uncle had offered a fold-up bed for which, now {{that he no longer}} let his house in August, he had no further use; and by spending another ten pounds Philip bought himself whatever else was essential. He spent ten shillings on putting a corn-coloured paper in the room he was making his parlour; and he hung on the walls a sketch which Lawson had given him of the Quai des Grands Augustins, and the photograph of the Odalisque by Ingres and Manet's Olympia which in Paris had been the objects of his contemplation while he shaved. To remind himself that he too had once been engaged in the practice of art, he put up a charcoal drawing of the young Spaniard Miguel Ajuria: {{it was the best thing}} he had ever done, a nude standing with clenched hands, his feet gripping the floor with a peculiar force, and on his face that air of determination which had been so impressive; and though Philip after the long interval saw very well the defects of his work its associations made him look upon it with tolerance. He wondered what had happened to Miguel. There is nothing so terrible as the pursuit of art by those who have no talent. Perhaps, worn out by exposure, starvation, disease, he had found an end in some hospital, or in an access of despair had sought death in the turbid Seine; but perhaps with his Southern instability he had given up the struggle of his own accord, and now, a clerk in some office in Madrid, turned his fervent rhetoric to politics and bull-fighting.|$|E
60|$|Thinking of Cronshaw, Philip {{remembered the}} <b>Persian</b> <b>rug</b> {{which he had}} given him, telling him that it offered an answer to his {{question}} upon the meaning of life; and suddenly the answer occurred to him: he chuckled: {{now that he had}} it, it was like one of the puzzles which you worry over till you are shown the solution and then cannot imagine how it could ever have escaped you. The answer was obvious. Life had no meaning. On the earth, satellite of a star speeding through space, living things had arisen under the influence of conditions which were part of the planet's history; and as there had been a beginning of life upon it so, under the influence of other conditions, there would be an end: man, no more significant than other forms of life, had come not as the climax of creation but as a physical reaction to the environment. Philip remembered the story of the Eastern King who, desiring to know the history of man, was brought by a sage five hundred volumes; busy with affairs of state, he bade him go and condense it; in twenty years the sage returned and his history now was in no more than fifty volumes, but the King, too old then to read so many ponderous tomes, bade him go and shorten it once more; twenty years passed again and the sage, old and gray, brought a single book in which was the knowledge the King had sought; but the King lay on his death-bed, and he had no time to read even that; and then the sage gave him the history of man in a single line; it was this: he was born, he suffered, and he died. There was no meaning in life, and man by living served no end. It was immaterial whether he was born or not born, whether he lived or ceased to live. Life was insignificant and death without consequence. Philip exulted, as he had exulted in his boyhood when the weight of a belief in God was lifted from his shoulders: {{it seemed to him that}} the last burden of responsibility was taken from him; and for the first time he was utterly free. His insignificance was turned to power, and he felt himself suddenly equal with the cruel fate which had seemed to persecute him; for, if life was meaningless, the world was robbed of its cruelty. What he did or left undone did not matter. Failure was unimportant and success amounted to nothing. He was the most inconsiderate creature in that swarming mass of mankind which for a brief space occupied the surface of the earth; and he was almighty because he had wrenched from chaos the secret of its nothingness. Thoughts came tumbling over one another in Philip's eager fancy, and he took long breaths of joyous satisfaction. He felt inclined to leap and sing. He had not been so happy for months.|$|E
