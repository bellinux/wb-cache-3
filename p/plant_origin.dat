500|$|Chemical defences are {{widespread}} and are mostly based on chemicals of <b>plant</b> <b>origin.</b> In {{many cases the}} plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as protection against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence. These defence mechanisms are effective {{only if they are}} well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females. [...] A Batesian mimic imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism. The common Mormon of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the common rose and the crimson rose. Müllerian mimicry occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; Heliconius butterflies from the Americas are a good example.|$|E

500|$|The ancient Greeks gleaned much {{of their}} {{medicinal}} knowledge from Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hippocrates (460–377 BCE), the [...] "father of medicine" [...] (renowned for the eponymous Hippocratic oath), used about 400 drugs, most being of <b>plant</b> <b>origin.</b> However, the first Greek herbal of any note was written by Diocles of Carystus {{in the fourth century}} BC—although nothing remains of this except its mention in the written record. It was Aristotle’s pupil Theophrastus (371–287 BCE) in his Historia Plantarum, (better known as the Enquiry into Plants) and De Causis Plantarum (On the Causes of Plants) that established the scientific method of careful and critical observation associated with modern botanical science. Based largely on Aristotle’s notes, the Ninth Book of his Enquiry deals specifically with medicinal herbs and their uses including the recommendations of herbalists and druggists of the day, and his plant descriptions often included their natural habitat and geographic distribution. With the formation of the Alexandrian School c. 330 BCE medicine flourished and written herbals of this period included those of the physicians Herophilus, Mantias, Andreas of Karystos, Appolonius Mys, and Nicander. The work of rhizomatist (the rhizomati were the doctors of the day, berated by Theophrastus for their superstition) Krateuas (fl. 110 BCE) is of special note because he initiated the tradition of the illustrated herbal in the first century BCE.|$|E

2500|$|Apples {{appear in}} many {{religious}} traditions, {{often as a}} mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that {{as late as the}} 17th century, the word [...] "apple" [...] was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts. This term may even have extended to plant galls, as they were thought to be of <b>plant</b> <b>origin</b> (see oak apple). [...] For instance, when tomatoes were introduced into Europe, they were called [...] "love apples". [...] In one Old English work, cucumbers are called eorþæppla (lit. [...] "earth-apples'), just as in French, Dutch, Hebrew, Persian [...] and Swiss German as well as several other German dialects, the words for potatoes mean [...] "earth-apples" [...] in English. [...] In some languages, oranges are called [...] "golden apples" [...] or [...] "Chinese apples". Datura is called 'thorn-apple".|$|E

However, the <b>plant</b> <b>origins,</b> efficacies, and traditional uses of these herbal medicines differ.

CAR {{has not been}} used as a traditional herbal medicine, and it cannot be legally used as a food or food ingredient in Korea. However, CAR is cultivated in Korea and imported from China.

40|$|To {{understand}} the biological {{effects of climate}} change, {{it is essential to}} take into account species' evolutionary responses to their changing environments. Ongoing climate change is resulting in species shifting their geographical distribution ranges poleward. We tested whether a successful range expanding plant has rapidly adapted to the regional conditions in its novel range, and whether adaptation could be driven by herbivores. Furthermore, we investigated if enemy release occurred in the newly colonized areas and whether <b>plant</b> <b>origins</b> differed in herbivore resistance. Plants were cloned and reciprocally transplanted between three experimental sites across the range. Effects of herbivores on plant performance were tested by individually caging plants with either open or closed cages. There was no indication of (regional) adaptation to abiotic conditions. Plants originating from the novel range were always larger than plants from the core distribution at all experimental sites, with or without herbivory. Herbivore damage was highest and not lowest at the experimental sites in the novel range, suggesting no release from enemy impact. Genotypes from the core were more damaged compared to genotypes from newly colonized areas at the most northern site in the novel range, which was dominated by generalist slug herbivory. We also detected subtle shifts in chemical defenses between the <b>plant</b> <b>origins.</b> Genotypes from the novel range had more inducible defenses. Our results suggest that plants that are expanding their range with climate change may evolve increased vigor and altered herbivore resistance in their new range, analogous to invasive plants...|$|R
