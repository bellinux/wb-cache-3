40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasma (APP) {{treatment was}} applied as a pretreatment process {{to enhance the}} deposition of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> {{in order to improve}} the final colour properties of digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics. Three <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> <b>containing</b> natural polymers, i. e. (1) sodium alginate, (2) chitosan and (3) sodium alginate-chitosan mixture, were prepared separately. After APP treatment, cotton fabric was padded with different <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> prior to digital ink-jet printing. Experimental results showed that APP pretreatment could increase the colour yield of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabric significantly even after washing. In addition, other properties such as colour fastness to crocking, colour fastness to laundering, outline sharpness and anti-bacterial properties were also improved when compared with those of the control cotton fabric printed without APP pretreatment. However, the influence of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> on the colour properties of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics depended very much on the composition of the <b>printing</b> <b>paste.</b> The scanning electron microscope images evidenced that the APP treatment could enhance the deposition of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> on the cotton fabric surface as proved qualitatively by both the contact angle and wetting time measurement as well as quantitatively by both the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and carboxyl group/nitrogen content analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a fine line seed layer screen <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> with low silver lay down ∼ 30 mg per cell for front side metallization. The contacts of these seed layers are subsequently thickened with light induced plating. Standard screen <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> <b>contain</b> between 2 %- 5 % glass frit while aerosol seed inks contain > 15 % glass frit. The amount of glass needed for best contact formation in fine-line seed layer screen <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> is unknown. In this study, an empirical approach varying the glass content in the seed layer pastes has been chosen. To adjust the glass amount to the low metal content, the glass content was varied at 4 %, 8 % and 12 % for the printed seed layer. 156 x 156 mm 2 p-type silicon solar cells with 90 Ω/sq. emitter were used. Contact fingers < 60 μm wide and 2 μm high were achieved. It was found that an increase in glass content improves the ability to achieve low contact resistance of about 5 mΩcm 2 even under moderate firing conditions. Open circuit voltages of Voc = 632 mV, fill factors of = 77 % and efficiencies up to η = 18 % have been achieved. Additionally, an increase in glass content from 4 % to 8 % improved the maximum contact adhesion after nickel and copper plating from 0. 5 N/mm to 1. 1 N/mm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMassive {{savings in}} silicon solar cell {{production}} {{could be achieved}} by replacing the costly Ag in front side metallization pastes against cheaper metals like Ni or Zn. Regarding the attempt to split the metallization process up into a two step process, first <b>printing</b> a <b>paste</b> <b>containing</b> Ni or Zn instead of Ag for contact formation and second <b>printing</b> a conducting <b>paste</b> <b>containing</b> e. g. Cu, this work is restricted to {{the investigation of the}} contacting <b>paste.</b> Simple <b>pastes</b> <b>containing</b> only Ni or Zn respectively, rudimentary glass frit, organic binder and solvent were tested on wafers with a low resistivity emitter using various fast firing profiles and annealing. Our first attempts using Ag compatible frits have shown {{that it is possible to}} create a contact to Si yet it is significantly worse than with comparable silver pastes. SEM measurements of the contact area after selective metal/glass etch have shown a strong Si etching by the investigated pastes and only insufficient crystallite formation. This explains the reduced open circuit voltage, pseudo fill factor and the high contact resistivity measured on the cells. Our investigations show that it is very hard to exchange Ag by another metal without fundamentally changing the paste formulation and/or the firing conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> for textile ink-jet printing was explored. An orthogonal {{analysis was used}} to determine the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and the effects of different process factors for achieving the best color yield in textile ink-jet printing. With the help of the orthogonal analysis, the importance of different process factors was found to be in the order of (1) the amount of urea used, (2) the amount of chitosan used, (3) the amount of sodium bicarbonate used, and (4) the steaming time. On the basis {{of the results of the}} orthogonal analysis, the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener for the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> were concluded to be 40 mL of chitosan, 10 g of urea, 8 g of sodium bicarbonate, and 5 min of steaming. According to an analysis of the results of different color fastness tests, chitosan could principally work as a pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> thickener. However, the final color yield obtained from chitosan-containing cotton fabrics depended greatly on the stage of the chitosan application. Nevertheless, the color fastness properties and the outline sharpness of the prints of cotton fabric were greatly improved by the chitosan treatment. A two-bath chitosan treatment was developed to separate the chitosan from sodium bicarbonate and urea before it was padded onto the fabric surface to minimize the neutralization effect. On the basis of the results for the highest color yield obtained on the cotton fabric, it was confirmed that the two-bath chitosan treatment was successfully developed. In addition, chitosan could impart higher antibacterial properties with a slight reduction in the tensile strength of the cotton fabric. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
