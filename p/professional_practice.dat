5|$|Action {{was taken}} against Landy's <b>professional</b> <b>practice</b> {{as a result}} of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's {{attention}} in 1984, and they were then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.|$|E

5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey.

Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent <b>Professional</b> <b>Practice,</b> which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E

30|$|In {{answer to}} the main question, we {{conclude}} that we designed {{an example of an}} instructional unit based on <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> which was meaningful for most of the students, also after the completion of the unit. We observed a relevant {{increase in the number of}} times that students made connections between mathematics, statistics, natural science and some <b>professional</b> <b>practices.</b> Although the literature, e.g., Berlin and White [2012], indicates that it is difficult to make the relationship between science and contexts clear to the students, the design on the basis of <b>professional</b> <b>practices,</b> with a focus on meaning from a student’s perspective, seems a promising direction to take. After all, the use of <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> helped the students to make connections in a natural way. Further research is needed to investigate whether and when <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> can help to improve curricular coherence in other situations. This also asks for comparative research. Further research is also needed in order to implement education based on authentic <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> and to better understand the role of the teacher.|$|R
5|$|Georgia Tech {{maintains}} {{close ties}} to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's cooperative education and internship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of <b>Professional</b> <b>Practice</b> (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates the largest and fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged with providing opportunities for students to gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between the occurrence of reported supervision and the <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> of school psychologists. Information provided by more than 1, 700 school psychologists in response to the National Association of School Psychologists: Demographic and <b>Professional</b> <b>Practices</b> Survey 1999 - 2000 School Year - NASP-DPPS 2000 survey were used to create the 1999 - 2000 national database (Curtis, et al., 2000) and served as the basis for secondary analyses in the current study. The NASPDPPS 2000 collected information regarding the demographic characteristics, employment conditions and <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> of school psychologists the United States. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were completed {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> and the reported receipt of supervision, background of the supervisor, and ratio of school psychologists to supervisor. <b>Professional</b> <b>practices</b> did not appear to be significantly related to vary as a function of the occurrence of reported supervision. School psychologists reporting receiving supervision completed significantly more initial psychoeducational assessment and reevaluations than school psychologists who reported not receiving supervision. Initial pyshcoeducational assessment and reevaluations are <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> that can be categorized as special education and direct service delivery model. vii The subsample of school psychologists who reported the occurrence of supervision was examined for the remaining analyses. In addition, supervised school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> did not vary as a function the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s type of educational background (i. e., school psychology or non-school psychology), and level of educational preparation (i. e., doctoral or nondoctoral). Finally, the school psychologists-to-supervisor ratio and nature of the school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> was examined. The remaining correlations were considered non-significant. It was noted that the questions included in the NASP-DPPS 2000 survey did not allow for specific information about the type, topography, or quality of supervision.

30|$|Creating {{coherence}} {{between school}} subjects {{mathematics and science}} and making these school subjects meaningful are still topical challenges. This study investigates how students make meaningful connections between mathematics, statistics, science and applications when they engage in a specially developed unit {{that is based on}} <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> in which mathematical, statistical and scientific knowledge are used. The central question is to what extent <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> can serve as meaningful contexts for senior high school students (aged 16 to 17) to help them make connections between mathematics, statistics, science and <b>professional</b> <b>practices.</b> In order to answer this question, we focused on two sub-questions: (1) ‘How meaningful do students find an instructional unit that is based on <b>professional</b> <b>practices</b> in which statistics plays a role?’ and (2) ‘To what extent are students able to show awareness of the connections between mathematics, statistics, science within the instructional unit and professional practices?’.|$|R
