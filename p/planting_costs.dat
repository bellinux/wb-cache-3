In this more general context, by examining how risks are distributed between storers and growers, results are obtained that differ dramatically from previous models in the literature. When storage is costly, storers may reduce risk by taking long hedging positions, rather than selling inventories short. Contrary to the conventional view (in a tradition beginning with J. M. Keynes and J. R. Hicks), costless storage does not imply downward bias of futures prices (" normal backwardation"). Hedging against the optimally varying <b>planting</b> <b>costs</b> promotes upward price bias (" contango"), while hedging against storage costs to be incurred promotes downward bias.

40|$|Agroforestry {{can help}} prevent land {{degradation}} while allowing continuing use of land to produce crops and livestock. A problem with the evaluation of agroforestry using long-run static models and traditional discounting techniques is that {{the present value of}} the forestry enterprise is generally much lower than that of other production activities. This problem is common with Australian native species which tend to have a high environmental value but a low market value. This paper presents an economic analysis of an agroforestry operation in land prone to degradation and in the presence of positive externalities provided by trees. The value of the land is estimated based on the present value of expected returns in perpetuity under optimal management.

During phosphate mining, clays are washed from phosphate ore, and the resulting slurry is pumped into clay settling areas (CSAs). CSAs comprise about 40 % of the phosphate-mined lands and can take about 15 years to dry and stabilize. While CSAs may be leased for cattle grazing for $ 35 -$ 40 ha- 1 year- 1, they are typically left idle. Fast growing, short-rotation tree plantations provide unique opportunities to sequester carbon on CSAs and, if used as a biofuel, can reduce CO 2 emissions associated with electricity generation.

Recently thousands hectares of SRF {{were established in}} central and southern regions of Italy also (especially in Latium and Molise) due to the promising introduction of new clones resistant to summer water limiting and pest attacks. A poplar SRF plantation was esta­blished in central Italy in order to investigate the influence of site conditions and planting densities/spacings on the growth and yield production of three hybrid poplar clones (AF 2, AF 6 and Monviso). Cuttings of each clone were planted at two different densities/spacings and planting design as: (a) low density = 7 140 cuttings ha- 1 in a single-row design (SR); (b) high density= 10 360 cuttings ha- 1 in a twin-rows design (TR). Growth (both diameter and height) and yield were evaluated after biennial (2006 - 2007) and triennial (2008 - 2010) rotation.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evaluate}} the biological and economic feasibility of restoring high-quality forests on mined land, and to measure carbon sequestration and wood production benefits that would be achieved from forest restoration procedures. In this segment of work, {{our goal was to}} review methods for estimating tree survival, growth, yield and value of forests growing on surface mined land in the eastern coalfields of the USA, and {{to determine the extent to}} which carbon sequestration is influenced by these factors. Public Law 95 - 87, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), mandates that mined land be reclaimed in a fashion that renders the land at least as productive after mining as it was before mining. In the central Appalachian region, where prime farmland and economic development opportunities for mined land are scarce, the most practical land use choices are hayland/pasture, wildlife habitat, or forest land. Since 1977, the majority of mined land has been reclaimed as hayland/pasture or wildlife habitat, which is less expensive to reclaim than forest land, since there are no tree <b>planting</b> <b>costs.</b> As a result, there are now hundreds of thousands of hectares of grasslands and scrublands in various stages of natural succession located throughout otherwise forested mountains in the U.

Procedures were developed for both mixed hardwoods and white pine under a set of low product prices and under a set of high product prices. Economic feasibility is based on land expectation values. Further, our review shows that three types of incentive schemes might be important: (1) lump sum payment at planting (and equivalent series of annual payments); (2) revenue incentive at harvest; and (3) benefit based on carbon volume...|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} mechanizing tree planting in southern Sweden is the biologically good planting results produced by today's tree planting machines. Nevertheless, {{the productivity of}} these tracked excavators with crane-mounted tree planting devices is too low for them to compete economically with manual planting. The objective of this thesis was to investigate concepts for 1) seedling packaging, 2) base machines, 3) planting devices, and 4) seedling carousels that could cost-efficiently increase the productivity of today's planting machines in southern Sweden. Article I analyzed the cost-efficiency of two seedling packaging concepts that decrease {{the time needed to}} reload planting devices with seedlings. The analysis showed, however, that machine-specific seedling packaging was costlier than delivering the seedlings in their cultivation trays, although band-mounted seedlings will probably be the most flexible and cost-efficient packaging system as mechanized planting becomes more common. Article II and III used a discrete-event simulation tool and detailed terrain, machine, and planting device models to simulate the productivity of conceptual two-armed excavators and multi-headed crane-mounted planting devices. Two arms per excavator proved to be an inefficient concept for increasing the productivity of today's planting machines when compared to multi-headed planting devices. Although four planting heads per device was the most productive configuration on easy to moderate terrain, three-headed devices were best at combining high productivity with acceptable silvicultural results on all terrain types. Article IV used a test-rig to study the feasibility of tray-wise seedling reloading on today's most common planting device. Seedling reloading was twice as fast when done tray-wise rather than seedling-wise, and deplugging proved to be a reliable method of extracting seedlings from suitable cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. Overall, this thesis confirms that there is high potential for technical improvements that increase the productivity and lower the <b>planting</b> <b>costs</b> of today's tree planting machines. Such improvements will likely include faster seedling reloading via tray-wise-loaded carousels or band-mounted seedlings, multi-headed planting devices that produce high quality planting spots using adapted soil preparation methods, and sensors that aid the operator in choosing microsites...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 During {{the past}} 20 years, {{repeated}} thinning of a Douglas-fir forest, now 65 years old, has allowed desired limits of basal {{area to be}} maintained. In the process, the understory environment has altered sufficiently to allow Douglas-fir reproduction to establish in abundance. The forest {{is located on the}} east side of the Coast Range, north of Corvallis, Oregon. A study was undertaken to examine growth patterns of understory trees in relation to microenvironment, physical attributes of the tree and time. This information would help determine how long a tree can be maintained at a given level of shade and still function properly. This information also would add to the understanding of modification of growth strategies for survival. To characterize the understory environments of the three thinning intensities (23 to 30, 30 to 37 and 37 to 44 m 2 /ha basal area), measurements were made of plant moisture stress, evaporative demand, air and soil temperature, light and vegetative cover. Light measured at seedling crown best separated the environments; light was found to increase with a decrease in stand basal area, averaging 5, 8 and 12 percent of daily sun for the three thinning levels. Trees, randomly selected, ranged in height from 10 cm to 1. 5 m and in age from 4 to 15 years. Parameters measured included leader growth for the past two seasons, diameter growth, above-ground biomass, height and age. Bud phenology and beginning of cambial activity were also observed. Development of buds in the spring was inversely related to light while renewed cambial activity was directly related to tree size and light. Increments of height and diameter growth were found to increase with light and tree height. Linear differences in average leader and diameter growth and above-ground biomass production were found between the three intensities of thinning, with trees under the heaviest thinning growing most. Average growth is predictable for at least two years. However, rates of leader growth and biomass production, in relation to growth of the previous year and leaf biomass, were not different for individual trees from the three understory environments. A balance of foliar to stem bioniass was maintained by understory trees. Physical characteristics of the tree accounted for most of the variation in growth. As thinning of young Douglas-fir becomes a widespread management practice, it can be expected that, in similar vegetation types, Douglas-fir seedlings will establish naturally in the understory. If the new forest is established at final harvest several years in lag time may be saved; regeneration problems often associated with clear-cutting will be alleviated, <b>planting</b> <b>costs</b> reduced or eliminated, and the forest gene pool maintained...|$|E

A systems trial was established to evaluate factorial management practices for organic production of northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). The practices included: flat and raised planting beds; feather meal and fish emulsion fertilizer applied at 29 and 57 kg·ha⁻¹of nitrogen (N); sawdust mulch, compost topped with sawdust mulch (compost + sawdust), or weed mat; and two cultivars, Duke and Liberty. The planting was established in Oct. 2006 and was certified organic in 2008. Weeds were managed by hand-hoeing or pulling in sawdust and weed mat-mulched plots and a combination of hand-pulling, propane-flaming, and post-emergent, targeted applications of acetic acid or lemon grass oil to any weeds present in the compost + sawdust plots depending on year. Data were recorded on input costs and returns in Year 0 (establishment year) through Year 3. Plants were harvested beginning the second year after planting. <b>Planting</b> <b>costs</b> were $ 741 /ha higher on raised beds than on the flat, but the higher costs were more than offset by an average of 63 % greater yields that improved net returns by as much as $ 2861 /ha.

From half {{a million}} {{hectares}} {{at the turn of}} the century, Philippine mangroves have declined to only 120, 000 ha while fish/shrimp culture ponds have increased to 232, 000 ha. Mangrove replanting programs have thus been popular, from community initiatives (1930 s- 1950 s) to government-sponsored projects (1970 s) to large-scale international development assistance programs (1980 s to present). <b>Planting</b> <b>costs</b> escalated from less than US$ 100 to over $ 500 /ha, with half of the latter amount allocated to administration, supervision and project management. Despite heavy funds for massive rehabilitation of mangrove forests over the last two decades, the long-term survival rates of mangroves are generally low at 10 - 20 %. Poor survival can be mainly traced to two factors: inappropriate species and sites selection. The favored but unsuitable Rhizophora are planted in sandy substrates of exposed coastlines instead of the natural colonizers Avicennia and Sonneratia. More significantly, planting sites are generally in the lower intertidal to subtidal zones where mangroves do not thrive rather than the optimal middle to upper intertidal levels, for a simple reason. Such ideal sites have long been converted to brackishwater fishponds whereas the former are open access areas with no ownership problems. The issue of pond ownership may be complex and difficult, but such should not outweigh ecological requirements: mangroves should be planted where fishponds are, not on seagrass beds and tidal flats where they never existed. This paper reviews eight mangrove initiatives in the Philippines and evaluates the biophysical and institutional factors behind success or failure. The authors recommend specific protocols (among them pushing for a 4 : 1 mangrove to pond ratio recommended for a healthy ecosystem) and wider policy directions to make mangrove rehabilitation in the country more effective.

40|$|From [URL] Plantations of short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) use {{fast-growing tree}} species that coppice, i. e., resprout from the stump, for {{repeated}} harvests that minimize <b>planting</b> <b>costs.</b> Under coppice management, 3 – 5 growth stages (coppices) can be harvested during the SWRC life (rotation or cycle), with each coppice lasting 2 – 10 years. SRWCs can produce wood for biomass, mulch, pulpwood, and other products, while also providing environmental services. For example, SRWC plantations can be irrigated with municipal wastewater or fertilized with treated biosolids or municipal compost, simultaneously increasing biomass production, reducing fertilizer costs, and intercepting nitrates and phosphates to reduce nutrient loading in waterways (Rosenqvist et al. 1997; Labrecque et al. 1997; Aronsson & Perttu 2001; Rockwood et al. 2004; Licht & Isebrands 2005; Langholtz et al. 2005; Mirck et al. 2005). SRWCs {{can also help}} build soil organic matter, recycle nutrients, and maintain vegetative cover to restore ecological functions of mined lands and other degraded lands (Stricker et al. 1993; Bungart & Huttl 2001; Rockwood et al. 2006). SRWCs established on agricultural lands as shelterbelts or buffer zones to protect riparian areas are likely to reduce soil erosion and runoff of agricultural inputs and improve wildlife habitat (Joslin & Schoenholtz 1997; Tolbert & Wright 1998; Thornton et al. 1998). In spite of these benefits, SRWC production is not always economically viable, and evaluating the economics of SRWC production is not easy. Because SRWCs can have multiple coppices per rotation, evaluating the economics of SRWCs {{is more complicated than}} that of conventional forestry. For example, in the evaluation of a pine plantation, the future value of harvested timber is discounted to the year of planting, and <b>planting</b> <b>costs</b> are subtracted to calculate the net present value (NPV) of one harvest rotation. NPV is then used to calculate land expectation value (LEV), i. e. the value of the land assuming the adoption of this forestry practice. However, in the case of SRWC systems, multiple coppices require that the value of every coppice is discounted {{to the beginning of the}} rotation. Furthermore, the costs associated with establishment of each rotation and coppice stage must be discounted differently, and determining the optimum harvest scheduling and replanting age is also more complicated than for conventional forestry. Theory behind economic evaluation and optimization of SRWCs is described by Medema & Lyon (1985), Tait (1986), and Smart & Burgess (2000). Economics of SRWC systems in Florida are evaluated by Langholtz et al. (2005; 2007). The Florida Institute of Phosphate Research (FIPR) has supported research in the development of SRWCs as commercial tree crops on phosphate mined lands in Florida. A product of this research is a SRWC Decision Support System (DSS) that can be used to evaluate the economic viability of SRWC systems. The DSS allows a user to input operational costs, planting densities, stumpage prices and other variables and calculate NPVs, LEV, equal annual equivalent (EAE), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio of a SRWC system. The DSS is in the form of a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet (Figure 1). The DSS allows users to enter variables in yellow cells in the “Inputs” section on the left side of the worksheet and view results in green cells in the “Outputs” section on the right. Input variables include stumpage price, capital cost, and costs of each start-up, rotation, coppice, and year. The user can specify what portion of total biomass is harvested, the number of coppices, and their harvest ages. Financial incentives for renewable energy or other environmental benefits can be incorporated on a per-ton basis in the stumpage price. The DSS uses growth and yield functions developed from measurements of two planting densities of Eucalyptus amplifolia in a field trial of SRWCs on a phosphate mine clay settling area (CSA) near Lakeland, FL. Yields for each growth stage are displayed, and can be modified by adjusting the initial planting density or by adjusting yields under the general parameters. Ranges of values used to assess SRWC production on CSAs are shown in Table 1. Under all possible combinations of the assumptions in Table 1, the profitability of E. amplifolia on CSAs varies widely, with LEVs ranging from -$ 909 to $ 6, 740 acre- 1. Under the base case scenario identified in Table 1, the resulting LEV is $ 308 acre- 1 assuming an interest rate of 10 % and $ 2, 633 acre- 1 assuming an interest rate of 4 %. LEV, EAE, and IRR results of the base case scenario under a range of discount rates and stumpage prices are shown in Table 2. This DSS does not automatically determine optimum harvest ages or the optimum number of stages per cycle, which both require dual optimization of continuous functions. DSS users can either input probable harvest and replanting ages and “zero in” inputs to maximize economic returns, or contact the authors to arrange a customized DSS. The DSS in either Excel or MathCad format could be modified to incorporate alternative growth and yield functions that might be developed for other SRWC species or conditions.

30|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the impact of}} various factors {{affecting}} coal-fired power plant economics of 210  MW subcritical unit situated in north India for electricity generation. In this paper, the cost data of various units of thermal power plant in terms of power output capacity have been fitted using power law {{with the help of}} the data collected from a literature search. To have a realistic estimate of primary components or equipment, it is necessary to include the latest cost of these components. The cost analysis of the plant was carried out on the basis of total capital investment, operating cost and revenue. The total capital investment includes the total direct <b>plant</b> <b>cost</b> and total indirect <b>plant</b> <b>cost.</b> Total direct <b>plant</b> <b>cost</b> involves the cost of equipment (i.e. boiler, steam turbine, condenser, generator and auxiliary equipment including condensate extraction pump, feed water pump, etc.) and other costs associated with piping, electrical, civil works, direct installation cost, auxiliary services, instrumentation and controls, and site preparation. The total indirect <b>plant</b> <b>cost</b> includes the cost of engineering and set-up. The net present value method was adopted for the present study. The work presented in this paper is an endeavour to study the influence of some of the important parameters on the lifetime costs of a coal-fired power plant. For this purpose, parametric study with and without escalation rates for a period of 35  years plant life was evaluated. The results predicted that plant life, interest rate and the escalation rate were observed to be very sensitive on plant economics in comparison to other factors under study.|$|R
