5000|$|The {{basic unit}} of syntaxonomy is the [...] "association", defined by its {{characteristic}} combination of plant taxa, habitat features, physiognomy, biogeographical area, role in ecological succession, historical (e.g. history of use by humans) and paleo-biogeographical relationships. The association is sometimes {{viewed as a}} concrete <b>phytocoenosis</b> (the plant component of a biocoenosis). Associations with floristic and territorial affinities can be grouped in larger ecological conceptual units (i.e. syntaxa) called [...] "alliances".

5000|$|A plant {{community}} (sometimes [...] "phytocoenosis" [...] or [...] "phytocenosis") {{is a collection}} or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each {{plant community}} are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given <b>phytocoenosis.</b> A plant community can be described floristically (the species it contains) and/or physiognomically (its physical structure). For example, a forest (a community of trees) includes the overstory, or upper tree layer of the canopy, {{as well as the}} understory, further subdivided into the shrub layer, herbaceous layer, and sometimes also moss layer. In some cases of complex forests there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. A plant community is similar in concept to a vegetation type, with the former having more of an emphasis on the ecological association of species within it, and the latter on overall appearance by which it is readily recognized by a layperson.|$|E

This endemic plant association of Dobrogea (Tzonev et al. 2005) was described for the first time from the northern Bulgarian Black Sea coast, near the border with Romania (Anna Maria beach).

Phytolittoral, with its clearly marked division into zones, is formed primarily by three associations. The rushes zone is built, first of all, by Phragmitetum australis, then Myriophylletum spicati appears, and the deepest parts are occupied by Lychnothamnetum barbati.

Iako su već istraživane (Rac 1995) u fitocenološkom smislu je izostala cjelovita analiza i usporedba s ostalim područjima Hrvatske. Zajednica je predstavljena s deset snimaka načinjenih u očuvanijim i suvislijim kompleksima na približno 250 ha njezina rasprostranjenja i nadmorskim visinama od 700 do 900 m. Ukupno su registrirane 84 vrste, prosječno po snimci 41, a njihova sociološka pripadnost relativno je složena, što su pokazala i prijašnja istraživanja na Biokovu (Trinajstić 1983, 1987). U odnosu na biokovske sastojine zabilježene su 54 nove vrste, a izostaje 46, među njima Pulmonaria visianii i Lonicera alpigena izdvojene kao svojstvene vrste asocijacije. U sloju drveća dominira Abies alba, podstojno i Ostrya carpinifolia, a u sloju grmlja pridolaze 34 vrste, bujnošću dominiraju one termofilne svojstvene za red Quercetalia pubescentis. U sloju prizemnog rašća prevladavaju mezofilne vrste reda Fagetalia i sveze Aremonio-Fagion i termofilna vrsta Sesleria autumnalis.

In Croatia, {{the forest}} {{community}} Ostryo-Abietetum (Fukarek 1963) Trinajstić 1983 {{was found on}} Mt. Biokovo (Trinajstić 1983, 1987) and on Kapela (Rac et Lovrić 1987, Rac 1995). Only five relevés {{have been published in}} scientific literature. Since the floral composition has not been analyzed and compared in more detail, the studied <b>phytocoenosis</b> is insufficiently known. Phytocoenological research was conducted following the classical principles of the Braun-Blanquet School (1964). Forests of fir with hop hornbeam were presented on the basis of ten relevés from the Vinodol area and five from Biokovo. Plant nomenclature was adjusted according to Ehrendorfer (1973), while plant-sociological affiliation and biological form of the species were based on the work generally used for this purpose. Phytocoenological research into the stands of the community Ostryo-Abietetum in Vinodol showed syntaxonomic affiliation in the sense of Marinček et al. (1993) in accordance with international syntaxonomic rules (Weber et al. 2000). A total of 84 species were registered in ten phytocoenological relevés. On average, there were 41 species per relevé. Abies alba prevails in the dominant layer, Ostrya carpinifolia in the intermediate layer and thermophilic species of the order Quercetalia pubescentis in the shrub layer. The layer of herbaceous vegetation is dominated by the species of the order Fagetalia and the alliance Aremonio-Fagion and by the thermophilic species Sesleria autumnalis. The forest <b>phytocoenosis</b> of fir with hop hornbeam occurs over approximately 250 ha in the study area (Racić 2001). Compared to past phytocoenological relevés of this community in Croatia, 54 new species have been registered. Those of mesophilic character and beech forests prevail, which completes the knowledge of the <b>phytocoenosis</b> Ostryo-Abietetum. In relation to the stands on Biokovo, 46 species of predominantly thermophilic character are absent, including Lonicera alpigena and Pulmonaria visianii, which were initially classified as characteristic species of the association. The species Hepatica nobilis, with frequent presence of sessile oak in the tree layer, occurs abundantly in Vinodol stands.
