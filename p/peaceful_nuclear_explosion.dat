40|$|Magnitude-yield {{calibration}} of Northern Eurasia can {{be improved}} by using the large chemical and <b>Peaceful</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Explosion</b> (PNEs) seismic datasets acquired by the Soviet Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) program. Currently, we are using inversion and numerical modeling to analyze the coda amplitude parameters and P-wave travel times from numerous DSS explosions, which {{would lead to a}} detailed empirical mapping of seismic properties within northern Eurasia. In this report, PNE Lg coda amplitudes from seven profiles are inverted to produce maps of the following new coda parameters: 1) frequency-dependent scattering intensities, 2) geometrical parameter (γ), and 3) effective quality (Qe). The γ and frequency-independent Qe parameters replace the traditional frequency-dependent Q(f) = Q 0 (f/f 0) η parameterization and provide stability, independence of assumptions of a background model, and convenience in interpretation. As we have shown before, parameter γ also yields itself to independent numerical waveform modeling, correlates with crustal tectonic types, and may be a portable attribute valuable for coda regionalization. All three maps show notable correlations with regional tectonics and with recently derived maps of phase amplitude ratios and Lg Q...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Frequency-dependent coda {{attenuation}} {{values are}} often reported; how-ever, such measurements usually {{depend on the}} types of the Qf models employed. We use numerical modeling of <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosion</b> (PNE) coda at far-regional to teleseismic distances to compare two such models, namely, the conventional frequency-dependent quality factor (Qcodaf Q 0 fη) and frequency-independent coda attenuation (Qc) with geometrical attenuation (γ). The results favor strongly the γ; Qc model and illustrate the mechanisms leading to apparent Qcodaf depen-dencies. Tests for variations of the crustal velocity structures show that the values of γ are stable and related to lithospheric structural types, and the inverted Qc-values can be systematically mapped into the true S-wave attenuation factors within the crust. Modeling also shows that γ could increase in areas where relatively thin attenuating layers are present within the crust; such areas could likely be related to younger and active tectonics. By contrast, when interpreted by using the traditional Q 0; η ap-proach, the synthetic coda shows a strong and spurious frequency dependence with η ≈ 0 : 5, which is also similar to the observations. Observed Lg coda from two PNEs located in different areas in Russia show sim-ilar values of γ ≈ 0 : 75 × 102 sec 1, which are also remarkably close to the inde-pendent numerical predictions. At the same time, coda Qc-values vary strongly, from 850 in the East-European platform to 2500 within the Siberian Craton. This suggests that parameters γ and Qc could provide stable and transportable discriminants for differentiating between the lithospheric tectonic types and ages and also for seismic coda regionalization in nuclear test monitoring research...|$|E

40|$|India {{entered the}} nuclear club {{with a bang}} in may 1974. Prior to this there had been {{considerable}} debate in the country on whether India should go nuclear and whether she could afford to do so. Now that India is set on the nuclear path, much of the debate is theoretical Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has of course stated that India {{does not intend to}} make nuclear weapons of destruction. But nuclear technology and nuclear explosions, whether for peaceful or destructive purposes cost of the same. If the question whether India can effort it at all is relevant now, it is so {{only to the extent that}} we are discussing the pace of development of nuclear technology. The more significant question especially since India still claims that its nuclear programme is strictly for peaceful purpose is: Is it in India's security interest to renounce the use of nuclear technology for building nuclear weapons. What posture we adopt towards a nuclear weapons. Programme will of course depend on our threat perception. The history of India's nuclear technological development begins directly after independence with Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru pressed hard for the development of civilian nuclear facilities in the name of scientific progress and domestic energy production. This was mainly driven by his desire to develop a Commission in 1947 to develop these civilian technologies by the 1960 's India had fuel and reprocessing facilities that resulted in weapons- ready plutonium. But all official considerations of nuclear energy research was still focused on civilian technologies. Any talk of nuclear weapons technology did not begin until Indira Gandhi's premiership in the 1970 's the research and debates leading to India are <b>peaceful.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>explosion</b> (PNE) did not begin until 1972, shortly after India's third war with Pakistan, even then public discourse on nuclear weapons was minimal...|$|E

Tests for variations of the crustal velocity structures show that the values of ¦Ã are stable and related to lithospheric structural types, and the inverted Qe values can be systematically mapped into the true Swave attenuation factors within the crust. Modeling also shows that ¦Ã could increase in areas where relatively thin attenuating layers are present within the crust; such areas could likely be related to younger and active tectonics.
