40|$|We study cosmological {{solutions}} {{in the context}} of four-dimensional low energy heterotic M theory with moving bulk branes. First we present nontrivial, analytic axion solutions generated by new symmetries of the full <b>potential-free</b> action, and we discuss their relation to "triple axion" solutions found in Pre-Big-Bang cosmologies. Next we consider the presence of a nonperturbative superpotential with and without a background perfect fluid. In the absence of a fluid the dilaton and the T-modulus go to the <b>potential-free</b> solutions at late time, while the moving brane tries to avoid colliding with the boundary and stabilize within the bulk. When the fluid is included the dynamics of the fields change, and we study their behavior both numerically and analytically.

40|$|We study cosmological {{solutions}} {{in the context}} of 4 -dimensional low energy Heterotic M-theory with moving bulk branes. In particular we present non-trivial, analytic axion solutions generated by new symmetries of the full <b>potential-free</b> action which are similar to 'triple axion' solutions found in Pre-Big-Bang (PBB) cosmologies. We also consider the presence of a non-perturbative superpotential, for which we find cosmological solutions with and without a background perfect fluid. In the absence of a fluid the dilaton and the T-modulus go to the <b>potential-free</b> solutions at late time, while the moving brane tries to avoid colliding with the boundary and stabilize within the bulk. When the fluid is included, we find that the real parts of the fields track its behaviour and that the moving brane gets stabilized at the middle point between the boundaries. In this latter case we can make analytic approximations for the evolution of the fields whether or not axions are included and we consider the possibility of this set up being a realization of the quintessential scenario.

40|$|DE 19860474 A UPAB: 20000818 NOVELTY - Bipolar pulsed {{magnetron}} {{sputter coating}} uses program controlled switching of selected targets {{connected to a}} <b>potential-free</b> bipolar current supply. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Substrates are coated by bipolar pulsed magnetron sputtering in the 10 - 100 kHz frequency range using three or more targets facing the substrates so the substrates {{are located in the}} high plasma density region during coating. Two or more of the targets are connected to a <b>potential-free</b> bipolar current supply and subjected to bipolar sputtering for a predetermined time, the choice of targets connected to this supply being altered according to a preset program during the coating operation. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for equipment for carrying out the above process. USE - For producing decorative or functional layers on optical, electrical or mechanical components or tools (claimed), e. g. to produce electrically insulating, friction reducing or wear protective layers. ADVANTAGE - The process provides stable operation even when using widely spaced magnetron sources and produces increased plasma activation of the substrates to form high quality coatings having an improved structure, e. g. high density, high crystallinity and high isotropy of crystal growth...|$|E

40|$|An exact {{analytical}} {{expression for}} the effective diffusion coefficient of an overdamped Brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential is derived for arbitrary potentials and arbitrary {{strengths of the}} thermal noise. Near the critical tilt (threshold of deterministic running solutions) a scaling behavior for weak thermal noise is revealed and various universality classes are identified. In comparison with the bare (<b>potential-free)</b> thermal diffusion, the effective diffusion coefficient in a critically tilted periodic potential may be, in principle, arbitrarily enhanced. For a realistic experimental setup, an enhancement by 14 orders of magnitude is predicted so that thermal diffusion should be observable on a macroscopic scale at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|We found a {{new kind}} of soliton {{solutions}} for the 5 -parameter family of the <b>potential-free</b> Stenflo-Sabatier-Doebner-Goldin nonlinear modifications of the Schrödinger equation. In contradistinction to the "usual" solitons like [b(x-kt) ]^-a[i(kx-ft) ], the new Finite-Length Solitons (FLS) are nonanalytical functions with continuous first derivatives, which are different from zero only inside some finite regions of space. The simplest one-dimensional example is the function which is equal to cos[g(x-kt) ]^ 1 +d[i(kx-ft) ] (with d> 0) for |x-kt|π/(2 g). The FLS exist even {{in the case of a}} weak nonlinearity, whereas the "usual" solitons exist provided the nonlinearity parameters surpass some critical values. Comment: 11 pages, LaTe...|$|E

Vast improvements of light trapping are already achieved leading to weighted reflection values below 8 % without dielectric anti-reflection coating.

40|$|First order {{rotational}} perturbations of {{the flat}} Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric are considered {{in the framework of}} four dimensional Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) string cosmological models coupled with dilaton and axion fields. The decay rate of rotation depends mainly upon the dilaton field potential U. The equation for rotation imposes strong limitations upon the functional form of U, restricting the allowed potentials to two: the trivial case U= 0 and a generalized exponential type potential. In these two models the metric rotation function can be obtained in an exact analytic form in both Einstein and string frames. In the <b>potential-free</b> case the decay of rotational perturbations is governed by an arbitrary function of time while {{in the presence of a}} potential the rotation tends rapidly to zero in both Einstein and string frames.

40|$|A {{heatable}} probe {{has been}} constructed for in-situ measurement of plasma parameters in reactive plasma coating processes. The PC controlled langmuir probe electronics allows a recording rate for {{a characteristic of}} 50 ms/scan and a <b>potential-free</b> measuring of the potential difference plasma-earth up to 1000 V. The probe characteristic is smoothed by a polynom filter, and from the polynom coefficients {{the first and second}} differentiation of the characteristic are obtained. The software is written in Lab-VIEW"R for the windows surface of Microsoft. Using this probe large differences in plasma densities and electron densities were found comparing two commercial magnetron sputter units and an arc evaporation unit. The plasma parameters can be adjusted within a wide range by changing the anode geometry and the strength and direction of the magnetic field.

40|$|We {{present a}} case demonstrating the {{connection}} between supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY [...] QM), reflectionless scattering, and soliton solutions of integrable partial differential equations. We show {{that the members of}} a class of reflectionless Hamiltonians, namely, Akulin's Hamiltonians, are connected via supersymmetric chains to a <b>potential-free</b> Hamiltonian, explaining their reflectionless nature. While the reflectionless property in question has been mentioned in the literature for over two decades, the enabling algebraic mechanism was previously unknown. Our results indicate that the multi-solition solutions of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schrödinger equations can be systematically generated via the supersymmetric chains connecting Akulin's Hamiltonians. Our findings also explain a well-known but little-understood effect in laser physics: when a two-level atom, initially in the ground state, is subjected to a laser pulse of the form V(t) = (nħ/τ) /(t/τ), with n being an integer and τ being the pulse duration, it remains in the ground state after the pulse has been applied, for any choice of the laser detuning.

40|$|The {{target of}} this master's thesis is to describe, design and {{construct}} an extra low voltage three-phase DC/AC inverter for the motor AXI 5345 / 18, which {{will work in}} EC motor mode. The inverter is supplied by DC source 24 V. In order to save place, the wiring is designed on three separated printed board circuits. These are connected together by connectors for ribbon cables.

40|$|We {{solved the}} Schrödinger {{equation}} for a particle {{in a uniform}} magnetic field in the n -dimensional torus. We obtained {{a complete set of}} solutions for a broad class of problems; the torus T^n = ^n / Λ is defined as a quotient of the Euclidean space ^n by an arbitrary n -dimensional lattice Λ. The lattice is not necessary either cubic or rectangular. The magnetic field is also arbitrary. However, we restrict ourselves within <b>potential-free</b> problems; the Schrödinger operator is assumed to be the Laplace operator defined with the covariant derivative. We defined an algebra that characterizes the symmetry of the Laplacian and named it the magnetic algebra. We proved that the space of functions on which the Laplacian acts is an irreducible representation space of the magnetic algebra. In this sense the magnetic algebra completely characterizes the quantum mechanics in the magnetic torus. We developed a new method for Fourier analysis for the magnetic torus and used it to solve the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian. All the eigenfunctions are given in explicit forms...|$|E
40|$|Glow {{discharge}} pretreatment of substrate {{surfaces in}} vacuum, prior to vacuum coating, involves maintaining a low pressure glow discharge between the substrate and a counter-electrode {{made of the}} coating material or {{one or more of}} its components, while periodically alternating the substrate as the cathode or anode of the glow discharge at a polarity alternation frequency of 1 Hz to 1000 kHz. The pulse lengths and/or the discharge voltage are adjusted in both polarities. Also claimed is an appts. for carrying out the above process, in which the substrate (2) and the counter-electrode (6) are mounted in <b>potential-free</b> manner in an evacuable vessel, and are connected to an alternating voltage generator (8). USE - For pretreating electrically conductive or insulating substrate surfaces, e. g. steel, hard metal or ceramic tools or polymer surfaces, prior to applying an adherent coating by vacuum coating.

40|$|We study {{viscoelastic}} subdiffusion in bistable and periodic potentials {{within the}} Generalized Langevin Equation approach. Our results justify the (ultra) slow fluctuating rate {{view of the}} corresponding bistable non-Markovian dynamics which displays bursting and anti-correlation of the residence times in two potential wells. The transition kinetics is asymptotically stretched-exponential when the potential barrier V_ 0 several times exceeds thermal energy k_BT (V_ 0 ∼ 2 - 10 k_BT) and it cannot be described by the non-Markovian rate theory (NMRT). The well-known NMRT result approximates, however, ever better with the increasing barrier height, the most probable logarithm of the residence times. Moreover, the rate description is gradually restored when the barrier height exceeds a fuzzy borderline which depends on the power law exponent of free subdiffusion α. Such a <b>potential-free</b> subdiffusion is ergodic. Surprisingly, in periodic potentials it is not sensitive to the barrier height in the long time asymptotic limit. However, the transient to this asymptotic regime is extremally slow and it does profoundly depend on the barrier height. The time-scale of such subdiffusion can exceed the mean residence time in a potential well, or in a finite spatial domain by many orders of magnitude. All these features are in sharp contrast with an alternative subdiffusion mechanism involving jumps among traps with the divergent mean residence time in these traps...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the sequel of evolving fuzzy rule-based (FRB) classifier eClass, {{which we call}} simplified evolving classifier, simpl_eClass. Similarly to eClass, simpl_eClass comprises of two different classifiers, namely zero and first order (simpl_eClass 0 and simpl_eClass 1). The two classifiers differ {{from each other in}} terms of the consequent part of the fuzzy rules, and the classification strategy used. The design of simpl_eClass is based on the density increment principle introduced recently in so called simpl_eTS+ approach. The rule learning in simpl_eClass does not involve computation of potential values that allows it to attain computationally much less expensive model update phase compared to eClass. As compared to other FRB classifiers, it retains all the advantages of eClass, such as being on-line and evolving, having zero and first order. In comparison with other non-fuzzy classifiers it has the advantage of interpretability and transparency (especially zero order type). The goals of this paper are to demonstrate the applicability of simpl_eTS+ to classification task, and to empirically show that the simplification of eClass to simpl_eClass by using <b>potential-free</b> approach does not compromise the accuracy of the classifiers. In order to attain the goals, the classifiers are tested by performing several experiments using benchmark data sets. The simpl_eClass 1 classifier is also applied to the real-life problem of on-line scene categorization for low-resource devices benefiting from its low computational cost. The results obtained from the experiments endorse that simpl_eClass achieves the accuracy of eClass while simplifying rule learning process...|$|E
40|$|For aerosol Brownian {{coagulation}} in {{the transition}} regime of Knudsen number {{in the presence of}} an interparticle potential, the Fokker-Planck equation is solved by using the Grad's 13 -moment method. The mass and energy accommodation coefficients that are used to describe the results of collisional processes are appropriately defined and interfaced with the Fokker-Planck moment equations. Analytical and numerical solutions of the number and energy flux profiles for the <b>potential-free,</b> power-law potential, van der Waals potential, and Coulombic potential situations are obtained. The results are in good agreement with those predicted by the flux-matching method of Fuchs. The present fundamental approach, therefore, provides theoretical support of the coagulation coefficient expression obtained by the empirical flux-matching method. For coagulation between ultrafine particles, we solved the BGK equation for large but finite Knudsen number situations by taking into account the van der Waals potential and/or the Coulombic/image potential. We present closed form best-fit equations for data calculated from the theory. The conditions where either Coulombic, image, or van der Waals forces predominate are determined. A new expression of the image potential between a charged particle and an uncharged particle is obtained. We calculate the coagulation rate between the particles and are able to determine the enhancement of coagulation rate due to the interparticle potential in all size regimes. An aerosol coagulation process is applied to the formation of aerosol particles in the semiconductor thin film preparation. In the CVD reactor, we consider simultaneous aerosol coagulation, diffusion, and generation of aerosol monomers by chemical reaction. The mass and number concentration of monomers and particles are computed as functions of temperature, pressure, input vapor concentration, and position in the reactor. The thin film growth rate can be subsequently evaluated. It is found that under certain circumstances, aerosol particle generation may significantly suppress the film growth due to monomers. The formulation of the homogeneous nucleation free energy change of aerosol clusters is reexamined. It is shown that the inclusion of the cluster translational and rotational motion in the cluster formation free energy change is appropriate. The classical and statistical thermodynamics are shown to be consistent. The cell model of liquids of statistical mechanics is employed to reevaluate the free energy change of cluster formation in aerosol nucleation. We provide a new molecular level theory that is applicable in the larger cluster size range where liquid-like properties begin to emerge and a cluster surface is present. The microcluster surface tension can be appropriately defined. The cluster rotational contribution to the free energy change, though it must be accounted for, is shown to be insignificant for liquid-like clusters...|$|E
