5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1935, Long {{undertook}} a national speaking tour and regular radio appearances, attracting large crowds and increasing his stature. At a rally of the Farmers Holiday Association in Des Moines, Long was introduced by Reno and asked the crowd: [...] "Do {{you believe in the}} redistribution of wealth?", receiving a huge [...] "Yes!" [...] as a response. After the rally, Long was heard to say that: [...] "I could take this state like a whirlwind". At a well attended Long rally in Philadelphia, a former mayor told the press [...] "There are 250,000 Long votes" [...] in this city. The Roosevelt administration was worried by Long's growing popularity and on 4 March 1935, General Hugh S. Johnson in a radio speech denounced Long and Coughlin as this [...] "great Louisiana demagogue and this political padre", going on to accuse the duo of speaking [...] "with nothing of learning, knowledge nor experience to lead us through a labyrinth that has perplexed the minds of men since the beginning of time... These two men are raging up and down this land preaching not construction, but destruction-not reform, but revolution!". The Democratic National Committee chairman James Farley commissioned a secret poll in early 1935 [...] "to find out if Huey's sales talks for his 'share the wealth' program were attracting many customers... We kept a careful eye on what Huey and his political allies... were attempting to do". Farley's poll revealed that if Long ran on a third party ticket, he would win about 4 million votes (about 10% of the electorate). In a memo to Roosevelt, Farley wrote: [...] "It was easy to conceive of a situation whereby Long by polling more than 3,000,000 votes, might have {{the balance of power in}} the 1936 election. For example, the poll indicated that he would command upwards of 100,000 votes in New York State, a <b>pivotal</b> <b>state</b> in any national election and a vote of that size could easily mean the difference between victory and defeat... That number of votes would mostly come from our side and the result might spell disaster". In response, Roosevelt in a letter to his friend, William E. Dodd who was serving as American ambassador in Berlin wrote: [...] "Long plans to be a candidate of the Hitler type for the presidency in 1936. He thinks he will have a hundred votes at the Democratic convention. Then he will set up as an independent with Southern and mid-western Progressives... Thus he hopes to defeat the Democratic Party and put in a reactionary Republican. That would bring the country to such a state by 1940 that Long thinks he would be made dictator. There are in fact some Southerners looking that way, and some Progressives drifting that way... Thus it is an ominous situation".|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} set out {{to develop}} a deeper theoretical component to the emerging discipline of hydropolitics by studying the political aspects of institutional developments in the water sector. The focal point was the four international river basins that are shared between South Africa and six of its neighbouring states. The study found that {{while there is a}} lot of evidence for the securitization of water resource management in South Africa’s international river basins, there are also a number of examples of regimes. The creation of these regimes was driven primarily by threat perceptions relating to state security, mostly during the period of apartheid and the Cold War. These regimes were mostly robust and served as a valuable instrument for the de-escalation of conflict, which was primarily of a high politics nature. Examples of both plus-sum and zero-sum outcomes have been isolated. Plus-sum outcomes arose when the non-hegemonic state chose to view the offer of a regime in terms of national self-interest with four examples of this condition. In all four cases the non-hegemonic state benefited from cooperation with South Africa. Zero-sum outcomes arose when the non-hegemonic state chose to view the offer of a regime in terms of ideology with two examples of this condition. In both cases the non-hegemonic state did not benefit and was sidelined to the extent that they became marginalized and worse off than before. In all cases the hegemonic state benefited from the regime. The research consequently showed that a hydropolitical complex is emerging in Southern Africa, clustered around two international river basins, the Orange and Limpopo, which have been defined as pivotal basins. Both of these basins have reached the limit of their readily available water resources and future development is not possible on any great scale. Four of the most economically developed states in Southern Africa (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa) are riparians on these two international river basins, and have been defined as pivotal states. Other less developed countries that share any international river basin with a <b>pivotal</b> <b>state</b> have been defined as an impacted state, because their own development aspirations have been capped through this association. Any international river basin that has at least one of the pivotal states in it has been defined an impacted basin. Finally, this research showed that regimes create a plus-sum outcome in closed international river basins because they reduce the levels of uncertainty and institutionalize the conflict potential. As such regimes are a useful instrument with which to regulate inter-state behavior, leading over time to the development of institutions consisting of rules and procedures.

40|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the importance of}} Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in both social and forest resource management terms, one of CIFOR's major projects is on "Sustainable Use and Development of Non-Timber Forest Products ". The project is aiming at a world level comparison of NTFPs-based forest use, and currently has field sites in seven countries, including Indonesia. This paper reports on a study on the interaction between land-use changes and forest management strategies at the household level, and how this interaction is shaped by ecological, physical, socio-economic and other exogenous factors (e. g., policies). Field sites in Indonesia are in Pasir and Mahakam in East Kalimantan, and the West of Lake Toba in North Sumatra. We are going to approach the problem by combining various data collection and data analysis tools. Data collection tools include remote sensing, household surveys, ecological surveys, market studies, gender and diversity studies. Analytical tools include GIS, statistical analysis, spatial modeling, land-use decision modeling, and gender and diversity analysis. The general framework of the study covers three scales: landscape, local and household. In the landscape level, time series of satellite images classified based on vegetation cover together with other data such as road, eleva-tion, soil type, administrative boundaries and population are used to obtain a transition probability matrix (TPM). The area with major changes is taken as local scale. Depending {{on the nature of the}} changes (e. g. road, plantation, etc.), we will apply optimization and econometric models based on data from the household studies. The overall model also allows for making scenarios to predict or outline possible future changes. We will study the impact of land-use change on biodiversity through the landscape diversity, complexity and heterogeneity. For preliminary study, we started with the simplest TPM, namely Markov TPM. A temporal Markov TPH was obtained from post-classification images of two Landsat TH images of North Sumatra taken in 1993 and 1996. Projection using this temporal Markov TPH shows the tendency of decreasing primary forest area, and increasing other types of vegetation cover over time. The spatial Markov TPM shows that it is very rare for primary forest to be directly adjacent to barren areas. More common a gradient between primary forest, secondary forest and other types of scrubs and crops is observed. Secondary forest's role as a <b>pivotal</b> <b>state,</b> both temporally and spatially, can clearly be seen m the TPM. The preliminary analysis of the household data in two villages in North Sumatra shows that land-use changes are associated with new economic opportunities. This has reduced the time spent on the management of benzoin gardens, but it has not lead to more drastic land-use changes such as abandoning the gardens completely. Rather they are kept as a reserve for possible future utilization. This has an influence on the resilience of the forest systems of the region and contributes to explain the rates and types of change observed...|$|E

Given the growing interaction between national and regional actors in the decision making of regional security governance, a state-centric approach is insufficient as a framework of analysis. Security governance covers threats that have to do with potential or actual violence: terrorism, war and counter insurgency, ethnic cleansing, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, massive human rights violence, and organised crime, as well as issues that have to do with natural disasters: famines, pandemics, cyber warfare, and even financial crises...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{management}} of Barrett's esophagus (BE), particularly high grade dysplasia (HGD), {{is an area}} of much debate and controversy. Surgical esophagectomy, intensive endoscopic surveillance and mucosal ablative techniques, especially photodynamic therapy (PDT), have been proposed as possible management strategies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the health related quality of life associated with Barrett's esophagus and many of the <b>pivotal</b> health <b>states</b> associated with Barrett's HGD management. Methods 20 patients with Barrett's esophagus were enrolled in a pilot survey study at a large urban hospital. The utility of Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia (current health state) as well as various health states associated with HGD management (hypothetical states as the subject did not have HGD) were measured using a validated health utility instrument (Paper Standard Gamble). These specific health states were chosen for the study because they are considered pivotal in Barrett's HGD decision making. Information regarding Barrett's HGD was presented to the subject in a standardized format that was designed to be easily comprehendible. Results The average utility scores (0 – 1 with 0 = death and 1 = perfect health) for the various Barrett's esophagus associated states were: BE without dysplasia- 0. 95; Post-esophagectomy for HGD with dysphagia- 0. 92; Post-PDT for HGD with recurrence uncertainty- 0. 93; Post-PDT for HGD with recurrence uncertainty and dysphagia- 0. 91; Intensive endoscopic surveillance for HGD- 0. 90. Conclusion We present the scores for utilities associated with Barrett's esophagus as well as various states associated with the {{management of}} HGD.

Relying upon John Maynard Keynes’s crisis theory, that slumps were always possible in a market system left to itself, and that there was therefore a continuous role for government in ensuring that they did not happen, I look at the case of Japan’s state regime shift which two previous financial crises have enabled.

I focus on state and Tokyo’s urban policies which played a <b>pivotal</b> role in <b>state</b> regime shift, and assess why state and urban policies have failed to resolve Japan’s contribution to global imbalances and avoidance of further crises. I conclude that state and urban policy analysis in the past few decades cannot be dissociated from financial crises, and that Japan’s state regime shift is a crisis outcome rooted in Japan’s political economy—one of many variations of market economies in the postcrisis multilateral global order. ...|$|R

Through the case study of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee – {{one of the largest and}} most well-known evangelical congregations in the country – the thesis situates evangelicals’ post-war political realignment in the local context. It is argued that from the beginning of the 1980 s a new form of political culture had started to exist at Bellevue which mirrored that of Republican Party and Christian Right conservatism; this, when extended to similar evangelical congregations elsewhere in the South of the country, helps explain the unprecedented political and electoral loyalty towards the GOP that conservative evangelicals had started to display during the Regan presidency and beyond. However, rather than being a symptom of direct political mobilisation or partisan endorsement from the pulpit – as conventional explanations often assume – it is demonstrated that Bellevue’s Republican-friendly political culture actually emerged indirectly, through a combination of the church’s theology and its connections with urban change in Memphis during desegregation...|$|R
40|$|Premise of research. Dust {{particles}} and pollen grains {{are similar in}} size. Dust deposition might therefore influence the pollination and reproduction of flowering plants. Little is known about such effects, however, despite more general interest in ecological effects of dust. Methodology. We used observational and experimental methods to explore whether dust generated by traffic on unpaved roads affects the amounts of pollen received and numbers of seeds produced by four species of native wildflowers in the western United <b>States.</b> <b>Pivotal</b> results. Flowers of Nuttall's larkspur (Delphinium nuttallianum), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), Lewis flax (Linumlewisii), and sulphur paintbrush (Castilleja sulphurea) growing 1 - 2 mfrom a road received substantially more dust and less pollen than those growing 40 - 50 m away. We observed the same pattern when we transplanted individuals {{of the first two}} species into pots and placed pots near to compared with far from a road. Experimental "hand dusting" of scarlet gilia and Lewis flax plants also reduced stigma pollen loads to a degree that resembled the average effect of road proximity for those species. On the other hand, numbers of seeds per flower ("seed set") did not vary consistently for any species as a function of road proximity or hand-dusting treatment. Conclusions. Several mechanisms might contribute to the different effects of dust on pollen loads and seed set. Wediscuss four possible mechanisms, which we refer to as pollen excess, pollen quality, resource limitation, and compensatory herbivory. These mechanisms suggest avenues for further study of dust, pollination, and plant reproduction with this and other systems...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} define the current {{anatomic}} barriers to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) stent grafting to guide future device development. MethodsAll patients presenting with TAA requiring repair were evaluated for endovascular repair during a 4 -year period (2000 to 2004). The TAAs evaluated were those beginning distal to the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and ending proximal to the celiac artery. All patients in whom endovascular repair was indicated underwent cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography angiography and three-dimensional modeling of their thoracic and abdominal arterial anatomy. Patients were evaluated for endovascular TAA repair {{in the context of}} the inclusion/exclusion criteria of <b>pivotal</b> United <b>States</b> Food and Drug Administration trials of the Gore TAG and Medtronic Talent devices. Anatomic requirements included ≥ 20 mm of suitable proximal and distal neck length, and proximal and distal neck diameters of 20 to 42 mm. These trials allowed the use of femoral or iliac access, including the use of conduits, and permitted stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) after preliminary carotid–subclavian bypass. Patients rejected for medical reasons or who died during evaluation were not included in the review. ResultsA total of 126 patients (73 men, 53 women) with TAA located between the LCCA and celiac artery were screened for endovascular repair, and 33 (26 %) were rejected for anatomic reasons. The remaining 93 patients underwent endografting (59 Talent, 34 TAG). Rejection was not significantly different by gender (16 / 73 men, 17 / 53 women, P =. 22, NS). Most patients (28 / 33) were rejected for more than one criterion. Hostile proximal neck characteristics were the most prevalent reason for disqualification, despite the ability to cover the LSA to extend the proximal seal zone. Many of these patients (16 / 28) also had distal neck anatomy unsuitable for grafting. Overall, 19 patients had hostile distal necks. Difficulties with vascular access (diseased or tortuous iliac arteries, or a small caliber aorta) that could not be overcome even by use of conduits occurred in a significant fraction of patients (10 / 33). ConclusionsMost patients with a TAA located between the LCCA and the celiac artery can be treated by endovascular repair. Patients excluded from TAA stent graft protocols for anatomic reasons most commonly have hostile proximal neck features that preclude endovascular repair with currently available devices. Transposition of arch vessels to facilitate greater use of existing stent grafts or development of new stent graft designs are needed to expand the applicability of TAA endovascular repair...|$|R
