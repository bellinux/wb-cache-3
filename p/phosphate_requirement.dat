40|$|Under {{exchange}} conditions (no net {{increase in}} calcium), erythrocytes incubated in isoosmotic phosphate-buffered saline have an exchangeable calcium pool comprising about 10 % {{of the total}} erythrocyte calcium. This pool reaches exchange equilibrium, for either inward-directed or outward-directed transfer of the 45 Ca-exchange label, with a half-time of about 20 min. The uptake of Ca 2 + requires phosphate, even under hypo-osmotic conditions, where the calcium loading expected as the cells swell is obtained only when phosphate is present. The <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> is not due to Ca 2 + transport as a phosphate salt. This exchangeable-calcium pool is also present in sickle-cell-anemia erythrocytes, and comprises a similar proportion of total cellular calcium...|$|E
40|$|S organism, an {{anaerobic}} gram-negative rod, {{which is}} one of two bacterial species isolated from the culture known as “Methanobacillus omelianskii,” ferments ethanol to acetate and H 2. The present study shows that extracts of this organism contain ferredoxin and produce acetate from acetaldehyde via aldehyde: ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Electrons generated in the reaction are given off as H 2 by a previously demonstrated ferredoxin-linked hydrogenase system. Extracts were shown to contain good phosphotransacetylase and acetokinase activities, but no mechanism of adenosine triphosphate generation during acetaldehyde conversion to acetate could be detected. No evidence could be obtained for coenzyme A (CoASH) or <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> or for formation of acetyl CoA or acetyl phosphate...|$|E
30|$|The {{important}} role of ammonia as a bio-control agent has already been reported (Trivedi et al. 2008). The present study described the production of ammonia during feather hydrolysis by strain PF 1. Ammonia production has been also reported by Bacillus subtilis isolated from forest soil (Jeong et al. 2010 c). Phosphate is abundant in soil and {{plays a major role}} in plant growth. The overall phosphate use efficiency following the application of phosphate fertilizer is very low because of the formation of insoluble complexes (Dastager et al. 2010). Phosphate solubilization is another good property of strain PF 1, which enhances the uptake of phosphate thereby promoting plant growth for better yield. However, increased concentration of degraded metabolites of chicken feather exhibited a negative effect on phosphate solubilization. This result is supported by the fact that phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms solubilize insoluble form of phosphate by acidification (Kaur and Reddy 2014) and feather-degraded metabolites are alkaline in nature which inhibits phosphate solubilization. This shows that in order to fulfil the <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> of plants, phosphate should be provided externally when feathers are used as biofertilizers. HCN indirectly enhances the plant growth by acting as a microbial antagonist and is yet another influential trait of PGPR (Goswami et al. 2014). The present study indicates that the feathers augmented the production of HCN which would be advantageous for eradication of plant pathogens.|$|E

30|$|When {{the silica}} {{limitation}} is removed, diatoms will form a quasi-monoculture in the lagoon. Nutrients should, of course, be added, mainly for their ammonia and <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements.</b> A cheap {{way to do}} this would be by the use of struvite, an ammonium-magnesium phosphate that is produced by a simple and robust technology in the treatment of organic wastes, including manure, urban waste, and urine[3]. Struvite is a slow-release fertilizer that will steadily add ammonium and phosphate to the lagoon. The addition of nutrients should be limited, however, because diatoms react to a slight starvation by raising their lipid content, which increases their value for biodiesel production. The diatom production can be increased by underwater lighting at night.|$|R
40|$|Ornithine {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} two {{strains of the}} trench fever rickettsia Rochalimaea quintana, Fuller and Guadalupe, and in the vole agent, a strain of Rochalimaea but not necessarily of Rochalimaea quintana. The metabolic activity of intact cells and cell-free extracts was measured by monitoring the evolution of 14 CO 2 from [1 - 14 C]ornithine. Low levels of activity were obtained with all three strains, but requirements for the demonstration of this activity differed. With {{the cells of the}} Fuller and Guadalupe strains, the decarboxylation of ornithine was almost completely dependent on added pyruvate or succinate, presumably as sources of energy for transport. This enhancement was not prevented by the presence of chloramphenicol. The activity of the vole agent, on the other hand, required the complete medium. This activity was prevented by chloramphenicol added {{at the same time as}} the medium but not by chloramphenicol added after 1 h of incubation. In cell-free extracts, the demonstration of ornithine decarboxylase activity in the vole agent required prior induction with medium containing ornithine, whereas in the other two strains, the activity was constitutive. The activities of the extracts of the Fuller strain and the vole agent differed also in pH optimum, which was somewhat lower for the vole agent, and in the added pyridoxal <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement,</b> which was greater for the Fuller strain. Comparable experiments with Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii failed to reveal evidence of ornithine metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria {{from some}} plant tissues possess {{the ability to}} take up Ca 2 + by a phosphate-dependent {{mechanism}} associated with a decrease in membrane potential, H+ extrusion, and increase in the rate of respiration (AE Vercesi, L Pereira da Silva, IS Martins, CF Bernardes, EGS Carnieri, MM Fagian [1989] In G Fiskum, ed, Cell Calcium Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York, pp 103 - 111). The present study reexamined the nature of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> in this process. The main observations are: (a) Respiration-coupled Ca 2 + uptake by isolated corn (Zea mays var Maya Normal) mitochondria or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-induced efflux of the cation from such mitochondria are sensitive to mersalyl and cannot be dissociated from the silmultaneous movement of phosphate in the same direction. (b) Ruthenium red-induced efflux is not affected by mersalyl and can occur in the absence of phosphate movement. (c) In Ca 2 +-loaded corn mitochondria, mersalyl causes net Ca 2 + release unrelated to a decrease in membrane potential, probably due to an inhibition of Ca 2 + cycling {{at the level of the}} influx pathway. It is concluded that corn mitochondria (and probably other plant mitochondria) do possess an electrophoretic influx pathway that appears to be a mersalyl-sensitive Ca 2 +/inorganic phosphate-symporter and a phosphate-independent efflux pathway possibly similar to the Na 2 +-independent Ca 2 + efflux mechanism of vertebrate mitochondria, because it is not stimulated by Na+...|$|E

Five rhizobia! strains were tested in one neutral soil, two acid soils, and the two acid soils limed to pH 6. 6. In the neutral and limed soils, three of the strains were effective (CB 1024, CB 756, TAL 169), but only two strains (CB 756, TAL 169) remained effective in acid soil. Strain CB 756 and plus-N treatments were further compared in a factorial trial involving com-binations of five levels of P with lime, no lime and CaCI 2 treatments, applied to an acid soil. Some of the treatments were also applied to plants inoculated with (CB 1024. Between the N-fertilized and CB 756 treatments there was no clear difference in growth response to applied P, and the critical internal concentration of P for 95 % of maximal growth was the same (0. 22 % shoot dry weight). Increasing P beyond levels needed for maximal growth increased nodulation and N concentration in plants inoculated with (CB 756. It lowered N concentration in N-fertilized plants. There was evidence suggesting that the P requirement of symbiotic plants increased if the soil was acid, or if CB 756 were replaced by CB 1024 as microsymbiont: but the critical statistical interactions were not significant...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Nodulation {{success by}} two {{indigenous}} Rhizobium trifolii serogroups, 6 and 36, on subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) {{was affected by}} the addition of phosphate to Abiqua soil (Ultic Haploxeroll). To understand the impact of phosphorus nutrition on the survival and nodulation characteristics of the two serogroups, studies were carried out to determine: (i) the growth characteristics of representative serogroup isolates, 6 and 36, in defined nutrient solution with phosphate concentrations typical of soil solution; and (ii) the influence of phosphate stress upon the nodulation characteristics of the two isolates at pH 5. 5 and 6. 5. An iron (III) oxide dialysis system was used to provide growth medium buffered at 0. 00, 0. 28, 0. 51, 0. 87, and 6. 50 uM phosphate at pH 5. 5. After depleting the internal P content of the organisms, the external critical <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements</b> of 6 and 36 were found to be significantly different (0. 56 and 0. 93 uM respectively). Despite the relatively small difference between the critical <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements,</b> 6 adapted to phosphate-depleted medium far better than 36 by maintaining viability in 0. 00 uM P medium, whereas 36 lost viability within 48 h in medium having < 0. 56 uM P. At pH 5. 5, P-deficient 36 was inferior to P-deficient 6 by taking 2 to 4 d longer to initiate nodulation and forming less nodules in P-depleted plant growth medium. Nodulation by P-starved 36 was improved by either the presence of phosphate at pH 5. 5, or by a higher pH of the plant growth medium depleted of phosphate. Rhizoplane enumeration showed that both 6 and 36 could proliferate even under stringently low inorganic phosphate conditions (5. 4 to 9. 2 generations in 7 d) and achieved about 9 generations at 21 d. P-deficient 36 proliferated significantly less than luxury P grown 36 regardless of the P status of the plant growth medium. The numbers of nodules formed by 6 and 36 were not related to the rhizoplane densities of the bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Conditions {{for optimal}} CO 2 {{fixation}} and malate decarboxylation by isolated bundle sheath chloroplasts from Zea mays were examined. The relative rates {{of these processes}} varied according to the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle intermediate provided. Highest rates of malate decarboxylation, measured as pyruvate formation, were seen {{in the presence of}} 3 -phosphoglycerate, while carbon fixation was highest in the presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate; only low rates were measured with added ribose- 5 -phosphate. Chloroplasts exhibited a distinct <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> and this was optimal at a level of 2 millimolar inorganic phosphate in the presence of 2. 5 millimolar 3 -phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, or ribose- 5 -phosphate. Malate decarboxylation and CO 2 fixation were stimulated by additions of AMP, ADP, or ATP with half-maximal stimulation occurring at external adenylate concentrations of about 0. 15 millimolar. High concentrations (> 1 millimolar) of AMP were inhibitory. Aspartate included in the incubation medium stimulated malate decarboxylation and CO 2 assimilation. In the presence of aspartate, the apparent Michaelis constant (malate) for malate decarboxylation to pyruvate by chloroplasts decreased from 6 to 0. 67 millimolar while the calculated Vmax for this process increased from 1. 3 to 3. 3 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll. Aspartate itself was not metabolized. It was concluded that the processes mediating the transport of phosphate, 3 -phosphoglycerate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate transport on the one hand, and also of malate might differ from those previously described for chloroplasts from C 3 plants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInhibition of the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition pore (PTP) {{has proved}} to be an effective strategy for preventing oxidative stress-induced cell death, and the pore represents a viable cellular target for drugs. Here, we report that inhibition of complex I by rotenone is more effective at PTP inhibition than cyclosporin A in tissues that express low levels of the cyclosporin A mitochondrial target, cyclophilin D; and, conversely, that tissues in which rotenone does not affect the PTP are characterized by high levels of expression of cyclophilin D and sensitivity to cyclosporin A. Consistent with a regulatory role of complex I in the PTP-inhibiting effects of rotenone, the concentrations of the latter required for PTP inhibition precisely match those required to inhibit respiration; and a similar effect is seen with the antidiabetic drug metformin, which partially inhibits complex I. Remarkably (i) genetic ablation of cyclophilin D or its displacement with cyclosporin A restored PTP inhibition by rotenone in tissues that are otherwise resistant to its effects; and (ii) rotenone did not inhibit the PTP unless phosphate was present, in striking analogy with the <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> for the inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A [Basso et al. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 26307 – 26311]. These results indicate that inhibition of complex I by rotenone or metformin and displacement of cyclophilin D by cyclosporin A affect the PTP through a common mechanism; and that cells can modulate their PTP response to complex I inhibition by modifying the expression of cyclophilin D, a finding that has major implications for pore modulation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Phosphate {{sorption}} by soils {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processes indicating the buffering power and availability of P for plants. Phosphorus sorption characteristics of eight representative calcareous soil of Isfahan region were evaluated. For this purpose, 3 grams, of &lt; 2 -mm soil were equilibrated for 24 hours at 25 ±l °C in 60 ml of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 with varying amounts of P. Sorbed phosphorus was calculated by the difference between P initially added and P remaining in the final solution. Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Van Huay equations were fitted to the sorption data.  All four equations adequately described the relationship between sorbed and solution P, but the Van Huay model was slightly superior. Some phosphorus buffering indices were calculated from the sorption isotherms. These buffering indices were highly related to each other as well as to soil properties. Clay percent showed the highest correlation with buffering indices (r= 0. 771 to 0. 949) followed by calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The quantity of P sorbed at standard concentration of 0. 3 µg P/ml (SPR) is reported to the amount that satisfies the <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> of many crops. This parameter was calculated from Van Huay equation and showed a strong correlation with buffering indices (r= 0. 807 to 0. 990) and soil properties such as clay (r= 0. 960) and CCE (r= 0. 809) percents. Regression analysis suggested that clay and CCE percents were the most important soil properties for estimating the buffering power and the standard P requirement of the calcareous soil in Isfahan region...|$|E

RESULTS The <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements</b> on arable farms were largely met by raw pig slurry, given its large regional availability. After the initial nutrient input by means of pig slurry, the nitrogen/phosphate ratio of the remaining nutrient crop requirements determined the additional amount of liquid mineral concentrates that can be used.

In addition, sludge can contain potentially harmful substances, including pathogens, persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals. It is therefore necessary to control the use of sewage sludge in order to protect human and animal health and to maintain soil fertility and crop yields. The bioavailability of heavy metals can be affected by several factors. Some of these factors are related to soil and some others may be related to plant characteristics. Soil pH, organic mater content, redox status, carbonate content, chloride content, moisture, source and form of metals and plant genotype may be the most important. However, investigation of any factors which may reduce or enhance the availability of heavy metals in soil and uptake by plants would be crucial. Such knowledge and information on these factors could be used and would help the authorities to manage and control the environmental problems which are concerned with sludge application to agricultural land and could threaten the human health.

A total of 45, 000 independent mini-Mu MudJ transposon mutants in S. typhimurium SL 1344 were screened in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells with a beta-lactam, cefotaxime, to enrich for mutants defective for intracellular replication. Ten different auxotrophic (purine, pyrimidine, purine/methionine, and valine/isoleucine) and three prototrophic replication-defective mutants (Rep-) were identified. All Rep- mutants showed no differences in aerobic and anaerobic growth patterns, motility, serum sensitivity, mouse macrophage survival, iron uptake, and <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements.</b> All Rep- mutants were unable to multiply inside MDCK, HeLa, and Caco- 2 epithelial cells. When required nutrients for various auxotrophs were supplemented, auxotrophs then replicated inside MDCK cells. Although the parental strain multiplies in large vacuoles inside MDCK cells that distort the host cells, MDCK cells infected with the Rep- mutants appeared relatively normal and few bacteria were seen inside vacuoles. The purine auxotrophs and the three prototrophic Rep- mutants were highly attenuated in mice, and oral and intraperitoneal LD 50 levels were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the wild type level.

40|$|Phosphorus {{plays an}} {{important}} role for food crop production in the forest zone of tropical Africa but very little information is available on the <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirement</b> for maize production there. Field trials were, therefore, conducted with maize (Zea mays L.) at two locations on Alfisols in southern Nigeria to investigate the P response and the residual effect of applied P. The experimental sites were recently cleared from fallow and the vegetation was removed after land clearing. On the Egbeda soil (Oxic Paleustalf), which is derived from basement complex rocks, five seasons of maize croppings were done from 1971 to 1973 using a split-plot design with three replications. Four periods of fresh P applications (major and minor seasons 1971 and major and minor seasons 1972), formed the main plots and each of these fresh P applications consisted of five P rates (0, 26, 52, 78 and 104 kg P/ha) which made up the sub-plots. Maize culture T 2 A ✕ TZB was planted at a spacing of 75 ✕ 25 cm (53, 300 plants/ha). The minor season maize received supplementary irrigation. On the Alagba soil (Oxic paleustalf) which is derived from sedimentary rocks, five P rates (0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 kg P/ha) were compared using a randomized complete block design with four replications. Phosphate was broadcasted as single superphosphate and incorporated in the soil to the various treatments. The residual effects of applied P were followed up at both locations. With removal of fallow vegetation following land clearing, significant responses to P applications were observed at both locations. The P requirement for obtaining significant yield increases was not very high, ranging from 26 to 52 kg P/ha depending on season and location. Higher yield response to P was observed during the main season (April to July) than during the minor season (August to November) planting. At both locations significant residual effects of applied P was observed on maize yield and Bray P- 1 soil test levels. On the Egbeda soil it was possible to build up and maintain adequate amounts of extractable P for two to three maize crops with one addition between 52 to 104 kg P/ha. Good relationship was observed between maize grain yield and Bray P- 1 test values on the Egbeda soil. The critical Bray P- 1 test values was estimated to be about 14 ppm P. Results of incubation studies showed that under laboratory conditions 2. 5 to 3 ppm of fertilizer P was required to increase the Bray P- 1 test level by 1 ppm for the Egbeda and Alagba soils respectively. Under field conditions for the Egbeda soil the P rate required was estimated to be 3. 5 ppm P. The critical P in the ear leaf was estimated at 0. 3 % P.

40|$|As in 1989 the {{algal bloom}} was toxic and mortal to Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in fish-farms. The brachish layer, with salinities between 5 and 25 %o, was {{characterized}} by a high N : P ratio reflecting the low phosphate content in the freshwater supplied to the fjord system. An overflow discharge of freshwater close to the power plant at Hylen created a vigorous 'upwelling' and dominated the hydrographical conditions in Hylsfjorden and Sandfjorden during the bloom. As a result a compensation current in Hylsfjorden was created resulting in a prolonged residual time in the upper 1 - 2 m, {{where most of the}} P. parvum was observed. The entrainment of seawater into the brackish layer at Hylen was about four times greater than that under normal wind conditions in the fjord system. The calculated nitrate consumption in the fjord system was about 2 800 kg day- 1 and compared well with the measured in situ production of about 900 mgC m- 2 day- 1. The supply of phosphate from fresh and seawater into the brackish layer could only support about 20 % of the theoretical normal <b>phosphate</b> <b>requirements</b> for phytoplankton growth. As in 1989 there was a close relationship between the start of the freshwater discharge, the associated upwelling at Hylen and the time of onset of a pelagical phase of the P. parvum bloom.

In this study, we show that the N. crassa hsp 70 - 1 (NCU 09602. 3) and hsp 70 - 2 (NCU 08693. 3) genes are preferentially expressed in an acidic milieu after 15  h of cell growth in sufficient phosphate at 30 °C. No significant accumulation of these transcripts was detected at alkaline pH values. Both genes accumulated to a high level in mycelia that were incubated for 1  h at 45 °C, regardless of the phosphate concentration and extracellular pH changes. Transcription of the hsp 70 - 1 and hsp 70 - 2 genes was dependent on the pacC+ background in mycelia cultured under optimal growth conditions or at 45 °C.

On soils low to medium in calcium, add a t least 400 pounds of landplaster to the foliage a t early blooming stage. On soils high in calcium the landplaster is not necessary. The calcium level of the soil can be determined best by having the soil analyzed.

In spite of this the yield of peanuts is seldom increased by direct application of nitrogen, phosphate or potash and their use is not recommended. To take care of the potash removed by the peanut crop, however, additional potash should be applied to other crops in rotation with peanuts. This can be accomplished by the use of high potash fertilizers or liberal potash top-dressing on other crops in the rotation. If this is done peanuts produce just as well with no fertilizers.

The organisms were exposed to a culture medium concentration of 20 ppb Pb for 3 hr at the time of luxury phosphate uptake and subsequently transferred to phosphorus and lead-free medium. A differential sensitivity was observed as follows: Plectonema > Scenedesmus > Cyclotella. In Plectonema and Scenedesmus, detrimental cytological changes were observed when the polyphosphate relative volume dropped below 0. 5 %, which was approximately the P-starvation level of polyphosphate. Few significant ultrastructural changes were observed in Cyclotella after one week in P-deficient medium. At this time, the relative volume of polyphosphate was still 1. 5 %. Although a few significant ultrastructural changes occurred with phosphate deprivation, the greatest numbers of changes occurred in cells that had been exposed to a short-term (3 hr) low level of Pb.

Binding of preproteins {{to the surface of}} mutant mitochondria and import of outer membrane proteins were not inhibited, indicating that the inhibition of protein import occurred after the recognition step at the outer membrane. The membrane potential across the inner membrane of the mutant mitochondria was strongly reduced. Restoration of the membrane potential restored preprotein import but did not affect the block of phosphate transport of the mutant mitochondria. We conclude that the inhibition of protein import into mitochondria lacking the phosphate carrier/p 32 is indirectly caused by a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta(gamma)), and we propose a model that the reduction of delta(psi) is due to the defective phosphate import, suggesting that phosphate transport is the primary function of the phosphate carrier/p 32...|$|R

Here we present the results of a thiophosphate substitution interference analysis of the pro-Rp <b>phosphate</b> oxygen <b>requirements</b> in the two hammerhead forms. Five pro-Rp phosphate oxygens, all in the central core, were found to be important for self-cleavage by the prototypical hammerhead. A similar set of core positions were important for self-cleavage by the extended hammerhead, but five non-core positions were also found to be important. Thiosubstitution at one of these positions had the most severe effect on self-cleavage observed in this analysis. Mn 2 + did not alleviate this negative effect, indicating that this position was not part of a divalent cation binding site. We propose that novel tertiary interactions in the extended hammerhead help form the same catalytic core structure as that used by the prototypical plant virus hammerhead...|$|R
30|$|Located {{amidst a}} human {{inhabited}} and agricultural landscape, KNP {{is likely to}} be affected by the agriculture practices in the surroundings. The soil in the area is alkaline and lack essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Fertilizers (urea and di-ammonium <b>phosphate)</b> meet these <b>requirements.</b> The prescribed usage of N fertilizer in the crop is 80  kg/ha (Parihar 2004). An increase in production was seen when 70 – 80  kg/ha the fertilizer is applied. While the higher application of N fertilizer increased crop production from 1999 to 2000, it resulted in a reduction in 2007 and 2008. Sneva (1977) reported that addition of N-fertilizer above 56  kg/ha leads to a buildup of NO 3 -N just above the cemented caliches layer that significantly increases the residues in the subsurface soil and deeper horizons in the soil profile. This prevents proper drainage in the soil because rainfall in the area is low for notable leaching and evacuation, and the presence of an impervious layer would further reduce it. Accumulation of NO 3 -N at a depth below the primary rooting zone would lead to restricting the supply of N to plants (Sneva, 1977), reducing crop productivity. The reduction of productivity in later years seen in the area would be perhaps for these reasons.|$|R
40|$|Generation of H 2 O 2 by rat liver {{mitochondria}} with choline, glycerol 1 -phosphate and proline as substrates {{has been}} shown by using high-concentration phosphate buffer. Rates obtained under these conditions were higher and more consistent {{as compared with the}} earlier reports with high-concentration mannitol/sucrose/Tris buffer. Sulphate ions could replace <b>phosphate</b> indicating a <b>requirement</b> for a high concentration of oxygen-containing anions. H 2 O 2 generation was dependent on the presence of native mitochondria and substrate. Maximal rates with various substrates were found to be the same as with succinate. Values of Km and Vmax for H 2 O 2 generation were considerably less than those obtained for respective dehydrogenase activities, measured by dye reduction. Scavengers of O 2 -. and OH. inhibited generation of H 2 O 2. ATP, ADP, thyronine derivatives and a number of phenolic compounds also showed very potent inhibitory effects of H 2 O 2 generation, whereas phenyl compound had no effect. Phenolic compounds did not have any effect on mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and choline dehydrogenase activities as well as on O 2 -. generation by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Inhibition by phenolic compounds may have potential for regulation of the intracellular concentration of H 2 O 2, that is not considered to have a "second messenger' function...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} brown adipocytes {{identified}} an increased breakdown of phosphoinositides after selective alpha 1 -adrenergic-receptor activation. The present paper reports that this response, elicited with phenylephrine {{in the presence}} of propranolol and measured as the accumulation of [3 H]inositol phosphates, is accompanied by increased release of [3 H]arachidonic acid from cells prelabelled with [3 H]arachidonic acid. Differences between stimulated arachidonic acid release and formation of inositol <b>phosphates</b> included a <b>requirement</b> for extracellular Ca 2 + for stimulated release of arachidonic acid but not for the formation of inositol phosphates and the preferential inhibition of inositol phosphate formation by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. The release of arachidonic acid in response to phenylephrine was associated with an accumulation of [3 H]arachidonic acid-labelled diacylglycerol, and this response was not dependent on extracellular Ca 2 + but was partially prevented by treatment with the phorbol ester. The release of arachidonic acid was also stimulated by melittin, which increases the activity of phospholipase A 2, by ionophore A 23187, by lipolytic stimulation with forskolin and by exogenous phospholipase C. The arachidonic acid response to phospholipase C was completely blocked by RHC 80267, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, but this inhibitor had no effect on release stimulated with melittin or A 23187 and inhibited phenylephrine-stimulated release by only 40 %. The arachidonate response to forskolin was additive with the responses to either phenylephrine or exogenous phospholipase C. These data indicate that brown adipocytes are capable of releasing arachidonic acid from neutral lipids via triacylglycerol lipolysis, and from phospholipids via phospholipase A 2 or by the sequential activities of phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase. Our findings also suggest that the action of phenylephrine to promote the liberation of arachidonic acid utilizes both of these reactions...|$|R
40|$|The agronomic {{practices}} such as plant spacing and <b>phosphate</b> fertilizer <b>requirements</b> for the cultivation of Bambara groundnut [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc. ] {{have not yet been}} fully determined in Agbani agro ecology South east Nigeria. Field trials were conducted in 2015 and 2016 planting season at the Teaching and Research Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources Management, Enugu State University of Science and Technology, Agbani as a 4 x 3 factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments were four rates of single super phosphate fertilizer (0 kg P ha- 1, 25 kg P ha- 1, 50 kg P ha- 1 and 75 kg P ha- 1) and three plant spacing regimes (intra and inter row spacing) 10 cm x 45 cm (222, 222 plants hectare- 1) 5 cm x 45 cm (148, 148 plants hectare- 1) and 20 cm x 45 cm (111, 111 plants hectare- 1). Soil samples were collected from the top soil at a depth of 0 to 15 cm before planting, four and eight weeks after planting. The obtained results showed that Bambara groundnut spaced at 20 cm × 45 cm per plant grown on plots fertilized with 75 kg P ha- 1 single super phosphate fertilizer (SSP) had significantly (P =. 05) the tallest plants [24. 53 cm at 4 weeks after planting (WAP), 35. 23 cm at 8 WAP in 2015 and 25. 00 cm at 4 WAP and 36. 00 cm at 8 WAP in 2016 respectively] compared with the other treatments. The effects of single super phosphate fertilizer treatment on leaf area index (6. 04 in 2015 at 4 WAP, 45. 86 in 2015 at 8 WAP, 6. 31 at 4 WAP in 2016 and 46. 51 at 8 WAP in 2016) were significant (P =. 05) at the highest at application rate of 75 kg P ha- 1 of SSP. Plots which had the lowest population density (111, 111 plants hectare- 1) and received the highest rate of SSP (75 kg P ha- 1) gave significantly (P =. 05) the highest number of fresh pods per plant at harvest (17. 67 in 2015 and 19. 00 in 2016) and weight of fresh pods per plant (248. 03 g plant- 1 in 2015 and 290. 76 g plant- 1 in 2016 respectively) than the other treatments. Total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentration 7 of soil were significantly (P =. 05) higher in plots which received 75 kg P ha- 1 SSP than the other treatments. Plant population density of 111, 111 plants hectare- 1 and SSP rate of 75 kg P ha- 1 is recommended for optimum agronomic performance of Bambara groundnut in a degraded tropical ultisol...|$|R
