5000|$|Improvement District No. 53 held {{a public}} meeting on November 5, 2013 to {{reassess}} property values. At the time, the Improvement District had 596 lots of the 1,500 originally planned. The public notice, posted in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, cited {{the reason for}} the reassessment as the <b>pressure</b> <b>sewer</b> line within the district only had the capacity to handle a maximum of 800 to 1,000 lots. However, the public notice did not cite the reassessment provisions of Arkansas Code, but rather the provision of Arkansas Code for subsequent tax levies if the tax first levied shall prove insufficient to pay the bonds. [...] In 2013, the same period of the reassessment of taxes for Improvement District 53, Hometex, LLC became delinquent on its property taxes owed to both Improvement District No. 53 and 54 and, as a result, the bond fund balance for Improvement District 53 had fallen to below $3,000. The reassessment assumed only 800 more lots could be built and significantly reduced the assessed benefits to the undeveloped land owned by Hometex, LLC, reducing their future tax burden as a result. On June 23, 2015, Doug Loftin, Cindy Loftin, and Hometex, LLC filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The filing included $267,566 in delinquent property taxes in addition to an undisclosed amount of debt owed to both Improvement Districts No. 53 and 54. In 2015, Bank of the Ozarks acquired most of the undeveloped land previously owned by Hometex, LLC and paid $250,000 of back taxes owed to Improvement District 53. As a result of the reassessment, homeowners in the district saw their tax bills raise from $228 to $429 a year and the taxes owed on undeveloped land now owned by Bank of The Ozarks decreased from approximately $200,000 a year to $94,000 a year.|$|E

But the best of the appropriate practices from the private sector have often “not crossed over”. The Water Research Commission (WRC) of South Africa, working in collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), finds that the concept of franchising, so successfully used by the private sector to deliver many goods and services, if applied to water services operation and maintenance, could alleviate and address many challenges in the management of water services. At the same time, franchising could provide an ideal stimulus to support the development of local enterprises, all within the municipal service delivery environment. Franchisee water service providers, dependent for their livelihood on the success of their business, would have a strong incentive to perform, and would also enjoy the benefit of the franchisor’s expert guidance and quality assurance. Some areas for potential franchising include meter management, billing, plumbing, <b>pressure</b> management, <b>sewer</b> maintenance, and wastewater treatment processes. The help from the franchisor would be of particular value to water services authorities at a distance from the major urban centres. Few of these authorities can afford to employ competent qualified staff, and often non-compliance with the laid down performance standards is a direct consequence of this lack. Significant improvements would soon be seen if the generally under-qualified and under-resourced water services staff could have this ongoing support, mentoring and quality control — or if the authority could enter into partnerships with small local enterprises or NGOs which would, through franchising, enjoy the necessary ongoing support, mentoring and quality control, and would have quick access to expert assistance when they needed it...|$|R

The target compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few μg/L, which {{are in the range}} commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i. e. from - 10 to 10 %. A higher decrease in concentrations (25 - 60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (- 66 ± 15 %) and irbesartan (- 58 ± 25 %), which {{may be due to the}} conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer.

The City of Portsmouth’s {{sewerage}} system consists of approximately 115 miles of sewers (excluding the Pease International Tradeport), 19 pumping stations, and a 4. 8 million gallon per day (mgd) primary wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) located on Peirce Island. The City has an inter-municipal agreement with the Town of New Castle, an island to the northeast of Portsmouth, to treat their wastewater at the City’s Peirce Island WWTF. Additionally, the City has entered into a long-term Municipal Services Agreement (MSA) with the Pease Development Authority (PDA) to maintain and operate the wastewater collection and treatment facilities at the Pease International Tradeport (Pease), the former Pease Air Force Base, and has other agreements with Rye, New Hampshire on behalf of Adams Mobil Home Park and with a private entity located in Greenland, New Hampshire. The Pease facilities include approximately 15 miles of sewers, one pumping station, and a secondary WWTF. The purpose of this project was to extend the city sewer to the Pleasant Point area which is adjacent to the Back Channel area of the Piscataqua River.

The storage capacity is mobilised through active flow control automatically regulated by an Artificial Intelligence system using local level monitoring. The effects of climate change, population growth and urbanisation are putting increasing <b>pressure</b> on <b>sewer</b> and drainage networks both in the UK and overseas. The capacity of networks to cope with runoff at the required rate often falls short of requirements leading to localised floods and/or increased CSO spills to receiving waters. Smart Water/ Wastewater Network technologies {{have the potential to}} deliver improved service to customers and cost-effective performance improvements for the water industry. CENTAUR aims to provide an innovative, cost effective, local autonomous data driven in-sewer flow control system whose operation will attenuate peaks and reduce the risk of surface water flooding. The system enables the capacity of existing infrastructure to be utilised more efficiently as a very economical alternative to capital-intensive solutions, for example building extra storage capacity. The system is also quick to implement with virtually no enabling works prior to installation. CENTAUR comprises level monitors which relay data to an intelligent controller, which instructs a flow control device regulated by a novel and robust artificial intelligence routine based on Fuzzy Logic. The level monitors and intelligent controller are located locally and utilise real time data to provide effective real time control (RTC). The CENTAUR Fuzzy Logic control algorithm was developed in Matlab. The Matlab RTC algorithm was linked to a SWMM hydro-dynamic model of a test network to prove its efficiency. Further rigorous testing was carried out by the University of Sheffield on the full-scale test facility designed to replicate field conditions.

40|$|Hong Kong has practiced {{seawater}} toilet flushing since 1950 s. It saves 22 % {{of fresh}} water but inevitably results in high sulfate-laden saline sewage, causing corrosion of <b>pressure</b> <b>sewers</b> and odor (mainly H 2 S) at sewage treatment plants. The former has been solved by applying anti-corrosion pipes and dosing with super-oxygenated liquids. However, the latter cannot be solved at low cost because {{there are two major}} odor sources: 1) primary treatment and 2) sludge treatment. At the same time, current sewage treatment plants in Hong Kong produce 1000 tonnes of dried sludge per day, which has to be incinerated in the near future since the landfill capacity will be surpassed by 2017. In order to solve these problems cost-effectively as well as to maximize the benefits of the seawater toilet flushing practice, we have recently developed a novel biological nitrogen removal process for saline sewage treatment, which is named Sulfate reduction, Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI®) process. The key features of this novel process include: elimination of primary treatment and sludge production as well as oxygen demand in organic matter removal. This novel process uses sulfate in the saline sewage originating from seawater toilet flusing to realize biological sulfate reduction (BSR) for effective removal of organic matter under an anaerobic condition. The produced sulfide dissolved completely due to production of sufficient alkalinity, providing adequate electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification. Since all the three major biomasses, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), autotrophs for denitrification and nitrification produce little sludge, total sludge production can thus be minimized significantly. A 500 -day lab-scale system has demonstrated that no purposeful withdrawal of excess sludge was needed. In order to verify these results and further understand this feature, a steady-state model was developed in this research based on the mass balances of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, sulfur and charge and the stoichiometries of the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification and nitrification. The model predictions agreed well with the measured data on COD, nitrate and sulfate removals, sulfide production, effluent Total Suspended Solids (TSS) as well as the mass balances of COD, sulfur and nitrogen in the system. The model also well explained the performance of the SANI® lab-scale system in the sludge production and the COD and nitrogen removals under various operating conditions. In order to further demonstrate the SANI® process in treating real saline sewage, a pilot-scale study was conducted with 10 m 3 /day of 6 -mm screened saline sewage at the Tung Chung Sewage Pumping Station. The SANI® pilot plant consisted of a sulfate reduction up-flow sludge bed (SRUSB), an anoxic bioreactor for autotrophic denitrification and an aerobic bioreactor for nitrification. The plant was operated at a steady state for 225 days, during which the average removal efficiencies of both COD and TSS were 87 % and no excess sludge was purposefully withdrawn. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was found to be 55 % only, which was attributed to a very high fraction (26. 5 %) of inert soluble organic nitrogen in the incoming sewage, which mainly originated from the wastewater of the Hong Kong International Airport. Furthermore, a tracer test of the SRUSB revealed 5 % shortcircuit flow and 34. 6 % dead zones in this key reactor of the plant, indicating a good possibility to maximize the treatment capacity of the process for full-scale saline sewage treatment through reactor design optimization. Compared with conventional biological nitrogen removal processes, the SANI® process eliminates 90 % sludge waste, saves 35 % energy and reduces 36 % greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This research work has confirmed that the SANI® process not only helps to eliminate the major odor sources originating from primary treatment and sludge treatment, but also promotes saline water supply as an economic and sustainable solution for water scarcity and sewage treatment in water-scarce costal areas. A new steady-state model was further developed in this research for evaluating the SANI® pilot plant. The model comprised: 1) a COD-based anaerobic hydrolysis kinetics to determine the removal of biodegradable COD and anaerobic hydrolysis rate in BSR under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and sludge retention times (SRTs), 2) elements (C, H, O, N, P, S), COD and charge mass balances for prediction of the concentrations of alkalinity (H 2 CO 3 * alkalinity+H 2 S alkalinity), COD, sulfate, sulfide, nitrate and free saline ammonia in the SRUSB, the anoxic autotrophic denitrifying reactor as well as the aerobic autotrophic nitrifying reactor of the plant, and 3) an inorganic carbon (HCO 3 -) and sulfide (H 2 S/HS-) mixed weak acid/base chemistry for pH prediction. Through characterization of the sewage organic matter and determination of the anaerobic hydrolysis kinetic rate and other relevant parameters, the steady-state model was validated successfully for application in the SANI® process. The model predictions agreed well with the experimental data of the pilot-scale trial, demonstrating that the model developed from this research can explain the causes and conditions for the minimal sludge production in the SANI® pilot plant. An integrated biological kinetic model was finally developed and applied to simulate the SANI® pilot plant. This kinetic model allows for five organic types, i. e. volatile fatty acids (VFA), fermentable biodegradable soluble organics (FBSO), biodegradable particulate organics (BPO), unbiodegradable particulate organics (UPO) and unbiodegradable soluble organics (USO), with different compositions of the incoming saline sewage. The kinetic model predictions (restricted to the steady state conditions) conformed favorably to the experimental measurements and the steady state model predictions, which validated the kinetic model. Based on the system optimization by this kinetic model, the SANI® pilot plant showed the potential to futher increase the volumetric loading rate and reduce the HRT simultaneously. The optimum values of recycle rateio from aerobic to anoxic bioreactor can be selected between 2. 5 and 2. 75, such as 2. 5 in the operation of SANI® pilot plant...|$|R
40|$|Addition of nitrate is a {{well-known}} method for odor control in sewer networks. However, although the kinetics of denitrification is widely studied, in regard to biological treatment, the respective reports, under sewer conditions, in literature are limited. In {{the framework of the}} investigation of the present thesis a chemostate was, initially, designed and operated for the kinetic study of autotrophic denitrification, by a mixed culture, with sulfide as the electron donor. The continuous operation of the chemostate, fed with a synthetic wastewater with no organic substrate, proved to be not possible for nitrate to sulfide influent ratios between 0, 50 - 1, 12 gNO 3 -N/gS- 2. The culture failure is attributed to nitrite accumulation, which leads to inhibition of the autotrophic denitrification and, consequently, to biomass washout. During the experimental period, temperature (300 C), pH value of 7, 2 and dilution rate (0, 03 h- 1) remained constant. After the culture failure of the chemostate, a fluidized bed reactor was designed and operated, in order to find suitable continuous flow conditions that will allow autotrophic denitrification to take place. Immobilization of the biomass and feeding with synthetic wastewater which contained, except from sulfide, organic substrates (acetic, glucose and peptone) were chosen, in order to avoid biomass washout and nitrite accumulation, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the potentiality of simultaneous autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification is determined by the type of the organic substrate. Autotrophic denitrification, under nitrate limited conditions, is found to be possible in the presence of glucose but is completely inhibited in the presence of acetic or peptone. Experiments with sewer wastewater, as the electron donor, prove that autotrophic denitrification with sulfide can take place simultaneously with heterotrophic denitrification. Different experimental group investigated, in a batch reactor, the kinetics of denitrification with septic sewer wastewater in different temperatures. The results indicate that nitrate utilization is accompanied with temporal nitrite accumulation and it can be simplified into three stages. During the first stage sulfide is oxidized and, during the followed two stages, sulfide is completely inhibited. It is also observed that the extend of temporal nitrite accumulation is determined by temperature, which has an important impact on the kinetic profile of nitrate utilization. Arrhenius equations were developed which predict the anoxic rates in every temperature. Further experiments investigated the effect of mass transfer phenomena in the overall kinetics of denitrification that take place in a <b>sewer</b> <b>pressure</b> main biofilm. For these purposes, an experimental pressure main was designed and operated. From the results, it is found that nitrite accumulation, during denitrification, is negligible regardless of the wastewater temperature. Heterotrophic denitrification is found to follow typical biofilm kinetics, in regard to nitrate utilization. Initially a zero order kinetic is observed, in regard to nitrate utilization, which is followed by half order kinetics, due to partial penetration of nitrate in the biofilm. In the presence of sulfide, anoxic sulfide oxidation and denitrification present similar kinetic profile. From the obtained rates, Arrhenius equations were developed which predict the rates in every temperature. Finally, nitrate addition was applied, under full scale conditions, in three sewer networks of the country. Nitrate addition in the sewer network of the Municipality of Corfu, with a length of 6, 7 Km, proved its effectiveness for odor control. Addition of 2, 6 KgNO 3 -N/h decreased total sulfide concentrations from 13 - 28 g/m 3 to concentrations below 1 g/m 3, along the sewer network. The method was also applied in the sewer network of Parikia (Municipality of Paros) and in the sewer network of Palio (Municipality of Kavala). Nitrate dosing between 1, 4 - 2, 3 and 0, 3 - 0, 5 KgNO 3 -N/h, respectively, cope effectively with odor problems in the networks. The correlation of the anoxic transformations rates, determined experimentally, with the hydraulic characteristics that define a sewer network allowed the development of a mathematical model that predicts the kinetics of anoxic sulfide oxidation and denitrification. The mathematical model became the base of a software program which allows the user to predict the optimum nitrate dosage, for effective odor control, in pressurized sewer networks. The simulation of the conditions, during the nitrate dosing period, in the sewer network of Parikia and Palio confirmed the ability of the mathematical model to adequately predict the optimum nitrate dosage in a sewer network, as the simulated nitrate dosages agree with the optimum nitrate dosages that were experimentally determined. ...|$|R
