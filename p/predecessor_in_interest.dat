50|$|The {{family-owned company}} (Ritz Camera Centers, Inc., <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> to Ritz Camera & Image, LLC) was founded as a {{portrait}} studio in 1918 by Benjamin A. Ritz, in the Ritz Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Whether the occasion was a wedding, graduation, or confirmation, the tradition in Atlantic City {{in the early}} 20th century was to have it captured with a B. A. Ritz portrait. In 1936, Benjamin and his brother Edward opened the first Ritz film-processing lab in Washington, D.C. Ritz Camera was headed by Edward's son, David Ritz.|$|E

50|$|For the 2015 model year, Ford Motor Company {{introduced}} the thirteenth-generation F-150. Without physically changing any dimensions from its <b>predecessor,</b> <b>in</b> the <b>interest</b> of fuel economy, designers reduced curb weight by nearly 750 pounds. In {{a radical change}} for a mass-market vehicle, much of the weight reduction stems the change from steel to aluminum in its body structure (the majority of the frame itself remains high-strength steel). With the lone exception of the firewall, all sheet metal used for the F-150 body is aluminum.|$|R
50|$|Although James {{expressed}} {{misgivings about}} some of Hawthorne's more extravagant symbolism and heavy reliance on allegory, he shared his <b>predecessor's</b> constant <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> moral quandaries, divided loyalties, and the inevitable conflicts between imaginative protagonists and intractable reality. James also shared Hawthorne's passion for careful craftmanship and thorough, unsparing analysis of character.|$|R
50|$|The Navajo Nation is {{the biggest}} {{reservation}} in the United States, and extends into the states of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, covering over 27,000 sq mi. Diné Bikéyah, or Navajoland, is larger than 10 of the 50 states in America. The Navajo Nation’s (“the Nation’s”) reservation lands contain {{a vast amount of}} coal, which is held in trust for the Nation by the federal government. The Nation and the <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> to the Peabody Western Coal Company (“Peabody”) entered into a lease for access to the Nation’s mineral exchange for money. The lease was approved by the Secretary of the Interior with insight {{that there needs to be}} reasonable adjustments at the end of the term by the Secretary. While the appeal was pending, both Peabody and Nation anticipated a ruling in favor of the Nation.|$|E
40|$|The {{petition}} for certiorari to the Maryland Court of Appeals by Loren Parker concerned {{the interpretation of}} Maryland Rule of Evidence 5 - 902, specifically the authentication of business records by debt buyers. The central issue was whether a debt purchaser is bound by the same rules of evidence for the admissibility of business records as other Maryland businesses. Rule 5 - 902 (b) provides for the self-authentication of records of a regularly conducted business activity. It requires that a party served with a 5 - 902 (b) notice must object within 5 days. The petitioner debtor argued that this rule was being abused by debt buyers, like Pasadena, who often did nothing to verify the debt. Business records have to be properly authenticated by someone {{with knowledge of the}} business to overcome hearsay objections. The amicus memorandum argues that debt buyers {{should not be allowed to}} self-authenticate the business records of a third party (the original creditor) as if those records were their own. It points out that the failure to object within five days does not bar other objections to the records at the time of trial. Also, any authenticating witness must have personal knowledge of the business, otherwise he or she is not competent to testify. Since the debt buyer has no personal knowledge of the business records practice of the creditor grantor, or of each intermediate debt buyer, it cannot lay a proper foundation for the admission of documents created by other entities. The memoranda urges the grant of certiorari to provide clarity to consumers and businesses about the requirements for self-authentication of records created by third-party <b>predecessors</b> <b>in</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|R
