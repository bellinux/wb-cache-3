40|$|Shifting prey {{selection}} {{has been}} identified as a mechanism potentially regulating predator–prey interactions, but it may also lead to different outcomes, especially in more complex systems with multiple prey species available. We assessed changing prey selection by lions, the major predator for 12 large herbivore species in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. The database was provided by records of found carcasses ascribed to kills by lions assembled over 70 years, coupled with counts of changing prey abundance extending over 30 years. Wildebeest and zebra constituted the most favored prey species during the early portion of the study period, while selection for buffalo rose in the south of the park after a severe drought increased their vulnerability. Rainfall had a negative influence on the proportional representation of buffalo in lion kills, but wildebeest and zebra appeared less susceptible to being killed under conditions of low rainfall. Selection by lions for alternative prey species, including giraffe, kudu, waterbuck, and warthog, was influenced by the changing relative abundance and vulnerability of the three <b>principal</b> prey <b>species.</b> Simultaneous declines in the abundance of rarer antelope species were associated with a sharp increase in selection for these species at a time when all three <b>principal</b> prey <b>species</b> were less available. Hence shifting prey selection by lions affected the dynamics of herbivore populations in different ways: promoting contrasting responses by <b>principal</b> prey <b>species</b> to rainfall variation, while apparently being the main cause of sharp declines by alternative prey species under certain conditions. Accordingly, adaptive responses by predators, to both the changing relative abundance of the <b>principal</b> prey <b>species,</b> and other conditions affecting the relative vulnerability of various species, should be taken into account to understand the interactive dynamics of multispecies predator–prey webs...|$|R

40|$|Prey {{selection}} by tiger in Chitwan National Park, Nepal was studied from 77 tiger scats {{that contained}} {{the remains of}} <b>principal</b> prey <b>species.</b>   The scats were collected from January to March 2010.   Government reports on herbivore population in Chitwan provided the base data on density of <b>principal</b> prey <b>species.</b>   In order to understand prey selectivity, the observed proportion of prey species in the scats were compared with the expected proportion derived from density estimates.   The observed scat frequency of Sambar, Hog Deer and Wild Boar {{was found to be}} greater than the estimated frequency, and the reverse was true for Chital and Muntjac.   The average weight of the <b>principal</b> prey <b>species</b> killed was 84 kg.
