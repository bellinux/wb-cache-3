Bilevel and Hi-level passenger cars have been in use since the 1950s, and new passenger equipment with a height of 19 ft has been built for use in Alaska and the Canadian Rockies. See Bilevel rail car. The structure gauge of the Mount Royal Tunnel limits the height of bilevel cars to 14 ft.|$|R

5000|$|The {{qualification}} de cour {{refers to}} the instrument's connection with the French court and aristocracy of the early seventeenth century. [...] "Exotic" [...] - {{in the sense of}} imported or out of place - elements were fashionable, resulting in the appearance of traditional instruments such as bagpipe, hurdy-gurdy and galoubet in compositions for professionals and amateurs alike. The musette may well have benefited from being a bellows-blown instrument, too; it was generally considered unseemly for women to play any mouth-blown instrument. Borjon de Scellery, however, does explicitly identify grimacing and <b>pulling</b> <b>faces</b> as a habit of ill-trained musette-players.|$|R

An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than fresco.

Then they clamoured at her, particularly the maialino, what was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they <b>pulled</b> <b>faces.</b> Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy, cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then.|$|R
