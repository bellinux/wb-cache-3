40|$|We {{consider}} the steady, gravity-driven flow of {{a thin film}} of viscous fluid down a helically wound shallow channel of arbitrary cross-sectional shape with arbitrary torsion and curvature. This extends our previous work [D. J. Arnold et al., “Thin-film flow in helically-wound rectangular channels of arbitrary torsion and curvature,” J. Fluid Mech. 764, 76 – 94 (2015) ] on channels of rectangular cross section. The Navier-Stokes equations are expressed in a novel, non-orthogonal coordinate system fitted to the channel bottom. By assuming that the channel depth is small compared to its width and that the fluid depth in the vertical direction is also small compared to its typical horizontal extent, {{we are able to}} solve for the velocity components and pressure analytically. Using these results, a differential equation for the free surface shape is obtained, which must in general be solved numerically. Motivated by the aim of understanding flows in static spiral <b>particle</b> <b>separators</b> used in mineral processing, we investigate the effect of cross-sectional shape on the secondary flow in the channel cross section. We show that the competition between gravity and inertia in non-rectangular channels is qualitatively similar to that in rectangular channels, but that the cross-sectional shape has a strong influence on the breakup of the secondary flow into multiple clockwise-rotating cells. This may be triggered by small changes to the channel geometry, such as one or more bumps in the channel bottom that are small relative to the fluid depth. In contrast to the secondary flow which is quite sensitive to small bumps in the channel bottom, the free-surface profile is relatively insensitive to these. The sensitivity of the flow to the channel geometry may have important implications for the design of efficient spiral <b>particle</b> <b>separators.</b> D. J. Arnold, Y. M. Stokes, and J. E. F.

Nuclear Structure {{physics is}} {{entering}} a new era, associated with three major tech-nological developments and the physics they enable: facilities that give access to large num-bers of exotic nuclei far from the valley of stability, new generations of detector systems and <b>particle</b> <b>separators,</b> and advanced computing capabilities both for data acquisition and analysis, and for theory. This talk will discuss the physics of exotic nuclei, focusing on new phenomena in the weakly bound, strongly interacting, quantal systems that nuclei near the drip lines provide, and on the opportunities to study the evolution of structure, shell struc-ture, collective modes, many-body symmetries, and quantum phase transitional behavior and critical point symmetries across long chains of nuclei.

Non-electrical separation efficiencies ranged from 71 to 75 % and with the application of additional electrical forces the increase in separation efficiency was between 17 and 21 % at a cyclone Reynolds number of 19000, with the most conductive particle most easily separated. Further parametric testing correlated the effects of dust loading, electrocyclone Reynolds Number and particle cut upon separation efficiency. In particular we show that {{the separation of the}} smallest size cuts (D < 38 m) of the dust sample almost doubled upon application of the corona.

40|$|Laminar gravity-driven {{thin-film}} {{flow down}} a helically wound channel of rectangular cross-section with small torsion {{in which the}} fluid depth is small is considered. Neglecting the entrance and exit regions we obtain the steady-state solution that is independent of position along the axis of the channel, so that the flow, which comprises a primary flow {{in the direction of}} the axis of the channel and a secondary flow in the cross-sectional plane, depends only on position in the two-dimensional cross-section of the channel. A thin-film approximation yields explicit expressions for the fluid velocity and pressure in terms of the free-surface shape, the latter satisfying a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that has a simple exact solution in the special case of a channel of rectangular cross-section.

The flow field of the carrier gas is predicted {{by means of the}} two-equation k-ϵ turbulence model. An Eulerian methodology is used to trace the particle trajectories of foreign particles such as droplets, ice and sand. To predict the characteristics of particle wall bouncing in dilute particle flow, the velocity re-associated two-node quadrature-based method of moments (VR-QMOM) is used. The particle distribution in the IPS is predicted for various particle sizes and these are compared with results from a Lagrangian particle tracking method. The particle-wall interactions and the separation efficiencies are studied for solid particles bouncing off perfectly elastic walls and an IPS shell coated with the M 246 alloy which changes the coefficients of restitution. The simulated separation efficiencies predicted by the Eulerian method are compared with the simulation using the Lagrangian method over a range of particle sizes. The VR-QMOM method is seen to reproduce the particle bouncing and trajectory crossing behavior and to agree well with the Lagrangian method for predicted separation efficiencies. The new VR-QMOM method is shown to be an accurate and convenient alternative to established Lagrangian approaches...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} fluid flows in helical channels. The primary {{motivating}} application {{for this work}} is the segregation of particles of different weights/densities in spiral <b>particle</b> <b>separators,</b> devices used in the mining and mineral processing industries to separate ores and clean coal. These devices feature very shallow flows, and so we use the thin-film approximation which enables significant analytic progress. It is most convenient to use a non-orthogonal, helicoidal coordinate system which allows a natural representation of helical channels with arbitrary cross-sectional profile, and arbitrary centreline slope and radius. We begin by studying particle-free flow in channels with rectangular cross-section. On taking the thin-film limit of the Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain a system of equations which has an analytic solution. This solution is investigated {{to determine the effects}} of changing the slope and curvature of the channel centreline, and the fluid flux down the channel. We then consider particle-free flow in helical channels with shallow, but otherwise arbitrary cross-section, and investigate the effect of changing the cross-sectional shape of the channel, guided in part by questions raised from studying rectangular channels. Except in a special case, this model must be solved numerically. Finally, we consider monodisperse particle-laden flow, using the diffusive-flux model proposed by Leighton and Acrivos (1987). We present the thin-film particle-laden flow model for shallow channels of arbitrary geometry and, assuming the particles are uniformly distributed in the vertical direction, solve the resulting system of equations numerically.
