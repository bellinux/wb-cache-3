50|$|<b>Pressboard</b> is a {{class of}} cellulose-based {{material}} constructed of several layers (plies) of paper which, when compressed {{using a combination of}} heat and pressure, form a stiff, dense material in a range of weights. <b>Pressboard</b> has been widely used in traditional school and office products such as spiral-bound notebooks and three-ring binders, but its unique physical characteristics lend itself readily to a variety of end-uses, including (but not limited to) document storage, filing supplies (classification and file folders), report covers, folding cartons, tags, labels, and industrial applications. It is commonly used to make the back panels of radios and some televisions. <b>Pressboard</b> may be converted using a number of different techniques (scoring, folding, die-cutting), and accepts a range of value-add decorating techniques (coating, foil-stamping, screen-printing, and embossing). <b>Pressboard</b> may contain recycled fiber content (including post-consumer waste), and is typically itself recyclable and biodegradable, making it an environmentally-sound choice for those seeking an alternative to petroleum-derived substrates.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of paper}} board as {{electrical}} insulation paper {{started in the}} early-mid 20th century. Since the need for high voltage electrical transformers, {{there has been a}} need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings. <b>Pressboard,</b> a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them, has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines. However, as electrical technology increased, the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew. In the late 1920s, Hans Tschudi-Faude became the director of H. Weidmann Limited and began developing a type of <b>pressboard</b> that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer, more powerful transformers. Unlike older methods of <b>pressboard</b> production, Transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with high-grade sulfate cellulose. The new product was made purely out of cellulose without a resin or binder, improving electrical insulation capabilities and could be completely dried, degassed, and oil impregnated. The new product became famous under the name Transformerboard. Throughout the 1930s, new methods of production and advances in understanding replaced almost all insulating parts of transformers with parts made from transformer board.|$|E

It summarized in how to create and simulate the real conditions of working transformer and testing its insulation materials for Partial Discharge PD, typically as in the working mode. A lot of tests may give untrue results as the physical behavior of the insulation material differs under tests from its working condition. In this work, the real working conditions were simulated, {{and a large number}} of specimens have been tested. The investigations first stage, begin with choosing samples of different types of insulation materials (papers, <b>pressboards,</b> etc.). The second stage, the samples were dried in ovens at 105 C 0 and 0. 01 bar for 48 hours, and then impregnated with dried and gasless oil (the water content less than 6 ppm.) at 105 C 0 and 0. 01 bar for 48 hours, after so specimen cooling at room pressure and temperature for 24 hours. The third stage is investigating PD for the samples using ICM PD measuring device. After that, a continuous test on oil-impregnated insulation materials (paper, <b>pressboards)</b> was developed, and the phase resolved partial discharge pattern of PD signals was measured.

40|$|Polarization-depolarization current (PDC) {{measurements}} {{are now being}} used as a diagnosis tool to predict the ageing condition of transformer oil-paper insulation. Unfortunately, it is somewhat difficult to obtain the ageing condition of transformer cellulose insulation using the PDC technique due to the variation in transformer insulation geometry. In this literature, to quantify the ageing condition of transformer cellulose insulation using the PDC technique, we firstly designed a series of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions, and then obtained the branch parameters of an extended Debye model using the technique of curve fitting the PDC data. Finally, the ageing effect and water effect on the parameters of large time constant branches were systematically investigated. In the present paper, it is observed that there is a good exponential correlation between large time constants and degree of polymerization (DP). Therefore, the authors believe that the large time constants may be regard as a sensitive ageing indicator and the nice correlations might be utilized for the quantitative assessment of ageing condition in transformer cellulose insulation in the future due to the geometry independence of large time constants. In addition, it is found that the water in cellulose <b>pressboards</b> has a predominant effect on large time constants...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool to measure the number of hydrogen nuclei in wood. By measuring various characteristics of the NMR signal (amplitude and relaxation times), the amount of hydrogen in different physical states of their molecular environment, (e. g. liquid and solid state) can be determined. Convential NMR equipment requires samples to be placed into the bore of a magnet and into a small detection coil. Therefore this "enclosing" technique is not suitable for inspections of larger objects, as wood pariticle boards or for in-field inspections of wood logs. For the measurements presented here a single-side access NMR instrumentation (Southwest Research Insitute, San Antonio, Texas) was used, which offers the feasibility to do NMR measurements external to the probe. The NMR signal is generated in a flat disk-shaped volume (sensitive volume) which is 1 mm thick and located 26 beneath the probe surface. By scanning the sensor towards the sample, depth profiles of the NMR signal can be obtained up to a maximum depth of 26 mm with a depth resolution of 1 mm. In one of our present studies this new instrumentation {{was used to determine}} the moisture profile in a disk of a beach log. A sharp increase of the moisture content at the bark/marrow interface was clearly detected by the NMR measurements. Moreover, some bends of the signal profiles in the marrow could originate from moisture variations in the annual rings. The goal of a second study is to use this NMR instrumentation for in-situ measurements of the moisture and the density distribution of wooden <b>pressboards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transformers are {{the most}} {{expensive}} and critical asset in any electrical power network. Their failure results in long interruption of power supply with consequent loss of reliability and revenue. Understanding and detection of the failure mechanism helps in avoiding catastrophic failures, unplanned outages and improving the power system reliability. Oil impregnated paper (OIP) and <b>pressboards</b> form the main soild insulation in a transformer. Life of the transformer is governed mostly by the life of OIP insulation. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} ageing of the OIP insulation in power transformer and its eventual failure, is mainly a function of temperature and electrical stresses. However, it has now been realized that the moisture causes rapid degradation of OIP and needs a special attention. Considering its practical relevance, this research program was formulated with goals: (i) to study the ageing of OIP insulation under temperature and moisture stresses, (ii) to seek correlation between diagnostic ageing indices and end-of-life (EOL) and (iii) to develop a life model for OIP considering moisture along with the thermal stress. Observing that working with actual transformers or even the prototypes are rather inordinately expensive, experiments were conducted with paper strips immersed in oil in test tubes with paper to oil ratio kept same as that in power transformers. In order to cater for the statistical nature of the phenomena, adequate numbers of test specimens were employed (25 numbers for each experiment). Experiments were conducted for two years at temperatures 90 °C, 110 °C & 120 °C and moisture 1 %, 2 % & 3 %. Following the literature, the degree of polymerization (DP) was chosen as the primary index for ageing. As measurement of DP is not only destructive, but also impractical on most of the working transformers, with an aim to develop suitable diagnostic indices for ageing, 2 -furfural (2 -FAL) and oxides of carbon (CO and CO 2) were also measured. Empirical relation between ageing and amount of stresses and time have been deduced for the relevant range. Limiting value of these indices to prescribe the end-of-life, as well as, their correlation with DP have been worked out and reported. In order to bring the role of moisture explicitly, based on earlier work on multi-stress ageing, a multiplicative power law supplementing the Arrhenius factor is envisaged. Accordingly, a phenomenological combined stress model involving the time to failure, temperature, and moisture content is deduced. Based on the experimental results, this model is statistically validated and the values of parameters appearing in the model is obtained. Thus the combined stress model enables one to estimate the life of OIP insulation at any temperature and moisture under synergy. In summary, this work through experimental and analytical approach has contributed to the evaluation of the aging of OIP insulation used in power transformers under the combined action of moisture and temperature...|$|R
