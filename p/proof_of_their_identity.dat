Still, even heretics {{had a right to}} a fair trial; at least he, who although a soldier by profession, was a man who honestly detested unnecessary bloodshed, held that opinion. Also long experience taught him great mistrust of the evidence of informers, who had a money interest in the conviction of the accused. Lastly, it did not seem well to him that the name of a young and noble lady should be mixed up in such a business. As they knew under the recent edicts, his powers in these cases were absolute; indeed, in his official capacity he was ordered at once to consign any suspected of Anabaptism or other forms of heresy to be dealt with by the appointed courts, {{and in the case of}} people who had escaped, to cause them, on satisfactory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity,</b> to be executed instantly without further trial. Under these circumstances, fearing that did the lady knew his purpose she might take fright, he had, he confessed, resorted to artifice, as he was very anxious both for her sake and in the interest of justice that she should bear testimony in the matter. So he asked her to accompany him on a short drive while he attended to a business affair; a request to which she had graciously assented.|$|E

50|$|Mathematics and logic, {{historically}} speaking, {{have been}} entirely distinct studies. Mathematics has been connected with science, logic with Greek. But both have developed in modern times: logic {{has become more}} mathematical and mathematics has become more logical. The consequence {{is that it has}} now become wholly impossible to draw a line between the two; in fact, the two are one. They differ as boy and man: logic is the youth of mathematics and mathematics is the manhood of logic. This view is resented by logicians who, having spent their time in the study of classical texts, are incapable of following a piece of symbolic reasoning, and by mathematicians who have learnt a technique without troubling to inquire into its meaning or justification. Both types are now fortunately growing rarer. So much of modern mathematical work is obviously on the border-line of logic, so much of modern logic is symbolic and formal, that the very close relationship of logic and mathematics has become obvious to every instructed student. The <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> is, of course, a matter of detail: starting with premises which would be universally admitted to belong to logic, and arriving by deduction at results which as obviously belong to mathematics, we find that there is no point at which a sharp line can be drawn, with logic to the left and mathematics to the right. If there are still those who do not admit the identity of logic and mathematics, we may challenge them to indicate at what point, in the successive definitions and deductions of Principia Mathematica, they consider that logic ends and mathematics begins. It will then be obvious that any answer must be quite arbitrary. (Russell 1919, 194-195).|$|E

However, formal <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> as cells of origin of recurrences at distant sites and the molecular events that may contribute to tumor cell dissemination and metastasis development are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed a set of patient-derived breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) lines. We found that in vitro BCSCs exhibit a higher chemoresistance and migratory potential when compared with differentiated, nontumorigenic, breast cancer cells (dBCCs). By developing an in vivo metastatic model simulating the disease of patients with early BC, we observed that BCSCs is the only cell population endowed with metastatic potential. Gene-expression profile studies comparing metastagenic and non-metastagenic cells identified TAZ, a transducer of the Hippo pathway and biomechanical cues, as a central mediator of BCSCs metastatic ability involved in their chemoresistance and tumorigenic potential. Overexpression of TAZ in low-expressing dBCCs induced cell transformation and conferred tumorigenicity and migratory activity. Conversely, loss of TAZ in BCSCs severely impaired metastatic colonization and chemoresistance. In clinical data from 99 BC patients, high expression levels of TAZ were associated with shorter disease-free survival in multivariate analysis, thus indicating that TAZ may represent a novel independent negative prognostic factor. Overall, this study designates TAZ as a novel biomarker and a possible therapeutic target for B...|$|E
40|$|In {{the scene}} of the bow contest in Book 21 of the Odyssey, several {{questions}} are raised, among which are why Telemachus joined the contest for choosing the husband of Penelope, and what he really means by his speech at 21. 113 - 7. It is the aim of this paper to consider how the motif (story pattern) of "the conflict between father and son" is working behind this scene, and how the poet of the Odyssey incorporated this motif into his story. In the first section, the characterisation of Telemachus is looked at. The main feature of his identity that is given emphasis is the son who is like his father. In the first four books of the Odyssey, the emphasis is on the similarity of his appearance to his father, as Telemachus is still a powerless youth at this stage. But at the same time, it is hinted at that he is to become a true hero like his father. Viewed from this context, the narrative that he could have strung his father's bow if Odysseus had not given a warning nod and stopped him (Od. 21. 128 - 9) shows that Telemachus is now similar to his father in power as well. Since no proof of identification is shown to Telemachus for him to recognise Odysseus, this episode functions as a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> as father and son; stringing his father's bow would be the most definite demonstration of their similarity. In the second section, Telemachus' speech (21. 113 - 7) is examined, where he talks of the reason for his joining the contest. The ambiguities in his speech are (1) whether ου (115) should be taken with μοι αχνυμενω (115) or with λειποι (116); and (2) what αεθλια (117) actually means. On the first point, it is concluded that ου (115) goes with λειποι (116), and on the second, it is argued that αεθλια (117) denotes "the prize" instead of "the contest" or "the weapon". Thus Telemachus joins the contest in order to gain Penelope and the kingship of Ithaca. The third section points out the reasons why the motif of father-son conflict could have intruded into this epic. The relevant factors are: (1) the poet's knowledge of the episode in the Telegony, in which Odysseus is killed by his son by accident; (2) the close contact between the Trojan and Theban epic cycles, as is shown by mention of Teiresias (Od. 11. 90 - 151) and Oedipus (Il. 23. 679 - 80; Od. 11. 271 - 80), in which the motif of father-son conflict is the basic pattern of the story; (3) the parallel relationship of Telemachus and Telegonus to Odysseus; (4) the widespread motif of father-son conflict throughout the Indo-European world. Thus, in this scene of the bow contest, the poet of the Odyssey seems to have alluded to the story of Odysseus' death by his own son, but also presents us with the new relationship between father and son, narrating Telemachus' acceptance of his father's warning nod. This interpretation of their momentary crisis and reconciliation well explains the episode of the two eagles, who come flying close together and depart in the same way, but in the meantime harm each other (Od. 2. 146 - 56). Although this episode has been regarded as difficult to interpret, it fits well with the situation of Odysseus and Telemachus at the bow contest; the son is now equivalent in strength to his father, which might cause dangerous tension between them, but they are reconciled at once and establish a new relationship. In this way, the motif of father-son conflict seems to underlie the bow contest scene...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the historians}} Saletore, P.B. Desai and Henry Heras, {{the theory of}} capture of Harihara I and Bukka Raya I by the Sultan of Delhi and {{conversion}} to Islam is false and that the testimony of epigraphs proves that the area around Hampi constituted their homeland. The empire never had a Telugu origin. The patron saint of the early kings was saint Vidyaranya, the 12th Shankaracharya of Sringeri in Karnataka, and this is <b>proof</b> enough <b>of</b> <b>their</b> unquestionable <b>identity</b> with the Kannada country. About the Muslim records that claim a Telugu origin of Harihara I and Bukka Raya, these historians feel, the records are neither unanimous nor reliable in their claims. In those days of religious rigidity, it is too far-fetched to accept a theory of conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism while still managing to win the trust and loyalty of Hindu subjects in an hour of impending invasions. According to Kamath, the great devotion {{the founders of the}} empire had in Lord Chennakeshava of Belur and Lord Virupaksha of Hampi testifies to their origin from Kannada country, though in political and administrative matters, the Vijayanagar kings followed the Hoysala, Kakatiya, Chola framework in the various provincial regions of the empire. The Sangama brothers even signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada (as Srivirupaksha) and used their Kannada titles even in their Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit records. No Telugu titles were used by them. A popular chieftain and patriot of those times, prince Kumara Rama of Kummata Durga or simply [...] Kummata Durga (capital of the tiny Kampli kingdom in Bellary District) may have been related to Sangama, father of Harihar I. This evidence exists in a literary piece by poet Nanjunda (Kumara Rama Charita). According to Kamath, the early Vijayanagar kings raised memorials at Sandur, Chitradurga and Dharwad to sing the glory of Kumara Rama's valor and show their continued efforts to build an empire in his legacy. All this proves the matrimonial relations the Sangama family had with the Kummata family.|$|R
40|$|Estudos sobre processos identitários têm tido grande visibilidade em trabalhos desenvolvidos em várias áreas do conhecimento (Psicologia, Antropologia, Ciências Sociais, Psicanálise etc.). Esses estudos referem-se ao vínculo entre as pessoas e aglutinam temas importantes, tais como: os mecanismos das identificações e a gestão dos laços sociais. Escolhemos pesquisar um acontecimento extremamente atual, porque nos permite dar visibilidade a situações até él [...] 'ltagônicas relativas às experiências identitárias. Com a promulgação da Constituição Federal de 1988, algumas comunidades negras rurais, foram remetidas, efetivamente, a uma situação singular: para obter os benefícios da Lei, que prevê a titulação das terras ocupadas por remanescentes dos antigos quilombos, seria necessária uma "identidade quilombola". Esta situação produz algumas questões: como aceder a uma "identidade"? Que reverberações isso provoca? Optamos por pesquisar a comunidade negra rural de Abacatal (PA), já reconhecida como quilombola desde 1999, com o intuito de pôr à vista algumas vicissitudes dos processos identitários aí implicados. Entrevistamos 12 moradores da comunidade, 5 homens e 7 mulheres, entre 27 e 68 anos, lá residentes há pelo menos 13 anos, ou seja, todos participantes do processo de titulação das terras. Ao final, foi possível destacar: a) as identificações que foram evocadas e remetidas aos antepassados escravos ou ao mito de origem da comunidade (que conta a história da união entre um conde e sua escrava); b) os benefícios que tiveram os moradores com a auto-identificação como quilombolas; c) os vários sentidos de ser "negro qui lombo Ia", dentre os quais, não se reconhecer quilombola quando isto significa ser "negro fugido". Concluímos que esses processos identitários, vividos nesta comunidade e por cada um de nós, pemitindo-nos a denominação de humanos, é, como afirma Costa (2000), o que nos mantêm vivos e nos dá gosto de viver. ABSTRACT: Studies {{about the}} {{processes}} of identity construction have gained great attention in researches developed in other academic domains, such as psychology, anthropology, social sciences, and psychoanalysis. These studies investigated the relationships between members of a given community and they center their efforts on important themes, as the following: the mechanisms of identity construction, {{and the organization of}} the social relations. The present study investigates an extremely current event, which will shed a light on the antagonistic relations related to {{the processes of}} identity construction. With the new Constitution of 1988, some black rural communities were forced into a unique legal situation: in order to obtain the benefits prescribed in the Constitution – which affirms that the descendants of ancient Brazilian Maroons (Quilombolas) have the right of ownership of the land that they occupied – the descendants of the Brazilian Maroons must give <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Maroon <b>identity.</b> This situation brings up some issues: How to build up an “identity”? What are the consequences of it? Given this situation, this study will focus on a black rural community of Abacatal (PA), which has been identified as a Maroon community since 1999, with the goal of pointing out some harm involved in the processes of identity construction. Twelve community member were interviewed, 5 men and 7 women, with ages between 27 and 68 – year old. All interviewees had been living in the community for at least thirteen years, therefore, all of them experienced the process of acquiring land ownership through the process of establishing a Maroon identity. The results of the study revealed that: a) the identities constructed evoked slave ancestors and also myths of the community creation (the story of the union between and noble man and slaved woman); b) the establishment of a Maroon identity brough benefits for the members of this Brazilian Maroon community; c) there are several, sometimes conflicting, meanings related to the identity of being a Brazilian Maroon, as for instance the meaning of being a black out-law. The conclusion is that, these processes of identity construction, experienced by the members of the community studied, as well as for each one of us, give us the human status and they are, as says Costa (2000), what keep us alive and add pleasure in our lives...|$|R
