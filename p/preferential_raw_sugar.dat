40|$|In this investigation, the {{production}} of ethanol from the <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet juice and <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet cossettes has been studied. For ethanol production from the <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet juice, batch and fed-batch cultivation techniques in the stirred tank bioreactor were used, while batch ethanol production from the <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet cossettes {{was carried out in}} hori-zontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). In both cases, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a production microorganism. During batch ethanol production from the <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet juice, ethanol yield was 59. 89 g/L and production efficiency 78. 8 %, and in fed-batch pro-cess the yield was 92. 78 g/L and efficiency 93. 4 %. At the same time, ethanol production in HRTB from the <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet cossettes with inoculum of 16. 7 % V/m (<b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> beet cossettes) resulted in the highest ethanol yield of 54. 53 g/L and production efficiency of 79. 5 %.

40|$|The {{filtering}} characteristics of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> destined for refining {{have been the}} topic of much research. Investigations in South Africa {{on the impact of}} various components of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> on the filterability characteristics of <b>raw</b> <b>sugars</b> started as far back as 1954. Worldwide, there is still no uniform method to determine the filterability of <b>raw</b> <b>sugars</b> for use in export agreements. To address this, the Sugar Milling Research Institute developed a method, called FilterKwik, specifically to predict the behaviour of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> during the first stages of refining. The aim was for the method to be representative of general South African refinery conditions so that it could be used to rapidly assess the suitability of a <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> for refining, be it local or abroad, bearing in mind that different refinery processes may be sensitive to different <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> quality requirements. The FilterKwik method was earmarked to replace the SA Sugar Terminal method, in recognition of the value that this would add to the South African Sugar Association marketing strategy, pending a seasonal comparison study. This study was completed during the 2009 / 10 season when just under 400 <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> samples were subjected to duplicate analyses using the FilterKwik method as well as a range of other sugar quality tests typically performed by the Sugar Terminal laboratory.

40|$|Many sugar {{factories}} of the Russian Federation sugar and white sugar is produced {{not only from}} sugar beet, but also from <b>raw</b> <b>sugar.</b> To do this, the technological scheme of the plants provide mostly separate processing beet and <b>raw</b> <b>sugar.</b> This paper proposes a joint processing. With the aim of {{improving the quality of}} syrup, improving the filtration properties of the juice II saturation with joint processing beet and <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> was proposed clarification <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> to conduct the filtered juice I saturation with the addition of bleach in the amount of 0. 05 - 0. 10 % by weight of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> and fine clay powder in the amount of 0. 3 - 0. 5 % by weight of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar.</b> Introduction chlorine {{is in the process of}} clarification <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> partly to carry out the depolymerization of highmolecular compounds, including polysaccharide dextran, and to adsorb the resulting fragments of high molecular compounds and pigments on fine particles of clay powder. Similar results were obtained when changing the costs of expanded clay powder. At a flow rate less than 0. 3 %, there is a lack of adsorption of the surface to remove the degradation products of high -molecular compounds, which degrades the quality characteristics of the mixture of woodworking and furniture production of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> and juice I carbon ation, and at a rate clay powder more than 0. 5 % is irrational, since the cleaning effect is increased slightly.

40|$|Brazil {{is known}} for its <b>sugar</b> cane production. <b>Raw</b> <b>sugar</b> is {{produced}} by artisanal farmers. As a result of artisanal production, <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> is diverse in color. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> color and its sensory acceptance in the market of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Colorimetric tests (CIELAB) were done. The results were analyzed by multivariate analysis, similarity and dissimilarity measurements and clustering techniques (GENES software). Two samples of <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> commercialized by Associação Riobranquense de Produtores de Rapadura, Áçucar Mascavo, Aguardente e Melado (ARPRAM), eleven samples produced of his associates and six samples from commercial brands were colorimetrically analyzed. Three representative samples of dark, semi-dark and light color were chosen to test color sensory acceptance. This assessment used a nine point hedonic scale. Of the 19 samples analyzed, 13 had visible color differences. Samples with the highest dissimilarity were from a producer and from ARPRAM, with 16. 47 Euclidean distance. Samples with greatest similarity were from ARPRAM and from a commercial brand with 0. 44 Euclidean distance. There was no significant difference in color sensory acceptance among the tested <b>raw</b> <b>sugar</b> samples. Colorimetric analysis confirmed a lack of color uniformity among the samples produced and marketed by ARPRAM and from the commercial brand.
