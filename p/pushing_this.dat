25|$|Tourism is {{important}} to the state as it is the only sector that is growing and brings substantial income from outside the state, although most tourism is concentrated in the capital and along the coast. In 2007, there were 1,927 small grocery stores, 70 tianguis and 167 municipal markets. Tourism accounts for about 30% of the commerce sector of Oaxaca's economy. The state attracts visitors from Mexico and abroad. The state government has been <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> sector heavily as a means of growing the economy, with major infrastructure projects such as the Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido-Huatulco highway (scheduled to finish in 2018) and the Iberdrola hydroelectric dam.|$|E
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|E

Bevin declared that Heiner's alleged connection to the Comer accusations had [...] "disqualified [...] from being the GOP nominee for governor". During a debate featuring all four Republican candidates on Kentucky Sports Radio, Bevin said, [...] "I don't know if [...] behind the Comer story, but I'm telling you his people have been <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> for a long time. And Hal himself has personally told me months and months ago before I even got in this race, that he knew things, not had heard things, that he knew things based on conversations that his people had had about Jamie Comer." [...] Bevin also released an ad depicting Comer and Heiner as children in a food fight, with the narrator promising that Bevin would bring [...] "grown up leadership" [...] to the governor's race.|$|E

[...] While {{trying to get away from}} the stampede, he said that people pulled down {{electrical}} wires, causing more people to die of electrocution. [...] These claims were backed up by one of the doctors treating patients, who said that electrocution and suffocation were the primary causes of death among the casualties, though the government disputed the claims of electric shock.|$|E

Even as war seemed imminent he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, Sir Dennistoun Burney. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant and quickly ended up in what would become the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as Panjandrum, a job that appealed to the engineer in him. [...] He also developed the [...] Rocket Spear, an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head. [...] After the first U-boat was sunk by it, Charles Goodeve sent him a message concluding [...] "I am particularly pleased as it fully substantiates the foresight you showed in <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> in its early stages.

2500|$|Water enters {{from both}} the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and {{can be divided into}} three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around [...] depth. It is {{composed}} of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea. [...] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4cm/s. This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a halocline.|$|E

It also quoted Andrew Sullivan: [...] "To rate this address on any political meter would be to demean it. The President wrested free of politics tonight and spoke of greater things." [...] Mann also mentioned two congressmen who said they intended [...] "packing heat" [...] more often when meeting constituents in future, but that [...] "others seemed resigned to merely a (post speech) truce in the high-octane political sport of baiting and debating" [...] He ended with a quote from Erick Erickson about obstacles to civil politics: [...] "Too many people earn a really good living <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> tone and this hate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fortunes}} of the industry declined during World War I and particularly into the early 1920s. Many interurbans had been hastily constructed without realistic projections of income and expenses. They were initially financed by issuing stock and selling bonds. The sale of these financial instruments was often local with salesmen going door to door aggressively <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> new and exciting [...] "it can't fail" [...] form of transportation. But many of those interurbans did fail, and often quickly. They had poor cash flow from the outset, higher expenses than expected, and struggled to raise essential further capital from a wary financial community. Interurbans were very vulnerable to acts of nature damaging track and bridges, particularly in the Midwestern United States where flooding was common. Receivership was a common fate when the interurban company couldn't pay its payroll and other debts, so state courts took over and allowed continued but temporary operation while suspending the company's obligation to pay its bond interest. With the interest payments suspended, the company had enough cash flow to meet its other cash obligations, but it was expected by the court that Receivership would eventually end and the company would resume its interest payments. Otherwise the company {{would be forced to}} quit, and many did. In addition, the interurban honeymoon period with the municipalities of 1895–1910 was over. The large and heavy interurbans, some weighing as much as 60 tons riding on track designed for lighter street cars, caused damage to city streets which led to disputes and lawsuits over who should bear repair costs. The rise of automobile traffic in the middle 1920s aggravated those trends. As the interurban companies struggled financially, they faced increasing competition from cars and trucks on newly paved streets and highways, and many municipalities sought to remove interurbans from city streets. [...] Some companies exited the passenger business altogether to focus on freight, while others sought to buttress their finances by selling surplus electricity to local communities. Several which attempted to exit the rail business altogether ran afoul of state commissions which required that interurban trains remain running [...] "for the public good," [...] even at a loss, such as the Indiana Railroad's forced passenger operation from Indianapolis to Seymour in 1939.|$|E

In front of him were eight or ten more ducks close together, all with heads under their wings. Scattered about in the grass everywhere were small groups, sleeping, or pluming their glossy dark feathers.|$|E

At the far end of this gallery a sallow, buxom lady sat sewing at a table, and Xavier saluted her very respectfully.|$|E

On this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool. Stooping low, Buck Patterson started for Calliope's fort, slowly <b>pushing</b> <b>this</b> loaded truck before him for protection. The posse, scattering broadly, stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him. Only once did Calliope make demonstration. He fired from a window, and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal's trustworthy bulwark. The return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort. No loss resulted on either side.|$|E
60|$|Young Powell, in {{the silence}} of the ship, {{reinforced}} by the great silent stillness of the world, said to himself that there was something mysterious in such beings as the absurd Franklin, and even in such beings as himself. It was a strange and almost improper thought to occur to the officer of the watch of a ship on the high seas on no matter how quiet a night. Why on earth was he bothering his head? Why couldn't he dismiss all these people from his mind? It was as if the mate had infected him with his own diseased devotion. He would not have believed it possible that he should be so foolish. But he was--clearly. He was foolish in a way totally unforeseen by himself. <b>Pushing</b> <b>this</b> self-analysis further, he reflected that the springs of his conduct were just as obscure.|$|E

The happy notion of taking a philanthropic public-house occurred to him, and was acted upon at the first opportunity. Maitland calculated that in his own bar-room he could acquire an intimate knowledge of humanity in its least sophisticated aspects. He would sell good beer, instead of drugged and adulterated stuff He would raise the tone of his customers, while he would insensibly gain some of their exuberant vitality. He would shake off the prig (which he knew to be a strong element in his nature), and would, at the same time, encourage temperance by providing good malt liquor.|$|E
