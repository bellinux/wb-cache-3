[...] I mean, there were 100 essential requirements. I read all of them. One of them said to give protection against any missile coming from any direction." [...] Spencer later commented: [...] "it is always hard to imagine why <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be able cost effectively to buy a bespoke requirement for a very small production run." ...|$|E

We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy {{on the death of}} Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E

6000|$|Staniford drew a long, silent breath. After all, he knew everything. He {{mechanically}} {{dropped a}} little the arm on which her hand rested, {{that it might}} slip farther within. Her timid remoteness had its charm, and he fell to thinking, with amusement, how she who was so subordinate to him was, in the dimly known sphere {{in which he had}} been groping to find her, probably a person of authority and consequence. It satisfied a certain domineering quality in him to have reduced her to this humble attitude, while it increased the protecting tenderness he was beginning to have for her. His mind went off further upon this matter of one's different attitudes toward different persons; he thought of men, and women too, before whom he should instantly feel like a boy, if he could be confronted with them, even in his present lordliness of mood. In a fashion of his when he convicted himself of anything, he laughed aloud. Lydia shrank a little from him, in question. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] he said. [...] "I was laughing at something I happened to think of. Do you ever find yourself struggling very hard to be what you think <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are?" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{shopping}} {{here is not}} so enslaving {{as it is with}} us--I mean, with you--because the fashions do not change, and you {{get things}} only when you need them, not when you want them, or when other <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> do. The costume was fixed long ago, when the Altrurian era began, by a commission of artists, and it would be considered very bad form as well as bad morals to try changing it in the least. People are allowed to choose their own colors, but if one goes very wrong, or so far wrong as to offend the public taste, she is gently admonished by the local art commission. If she insists, they let her have her own way, but she seldom wants it when she knows that people think her a fright. Of course the costume is modified somewhat for the age and shape of the wearer, but this is not so often as you might think. There are no very lean or very stout people, though there are old and young, just as there are with us. But the Altrurians keep young very much longer than capitalistic peoples do, and the life of work keeps down their weight. You know I used to incline a little to over-plumpness, I really believe because I overate at times simply to keep from thinking of the poor who had to undereat, but that is quite past now; I have lost at least twenty-five pounds from working out-doors and travelling so much and living very, very simply.|$|E
