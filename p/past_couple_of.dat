5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest}} of the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

Methods: Hospital based retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2009 to December 2013 at University hospital located in Northwest Ethiopia. Human subject research approval for this study was received from University of Gondar Research Ethics Committee and the medical director of the hospital. Cox-proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of baseline covariates on composite outcome and a semi-parametric mixed effect model was used to investigate CD 4 counts response to treatments. Results: A total of 2386 HIV/AIDS naive patients were included in this study.

40|$|The widely {{existing}} MECs in Nature {{have inspired}} researchers to design synthetic analogs {{to promote the}} overall catalytic efficiency in vitro by co-localizing multiple enzymes to mimic the MECs 2 ̆ 7 unique functionalities. A number of efforts have been devoted to designing synthetic MECs in the <b>past</b> <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> decades. This thesis work has focused on developing novel strategies based on enzyme immobilization to design nano-carriers for multi-enzyme co-localization to realize kinetics enhancement and strong control of spatial arrangement of the enzymes. Three distinct approaches have been designed using different attachment methods and platforms. First, the multifunctional polystyrene nanoparticles were designed for immobilization and sequential co-localization of GOX and SHRP enzymes using covalent binding and streptavidin-biotin coupling attachment techniques. The sequentially co-localized GOX and SHRP on B/C-PS nanoparticles were capable of enhancing the overall conversion rate by approximately two-fold compared to the equivalent concentration of free enzymes in solution. Secondly, amphiphilic Pluronic-QD micelles were designed to co-localize multiple enzymes to investigate {{the effect of a}} more flexible substrate compared to the rigid polystyrene particles. FRET was used to characterize the adsorption of single enzymes and co-localization of multiple enzymes on the micelles. The two co-localized enzymes enhanced the overall conversion rate by 100...|$|R

40|$|Over the <b>past</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades, {{considerable}} {{research efforts}} have been devoted to the behaviours of concrete filled tube (CFT) because of their superior strength and stiffness characteristics for structural applications.

For this purpose, fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) are being studied as replacements of steels because they are light and highly corrosion resistant. However, application of FRP in structural engineering is still in early phase as the compatibility with other materials is yet to be fully investigated. A comprehensive overview of the researches involved in CFT is discussed in this paper with particular attention on recent developments with FRP as the tube materials.

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated in the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket.
