In this paper a semi-automatic approach is described to reconstruct triangular boundary representations from images originating from, either histological sections or mCT-, CT- or MRI-data, respectively. In a user-guided first step, planar 2 D contours were extracted for every material of interest, using image segmentation techniques. In a second step, standard 2 D triangulation algorithms were used to derive high quality mesh representations of the underlying surfaces. This was accomplished by converting the 2 D meshes into 3 D meshes by a novel lifting procedure. The meshes can be imported as is into finite element <b>programme</b> <b>packages</b> such as Marc/Mentat or COSMOS/M. Accuracy and feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated by reconstructing several specimens as examples and comparing simulated results with available measurements performed on the original objects...|$|R

Background: As {{result of}} the {{restructuring}} of the South African Police Services during 1994 {{as well as other}} factors, Police Social Work Services decided to shift the focus from reactive services to more proactive, personnel capacity building programmes. At the end of 1999, 15 of these programmes were already developed. Although basic evaluation instruments were included in some of the <b>programme</b> <b>packages,</b> the need arose to determine either the effect of the programmes on the participants or the cost-efficiency of the interventions scientifically. This led to the launch of the PCBP project and the Evaluation of the Substance Dependency study in November 2001. This form part of the evaluation of the comprehensive personnel capacity building research project. Objectives: The primary aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of the Substance Dependency Programme on SAPS personnel's knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Method: In the research, the comparison group pre-test and post-test design and triangulation were used. Six measurement scales and a presenter's evaluation questionnaire were developed and completed by 217 experimental group respondents, 47 comparison group respondents and 10 presenters. Results: Through the triangulation of measurement it was determined that the Substance Dependence Programme had a practical significant effect on the respondent's knowledge, attitude and behaviour. It is thus an effective tool in the hand of Police Social Work Services, that empower police members and lead to productivity and enhanced their personal well-being. Master...|$|R
