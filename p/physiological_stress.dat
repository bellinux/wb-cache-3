5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Activating {{transcription}} factor 3 (ATF 3), {{a member of}} the activating {{transcription factor}}/cAMP responsive element binding protein (ATF/CREB) family of transcription factors, is induced by many <b>physiological</b> <b>stresses.</b> To investigate the activity of ATF/CREB in cells with <b>physiological</b> <b>stresses,</b> we developed a practical reporter vector, the plasmid pATF/CRE-luc, bearing activating transcription factor/cAMP responsive element (ATF/CRE) binding sites. This plasmid was constructed by inserting three repeats of the ATF/CRE binding element into the plasmid pG 5 luc, replacing the GAL- 4 binding sites. The plasmids pACT/ATF 3 and pATF/CRE-luc were transfected into HeLa and NIH 3 T 3 cells, respectively, and the results showed that the expression of luciferase was increased in a dose-dependent manner on plasmid pACT/ATF 3. The data suggested that the plasmid pATF/CRE-luc {{could be used as a}} sensitive and convenient reporter system of ATF 3 activity. Key words ATF/CRE; luciferase gene; pG 5 luc; reporter syste...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, neuropsychiatry, physiological, and imaging {{studies have}} shown PTSD and {{depression}} to be physical syndromes, in many respects, as they are psychiatric ones in demonstrating limbic system physiological and anatomy disturbances. Attendant PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, which additionally increase <b>physiological</b> <b>stress,</b> may {{play a part in}} leading to frequent MH-like hyperpyrexia and speculate on its influence on underlying myopathology of FSS in other ways. PTSD may also bring about developmental delays or developmental stagnation, especially in paediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have begun working to grow heart valves in vitro. Autologous cells are seeded on a scaffold, typically {{made from a}} biodegradable polymer such as PGA or PLA. The scaffolding acts as an artificial extra-cellular matrix, guiding tissue growth into the correct 3D structure of the heart valve. Mechanical stimuli must be simulated in the culture in order to condition the tissue for <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> in vivo. These heart valves have not yet reached clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, a {{restoration}} programme {{was put in}} place that has now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery can depend on the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.|$|E

25|$|Arginine is a conditionally {{essential}} amino acid in humans and rodents, {{as it may be}} required depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. For example, while healthy adults can supply their own requirement for arginine, immature and rapidly growing individuals require arginine in their diet, and it is also essential under <b>physiological</b> <b>stress,</b> for example during recovery from burns, injury and sepsis, or when the small intestine and kidneys, which are the major sites of arginine biosynthesis have been damaged. It is, however, an {{essential amino acid}} for birds, as {{they do not have a}} urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which needs to be processed through the urea cycle, and if there is not enough arginine present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is another}} environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within {{the real estate}} industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination {{have been shown to}} have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{injury is}} a major issue for firefighters as they wear {{insulated}} clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders {{to the status of}} their people on the fire ground. Devices such as PASS device alert 10–20 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to <b>physiological</b> <b>stress.</b> These devices are similar to technology developed for Future Force Warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as {{they may not be able}} to make voice calls over their radio. Current OSHA tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.|$|E

3000|$|... mTOR is a Ser/Thr {{protein kinase}} that {{integrates}} signals originating from changes in growth factors, nutrient availability, energy status, and various <b>physiological</b> <b>stresses</b> (Wullschleger et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2009). Convergence of these {{internal and external}} signals to the mTOR complex, in turn, triggers various downstream outputs such as mRNA translation, protein synthesis, autophagy, cell proliferation, growth, and survival, which are critical for the lifespan of organisms (Kennedy and Kaeberlein, 2009; McCormick et al., 2011; Zoncu et al., 2011).|$|R
50|$|Root and tuber {{vegetables}} {{are susceptible to}} infection by Streptomyces species {{as soon as the}} root or tuber forms, but, because this disease only affects root and tubers, the symptoms are not usually noted until harvest. Dry soils increase disease incidence and severity, therefore proper irrigation can aid in control of this disease. Common scab is suppressed if the soil pH is lower than 5.2, although scab lesions may still form in low pH soils due to <b>physiological</b> <b>stresses</b> or S. acidiscabies.|$|R
25|$|Once bonded, a {{male and}} female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These {{relationships}} may last for up to 20years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter {{the weight of the}} female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi {{is about the size of}} a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92days. Producing the huge egg places significant <b>physiological</b> <b>stress</b> on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.|$|E

2500|$|In {{years of}} average {{population}} sizes, typical meadow vole population density is about 15 to 45 meadow voles per acre in old-field habitat. In peak years, their population densities may reach 150 per acre in marsh habitat (more favorable for meadow voles than old fields). Peak meadow vole abundance can exceed 1,482 meadow voles per hectare (600/acre) in northern prairie wetlands. [...] Meadow voles in optimal habitats in Virginia (old fields with dense vegetation) reached densities of 983/ha (398/ac); populations declined to 67/ha (27/ac) {{at the lowest}} point in the cycle.

2500|$|An {{adrenaline}} junkie {{is somebody}} who engages in sensation-seeking behavior through [...] "the pursuit of novel and intense experiences without regard for physical, social, legal or financial risk". Such activities include extreme and risky sports, substance abuse, unsafe sex, and crime. The term relates {{to the increase in}} circulating levels of adrenaline during <b>physiological</b> <b>stress.</b> Such an increase in the circulating concentration of adrenaline is secondary to activation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the adrenal medulla, as it is rapid and not present in animals where the adrenal gland has been removed. Although such stress triggers adrenaline release, it also activates many other responses within the central nervous system reward system which drives behavioral responses, so while the circulating adrenaline concentration is present, it may not drive behavior. Nevertheless, adrenaline infusion alone does increase alertness and has roles in the brain including the augmentation of memory consolidation.|$|E
