40|$|Three coating {{solutions}} {{have been}} used to coat emulsion masks to deter-mine Whether any benefits might be realized. It was found that these coat-ings enable one to increase mask life and reduce the defect density. Capacitor yields and pinhole counts have been determined which show significant yield enhancement over noncoated emulsion masks. It has been further shown that an adequate soft bake cycle of photoresisted wafers to remove solvents prior to exposure is essential in obtaining maximum yield with or without coatings on the masks. Device yield in the semiconductor industry is strongly dependent upon effective photoresist proc-essing which minimizes photolithographic defects. Schnable et al. have published an excellent review of passivation coatings on silicon including such defects in <b>passivation</b> <b>glass</b> (1). Pinholes and cracks in passiva...|$|E
40|$|Defects in {{photolithographic}} processing {{account for}} large yield losses in semiconductor device fabrication. A major {{factor contributing to}} these defects is pinholes formed by photoresist pieces pulled from the resisted layer with subsequent undesired etching of oxide, metal, or <b>passivation</b> <b>glass</b> during processing. Further, for negative photoresist, pieces on the mask "print" during exposure forming latent defects which etch during processing also giving shorts, parted metal, and the like. Using surface chemical principles of lubrication, a resist protect coat (RPC) formulation based on polyvinyl al-cohol, a surfactant, and a lubricant has been developed which greatly mini-mizes these defects. Significant increases in effective mask use and increased yields for three layer metal devices are shown. It {{is well known that}} repeated mask-wafer contacts in semiconductor photolithography severely deteriorate process yield and photomasks. Pieces of resist tor...|$|E

DTA curves for ZnO-B 203 -PbO-Si 02 <b>passivation</b> <b>glasses</b> {{using the}} Rigaku DTA system, {{are given in}} Fig. 1, where % is glass {{transition}} point (log V = 13. 3), M e is deforma-tion point (log V = 11. 0), T ~ is softening point (log V = 7. 6), Tsi,t is sintering point (log V = 6. 0), and Tr is flow point (log V = 5. 0). The heating rate for measuring DTA curves was 10 ~ As listed in Table II, Tg, Tf, and the other points are raised {{with an increase in}} SiO 2 and a decrease in B 203, regardless of the amount of ZnO and PbO. As the Al~O 3, P 20 ~, and ZnF 2 contents are small, it seems likely that they do not affect the variations in glass viscosity points. Typical infrared absorption spectra are repre-sented in Fig. 2, which exhibit sharp absorption bands nearly at 2. 7 nm, caused by OH stretching vibration. Com-pared with the spectrum for an untreated glass without fluoride, the OH absorption band removal was carried out completely by dry air bubbling treatment for a fluoride containing molten glass. Low flow point and OH-free glasses are suitable for semiconductor device passivations, because they are not harmful to the reliabil-ity and I-V curves of passivated evices...|$|R

Their physical and elec-trical properties were compared using DTA characteristics, SEM observations, x-ray diffraction patterns, thermal ex-pansion coefficients, and surface charge densities, as a function of firing temperature. Reverse characteristics of semi-conductor devices passivated with these glasses were also investigated. Differences in the variation of properties with firing temperature between the two glasses were found to originate mainly from differences in the variation of crystal morphology in the glasses as a function of firing temperature.

Thermistors are solidstate electronic devices that detect changes in temperature. These devices have a broad field of use ranging from aerospace applications to consumer electronics. Current thermistor manufacturing involves a labor-intensive <b>glass</b> <b>passivation</b> coating process, which is a bottleneck to the thermistor throughput. In an effort to increase manufacturing efficiency, a coupled process involving a fluidized bed and co-fire termination process is being developed by a Senior Project Team. Optimization of the fluidized bed and co-fire processes were investigated using a design of experiments (DOE) approach. The DOE was used to evaluate the main factor effects of the binder, glass frit, and temperatures associated with the process.

40|$|Although {{the concept}} of {{constructing}} active optical waveguides in crystalline silicon has existed for over twenty years, {{it is only in}} the past few years that silicon photonics has been given serious attention as a displacing technology. Fueled by the predicted saturation of "Moore's Law" within the next decade, universities and industries from all over the world are exploring the possibilities of creating truly integrated silicon opto-electronic devices in a cost effective manner. Some of the most promising silicon photonics technologies are chip-to-chip and intra-chip optical interconnects. Now that compact high-speed modulators in silicon have been achieved, the limiting factor in the widespread adoption of optical interconnects is the lack of practical on-chip optical sources. These sources are critical for the generation of the many wavelengths of light necessary for high-speed communication between the logical elements between and within microprocessors. Unfortunately, crystalline silicon is widely known as a poor emitter because of its indirect bandgap. This thesis focuses on the many challenges in generating silicon-based laser sources. As most CMOS compatible gain materials possess at most 1 dB/cm of gain, much of our work has been devoted to minimizing the optical losses in silicon optical microresonators. Silicon microdisk resonators fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers were employed to study and minimize the different sources of scattering and absorption present in high-index contrast Si microcavities. These microdisks supported whispering-gallery modes with quality factors as high as 5 x 10 ^ 6, close to the bulk limit of lightly doped silicon wafers. An external silica fiber taper probe was developed to test the microcavities in a rapid wafer-scale manner. Analytic theory and numerical simulation aided in the optimization of the cavity design and interpretation of experimental results. After successfully developing surface chemistry treatments and <b>passivation</b> layers, erbium-doped <b>glasses</b> were deposited over undercut microdisks and planar microrings. Single-mode laser oscillation was observed and carefully characterized for heavily oxidized silicon microdisks. Dropped power thresholds of 690 nW, corresponding to 170 nW of absorbed power, were measured from gain-spectra and Light in-Light out curves. In addition, quantum efficiencies for these lasers were as high as 24 %, indicating that this technology may be ready for further development into real-world devices...|$|R
