50|$|In 2009 Fiat Powertrain {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of this technology, called Multijet II. With its new and innovative injectors with hydraulically balanced solenoid valve and even higher injection pressure of 2,000 bar (29,000 psi) {{it is capable of}} even more precise controlling of the injected diesel fuel, injecting it in a quicker and more flexible manner. It enables up to eight consecutive injections per combustion cycle and implemented Injection Rate Shaping technology, which provides two very close <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> making the fuel delivery more continuous and modulated. This results in an engine that is quiet and has a smoother operation, lower emissions, better fuel mileage and higher performance compared to the previous generation.|$|E
5000|$|This engine uses Toyota's D-4D Common Rail fuel {{injection}} technology operating at ultra high pressures {{of up to}} 135 mpa (1350 bar or about 19,580 psi) which is about 8 {{times more than the}} pressure of conventional {{fuel injection}} systems within a [...] "common rail" [...] that feeds the injectors on all four cylinders. This is combined with a 32-bit ECU which controls fuel quantity, valve-timing, and boost pressure at different engine parameters resulting in best fuel economy and also full utilization of power during acceleration. <b>Pilot</b> <b>injection</b> is also utilized by the common rail fuel system to smooth engine operation. Small amounts of fuel are introduced into the combustion chamber prior to the main injection event, reducing lag time and promoting more continuous and complete combustion. Exterior and interior engine noise is also reduced.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} post-start cold idling behaviour {{has been carried}} out on a modern single-cylinder HPCR DI light duty diesel engine with a low compression ratio of 15. 5 : 1 at temperatures between 10 and - 20 °C. The trend toward lower compression ratios from more common values of around 22 : 1 a few years ago has resulted in lower compression pressures and temperatures, which negatively affects cold idle operation. Improvements in cycle-by-cycle stability of indicated work output through fuel injection strategy and glow plug temperature changes have been explored. This is important to improve NVH and the consumer’s perception of vehicle quality. The key effects on heat release characteristics have been identified and the associated impact on stability discussed. High speed imaging of ignition in a combustion bomb has been used to aid interpretation of engine results. Up to four <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> placed in advance of the main have been used. Shorter separation between pilots and pilot-to-main improves stability independent of the number of <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> and extends the range of main injection timings to meet target stability of 10 % or lower at - 20 °C. Increasing the number of <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> was effective in stabilising combustion at all investigated soak temperatures at fuelling levels producing indicated work required to match friction and ancillary demands. Stability can be susceptible to deterioration at moderate soak temperatures because fuelling demand is relatively low. If a high number of <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> are to be avoided to reduce potential wear, then increasing main injection quantity is an effective method to stabilise combustion for a lower pilot number strategy but any increase above target load has to be harnessed by additional ancillary devices. Very high glow plug temperatures of up to 1200 °C were examined using a smaller diameter tip ceramic type design. Stable combustion cannot be achieved through higher glow plug temperatures alone. A temperature of 1000 °C, which can be achieved using a low voltage metallic type, is adequate to stabilise combustion when combined with a triple-pilot strategy at sub-zero temperatures. The best stability is achieved using 1200 °C, which can only be achieved using a more expensive ceramic type, in combination with a triple-pilot strategy producing the desirable target of ~ 5 % or below; the effects are not mutually exclusive. At high glow plug temperatures and using three or four <b>pilot</b> <b>injections,</b> stability improved with warmer soak temperatures. At - 5 °C, stability was relatively poor when one or two pilots were used irrespective of glow plug temperature. A high premixed contribution to main combustion is associated with improved stability. Minimum threshold values are necessary to stabilise combustion: ~ 25 J/° at - 20 °C, ~ 20 J/° at - 5 °C and only ~ 10 J/° at 10 °C. A higher number of <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> raises <b>pilot</b> induced combustion and improves mixture distribution. These effects subsequently increase the premixed combustion and help sustain a strong main development with less variability. This benefit is maximised when using hotter glow plug temperatures raising IMEPg magnitude and reducing variation...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{injection}} rate shaping and multi-pilot events {{can help to}} improve fuel efficiency, combustion noise and pollutant emissions in diesel engine, providing high flexibility {{in the shape of}} the injection that allows combustion process control. Different strategies can be used in order to obtain the required flexibility in the rate, such as very close <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> with almost zero Dwell Time or boot shaped <b>injections</b> with optional <b>pilot</b> <b>injections.</b> Modern Common-Rail Fuel Injection Systems (FIS) should be able to provide these innovative patterns to control the combustion phases intensity for optimal tradeoff between fuel consumption and emission levels.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} level of exhaust {{emissions}} and to improve the ignition characteristics, the effect of <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> on combustion was examined experimentally in a turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine, and was analyzed theoretically using a two-zone combustion model. The <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> effect was compared with the combustion in the injection without <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> and also with the effect of fuel additive as an ignition improver in two kinds of fuel : high-quality fuel having a cetane index of 57 and low-quality fuel having that of 40. It is found that the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> effectively reduces ignition delay at the retarded injection timing, under the low-load condition, {{and in the case}} of low-cetane fuel. The ignition delay of the main injection is reduced to about a half of that of the injection without <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> by the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> with the short interval between pilot and main injection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of DME-biodiesel, diesel-biodiesel and diesel fuels on the combustion and emission reduction characteristics of a compression ignition engine according to <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> and single injection strategies. In this investigation, the effect of <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> and single injection modes were studied as they pertain to the combustion and emission characteristics of three alternative fuels. These tests were conducted to display the effect of a DME-biodiesel blend (DME 80 B 20), biodiesel-diesel blend (B 80 D 20), and diesel fuel on a passenger car diesel engine. According to the combustion characteristics, the DME 80 B 20 fuel has a higher pressure than the B 80 D 20 and conventional diesel fuel, while the DME-biodiesel blend exhibits a lower peak in <b>pilot</b> <b>injection.</b> The maximum pressure of the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> mode showed significantly lower pressure than for single injection mode without <b>pilot</b> <b>injection.</b> In a <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> cycle, NOx emissions of DME-blend (DME 80 B 20) are higher than those of diesel and biodiesel-diesel blend (B 20 D 80), regardless of injection timings.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for diesel {{combustion}} {{has been investigated}} by means of AVL single cylinder engine tests and combustion observations {{in order to reduce}} the NOx emission at constant BSFC. The concept is based on <b>pilot</b> <b>injection.</b> In this method, some part of fuel is injected at an early stage, short prior the main injection. It is well known that <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> is effective to shorten ignition delay of the main injection.

40|$|A {{common goal}} for Diesel engine {{development}} {{is to reduce}} NOx and soot emissions while maintaining low fuel consumption.

When applying high injection pressures and multiple injections, pressure waves and pressure drops (caused by the injections) in the injection system are generated, and their effects on soot emissions are analyzed here. Since high fuel pressure has a strong beneficial effect on soot emissions it is desirable to keep it as high as possible. Multiple early (<b>pilot)</b> <b>injections</b> do not reduce the fuel pressure significantly while late (post) injections, after and in interaction with a main injection; can result in very low injection pressures.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} idea of igniting LPG in a {{compression}} ignition diesel engine using <b>pilot</b> diesel <b>injection</b> as spark ignition medium. The main advancement in using this technology on current diesel engines is {{the establishment of a}} better balance between NOx and PM emissions without losing too much of the CO 2 benefits of diesel. With the advent of common rail diesel engines, it is now possible to get control of <b>pilot</b> diesel <b>injection</b> and make the LPG and diesel control systems work together. Combined diesel and LPG operation is a new subject for engine research, so the thesis moves on to consider the results from detailed engine simulation studies that explore the potential benefits of the mix. Subsequent simulations of a modern four cylinder dCi engine suggest that with closer control over the <b>pilot</b> diesel <b>injection,</b> diesel like performance can be obtained, hopefully with less emissions than currently expected from diesel only operation. A single cylinder variable compression ratio research engine was developed to explore diesel /LPG dual fuel operation. A second generation common rail injection rig was also developed for the engine and for fuel spray characterisation. Engine experiments proved the concept of using a modest charge of pilot injected diesel for igniting a larger dose of port injected LPG. The experimental work results suggest that combining diesel common rail injection technology with {{the state of the art}} LPG injection systems, it is possible to establish a better balance between NOx/ PM emissions without losing too much of the CO 2 benefits from the diesel operation.

The model was evaluated over the full engine speed, load and EGR operating envelope and cylinder pressure metrics were predicted with R 2 values above 0. 94.

40|$|The {{need for}} this thesis comes from the timely {{objective}} to minimize emissions and maximize efficiency in combustion engines. The latest trend in the marine industry is to utilize dual fuel engines as the power source for vessels, allowing the engine to be run on both diesel and gas. In the gas mode, the gas is ignited by injecting {{a small amount of}} diesel, in a so-called <b>pilot</b> <b>injection,</b> into the combustion chamber. The <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> event, and the fuel injector creating it, is the topic of this thesis. To be able to understand the operation of a fuel injector, mechanic, hydraulic and electromagnetic theory is presented. Next, fuel injector operation is descripted. Then, a simulation model of the fuel injector is built and verified. Sensitivity analyses are made for both the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> and the full injection event, for the purpose of understanding which parameters affect the injector outputs. Finally, both the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> and the full injection event are optimized in order to reach the emission and efficiency targets. The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the most important parameters affecting the injector performance are the inlet, outlet and filling orifices. Naturally, also the number of nozzle holes and the hole diameters play a crucial role, a smaller flow area resulting in a faster <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> but less injected quantity in a full injection. The pressure step and the needle spring have a lesser impact. The geometry of the needle tip is also important but hard to model accurately. In the studied injector, the control valve was so fast that it did not restrict the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> speed.

This study investigate the effects of <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> using a rapid compression machine together with the schlieren photography and direct photography methods. The detail behavior of mixture formation during ignition delay period was investigated using the schlieren photography system with a high speed digital video camera. This method can capture spray evaporation, spray interference and mixture formation clearly with real images. Ignition process and flame development were investigated by direct photography method using a light sensitive high-speed color digital video camera. <b>Pilot</b> <b>injection</b> promotes mixture formation during ignition delay period and slower oxidation reaction and thus leads to earlier rise and lower peak heat release rate...|$|E
40|$|Low {{temperature}} combustion (LTC) {{modes of}} operating internal combustion engines are {{of great interest}} for their potential to achieve high thermal efficiencies while maintaining low nitrogen oxide (NOX) and particulate matter emissions below levels requiring costly after-treatment systems. While various strategies for realizing LTC have been developed, including homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI), a common challenge is {{the control of the}} kinetically-driven auto-ignition processes over appreciable load ranges. This study examines the chemical kinetics of split-injection timing and the kinetic effect of this parameter on combustion phasing and pressure rise rate. Detailed reaction mechanisms are applied in CHEMKIN-based kinetic simulations to model the production and composition of combustion intermediates produced by a <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> through different pressure-temperature histories. The influence of these intermediates on the combustion phasing of the following main fuel ignition is examined. Different <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> timings were tried keeping the main fuel addition timing constant. The temperature, pressure and rate of heat release profiles during the combustion cycle for varied pilot fuel injection timings were compared along with the species composition at the start of main fuel addition. The results will provide insight to the role of <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> timing on LTC control...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> on engine noise using a single cylinder combustion ignition engine. The engine rotary speed was fixed at 1200 RPM and a 10 -mg quantity was injected at a <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> ratio of 1 : 9, 2 : 8, or 3 : 7. The engine performance parameters were calculated from the combustion pressure data acquired by a piezoelectric transducer (6057 A 80, Kistler), which {{was placed in the}} location of the glow plug. Engine noise was measured at a distance and height of 1 meter each from the engine for 9 - 10 seconds and analyzed using a commercial sound analysis program. By analyzing in-cylinder pressure and sound quality metrics, the following conclusions were obtained. The frequency analysis showed that the combustion noise was distributed at the frequency bands from 1100 Hz to 1900 Hz and from 2100 Hz to 2900 Hz. Pilot injections lowered the maximum rate of pressure increase, and the trend of the maximum pressure rise rate varied significantly according to injection pressure. The maximum pressure rise rate exhibited a linear relationship with sound level and loudness. Thus, the <b>pilot</b> <b>injection</b> strategy appeared to improve engine noise characteristics.

40|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{port injection}} system was built up using low pressure injectors installed on a commmon rail. Methanol/water blend was injected into each suction port of a four cylinder turbocharged DI diesel engine by controlling the injection timing and duration electronically. The optimum {{conditions of the}} injected amount of methanol/water blend and the blending ratio of methanol and water were investigated to obtain simultaneous reduction in both NO_x and smoke without increasing fuel consumption. In the theoretical study, the effect of methanol/water blend on combustion and NO formation was analyzed by using the two-zone model. The proposed auxiliary port injection of meth anol/water blend combined with the <b>pilot</b> fuel <b>injection</b> could be a feasible countermeasure...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} using an SI {{stratified}} charge {{in combination with}} HCCI combustion on combustion phasing, {{rate of heat release}} and emissions were investigated in engine experiments to identify ways to extend the operational range of HCCI combustion to lower loads. In the experiments an optical single-cylinder engine equipped with a piezo electric outward-opening injector and operated with negative valve overlap (NVO) and low lift, short duration, camshaft profiles, was used to initiate HCCI combustion by increasing the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and thus retaining sufficient thermal energy to reach auto-ignition temperatures. Two series of experiments with full factorial designs were performed, to investigate how the tested parameters (amounts of fuel injected in <b>pilot</b> <b>injections</b> and main injections, stratification injection timing and spark-assistance) influenced the combustion. In the optical study fourth harmonic light (266 nm) from a Nd:YAG laser was used to induce fluorescence (LIF), from 3 -pentanone added as a fuel tracer, to analyze the concentration and distribution of fuel vapor within the cylinder. In addition third harmonic light (355 nm) was used to study the concentration and distribution of formaldehyde in the cylinder, and chemiluminescence signals from OH radicals were used to locate the flame front. It was found that the injection and ignition timing of the SI stratified charge were the main parameters influencing the HCCI combustion phasing. The NOX emissions were found to be significantly affected by the use of a SI stratified charge, and its injection timing. The results show that use of an SI stratified charge can extend the operational range of HCCI combustion to lower loads by advancing combustion phasing. In addition, use of NVO in combination with an SI stratified charge provides a useful, flexible means to control HCCI combustion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} an active control system for lean blowout (LBO) in a premixed combustor. The investigated control system consists of acoustical and optical sensors, an optimal, rule-based controller and a pilot fuel actuator. The controller uses the acoustic and/or optical sensors to detect the presence of “extinguishment events ” in the flame stabilization region. The frequency (number of events per second) dramatically increases as LBO is approached. LBO is prevented by “actuating ” a pilot fuel valve that increases the {{fraction of the total}} fuel injected through a small pilot port. The piloted combustion region acts to stabilize the overall combustion process. It is shown that the use of the <b>pilot</b> fuel <b>injection</b> allows safe combustor operation at a lower overall equivalence ratio, which results in significant reduction of NOx emissions...|$|R
