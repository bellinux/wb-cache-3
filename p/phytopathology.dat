5|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of <b>phytopathology,</b> the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of lab work and research in pathology concerns the development of disease in humans, pathology is of significance throughout the biological sciences. Two main catch-all fields exist to represent most complex organisms capable of serving as host to a pathogen or other form of disease: veterinary pathology (concerned with all non-human species of kingdom of Animalia) and <b>phytopathology,</b> which studies disease in plants.|$|E

In 1929, {{she became a}} charter member of the Canadian Phytopathological Society {{and became one of}} the editors for the journal <b>Phytopathology.</b> Newton identified physiologically distinct races of Puccinia graminis and focused on determining their genetic structure, physiology, origin, and life cycle. She investigated stripe rust on wheat and barley and wheat leaf rust, and the environmental factors on disease expression in wheat plants. She also researched the genetic structure of wheat rust pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The IALA {{closed its}} doors in 1953 but was not {{formally}} dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed Interlingua Division. Hugh E. Blair, Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant. A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute, was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on <b>phytopathology</b> produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.|$|E

2500|$|Economically, one of {{the most}} {{important}} areas of research in environmental physiology is that of <b>phytopathology,</b> the study of diseases in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection. [...] Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, as well as physical invasion by insects and roundworms.|$|E
2500|$|An arborist's {{work may}} involve {{very large and}} complex trees, or {{ecological}} communities and their abiotic components {{in the context of}} the landscape ecosystem. [...] These may require monitoring and treatment to ensure they are healthy, safe, and suitable to property owners or community standards. This work may include some or all of the following: planting; transplanting; pruning; structural support; preventing, or diagnosing and treating <b>phytopathology</b> or parasitism; preventing or interrupting grazing or predation; installing lightning protection; and removing vegetation deemed as hazardous, an invasive species, a disease vector, or a weed.|$|E
2500|$|George Carver Clerk (born 29 July 1931) is a Ghanaian {{botanist}} and Professor Emeritus at the University of Ghana, Legon whose research {{focused on}} the ecology and the pathology of plant diseases (<b>phytopathology),</b> indigenous to Ghana and West Africa. Clerk, along with his academic contemporary Ebenezer Laing, is one of Ghana's earliest practitioners of botany as a scientific discipline, {{in addition to being}} a pioneering plant pathologist [...] in West Africa. G. C. Clerk was also inducted as a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} plant {{physiology}} includes {{the study of}} all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with life as they occur in plants. [...] This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are molecular interactions of photosynthesis and internal diffusion of water, minerals, and nutrients. [...] At the largest scale are the processes of plant development, seasonality, dormancy, and reproductive control. [...] Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include phytochemistry (the study of the biochemistry of plants) and <b>phytopathology</b> (the study of disease in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research.|$|E
2500|$|He taught {{biology at}} Prempeh College at the {{beginning}} of his career. He later became a professor of botany at the University of Ghana, Legon. While at the University of Ghana, he served as the Hall Tutor for the residential hall, Akuafo Hall from 1979 to 1980. His research interest is in plant pathology and has authored more than 100 book chapters, peer-reviewed journal articles, abstracts and other scientific publications. Clerk's work on plant diseases in Ghana and West Africa has influenced the blueprint for national science and industrial policy in relation to plant development in the agricultural sector within the sub-region. He was also a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria. In 1973, he became a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the only [...] to be elected that year. He served on the board of directors of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission from 1996 to 1998 along with his academic colleague, Marian Ewurama Addy, the first Ghanaian woman professor of natural science. He has also been a resource person and consultant to the West African Examinations Council (WAEC). George Clerk's seminal book in botany and <b>phytopathology,</b> Crops and their diseases in Ghana, was published in 1974.|$|E
