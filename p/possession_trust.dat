50|$|An {{interest}} in <b>possession</b> <b>trust</b> {{is the most}} common example of a life interest trust. In a typical {{interest in}} <b>possession</b> <b>trust,</b> the life tenant receives all the income from the trust {{for the rest of his}} or her life. On the life tenant's death, the trust comes to an end, and the capital of the trust is paid to another person, known as the remainderman, as specified by the trust document.|$|E

5000|$|A trust {{can give}} the {{interest}} in possession to a beneficiary for a fixed period, for an indefinite period or, more usually, {{for the rest of}} the beneficiary's life. Such a life interest trust is the most common example of an interest in <b>possession</b> <b>trust.</b> In the United Kingdom, the 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charge may be due on assets transferred into this type of trust on or after 22 March 2006.|$|E

40|$|The {{presently}} entitled formula establishes and allocates {{tax liability}} for trust income in Div 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). However, entitlement {{does not provide}} a stable link between taxpayers and the economic advantages associated with trusts. The meanings of "presently entitled" and "trust estate" are ambiguous in both Anglo-Australian and American trusts law. Unsurprisingly, Australian courts have wrestled with the terms for many years. The utility of continuing with the presently entitled formula to tax trust income is questioned in light of the new specifically entitled regime for taxing trusts&# 039; capital gains. The article also considers interest in <b>possession</b> <b>trusts</b> in the United Kingdom and the recent authorities of Colonial First State Investments Ltd v FCT and Howard v FCT...|$|R
50|$|According to authors F. Nomani and A.

Islamic jurists divide {{properties}} into public, state, private categories.|$|R
50|$|In the {{combined}} jurisdiction of England and Wales since 1925 a freehold estate {{intended to be}} 'held' as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an interest in <b>possession</b> <b>trust.</b> The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are {{for a period of}} between 99 and 999 years 'leases for life' will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interest}} in <b>possession</b> <b>trust</b> {{is a form}} of legal arrangement which gives a person a [...] "present right to the present enjoyment of something". [...] At least one of the beneficiaries of this type of trust will have the right to receive the income generated by the trust (if trust funds are invested) or the right to enjoy the trust assets for the present time in another way, for example by living in a property owned by the trustees. The beneficiary with the right to enjoy the trust property for the time being is said to have an {{interest in}} possession and is colloquially described (though not always strictly accurately) as an income beneficiary.|$|E

40|$|The study aims {{to examine}} the {{concepts}} of ḍamān (guarantee), taqṣīr (negligence) and taʿaddī (transgression) from Sharīʿah {{point of view and}} their relations with both trust-based contracts (ʿuqūd al-amānāt) and guarantee-based contracts (ʿuqūd al-ḍamānāt). The study conducted the qualitative research approaches which consist of documents analysis, interviews and observations in few phases.

50|$|The second {{ground for}} the {{decision}} was that A's failure to give notice had left the beneficiary of the <b>trust</b> in apparent <b>possession</b> of the <b>trust</b> fund, and A could not, therefore, rely on this assignment in a dispute with B. This latter ground has been criticised as {{it appears to be}} based on the concept of reputed ownership in bankruptcy law, which had never previously been employed in determining priority between competing equitable claims. Nevertheless, on the facts of the case most commentators feel that justice was done; A had allowed the beneficiary to commit a fraud on B, and therefore A should rank behind B.|$|R
40|$|Human Being is {{the most}} {{important}} asset of our planet. Living environment is very important for him. Recently, problems between human and his living environment have come out and severe difficulties have emerged. Globalization has raised the problem and the planet started to scream the reality that it shoult be deal with. Over-industrialization after the second Wotld War and the consequent pollution have brought up theenvironmental problems. Excessive use of natural resources has raised the problems, and humankind began to look for solutions to the problems. Environment-related problems have changed human’s view of environment. As a result of this, new diciplines in the philosophical perspectives, “Environmental Philosophy” and “Environmental Ethics” have begun to take their place. Environmental Ethics examines human’s view of environment. It isn’t a consept that has emerged today. Throughout the history,man has always been with his environment and always hadopsitive or negative opinions of it. Human’s view of environment will be more valuable if it is cosidered in the belief that it isn’t a <b>possession</b> but a <b>trust...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a reference implementation of CapaFS, a global, decentralised file {{system that allows}} users to collaborate with other users anywhere in the world, with no prior arrangements or connections. The system uses filenames as sparse capabilities to name and grant access to files on remote servers. Users can share files by exchanging capability filenames with parties that they <b>trust.</b> <b>Possession</b> of a capability filename is the necessary and sufficient proof of authority to perform the operations, authorised by the capability on the file it names. CapaFS {{does not need to}} establish trust between client and server, it only needs to verify the validity of the CapaFS capability filename. By using CapaFS we can demonstrate a globally accessable file system with a uniform namespace, that does not need any central authority to manage the namespace. We show that the capability filenames used in CapaFS are a secure and practical solution to sharing resources. We also prove the reference implementation of CapaFS can offer reasonable performance when compared with systems like NFS. The results of CapaFS show that the cost of software encryption can be tolerated in large networks like the Internet, where the cost of encryption is {{a small percentage of the}} total delay. CapaFS offers new functionality to users which sucessfully promotes the sharing of files and collaboration on the Internet, without imposing significant costs in terms of overhead and performance...|$|R
40|$|Museums, {{in their}} {{broadest}} sense, are institutions which hold their <b>possessions</b> in <b>trust</b> for human kind {{and for the}} future welfare of the human race.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as a first step}} for the examination of effects of the freshman orientation camp（ FC） on students’ well-adapted college life. Three months after the first-year students participated in the program, they were asked to answer their states of school adjustment including their satisfactions of their school life, anxieties of their study, personal growth, utilization of the FC, and other variables. In addition to these, the Japanese version of the Social Provision Scale was tested for future administration, since it has been widely used {{all over the world and}} the development of social provision was reported through outdoor orientation programs in the United States. 　From the results of analyses, the effectiveness and some issues of the Social Provision Scale were found especially subscales. In this study only total score of the social provision were used for analyses. The score of social provision was significantly positively correlated with all factors of the school adjustment including comfortability at school, a sense of being <b>trusted,</b> <b>possession</b> of goals, and absence of a sense of inferiority. Furthermore, students who had higher levels of social provision showed higher levels of satisfaction in their school life, more opportunities to utilize their abilities at school, higher levels of pride regarding their school, and higher levels of personal growths. In relation to the utilization of the FC, students who felt higher levels of utilizations of the FC showed higher levels of school adjustments, more opportunities to utilize their abilities at school, more pride in their school, and higher levels of personal growth. 　The results of this study implied the contributions of the FC on students’ well-adjusted school life, excluding the aspect of academic achievement. At same time, the improvements of the Japanese version of the Social Provision Scale and future examinations to prove the effects of the FC are necessary for future study...|$|R
6000|$|While {{the rulers}} of Germany to-day are more openly {{aggressive}} and imperialist {{than they were in}} August, 1914, the Allies arrayed against them have made great progress in clearing up and realizing the instincts and ideals which brought them originally into the struggle. The German government offers the world to-day a warring future in which Germany alone is to be secure and powerful and proud. Mankind will not endure that. The Allies offer the world more and more definitely the scheme of an organized League of Free Nations, a rule of law and justice about the earth. To fight for that and for no other conceivable end, the United States of America, with the full sympathy and co-operation of every state in the western hemisphere, has entered the war. The British Empire, {{in the midst of the}} stress of the great war, has set up in Dublin a Convention of Irishmen of all opinions with the fullest powers of deciding upon the future of their country. If Ireland were not divided against herself she could be free and equal with England to-morrow. It is the open intention of Great Britain to develop representative government, where it has not hitherto existed, in India and Egypt, to go on steadfastly increasing the share of the natives of these countries in the government of their own lands, until they too become free and equal members of the world league. Neither France nor Italy nor Britain nor America has ever tampered with the shipping of other countries except in time of war, and the trade of the British Empire has been impartially open to all the world. The extra-national [...] "possessions," [...] the so-called [...] "subject nations" [...] in the Empires of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, are, in fact, <b>possessions</b> held in <b>trust</b> against the day when the League of Free Nations will inherit for mankind.|$|R
60|$|Well, my Lords, {{he searched}} the seraglio. When {{you have to}} take into {{consideration}} the guardianship of a person of great dignity, there are two circumstances to be attended to: one, a faithful and affectionate guardianship of his person; and the other, a strong interest in his authority, and the means of exercising that authority in a proper and competent manner. Mr. Hastings, when {{he was looking for a}} woman in the seraglio, (for he could find women only there,) must have found actually in authority there the Nabob's own mother: certainly a person who by nature was most fit to be his guardian; and there is no manner of doubt of her being sufficiently competent to that duty. Here, then, was a legitimate wife of the Nabob Jaffier Ali Khân, a woman of rank and distinction, fittest to take care of the person and interests, as far as a woman could take care of them, of her own son. In this situation she had been placed before, during the administration of Mahomed Reza Khân, by the direct orders of the Governor, Sir John Cartier. She had, I say, been put in <b>possession</b> of that <b>trust</b> which it was natural and proper to give to such a woman. But what does Mr. Hastings do? He deposes this woman. He strips her of her authority with which he found her invested under the sanction of the English government. He finds out a woman in the seraglio, called Munny Begum, who was bound to the Nabob by no tie whatever of natural affection. He makes this woman the guardian of the young Nabob's person. She had a son who had been placed upon the musnud after the death of his father, Sujah Dowlah, and had been appointed his guardian. This young Nabob died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by Nujim ul Dowlah, another natural son of Sujah Dowlah. This prince being left without a mother, this woman was suffered to retain the guardianship of the Nabob till his death. When Mobarek ul Dowlah, a legitimate son of Sujah Dowlah, succeeded him, Sir John Cartier did what his duty was: he put the Nabob's own mother into the place which she was naturally entitled to hold, the guardianship of her own son, and displaced Munny Begum. The whole of the arrangement by which Munny Begum was appointed guardian of the two preceding Nabobs stands in the Company's records stigmatized as a transaction base, wicked, and corrupt. We will read to your Lordships an extract from a letter which has the signature of Mr. Sumner, the gentleman who sits here by the side of Mr. Hastings, and from which you will learn what the Company and the Council thought of the original nomination of Munny Begum and of her son. You will find that they considered her as a great agent and instrument of all the corruption there; and that this whole transaction, by which the bastard son of Munny Begum was brought forward to the prejudice of the legitimate son of the Nabob, was considered to be, what it upon the very face of it speaks itself to be, corrupt and scandalous.|$|R
