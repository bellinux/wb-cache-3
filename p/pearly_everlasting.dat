50|$|<b>Pearly</b> <b>everlastings</b> are {{suitable}} for flower beds and floral arrangements. They provide attractive, but not brilliant displays of bloom in late summer and fall. They are sometimes placed adjacent to red or blue flowers for aesthetic purposes. The flowers are useful for cutting and are easily prepared for dried arrangements. This is done by cutting them before they attain their fullest opening and before the whiteness of the stems and foliage begins to dim, tying the stems in small bundles, and hanging them in a cool, airy, shaded place. It {{is not uncommon to}} color the dried flowers by dipping them in dyes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pearly</b> <b>everlastings</b> thrive {{with little}} care in sunny {{locations}} where {{the soil is}} thoroughly well drained and tends to be dryish rather than wet. They are easily increased by division in early spring, and can be raised from seeds. Dividing in fall is {{likely to result in}} winter losses. On poor soils these plants benefit from a spring application of a complete garden fertilizer, but this is unnecessary where the soil is reasonably fertile. Old plants that show signs of deterioration should be dug up, divided, and replanted in fall or spring. This may be needed every third or fourth year.|$|R
50|$|Anaphalis is a genus of {{herbaceous}} {{and woody}} flowering plants within the Asteraceae family, {{whose members are}} commonly known by the name pearl or <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting.</b> There are around 110 species with the vast majority being native to central and southern Asia. There is one species native to North America that is fairly well known and popular in cultivation, namely the western <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> (Anaphalis margaritacea).|$|E
50|$|Anaphalis margaritacea, {{commonly}} known as the western <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> or <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting,</b> is an Asian and North American species of flowering perennial plant in the sunflower family. It is widespread across most of the United States and Canada, as well as northwestern Mexico. Asian populations are found in China, the Russian Far East, Japan, Korea, northern Indochina, and the Himalayas. The species is reportedly naturalized in Europe though not native there.|$|E

Commonly used {{medicine}} plants included Yerba santa, yarrow, giant hyssop, Brewer's angelica, sagebrush, showy milkweed, mountain dogbane, balsamroot, California barberry, fleabane, mint, knotweed, wild rose, meadow goldenrod, mule ears, <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting,</b> and the California laurel.|$|E
50|$|The diet of Speyeria zerene varies {{throughout}} its life history. When the larva emerges {{in the spring}} the diet consists solely on {{the leaves of the}} blue violet (Viola adunca). When the adult emerges from its chrysalis it will feed solely on nectar of flowers. It feeds on a variety of plants including ones from the Asteraceae family, its main source of nutrition, but other families of plants that the butterfly may feed on include thistles, asters, yarrow, and <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting.</b>|$|E

50|$|Deer are browsers. During {{the winter}} and early spring, they feed on Douglas-fir, western red cedar, red huckleberry, salal, deer fern, and lichens growing on trees. Late spring to fall, they consume grasses, blackberries, apples, fireweed, <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting,</b> forbs, salmonberry, salal, and maple. The mating or 'rutting' season occurs during November and early December. Bucks can be {{observed}} running {{back and forth across}} the roads in the pursuit of does. After the rut, the bucks tend to hide and rest, often nursing wounds. They suffer broken antlers, and have lost weight. They drop their antlers between January and March. Antlers on the forest floor provide a source of calcium and other nutrients to other forest inhabitants. Bucks regrow their antlers beginning in April through to August.|$|E
5000|$|Fire moss prefers low {{competition}} and high light; however, {{it is somewhat}} shade tolerant. [...] It is a colonizer of disturbed sites and readily invades mineral soil by spores. [...] Fire moss is typically found associated with other species characteristic of disturbed sites such as fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) and <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> (Anaphalis margaritacea). [...] Fire moss is often replaced by flowering plants in later stages of succession. [...] In the black spruce (Picea mariana)-lichen woodlands of Alaska and Canada, {{the first stage of}} revegetation, which lasts from 1 to 20 years, is dominated by pioneer mosses such as fire moss. Fire moss continues to increase {{in the early part of}} the shrub stage but begins to decrease toward the end of this stage.|$|E
50|$|Wildflowers are {{a common}} site among the foliage around the tubs and the {{surrounding}} forests. The northeast is home to {{many different types of}} wildflower and the tubs is no exception."About 60 kinds of wildflowers have been observed, including <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> (Anaphalis margaritacea), wild lettuce (Prenanthes alba), jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum), closed gentian (Gentiana andrewsii), pink lady's slipper (Cypripedium acaule), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris), small round-leaved orchis (Orchis rotundifolia), and harebell (Campanula rotundifolia). Tailing arbutus (Epigaea repens), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia), and blueberry also thrive here."There is a multitude of categories of foliage in the area. The trees in the area vary greatly and are fairly dense in vegetation. The vegetation surrounding the tubs includes hemlock and yellow, grey, and black birch trees, as well as white and red chestnuts. Bear oaks {{are a common}} sight among the foliage as well as the tulip tree, red and striped maples, big-tooth and quaking aspens, American sycamore, American beech, white ash, slippery elm, sassafras, white gum, witch-hazel, flowering dogwood, staghorn sumac, as well as white, red, and pitch pines.|$|E
30|$|At the Tyee Fire in late summer, {{the seed}} {{richness}} of high severity fire patches {{was greater than}} in the paired low severity patches. This greater richness resulted primarily from the addition of perennial native forbs including <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> (Anaphalis margaritacea), grand collomia (Collomia grandiflora), fireweed, and a few graminoids, including pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens) and western fescue (Festuca occidentalis). The late season spike in richness corresponded to the late season spike in total seed production in these patches.|$|E
40|$|Douglas fir duff {{moisture}} when {{correlated with}} the average relative humidity for 60 -minute periods ending one hour before the moisture measurements also gave a positive correlation of 0. 97. (The sine curve analysis showed duff to have a lag of about one and one-half hours.) Correlation of the moisture in decayed wood with humidity data likewise yielded a positive correlation of 0. 97. Of the 21 fuels studied, western white pine duff gave the best correlation, 0. 98, and lowlaud white fir duff gave the poorest, 0. 89. As indicative of the sufficiency of the data for correlation purposes, the standard deviations of the correlation coefficients {{were found to be}} of the order of & 0. 01. Estimates of current fuel moisture conditions based on atmospheric relative humidity show standard errors of estimate ranging from & 2. 3 per cent moisture for <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> down to but icO. 3 per cent moisture for Douglas fir twigs. For example the standard error of the estimates of braken fern moisture was calculated to be ic 1. 6 per cent moisture.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in {{non-timber forest products}} (NTFPs) has led to their greater recognition in sustainable forest management planning. This is evident in local resource management plans for the Robson Valley in east-central British Columbia, where public input shows {{strong support for the}} sustainable development of NTFP harvesting. However, information needed to develop sustainable management guidelines for NTFPs is currently lacking. We, therefore, undertook an inventory of non-timber forest product plant and fungal species in the Robson Valley. The distribution and abundance of NTFP plant species was determined by ecosystem types as described by the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification system used in British Columbia. Species with a relatively high abundance and commercial potential included the valuable medicinal plant Devil’s club (Oplopanax horridus), berry-producing species such as black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), and the edible ostrich fern (Matteuccia struthiopteris). Plants used for floral greenery that are relatively abundant in certain ecosystem types included falsebox (Paxistima myrsinites), tall Oregon-grape (Mahonia aquifolium), <b>pearly</b> <b>everlasting</b> (Anaphalis margaritacea), and conifer boughs, especially from western redcedar (Thuja plicata). We identified a number of fungal species noted for their food, medicinal, wildcrafting, industrial, or traditional uses. Among the important food mushrooms we recorded in the Robson Valley were pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare), hedgehog mushroom (Hydnum repandum), and black morel (Morchella elata). Several information gaps were identified. We recommend that future research focus on gathering detailed information about selected NTFP species. Information describing habitats, growth requirements, production levels, and response to harvesting is needed to develop sustainable management strategies...|$|E
