5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is {{the study}} of the theory and {{practice}} of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. Cultivated plant taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning over}} his non-research duties to Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, and Watson, Gray {{concentrated}} more {{on research and}} writing, especially on <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> as well as lecturing around the country, largely promoting Darwinian ideas. Many of his lectures during this time were given at the Yale Divinity School. Liberty Hyde Bailey worked as Gray's herbarium assistant for two years during 1883–1884.|$|E

5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science. In principle, their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants {{for the purposes of}} scientific research, conservation, display, and education, although this will depend on the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated <b>Plant</b> <b>Taxonomy.</b> Hortax also publishes Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} {{the historical development of}} cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present-day International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.|$|E

5|$|Cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is {{one part}} of the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or {{government}} departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|The International Association for <b>Plant</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> (IAPT) {{promotes}} {{an understanding}} of plant biodiversity, facilitates international communication of research between botanists, and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E
5|$|The key {{activities}} of cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants are {{separate from the}} methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E

Notably much of her time went into uncompromising reviews of manuscripts and theses. She excelled in picking her way through botanical nomenclature and spent countless hours helping others with nomenclature problems. Luella worked tirelessly to make the International Botanical Code of Nomenclature (now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants) more easily understood, less equivocal, more comprehensive, and hence more useful.

This subgenus is represented by eight valid species from Indian Himalayas viz. B. ferganicus B. novus, B. morawatizianus, B. cornutus, B. branickii, B. skorikovi, B. tibetanus and B. turneri. Due emphasis has been laid on their altitudional distribution, food <b>plants,</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> synonymy, and illustrations. Being their parasitic nature these species lack worker caste and has negligible role in pollination ecology although they have got preference to forage on different host plants. The species were observed feeding sluggishly on flower heads of Rosa weibbiana, Cirsium spp. and Trifoium spp. Many new food plants of these species have been recorded {{for the first time}} from the area under study.

5|$|Modern botany is a broad, {{multidisciplinary}} {{subject with}} inputs from most {{other areas of}} science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, plant propagation, breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, {{and the maintenance of}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{was barely}} known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his {{writings}} were popularized there {{only in the}} 15th century, when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza {{at the request of}} pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval pharmacology, which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. By the same token, however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance thought in the form of illustrated encyclopedias—which were still heavily based on classical writings.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E

40|$|One of <b>plant</b> <b>taxonomy's</b> {{numerous}} {{goals is}} to provide a serviceable classification that biologists, foresters and other professionals can use to identify accurately species {{in the course of their}} work. Most workers rely exclusively on state or regional floristic manuals, such as Flora of the Pacific Northwest (Hitchcock and Cronquist 1973), which sum-marize the species for a given area based on the opinions of numerous taxonomic authorities. Although these extensive references are invaluable, size limitations often make it im-possible to include adequately all the natural variation encountered during botanical field studies. This is particularly true if the focus in-volves rare or unusual taxa. Mimulus jepsonii (Scrophulariaceae), a delicate, annual rnonkeyflower with purplish-red corollas, provides an example of the problems that can arise in distinguishing rare from more common species. First described by Grant (1924), the species belongs to the Eunanus section of the genus, characterized by low-growing annuals with yellow or reddish flowers, often occurring in dry, sandy sites. Peck (1961) reported that M. jep-sonii occurred only from southern Klamath Coun-ty (Oregon) to Nevada and California, with the majority of collections from northern California. Because of its apparent rarity, Siddall et al. (1979) recognized M. jepsonii as a potentially en-dangered species for Oregon. Later, it was placed on the Sensitive Species List maintained b...|$|R
