5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the <b>party</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' <b>Party</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E

In the US, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had recruited mafia support to protect the New York City waterfront from Axis Powers sabotage since the US had entered the war in December 1941. The ONI collaborated with Lucky Luciano and his partner Meyer Lansky, a Jewish mobster, in what was called Operation Underworld. The resulting Mafia contacts were also used by the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) – the wartime predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) – during the invasion of Sicily. Later, the alliance was maintained in order to check the growing strength of the Italian Communist <b>party</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E

In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little to spend it on.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Apropos had run her ashore {{soon after}} Emerald {{had entered the}} harbour.

The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart. British casualties were heavy. Emerald had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy.|$|E

5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial <b>party,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} free elections, {{with the end}} of the Estado Novo period, only right-wing parties have governed the city: the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD. The CDS saw its {{popularity}} suffer an abrupt decline in 1997, and has since then been the third political <b>party.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the PSD in the same year achieved its first absolute majority with 62.4% of the votes. After the 2017 municipal elections, seven councilmen were members of the centre-right Partido Social Democrata (PSD), and two of the centre-left Partido Socialista (PS). The mayor is Aires Pereira, for the PSD, elected with 57.7% of the votes. The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes. Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members, with the PSD holding 16 seats, the PS 6, the right-wing CDS 2 and one member for the left-wing Left Bloc, the green party People–Animals–Nature (PAN) and one for the left-wing CDU.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{fragmentation}} of the political right and the coherence of <b>the</b> political left <b>on</b> three dimensions of left-right disagreement in twenty-one Western European and Anglo-American countries. Drawing on expert survey data from Benoit and Laver (2006), the analysis indicates that <b>party</b> positions <b>on</b> wealth redistribution, immigration and social liberalism are organized coherently among <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, but not among <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. The second stage of the analysis turns to individual-level public opinion data from the European Social Survey. The results of this analysis indicate that left-right opinions are not organized coherently in {{the population as a}} whole.
