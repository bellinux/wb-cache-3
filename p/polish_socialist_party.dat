5|$|Various Polish {{military}} {{organizations and}} provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw; Ignacy Daszyński's government in Lublin; and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Kraków) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> {{such as the}} eight-hour day, free school education, and women's suffrage. This was necessary to avoid major unrest.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not a}} universally popular attitude, and in 1909 Dmowski {{resigned}} {{his deputy}} mandate to focus on an internal political struggle within Endecja. He lost the election to the Fourth Duma in 1912 to a socialist politician, Eugeniusz Jagiełło from the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> – Left, who won {{with the support of}} the Jewish vote. Dmowski viewed this as a personal insult; in exchange he organized a successful boycott of Jewish businesses throughout much of Poland.|$|E
5|$|When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had {{strongly}} criticized, {{formed a}} new government, on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned {{to power in}} a coup d'état (the May Coup), supported by the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> Liberation, the Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party. Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.|$|E

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Piłsudski {{returned}} from exile {{and settled in}} Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PPS) and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, Robotnik (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, {{he became}} {{secretary-general}} of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> central executive committee in 1946. However, factional infighting split the Party into two camps: one led by Cyrankiewicz, the other by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, who was also prime minister.|$|R
50|$|Związek Walki Czynnej (abbreviation: ZWC; Union of Active Struggle; also {{translated}} as Union for Active Struggle and Union for Active Resistance) was a Polish secret military organization founded in June 1908 in Lwów by Józef Piłsudski, Marian Kukiel, Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Władysław Sikorski, {{all members of}} the Combat Organization of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> Revolutionary Faction.|$|R

5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E

Its members came from small anarchist groups (such as Grupa Rewolucjonistów Terrorystów) and radical members of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> Two direct founders were Edward Dłużewski and Józef Piątek. As a teenager, Dłużewski had focused on {{stealing}} from the rich. Piątek was {{a former member of}} the Combat Organization of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> disillusioned with PPS, and less interested in fighting for Poland's independence (increasingly a major item for that organization) than in improving workers' condition.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1925 {{parliamentary}} elections in Czechoslovakia, the SPP formed a coalition with the Polish minority parties: the Union of Silesian Catholics, the Polish People's <b>Party</b> and the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> Workers <b>Party.</b> Gustaw Wałach, {{a member of}} the Szlonzakian movement, took third place, after Leon Wolf from the Union of Silesian Catholics and Wiesław Wójcik from the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> Workers <b>Party.</b> The election slogan of the Polish coalition was [...] "Silesia for Silesians", which was originally an SPP slogan that all Polish organizations had opposed in the Austrian period. Leon Wolf was elected deputy.|$|R

During this time he was also a member of Warsaw City Council.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the pogrom 88 people were killed, {{including}} 82 Jews, although some sources list a higher number of 200.

40|$|The {{following}} article analyzes {{participation of}} the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialists</b> in the constitutional debate conducted in the parliament between 1928 and 1930. In the first section, the political context of the debate and main constitutional demands of the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government are presented. Further, the article discusses role of the constitutional debate in the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party’s</b> (PPS) political strategy of that time. Leaders of the PPS were arguing that the Nonpartisan Bloc’s constitutional draft was synonymous with the institutionalization of the dictatorial rule in Poland. Socialists criticism of the draft is reconstructed in details {{in the next few}} paragraphs. Special attention is given to the discussion about constitutional role of the president and the parliament as well as the connections between class conflicts and political system – main themes in the socialist’s analyzes, presented in the press, mass meetings as well as during parliamentary sessions. In {{the last part of the}} article the strategies of argumentation (especially main strategy – discourse polarization) used by socialists leaders, commentators and party’s propagandists are presented and elaborated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> Workers <b>Party</b> (Polska Socjalistyczna Partia Robotnicza, PSPR) was a {{political}} party in Czechoslovakia founded in February 1921, based amongst Polish workers. The party was active in trade union struggles, mainly mobilizing miners and workers in heavy industries. The chairman of the party was Emanuel Chobot. Other prominent members of the party were Antoni Steffek and Wiktor Sembol. The party closely cooperated with the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party. The party published the newspaper Robotnik Śląski ('Silesian Worker') from Fryštát.|$|R
25|$|He {{graduated}} from the faculty of law at Kiev University. During his studies in Kiev, Narutowicz joined the Polish circle of students and {{became a member of}} the II Proletaryat, an underground socialist-revolutionary party and the predecessor of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> However, his beliefs were much less radical than those of his colleagues, and with time his contacts with the far left weakened.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Białystok was a city with a predominantly Jewish population. In 1895, the Jewish population numbered 47,783 (out of 62,993, or about 76%). Białystok was primarily a city known for its textile manufacturing, commerce and industry. During the 1905 Russian Revolution the city was a center of the radical labour movement, with strong organisations of the Bund and the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> as well as the more radical anarchists of the Black Banner association.|$|E
25|$|Before the war, {{a network}} of clandestine groups was created, tasked with paralyzing lines of {{communication}} and destroying enemy supply depots and command networks. Their membership was drawn from varied backgrounds, including the Riflemen's Association (Związek Strzelecki), Reserve Noncommissioned Officers' Association (Związek Podoficerów Rezerwy), Reserve Officers' Association (Związek Oficerów Rezerwy), referrals by County Offices of Physical Education and Military Training (Powiatowe Urzędy Wychowania Fizycznego i Przysposobienia Wojskowego, or PUWFiPW), the Polish Scouting Association (Związek Harcerzy Polskich, or ZHP), the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PPS), {{and a host of}} other organizations.|$|E
5000|$|Narutowicz {{finished}} his secondary {{education at the}} gymnasium in Liepāja, Latvia. He then enrolled at the Institute for Mathematical Physics in St. Petersburg. Illness, however, caused him to suspend those studies and to later transfer to the Zurich Polytechnic in Switzerland, where he studied from 1887 to 1891. Narutowicz helped exiled Poles {{on the run from}} the Russian authorities during his time in Switzerland. He was also connected with a <b>Polish</b> émigré <b>socialist</b> <b>party,</b> [...] "Proletariat". As a result of his associations he was banned from returning to Russia, and had a warrant issued for his arrest. In 1895 Narutowicz became a Swiss citizen and, after completing his studies, got his first job on the construction of the St. Gallen railway.|$|R
25|$|After Poland's {{capitulation}} and {{the capture}} of Warsaw by German forces he was forced into the Warsaw Ghetto. From the end of November 1942 {{he was on the}} Bund's Coordinating Commission of the Jewish National Council. Most likely, together with Maurycy Orzech, he was one of Bund's representatives in negotiations with the Anti-Fascist Block (an alliance between leftist-Zionist, communist and <b>socialist</b> <b>Polish</b> Jewish <b>parties).</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1903 he {{took part}} in several congresses and gatherings of the International <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> advocating for the {{independence}} and reunification of all Polish territories, {{as an integral part}} of the <b>Polish</b> <b>socialist</b> program.

25|$|Piłsudski's Combat Organization of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> {{founded in}} 1904, and which contributed to {{escalation}} {{of some of}} the hostilities, became more active during the next few years, starting its campaign of assassinations and robberies mostly from 1906 onward, although they grew much weaker {{near the end of the}} decade. Piłsudski's faction was temporarily weakened, and PPS split, although by 1909 Piłsudski's faction again regained prominence on the Polish underground political scene. Piłsudski eventually succeeded in securing Polish independence, and became an important political figure in interwar Poland.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the strike}} did not meet with {{unanimous}} approval. Marginal Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP) threw its weight behind the strike, but right wing National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) was opposed to it. Crucially, <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) declined to participate in it, so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period. Even within SL not all activists were convinced {{it was a good}} idea; it was supported by Wincenty Witos and Stanisław Mikołajczyk, but criticized by Maciej Rataj.|$|E
25|$|In March 1889, {{the court}} decided {{to extend his}} term of exile by three more years, and {{relocated}} him {{to the village of}} Serginsk, near Minusinsk. He much later claimed that, while passing through the prison of Krasnoyarsk, he met Vladimir Lenin, the future Bolshevik leader— this is unlikely, as Lenin passed through the city several years after Stere. His other claim to have met and befriended Józef Piłsudski, future head of state of Poland (and, at the time, a prominent member of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party),</b> was confirmed by Piłsudski himself in 1927 (Stere's novel, În preajma revoluției, included Piłsudski as a character, under the name Stadnicki).|$|E
5|$|The Underground State {{represented}} most, {{though not}} all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political Consultative Committee (PKP) represented four major <b>Polish</b> parties: the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PPS-WRN), the People's Party (SL), the SN, and the Labor Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, {{four months after}} the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the Big Four, were also represented in the Home Political Representation (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were.|$|R
50|$|The Alliance of <b>Polish</b> <b>Socialists</b> in America {{was formed}} as an emigre group, {{dedicated}} to making revolution in Poland, {{rather than the}} United States. It merged with the Polish Section of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1913. It published a daily newspaper in Chicago and two weekly newspapers. It formally disaffiliated from the SPA in 1916, although a minority remained with the party. A few hundred members joined the CPUSA.|$|R
50|$|Gebert immigrated from Poland to the United States {{prior to}} the Russian Revolution and found work as a miner. He was {{an active member of}} the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> of America working in the SPA's Polish Federation by 1915. He took part in the {{creation}} of the Kosciuszko League. Gebert was active in the Left Wing Section of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> In 1919 and a founding member of the Communist Party of America (CPA), and edited a <b>Polish</b> <b>socialist</b> newspaper. He was arrested in the Palmer Raids at the end of 1919 but was not deported. He was named to the governing Central Executive Committee of the CPA as an ostensible representative of the Polish Communist Federation in the wake of the deportation of Polish leader Daniel Elbaum in 1920.|$|R
