5000|$|The {{incident}} which {{decided the}} Judges was called [...] "the procession" [...] and occurred on polling day. The Conservatives were campaigning {{in opposition to}} the Liberal government's Local Veto Bill which would have allowed local authorities to prevent the sale of alcohol. Several costermonger's carts, bearing [...] "certain symbols of drink", headed by a carriage on which Chamberlayne sat, spent two hours moving through the streets of Southampton, stopping at pubs and Conservative supporting clubs. Although Chamberlayne had not known about the procession beforehand, Mr Justice Wright noted that he had chosen to lead it and therefore [...] "allowed to follow him [...].procession of a nature calculated to excite and provoke to treating [...]. and to illegal practices to some extent". Mr Justice Bruce agreed that [...] "it was, at least, possible, if not probable, that corrupt treating was going on". Therefore, both judges concluded that Chamberlayne had not taken all reasonable means to <b>prevent</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices,</b> and his election was void; however, they refused to award the petitioners costs save in respect of the railway fare allegation.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{corporate}} and securities laws in addressing foreign <b>corrupt</b> business <b>practices</b> has, to date, received limited consideration. Departing from the substantial {{literature on the}} criminal and public law response to international corruption, the authors analyze Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in comparison with British and American legislation and conclude that the Canadian regime relies too heavily {{on the use of}} criminal sanctions and fails to contemplate the role of behaviour modification in its legislative structure. Recognizing that multinational corporations are well placed to identify, expose and <b>prevent</b> <b>corrupt</b> business <b>practices,</b> the authors propose a private law based solution that builds upon the existing corporate governance frameworks of multinational corporations to curtail corruption. Corporate law directors’ duties and securities law disclosure requirements provide legislators with complimentary tools to incentivize the development of internal control mechanisms and facilitate civil claims against corrupt companies...|$|R
5000|$|Fifth century BC Athenian {{democracy}} developed out of {{a notion}} of isonomia (equality of political rights), and random selection was a principal way of achieving this fairness. Greek democracy (literally meaning [...] "rule by the people") was actually run by the people: administration was in the hands of committees allotted from the people and regularly changed. Although it may seem strange to those used to modern liberal democracy, the Athenian Greeks considered elections to be essentially undemocratic. This was because citizens chosen on merit or popularity contradicted the democratic equality of all citizenry. In addition, allotment <b>prevented</b> the <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> of buying votes as no one could know who would be selected as a magistrate, or to sit on a jury.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 March, however, Regenvanu was reshuffled to the Ministry of Justice and Social Affairs. Prime Minister Kilman {{had just}} sacked Justice Minister Yoan Simon, who had [...] "reportedly backed the opposition’s {{plans for a}} motion of no confidence" [...] in him, and needed to shore up his {{coalition}} government by bringing in a new party. Kilman offered a Cabinet position to the Republican Party, who demanded the Lands Ministry. Consequently, Alfred Carlot replaced Regenvanu as Minister for Lands, while Regenvanu {{was appointed to the}} vacant position of Minister for Justice. Ben Bohane, of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, remarked that Regenvanu seemed to have been [...] "sacrificed to allow the [...] to come in as a coalition partner for the government. The government's numbers are very shaky. Parliament is set to resume some time {{at the end of this}} month and again there is ongoing talk of a vote of no confidence." [...] Radio New Zealand International, describing Regenvanu as a reformer during his three weeks as Minister for Lands, noted: [...] "Reliable sources from the office of the opposition say Mr Kilman had no choice but to make the reshuffle to stay in power." [...] Radio Australia noted that he had been [...] "transferred due to political pressure", as the government tried to maintain a viable parliamentary majority. It added that Regenvanu was [...] "not happy about leaving before finishing significant changes to the laws on land ownership". Carlot said he would continue Regenvanu's reforms aimed at rooting out and <b>prevent</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In August 2008, Sir Peter Kenilorea {{commented on}} what he {{perceived}} as the flaws of a first-past-the-post electoral system in the Solomon Islands: An... underlying cause of political instability and poor governance, in my opinion, is our electoral system and its related problems. It has been identified {{by a number of}} academics and practitioners that the First Past the Post system is such that a Member elected to Parliament is sometimes elected by a small percentage of voters where there are many candidates in a particular constituency. I believe that this system {{is part of the reason}} why voters ignore political parties and why candidates try an appeal to voters' material desires and relationships instead of political parties. ...Moreover, this system creates a political environment where a Member is elected by a relatively small number of voters with the effect that this Member is then expected to ignore his party’s philosophy and instead look after that core base of voters in terms of their material needs. Another relevant factor that I see in relation to the electoral system is the proven fact that it is rather conducive, and thus has not <b>prevented,</b> <b>corrupt</b> elections <b>practices</b> such as ballot buying.
