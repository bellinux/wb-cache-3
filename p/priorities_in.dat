As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. These programs would help define the new university.|$|E

The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.|$|E
40|$|Taken {{together}} the international move from liquidation to reorganization-based bankruptcy regimes {{and the international}} move to abolish Crown <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> bankruptcy provide Canada {{with an opportunity to}} rethink Crown <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> bankruptcy. This paper makes the case that abolishing Crown <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> bankruptcy in Canada is optimal given a revaluation of traditional normative claims surrounding Crown <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the context of a bankruptcy system that favours reorganization when possible. While this paper focuses on Canada, it engages in a normative assessment that may be useful for possible reforms to Crown <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the United States and in other jurisdictions that, like Canada, have been influenced, not only by the English model, but also by the American bankruptcy and reorganization system...|$|R
40|$|Aristotle’s {{notion of}} <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> nature and in substance, as {{introduced}} in Metaphysics 1019 a 2 - 4, has been traditionally understood <b>in</b> terms of <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> existence: x is prior to y if x can exist without y’s existing, but y cannot exist without x’s existing.

5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided <b>priorities.</b> <b>In</b> the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E

Band is a proponent for the Sustained surface combatant capability {{and the creation of}} new ships to maintain the Royal Navy as one of the world's leading navies. These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top <b>priorities</b> <b>in</b> the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, one of {{the first}} <b>priorities</b> <b>in</b> response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas then {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod and marched against the Order. Treniota led an army to Cēsis and battled Masovia, hoping to encourage all the conquered Baltic tribes to rise up against the Orders and unite under Lithuanian leadership. He waged successful battles, but did not manage to capture the fortified castles or spark a coalition of Baltic forces against the Order. His personal influence grew because Mindaugas was concentrating on the conquest of Russian lands, dispatching a large army to Bryansk. Treniota and Mindaugas began to pursue different <b>priorities.</b> <b>In</b> the midst of these events, Mindaugas' wife Morta died, and Mindaugas expressed the wish to marry Daumantas' wife. Daumantas and Treniota responded to this insult by assassinating Mindaugas {{and two of his}} sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263. Lithuania lapsed into years of internal instability.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda and Uganda were allies {{during the}} First Congo War against Zaire, with both {{countries}} being {{instrumental in the}} setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war. The two nations joined forces again {{at the beginning of}} the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different <b>priorities</b> <b>in</b> fighting the war. In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions, and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani. The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians. Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more.|$|E
