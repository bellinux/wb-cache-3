5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{announced}} to the public with a trailer on June 6, 2011, at Microsoft's annual E3 global media briefing, which closed with the teaser trailer for Halo 4. Bonuses for <b>preordering</b> the game included a Master Chief Xbox 360 avatar costume and an exclusive Grunt Funeral skull, which toggles whether enemy Grunts explode upon death. During the Halo Universe panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, a short trailer showcasing the animation used in the terminals with a narration by 343 Guilty Spark was shown to the fans. Microsoft launched the Halo Living Monument, consisting of a live-action short and a website, to celebrate the launch of Combat Evolved Anniversary.|$|E

Digital bonuses were {{also included in the}} form of the Digital Imperial Assassin's Pack, which included additional in-game content.

5000|$|The {{relation}} [...] "injects into" [...] is a <b>preorder</b> (that is, a reflexive and transitive relation), and [...] "be isomorphic" [...] is an equivalence relation.

Generally, a <b>preorder</b> leads to an equivalence relation and a partial order between the corresponding equivalence classes. The Schröder-Bernstein property claims that the embeddability <b>preorder</b> (assuming that it is a <b>preorder)</b> leads to the similarity equivalence relation, and a partial order (not just <b>preorder)</b> between classes of similar objects.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we define {{simulations}} up-to a <b>preorder</b> and show {{how we can}} use them to provide a coinductive, simulation-like, characterization of semantic <b>preorders</b> for processes. The result applies to a wide class of <b>preorders,</b> in particular to all semantic <b>preorders</b> coarser than the ready simulation <b>preorder</b> in the linear time-branching time spectrum. An interesting but unexpected result is that, when built from an equivalence relation, the simulation up-to is a canonical <b>preorder</b> whose kernel is the given equivalence relation. These canonical <b>preorders</b> have several nice properties, the main being that since {{all of them are}} defined in a homogeneous way, their properties can be proved in a generic way. In particular, we present an axiomatic characterization of each of these canonical <b>preorders,</b> that is obtained just by adding a single axiom to the axiomatization of the original equivalence relation. This gives us an alternative axiomatization for every axiomatizable <b>preorder</b> in the linear time-branching time spectrum, whose correctness and completeness can be proved once and for all...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoherence-based {{approaches}} are quite popular to reason under inconsistency. Most {{of them are}} defined with respect to totally <b>preordered</b> belief bases such as the lexicographic inference which {{is known to have}} desirable properties from theoretical, practical and psychological points of view. However, partially <b>preordered</b> belief bases offer much more flexibility to represent efficiently incomplete knowledge and to avoid comparing unrelated pieces of information. In this paper, we propose a lexicographic inference for partially <b>preordered</b> belief bases that extends the classical one. On one hand, we define a natural inference relation which con- sists in applying classical lexicographic inference from all compatible totally <b>preordered</b> belief bases. On the other hand, we propose a novel cardinality-based <b>preorder</b> between consistent subbases. This cardinality- based <b>preorder</b> can be indifferently applied on partially or totally <b>preordered</b> belief bases. Then, applying classical inference on the preferred consistent subbases, according to this <b>preorder,</b> provides another lexicographic inference relation for partially <b>preordered</b> belief bases. Interestingly enough, we show that the second inference is covered by the first one. Lastly, a semantic characterization of these two definitions is provided...|$|R
