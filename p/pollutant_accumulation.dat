In this paper, an application of the Metropolis algorithm, a general Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling method, for the calibration of a four-parameter lumped urban stormwater quality model is presented. Unlike traditional optimisation approaches, the Metropolis algorithm identifies not only a "best parameter set", but a probability distribution of parameters according to measured data.

Our study shows that the allophane microstructure favors <b>pollutants</b> <b>accumulation</b> and sequestration in soils. We put forth the importance of the mesoporous microstructure of the allophane aggregates for pollutant trapping in andosols. We show that the soil contamination increases with the allophane content but also with the mesopore volume, the tortuosity, {{and the size of the}} fractal aggregate. Moreover, the pore structure of the allophane aggregates at nanoscale favors the pesticide retention. The fractal and tortuous aggregates of nanoparticles play the role of nanolabyrinths. It is suggested that chlordecone storage in allophanic soils could be the result of the low transport properties (permeability and diffusion) in the allophane aggregates. The poor accessibility to the pesticide trapped in the mesopore of allophane aggregates could explain the lower pollutant release in the environment. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{claim that the}} {{disadvantage}} in the pollution control is not primarily the accumulated stock of pollutants, which is an accomplished fact, {{but the use of}} the available inputs in production in conjunction with the available equipment are the sources of <b>pollutants</b> <b>accumulation.</b> In most cases pollution is an irreversible fact and consequently, the main concern of a social planer should be the discovery of effective ways to reduce the sources (inputs and equipment) that generate pollutants. Using both optimal control and differential game approaches, we study the intertemporal strategic interactions between polluters and the social planer. We find that the establishment of cyclical strategies in a polluter’s optimal control problem requires that the polluter’s discount rate must be greater than the marginal resources’ growth. For the saddle point stability, the marginal resources growth has to be equal or less than zero. Assuming constant elasticity for the polluters’ resources reduction function and linearity {{for the rest of the}} functions, we find that the pollution game yields constant optimal Nash strategies. Finally, we provide analytical expressions of these strategies as well as the steady state value of the resources’ stock. ...|$|R

The WRF-CHEM model generally performed well in simulating the surface species concentrations of PM 2. 5, O 3 and NO 2 compared to the observations; in addition, it reasonably reproduced the observed temporal variations of wind speed, wind direction and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). It was found that the CFB that occurred in southern NCP (SNCP) had a significant effect on PM 2. 5 concentrations locally, causing a maximum of 34  % PM 2. 5 increase. Under continuous southerly wind conditions, the CFB pollution plume went through a long-range transport to northern NCP (NNCP; with several mega cities, including Beijing, the capital city of China), where few CFBs occurred, resulting in a maximum of 32  % PM 2. 5 increase. As a result, the heavy haze in Beijing was enhanced by the CFB, which occurred in SNCP. Mountains also play significant roles in enhancing the PM 2. 5 pollution in NNCP through the blocking effect.

A clear vertical (3, 6 and 9 m) distribution gradient of pollutants was not observed, so that both the model and biomonitoring results suggested that local air turbulences in the street canyon could contribute to uniform pollutant distributionat different heights...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{dispersion of}} the NOX plume {{that will be}} emitted from a new power–plant, at present under installation, was simulated at micro–scale with Micro–Swift–Spray (MSS) Model. The plant will be constructed in a residential urban area {{in the town of}} Modena (Po Valley, Northern Italy), where low wind speeds and thermal inversions are quite frequent. Simulation results point out a different behavior of urban canopy in influencing the 3 D dispersion patterns among urban obstacles, according to atmospheric mixing conditions: in case of moderate wind events, urban canyon phenomena may occur with a consequent increasing of NOX concentration gradients among buildings, while with low winds the near–field influence of the buildings emphasizes <b>pollutant</b> <b>accumulation.</b> The MSS simulated NOX concentrations result always much lower than the regulatory limits for air quality. The comparison of simulation results with measured concentration data for NOX shows the importance of micro–scale dispersion modeling to perform an accurate and reliable assessment of meteorological condition effects on pollutant distribution, and the ability of MSS in providing reliable simulations of atmospheric dispersion...|$|E
40|$|Workers of {{iron and}} steel {{factories}} are exposed {{to a wide range}} of pollutants depending on the particular process, the materials involved, the effectiveness of monitoring and the control measures. Adverse effects are determined by the physical state and propensities of the pollutant involved, the intensity and duration of the exposure, the extent of <b>pollutant</b> <b>accumulation</b> in the body and the sensitivity of the individual to its effects. The main aim of this study is to assess the levels of the indoor respirable particulate matter (RPM) and to compare the health condition of exposed workers, with nonexposed employees group. Line 630 has only one furnace of 40 tons and line 650 has two furnaces of 20 and 40 tons capacity due to which the mean of the RPM concentrations in the breathing zone was significantly different (P < 0. 05) in line 650 but not in line 630 as compared with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Hygiene&#x 2032;s (3 mg/m 3). The average of the RPM concentrations in production line 650 is higher than that of production line 630, with the 95 &#x 0025; confidence interval in saw cabin station number 1 of production line 650...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} of aquaculture waste in water {{in addition to}} anthropogenic activities has posed a great threat to ecosystem. The phytoremediation technology is used to treat the contaminated soil and water which containing higher amount of pollutants. In this study, Limnocharis flava {{has been used to}} remediate the pollutants contaminated water. The physico- chemical changes, removal efficiency of <b>pollutants,</b> <b>accumulation</b> of <b>pollutants</b> by Limnocharis flava was carried out in this research. All the samples were analysed by the XRF and Ysi 556 multi-parameter to identify the concentration of each pollutant in the water samples and physico-chemical parameter. The aquaculture wastewater and three reactor (Limnocharis flava) were put into reactor tank. Then, the pollutants concentration such as heavy metals and aquaculture waste based on hydraulic retention time (HRT) were analysed. The experiment is repeated with 6 cycles. The data analysis and statistics were calculated by Microsoft Excel 2013. The result of physico- chemical analysis showed that Limnocharis flava has the ability to increase the values of pH with 1. 95 ± 4. 48, DO with 12. 85 ± 27. 05 and reduce the value of TDS with - 19. 39 ± 66. 30. Furthermore, the experiment demonstrated that Limnocharis flava significantly removed Ba with 30. 88 ± 28. 72 ppm, Sn with 51. 7 2 ± 34. 90 ppm, Al with 53. 45 ± 49. 78 ppm, P with 42. 15 ± 19. 64 ppm, S with 42. 15 ± 26. 38 ppm, Cl with 41. 62 ± 25. 88 ppm, and respectively in aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, Limnocharis flava can accumulate Al in plant tissues with BCF 0. 0721 ppm. Therefore, Limnocharis flava have the characteristic that help to reduce pollutants from water sources and increase water quality...|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{carried out}} a study to {{determine}} the influence of dust in the aggravated environment of the Greek capital, Athens, and considered that the dust effects are site-specific (Kaldellis and Kokala 2010). Similarly some researchers carried out fundamental studies on dust fouling effects on PV module glass cover (Said and Walwil 2014). It was found that the spectral transmittance reduction was around 35 % and the overall transmittance was around 20 %. It was also observed that the dust particles accumulated were generally spherical in shape. Researchers gave a concept on effect of dust deposition on the performance of multicrystalline PV modules based on experimental measurements (Kazem et al. 2014). The authors investigated the dust effect on the PV module (multicrystalline) performance and the degradation of PV performance due to the deposition of different <b>pollutants</b> and <b>accumulation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on 2, 500 air samples, P-dichlorbenzene was {{measured}} by using the automatic analyzing system. As {{a result of this}} research, its movement in the atmosphere was considered. It was found that p-dichlorobenzene as insecticide sublimed to form the atmospheric pollution in urban area and its average concentration was estimated to be the order of ppb in usual use. The concentration lebel of p-dichlorobenzene was dependent bn the temperature, that is, its rise to 10 ℃ resulted　in about 1. 5 times rise of the concentration. According to the photochemical experiment, p-dichlorobenzene showed the lowest reactivity among the other pollutants tested. This property accounted well the fact that its background value was higher than {{in the case of the}} other <b>pollutants.</b> The <b>accumulation</b> of p-dichlorobenzene was observed widely in the environment. Therefore, its marketing as a daily commodity must be controlled immediately...|$|R
