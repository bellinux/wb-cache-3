40|$|The o-phenanthroline {{method was}} tested {{as to its}} {{applicability}} to the separate determination of iron in natural water: ionic ferrous iron, reducible iron, snd colloidally dispersed iron. In connection with this, {{the results of the}} following experiments are given in this paper. 1. Determination of the absorption curve of o-phenanthroline ferrous complex. (Figure 1.) 2. Construction of the calibration curve for a Purfrich's <b>photometer</b> <b>with</b> <b>filter</b> S 50, 15 cm cuvettes. (Figure 2.) 3.

Test of the applicability of this method to the determination of ionic ferrous iron and reducible iron in thermal water. (Table 5., Table 6.) From the above, it was revealed that ionic ferrous iron and reducible iron in natural water are separately determinable with sufficient accuracy by the o-phenanthroline method, and that ionic iron and colloidally dispersed iron are also separately determinable, when the dispersed iron is present in amount more than 1. 3 % of the total iron...|$|R

Using of Langley’s method to determine extraterrestrial constant of GLOBE LED Sun photometer is discussed. More than 120 GLOBE schools around world are conducting aerosol measurements on daily basis and have reported around 80. 000 data on atmospheric optical depth. There are four GLOBE Sun photometers operating in Croatia now, which are used by six schools, so our schools made around 5000 measurements.

40|$|We {{describe}} the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI). This instrument {{consists of a}} scanning imaging spectrograph (SIS) whose field-of-view is scanned from horizon to horizon and a nadir-looking photometer system (NPS). The SIS produces simultaneous multispectral images over the spectral range 1150 to 1800 Å. The NPS consists of three <b>photometers</b> <b>with</b> <b>filters</b> designed to monitor the airglow at 4278 Å and 6300 Å and the terrestrial albedo near 6300 Å. SSUSI will fly on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5 D 3 satellites S- 16 thru S- 20 beginning in the later par of this decade. The instruments will be calibrated at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Optical Calibration Facility. 1. SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES The DMSP Block 5 D 3 Special Sensors will provide the first comprehensive operational space-based investigation of the physical and chemical processes in the Earth's upper atmosphere (above 80 km). The upper atmosphere is the region that contains the mesophere, thermosphere, and ionosphere. This region is poorly understood due to the difficulty in carrying out in situ measurements, its inherent complexity, {{and the need to}} develop a comprehensive global picture of this environment. While the basic physics that controls this region is understood, it does represent a difficult region to model since the atmospheric temperature and temperature gradients reach their largest values, composition changes from molecular to predominantly atomic, complex chemical and electrodynamic processes become the major determinants of composition, and where the combination o...|$|R
40|$|The University of South Africa {{has built}} a small {{observatory}} for teaching and research. The 35 cm Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector and the SSP- 5 A <b>photometer</b> <b>with</b> Johnson UBV <b>filters</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} local possibilities for aperture photometry. Extinction and transformation coefficients and zero points were determined with the RPHOT software package from standard star photometry. To determine the system limits, UBV light curves were obtained for four eclipsing binaries, ranging between magnitudes 7 and 13. In B the limit is 12, 5, in U it is 12, 0 and in V only 11, 0 with large scatter even for bright objects. The rapidly varying sky background in an urban site may be a major cause. A related problem is the large, fixed photometer diaphragm, aggravating the bright sky situation. Possible solutions to this and other problems were suggested. The system can be used fruitfully, especially for single filter photometry of periodic and nonperiodic variables. School of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{interesting}} questions concerning meteor streams associated with Comet Halley {{is the question}} of whether or not the activity of a meteor stream was connected with the approach of the comet to the terrestrial orbit in 1985 to 1986. Meteoric aerosols getting to the upper atmosphere can be detected by twilight sounding, as has been done previously. It turns out that not only parameters describing some properties of aerosol can be obtained by twilight sounding, but also characteristics concerning the structure of the stream can be derived. Among the yearly active streams, the Orionides have always attracted the attention of scientists. The period of activity of the Orionides is October 18 to 26, and the maximum stream activity is October 21. In detecting aerosol layers in the terrestrial atmosphere, a notion of the logarithmic intensity gradient of scattered twilight light is used, d log I/dH, where I is intensity and H is the real twilight beam height, which is a function of the wavelength observed. A photoelectric <b>photometer</b> <b>with</b> an interference <b>filter</b> at the wavelength of 610 nm is used. The observation were carried out in two points of the solar vertical; the zenith angle of the observation points was + or - 60 degrees. The recording was carried on continuously in each direction during a minute, then the system was switched to the other direction. A calibration standard was recorded before each observation. The observation dates in the Orionid periods of 1984, 1986, and 1987 are given...|$|R
