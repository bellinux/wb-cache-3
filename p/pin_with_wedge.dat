50|$|Dondi {{constructed}} the clock, with its 107 gear wheels and pinions, entirely by hand. No screws were used, and every part was {{held together by}} over 300 tapering <b>pins</b> and <b>wedges,</b> <b>with</b> some parts being soldered. Most of the wheels have triangular shaped teeth, although some are blunt-nosed. In some cases, Dondi used near-elliptical wheels, in order to more accurately model the irregular motions of the planets (using the Ptolemaic epicycles rather than the ellipses as later worked out by Johannes Kepler). On some of these wheels, the teeth varied in size and spacing along the wheel's periphery. To indicate dimensions in his descriptions, Dondi used units such as {{the width of a}} goose quill, the thickness of a blade of a knife, or the breadth of a man's thumb.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{steel frame}} <b>with</b> <b>wedge</b> devices {{is a kind}} of shock {{structure}} based on the node energy consumption. The seismic performances of steel frame <b>with</b> <b>wedge</b> and ordinary steel frame model under low cycle reciprocating load simulation analysis and time history analysis under earthquake loads are analyzed by using finite element software, compared the respective energy dissipation performance and seismic performance, the results show that the wedge spring damping device can effectively control story drifts of structure, reduce the seismic response of structure, and well consume the seismic energy, so the structure of the new column bases <b>with</b> <b>wedge</b> spring devices show better seismic performance...|$|R

40|$|To produce preforms {{for complex}} long flat parts with an {{unsteady}} mass distribution along the longitudinal axis rolling processes, like cross wedge rolling, can be used. Tools for cross wedge rolling processes {{can be designed}} as roller or flat, both <b>with</b> <b>wedges.</b> In the collaborative research project SFB 489 “Process chain {{for the production of}} precision forged high performance parts ” the subproject “Innovative machine and tool technology for precision forging ” deals with the development of a flashless forging process for a two cylinder crankshaft <b>with</b> <b>pin</b> and flange. This process is developed by IPH – Institut für Integrierte Produktion Hannover. The first preform of the developed forging sequence is produced by a cross wedge rolling process on the basis of flat <b>with</b> <b>wedges.</b> To consider the mass distribution of the two cylinder crankshaft in the preform for a rolling process four mass concentrations for the crank arms and mass concentrations for pin and flange are needed...|$|R
