5|$|A {{bill was}} passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara on 19 and 20 January 1993 respectively. The bill, which <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> remove legal {{immunity}} was approved by six out of nine sultans—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included the Ismail Petra, the Sultan of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall {{the implementation of the}} proposed bill. The bill, which <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: We are <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> {{amend the}} {{regulations}} that govern the importation of animals and animal products to revise the conditions for the importation of live bovines and products derived from bovines with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). We are <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> base importation conditions on the inherent risk of BSE infectivity in specified commodities, {{as well as on}} the BSE risk status of the region from which the commodities originate. We are <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> establish a system for classifying regions as to BSE risk that is consistent with the system employed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the international standard-setting organization for guidelines related to animal health. The conditions we are proposing for the importation of specified commodities are based on internationally accepted scientific literature and, except in a few instances, are consistent with OIE guidelines. We are also <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> classify certain specified countries as to BSE risk and are <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> remove BSE restrictions on the importation of cervids and camelids and products derived from such animals. We are <b>proposing</b> <b>to</b> make these amendments afterconducting a thorough review of relevant scientific literature and a comprehensive evaluation of the issues and concluding that the <b>proposed</b> changes <b>to</b> the regulations would continue to guard against the introduction of BSE into the United States, while allowing the importation o...|$|R
