50|$|Astronlon-C, a <b>polyamide</b> <b>yarn,</b> and Astralene-C, a {{polyester}} yarn, were irritable to {{the skin}} when made into clothing. Companies had been trying {{for some time to}} find an artificial yarn alternative.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{tannic acid}} {{can also be}} used as an {{aftertreatment}} to improve wash fastness properties of acid dyed polyamide. It is also an alternative for fluorcarbon aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to <b>polyamide</b> <b>yarn</b> or carpets.However, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of upholstery flock; this serves as an anti-static treatment.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of yarn dyeing. Common forms are the package form and the hanks form. Cotton yarns are mostly dyed at package form, and acrylic or wool yarn are dyed at hank form. In the {{continuous}} filament industry, polyester or <b>polyamide</b> <b>yarns</b> are always dyed at package form, while viscose rayon yarns are partly dyed at hank form because of technology.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{fabrication}} process that produces polymeric charge storage devices directly onto a textile surface. By using a coating of poly-(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulphonic acid) (PEDOT) as a solid electrolytic layer deposited between two woven silver coated <b>polyamide</b> <b>yarns,</b> {{we have created}} a simple polymeric textile battery. By studying the device's surface morphology and chemical composition, we determined that {{in the presence of}} an electric field, silver ions from the anode yarn migrate to the cathode yarn through the PEDOT. Despite this migration, the device could be charged and discharged five times without suffering degradation in electrical performance. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{mechanical}} behaviour of compression arm sleeves based on knitted fabrics has been reported. Rib fabrics were developed using 95 % <b>polyamide</b> knitting <b>yarns</b> and 5 % <b>polyamide</b> covered elastane <b>yarns</b> as inlays using stockings technology. Samples were produced varying the characteristics (fineness of elastane core and polyamide cover) of elastane yarns {{in order to}} investigate its influence {{on the performance of}} knitted arm sleeves. The performance of developed arm sleeves was characterized in terms of level of compression that can be achieved as well as the permanent deformation and energy dissipation, which occurs during stretching. It was observed that the compression performance improved significantly with the linear density of elastane core and the improvement is higher for finer cover yarns. However, the energy dissipation and permanent deformation in the first stretching cycle also increased with the fineness of elastane core and therefore, proper selection of elastane yarn is extremely necessary to achieve required degree of compression with minimum permanent deformation while stretching...|$|R

40|$|By the {{integration}} of electro-conductive properties in the fabric structure a flexible textile can be obtained that does not reduce the quality of comfort, maintenance and wearability of clothing. Each type of yarn has its advantages and disadvantages, for example, metal coated polymer multifilament yarn has a lower resistance to heat than metal multifilament yarn, {{but it is more}} flexible. During this research conductive knitted patterns were made and tested. For the experiments more suitable yarns for knitting were selected, which had a lower resistance and were visually less changing of the knitted pattern in appearance: silver coated multifilament polyamide, products of two different companies; stainless steel multifilament yarn and polyester/stainless steel spun yarn. The single-faced patterns of non-conductive yarn and straight and figural conductive traces of conductive yarns were knitted. A test was made with the purpose of finding out the electrical resistance of knitted textile affected by force. Knit warm-up potency was researched during temperature measurement tests. Knitting test pieces were also evaluated by aspect of technical structure and visual appearance. Generally, it was concluded that steel yarns could not be used for knitting while silver coated <b>polyamide</b> <b>yarns</b> are suitable for the manufacture of knitted heating elements. As a result of this research, knitwear with a textile heating element was made...|$|R

40|$|Future {{generations of}} {{wearable}} electronic systems and mobile communication place a great demand for harvesting {{energy from ambient}} environments or human movements. Soft fiber-based electric power generators are attractive in meeting the requirements of wearable devices because of efficient energy conversion performance, high durability and comfort. In this paper, we present a novel all-fiber wearable electric power nanogenerator, which consists of a PVDF-NaNbO 3 nanofiber nonwoven fabric as an active piezoelectric component, and an elastic conducting knitted fabric, made from segmented polyurethane and silver coated <b>polyamide</b> multifilament <b>yarns,</b> as {{the top and bottom}} electrodes. The non-uniform deformation distribution in a compressed nanogenerator device determines the complex operating modes in the piezoelectric nanofiber nonwoven fabric. The nanogenerator consistently produces a peak open-circuit voltage of 3. 4 V and a peak current of 4. 4 μA in cyclic compression tests at 1 Hz and a maximum pressure of 0. 2 MPa, which is comparable to normal human walking motion. More importantly, the all-fiber nanogenerator retains its performance after 1 000 000 compression cycles, demonstrating great promise as a wearable energy harvester that converts the mechanical energy of human movement into electricity.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years {{research}} activities have been focused on the modification of fiber properties with nano-scaled additives. One of the most important fields of research is the alteration of mechanical properties such as the tenacity and the specific breaking load. In this study, we determined the influence of nano-phyllosilicates on the drawability of <b>polyamide</b> 6 multifilament <b>yarns.</b> It was first demonstrated that the drawability of the fibers drastically increased in an industrially relevant high-speed melt spinning process. Structural properties of the material are identified by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in the crystalline properties {{as well as in the}} alignment of the silicates are compared with the stress–strain curves of the fibers, and a molecular mechanism for the drawing process is derived from these experiments. In a first step, a significant phase transition in the crystalline structure unaffected by the silicates occurs for low draw ratios (DRs). Beyond this point, where unmodified fibers start to break, a gliding between the silicate layers takes place, which is responsible for an extended drawability of the fibers. This mechanism leads to new possibilities for fiber processing, which can be used to research ultra-fine filaments in future studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effects of far infrared (FIR) ray emitting clothes on indirect markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and physical performance recovery after a plyometric bout applied to soccer players. Twenty-one male players (18. 9 ± 0. 6 years; 70. 8 ± 5. 01 kg; 178. 3 ± 0. 06 cm) performed 100 drop-jumps. Six hours after the bout, athletes put on FIR clothes (FIR) (density of 225 g • m- 2, 88 % far infrared rays emitting <b>polyamide</b> 66 Emana <b>yarn</b> (PA 66) fibre, 12 % Spandex, emissivity of 0. 88 and power emitted of 341 W/m 2 μm at 37 °C in the 5 - 20 μm wavelength range, patent WO 2009 / 077834 A 2) (N= 10) or placebo clothes (PLA) (N= 11). Mid-thigh circumferences, creatine kinase (CK), and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) were assessed before, immediately after and 24, 48, and 72 h after the bout. Squat (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) heights were measured before and at 24, 48, and 72 h after, while 1 RM leg press (maximum strength) was measured before and at 72 h after the plyometrics. No differences between groups were found in mid-thigh circumferences, SJ, CMJ or 1 RM. CK increased significantly 24 h after the plyometrics in comparison to before (p< 0. 05) in both groups. PLA showed significant DOMS increases at 24, 48, and 72 h, while FIR showed significant increases at 24 and 48 h (p< 0. 05). DOMS effect sizes were greater in FIR (moderate at 48 h, ES= 0. 737 and large at 72 h, ES= 0. 844), suggesting that FIR clothes may reduce perceived DOMS after an intense plyometric session performed by soccer players...|$|R
