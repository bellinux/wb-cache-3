40|$|Heterophasic <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers</b> (Hecoss) are {{versatile}} {{polymeric materials}} used in various applications such as automotive, packaging, construction industry among others. Heterophasic <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers</b> consist of two main components: a polymer matrix of isotactic polypropylene and a dispersed rubbery ethylene-propylene copolymer, which is not miscible into the matrix phase. While the matrix improves stiffness, the elastomeric phase enhances the impact strength and the mechanical behavior at low temperature. Heterophasic <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers</b> are produced in -at-least- two stage processes. In the first stage, starting from the catalyst particle, the homopolymer matrix is build, in the second stage, ethylene-propylene-rubber is polymerized into the polymer particle. The morphology of hiPP particles is of great interest {{for a number of}} reasons since the quantity of EPR, as well as the size and distribution of the rubber domains within the particles will have a great influence on the final properties of the polymer. Since the rubber formed in the second stage is sticky, rubber formation on the outer surface of the particle might lead to particle agglomeration and subsequent operational problems. Providing sufficient porosity for rubber accommodation in the heco-stage is one key element for avoiding these operational issues. Furthermore, particle morphology influences heat- and mass transfer within the polymer particles and therefore has an impact on reaction conditions at the active sites of the catalyst. The current contribution deals with the the effect of reaction conditions, in particular prepolymerization conditions, on resulting particle morphology and how the matrix particle morphology influences rubber incorporation in the heco-stage. Matrix polymerization in both bulk and gas-phase polymerization followed by a gas-phase polymerization of the rubber are discussed for two different Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The resulting particle morphology, transport properties and process kinetics are presented and compared.

Short continuous crystallizable sequences and high crystallization temperatures favor the formation of this polymorph in homo poly(propylenes) and random <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers.</b> Differences in the partitioning of the comonomer between the crystalline and non-crystalline regions leads to contents of the gamma phase that differ among the copolymers at any given crystallization temperature.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: From the Sasol Fischer- Tropsch process, {{a variety}} of {{different}} a-olefins are produced. Sasol recently started presenting these a-olefins to polymer producers. To demonstrate the application possibilities of these a-olefins as comonomers for ethylene and propylene polymerization, it was necessary to first synthesize catalysts having a combination of high activity and good comonomer incorporation, {{and in the case of}} <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers,</b> also sufficient stereospecificities. Different methods to produce catalysts conforming to these requirements were investigated and it was found that catalysts produced from a MgCb-support activated by a combination of chemical and mechanical means produced suitable catalysts. The amount of alcohol used during the support activation step and the time allowed for alkylation of the active centers were important. No clear correlation between total titanium content and activity was observed. The degree to which active sites are protected was evaluated from the amount of comonomer present in the final copolymer based on the amount added to the reaction. Cyclopentadiene was used to selectively deactivate the unprotected active sites to determine the ratio between protected and "open" active sites. High activity catalysts are not suitable for gas-phase copolymerization and were consequently "diluted" by dispersion in a pre-formed polymer powder and by prepolymerization. Catalyst activity based on titanium content was substantially decreased, but comonomer incorporation was not. Catalysts for producing crystalline polypropylene require the presence of both an internal and external electron donor. It was shown that isotacticity increased linearly with an increase in external modifier at the expense of catalyst activity and that a double treatment of the support or catalyst before the final TiCl 4 fixation was more effective at increasing stereospecificity. The less stereospecific sites are more capable of accepting bulky comonomers in the coordination complex and thus by decreasing the amount of less-stereospecific active sites, the overall capability of the catalyst to incorporate comonomer was decreased. Comonomer sequence distributions and average lamellar thicknesses of different ethylene / a-olefin copolymers were calculated from CH 2 dyad concentrations determined by I 3 C NMR spectroscopy. Ethylene sequences in the I-butene containing copolymers are generally longer than those where a higher a-olefin was used as comonomer which indicates that a more random comonomer distribution is obtained when the higher u-olefins are used. It was shown that an inverse relationship exists between branch size and density. For density, no effect resulting from the comonomer type was observed. This same inverse relationship was also observed for tensile strength. Modulus, hardness and impact strength, on the other hand, did show an effect resulting from the comonomer type. Modulus and hardness were not depressed as much and impact strength improved more than what was expected from calculations based on branch size. Homogeneous copolymers have broad melting peaks. It was shown that at sufficiently high comonomer content, peak broadening occurs when the higher cc-olefins are used as comonomer, which also indicates that more random comonomer distributions are obtained with the higher aolefins. From the chain propagation probabilities calculated it was observed that two types of active sites are present. Those responsible for producing mainly polyethylene have an alternating character while the sites capable of incorporating comonomer have a blocky character. It was expected that the additional introduction of a third a-olefin during ethylene / 1 - pentene copolymerization will produce a terpolymer with density and related properties similar to the mathematical average between those of the relevant copolymers. This was only observed for the terpolymers containing l-heptene, 1 - octene and l-nonene. The I-butene containing terpolymers have densities well below the expected values while the I-hexene containing terpolymers have values very similar to that of the ethylene / l-hexene copolymer densities, but still below the expected values. Properties related to density, such as tensile strength and modulus, follow this same trend. It is believed that the presence of l-pentene breaks up the tendency of the lower c-olefins to cluster which results in improved randomness. Compared to the copolymers, I-butene and l-hexene containing terpolymers seem to reach the impact strength maximum at a lower total comonomer content than that of the I-pentene copolymers which also indicates an enhanced effect from the combined use of I-pentene with these o-olefins. No substantial difference between impact strengths of co- and terpolymers prepared with higher a-olefins was observed. In general, the melting temperatures of the terpolymers are slightly lower and spread over a wider temperature range than those of the copolymers which can be realized if the comonomer units are less clustered and thus more randomly distributed. Decrease in melting temperature was, however, not as much as for the metallocene catalyzed terpolymers. From sequence length calculations from l 3 C NMR spectroscopy it was found that the crystallizable ethylene sequences of l-butene containing terpolymers were shorter than those of the corresponding copolymers, which confirms the notion that the introduction of a third comonomer resulted in an increase in randomness. Crystallizable sequence lengths became gradually shorter when higher cc-olefins were used in co- and terpolymers and those of the terpolymers are generally shorter. From the different types of active centers present on a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, it was reasoned that three main types of polymer chains can be present in the terpolymers: (a) ethylene homopolymer, (b) ethylene / lower a-olefin copolymer and (c) ethylene / lower a-olefin / higher a-olefin terpolymer. The ratio between these components in the final terpolymer depends primarily on the size of the higher a-olefin. The larger the third a-olefin becomes, the more active sites will reject it, resulting in a higher amount of ethylene / lower a-olefin copolymer. It was thus suggested that the large decrease in density and the associated change in related properties observed for ethylene / l-pentene / l-butene terpolymers can be related to the combined result of improved random comonomer incorporation together with the decrease in the amount of ethylene homopolymer. The possibilities of using the higher a-olefins having uneven carbon numbers were investigated in random <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymers.</b> Similar to that observed for the ethylene copolymers, less of the higher a-olefins was necessary to achieve a certain level of crystallinity. A good agreement was observed between tensile properties and comonomer type and content and the size of the branch and the resulting defect it causes in the crystal structure is the primary factor affecting tensile strength. For impact strength a close correlation between the size of the comonomer side chain and comonomer content was observed. It was shown that the effect of the heptyl branch derived from a l-nonene unit was 2. 3 times that of the propyl group derived from the I-pentene unit. Properties of block copolymers can not be related directly to l-pentene content as is the case with random copolymers, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the block copolymers. The activating effect of hydrogen on catalyst activity was observed. It was also observed that the amount of l-pentene incorporated in the copolymer as well as the copolymer yield were higher in the presence of hydrogen than when the reaction was carried out in the absence of hydrogen. By using DSC it was possible to identify different crystalline phases in the propylene / I-pentene block copolymers due to the differences in their crystallization kinetics. A connection between the low-temperature peak and impact strength was observed. It was found that the presence of the low-temperature peak resulting from thin lamellae formed by chain containing many defects was undesirable when high impact strength is required. It was not possible to quantify the extent to which the intensity of this peak affected mechanical properties of the block copolymers. However, from sequence length calculations it was found that the ratio between the propylene and 1 - pentene sequence lengths could be related quantitatively to impact strength, modulus, hardness and tensile strength of the polymers investigated. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: 'n Verskeidenheid van verskillende «-olefiene word in die Sasol Fischer- Tropsch proses vervaardig. Sasol het onlangs begin om hierdie a-olefiene aan polimeervervaardigers te bied. Om die toepassingsmoontlikhede van hierdie aolefiene as komonomere vir etileen en propileen polimerisasie te demonstreer was dit nodig om eerstens 'n katalis met 'n kombinasie van hoë aktiwiteit en goeie komonomeer invoeging te sintetiseer. In die geval van propileen word voldoende stereospesifisiteit ook vereis. Verskillende metodes om kataliste wat aan hierdie vereistes voldoen te vervaardig is ondersoek. Daar is gevind dat kataliste waarvan die MgCb basis deur 'n kombinasie van chemiese- en meganiese metodes geaktiveer is, die vereiste eienskappe besit. Die hoeveelheid alkohol gebruik tydens die basis aktivering stap en die tyd toegelaat vir die alkilering van die aktiewe spesies was belangrik. Geen duidelike verband tussen totale titaan inhoud en aktiwiteit is waargeneem nie. Die mate waartoe aktiewe spesies beskerm is, is bepaal vanaf die hoeveelheid komonomeer teenwoordig in die finale kopolimeer in verhouding met die hoeveelheid bygevoeg tydens die reaksie. Siklopentadieen is gebruik om onbeskermde aktiewe spesies selektief te deaktiveer om die verhouding tussen beskermde en oop aktiewe spesies te bepaal. Hoëaktiwiteit kataliste is nie geskik vir gasfase kopolimerisasie nie en is gevolglik verdun deur dit te versprei in 'n voorafgevormde polimeer poeier en deur prepolimerisasie. Katalis aktiwiteit gebaseer op titaan inhoud was aansienlik laer maar komonomeer invoeging was nie merkbaar beinvloed nie. Kataliste VIr die vervaardiging van kristallyne polipropileen vereis die teenwoordigheid van beide interne- en eksterne elektron donors. Daar is gewys dat isotaktisiteit liniêr verhoog met 'n toename in eksterne modifiseerder ten koste van katalis aktiwiteit en dat 'n dubbele behandeling van die basis of katalis, voor die finale titaan fiksering, meer effektief was om stereospesifisiteit te verhoog. Die spesies met laer stereospesifisiteit is meer bevoeg om bonkige komonomere in die koërdinasie kompleks toe te laat en deur dus die konsentrasie van hierdie spesies te verlaag is die bevoegdheid van die katalis om bonkige komonomeer te inkorporeer, verlaag. Komonomeer reeksverspreiding en gemiddelde lamellêre dikte van verskillende etileen / o-olefien kopolimere is bereken vanaf CH 2 diad konsentrasie bepaal deur KMR spektroskopie. Etileen reekse in die kopolimere wat l-buteen bevat is oor die algemeen langer as dié waarin 'n hoër a-olefien as komonomeer gebruik was, wat aandui dat 'n meer egalige komonomeer verspreiding verkry word as hoër «-olefiene gebruik word. Daar is getoon dat 'n inverse verhouding tussen die grootte van die vertakking en digtheid bestaan. Geen effek komende van die komonomeer tipe kon waargeneem word nie. Hierdie soortgelyke inverse verhouding was ook waargeneem vir treksterkte. Modulus, hardheid en impaksterkte aan die ander kant, hét 'n effek komende van die komonomeer tipe getoon. Modulus en hardheid was nie soveel verlaag, en impak sterkte soveel verhoog as wat verwag is vanaf berekeninge gebaseer op vertakking grootte nie. Homogene kopolimere toon breë smeltpieke. Daar is gewys dat by voldoende komonomeer inhoud 'n verbreding van die pieke voorgekom het wanneer hoër a-olefiene as komonomere gebruik is, wat ook aandui dat 'n meer egalige komonomeer verspreiding met hierdie c-olefiene verkry kan word. Vanaf berekening van die ketting voortplantingsmoontlikhede is waargeneem dat twee tipes aktiewe spesies teenwoordig is. Die verantwoordelik vir die vorming van polietileen het 'n alternerende karakter terwyl die sentra wat komonomeer kan inkorporeer 'n blokagtige karakter het. Daar is verwag dat die addisionele byvoeging van 'n derde o. -olefien tydens etileen / I-penteen kopolimerisasie, 'n terpolimeer met digtheid en verwante eienskappe soortgelyk aan die wiskundige gemiddelde tussen dié van die relevante kopolimere tot gevolg sal hê. Dit was egter slegs waargeneem vir terpolimere wat I-hepteen 1 - okteen en l-noneen bevat. Die I-buteen bevattende terpolimere het digthede ver onder die verwagte waardes terwyl die I-hekseen bevattende terpolimere waardes soortgelyk aan die etileen / l-hekseen kopolimeer digthede het' wat steeds onder die verwagte waardes is. Eienskappe verwant aan digtheid, soos treksterkte en modulus, volg dieselfde neiging. Dit word geglo dat die teenwoordigheid van l-penteen die neiging van die laer a-olefiene om saam te bondelopbreek wat 'n verbeterde egaligheid in komonomeerverspreiding tot gevolg het. Vergeleke by die kopolimere blyk dit dat die terpolimere wat l-buteen en I-hekseen bevat, die impaksterkte maksimum by 'n laer totale komonomer inhoud bereik as dié van die 1 -penteen polimere. Dit dui ook op 'n verbeterde effek as gevolg van die gekombineerde gebruik van l-penteen met ander a-olefiene. Geen duidelike verskil tussen die impaksterktes van ko- en terpolimere, wat met die hoër a-olefiene berei was, is waargeneem me. In die algemeen is die smeltingstemperature van die terpolimere effens laer, en versprei oor 'n wyer temperatuurgebied as dié van die kopolimere wat verklaar kan word as komonomere minder saamgebondel is en dus meer homogeen versprei is. Die afname in smelt temperatuur was egter nie soveel as dié van die metalloseengekataliseerde terpolimere nie. Vanaf reekslengte berekeninge met behulp van KMR spektroskopie is daar gevind dat die kristalliseerbare etileen reekse van die l-buteen bevattende terpolimere korter was as dié van die ooreenkomstige kopolimere, wat die gevoel dat die byvoeging van 'n derde komonomeer 'n verbeterde komonomeerverspreiding tot gevolg het, bevestig. Vanaf die verskillende aktiewe spesies teenwoordig in 'n Ziegler-Natta katalis is daar geredeneer dat drie hooftipes polimeerkettings in die terpolimere teenwoordig kan wees: (a) etileen hompolimeer, (b) etileen / laer a-olefien kopolimeer en (c) etileen / laer a-olefien / hoër a-olefien terpolimeer. Die verhouding tussen hierdie komponente in die finale terpolimeer hang primêr van die grootte van die hoër aolefien af. Hoe groter die derde a-olefien is, deur hoe meer van die aktiewe spesies sal dit verwerp word wat 'n groter hoeveelheid etileen / laer a-olefien kopolimeer tot gevolg sal hê. Daar word dus voorgestel dat die groot afname in digtheid en die geassosieerde veranderings in die toepaslike eiensappe waargeneem vir etileen / 1 - penteen / I-buteen terpolimeere, herlei kan word na die gekombineerde effek van verbeterde komonomeerverspreiding tesame met die afname lil die hoeveelheid etileen homopolimeer. Die moontlikheid om hoër cc-olefiene met onewe koolstofgetalle te gebruik in homogene propileen kopolimere is ondersoek. Soortgelyk aan dit wat waargeneem is vir die etileen kopolimere, was minder van die hoër cc-olefiene nodig om 'n spesifieke vlak van kristalliniteit te bereik. 'n Goeie ooreenkoms tussen trek-eienskappe en. komonomeer tipe- en inhoud is waargeneem en die grootte van die vertakking en die gevolglike defek wat dit veroorsaak in die kristal struktuur is die primêre faktor wat treksterkte beinvloed. Vir impaksterkte is 'n noue verband tusssen die grootte van die vertakking en komonomeer inhoud waargeneem. Daar is aangetoon dat die effek van die heptiel vertakking vanf die l-noneen eenheid 2. 3 keer dié van die propiel groep van die l-penteen eenheid is. Eienskappe van blok kopolimere kan nie direk na l-penteen inhoud herlei word soos die geval met die homogene kopolimere was nie, hoofsaaklik as gevolg van die heterogeniteit van die blok kopolimere. Die aktiverende effek van waterstof op katalis aktiwiteit is waargeneem. Daar is ook gesien dat die hoeveelheid l-penteen geïnkorporeer in die kopolimeer, sowel as die kopolimeer opbrengs, hoër was in die teenwoordigheid van waterstof as wanneer die reaksie sonder waterstof uitgevoer is. Deur DSC te gebruik was dit moontlik om verskillende kristallyne fases in die propileen / l-penteen blok kopolimere vanaf die verskille in hulle krisallisasie kinetika, te identifiseer. 'n Verbintenis tussen die lae-temperatuur piek en impaksterkte is waargeneem. Daar is gevind dat die teenwoordigheid van die laetemperatuur piek, komende van die dun lamellas gevorm, deur kettings wat baie defekte bevat, ongewens is wanneer hoë impaksterkte vereis word. Dit was nie moontlik om die bereik waartoe die intensiteit van hierdie piek die meganiese eienskappe van die blok kopolimere affekteer, te kwantifiseer nie. Vanaf reekslengte bepalings is daar gevind dat die verhouding tussen die propileen en I-penteen reekslengtes kwantitiatief herlei kan word na impaksterkte, modulus, hardheid en treksterkte van die ondersoekte polimere...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated {{polypropylene}} (CPO) {{is commonly}} used as an adhesion promoter for paint on polypropylene/ ethylene - <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> blends (PP/EP). An adhesion mechanism frequently proposed in the literature is the CPO diffusion into the substrate, leading to molecular entanglement. It is shown here that CPO and PP/EP are immiscible. On the other hand, the use of radiolabelled CPO allowed quantification of CPO diffusion into PP/EP substrates {{as a function of}} several parameters and under conditions which simulate industrial practice. Diffusion requires substrate swelling by the solvent. This explains that it increases with the EP content of the material, with the solvent ability to swell the substrate, and with the thickness of the paint. For baked samples, diffusion passes through a maximum when the delay between CPO application and baking is varied. This is due to a balance between two processes working in opposite directions, i. e. substrate swelling and solvent evaporation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe impact <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> (IPC) and {{isotactic}} polypropylene (iPP) were separately selected to prepare laminates with {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) by hot press. The peel forces of IPC/HDPE and iPP/HDPE laminates were examined, and {{it was found that}} the welded joint strength in IPC/HDPE laminate was dramatically higher than that of iPP/HDPE laminate. According to the special microstructure of IPC, the co-crystallization of the ethylene segments in ethylene-propylene block copolymer (EbP) component of IPC and the PE chain in HDPE was proposed to explain the highstrength welding. The DSC results indicated that there indeed existed some interaction between IPC and HDPE, and the crystallizable PE component in IPC could affect the crystallization of HDPE. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of IPC/HDPE blends demonstrated that HDPE tended to stay with the PE-rich EbP chains to form the dispersed phase, indicating the good miscibility between HDPE and EbP components of IPC. According to the above results, the effect of co-crystallization of the PE components of the IPC and HDPE on the high weld strength of IPC/HDPE laminate was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work aims {{to probe}} the roles of {{ethylene}} <b>propylene</b> segmented <b>copolymer</b> (EPS) in impact polypropylene copolymers (IPCs) by rheological and morphological investigations. A series of IPCs with different EPS contents and molecular structures are prepared by an atmosphere-switching polymerization process (ASPP). The Palieme emulsion model is {{used to describe the}} relationship between the rheological response to small amplitude oscillatory deformation and the morphology of IPC. It is found that this model describes well the linear viscoelastic responses of IPC, if the role of EPS is taken into account. An increase in the content of EPS and the length of its PP segments leads to a decrease {{in the size of the}} ethylene <b>propylene</b> random <b>copolymer</b> (EPR) phase domains and the interfacial tension. These results strongly confirm the role of the EPS as a compatibilizer in the IPC system. The adhesion between the PP matrix and the EPR phase domains is enhanced by the presence of the EPS that is produced in situ during the ASPP. For this reason, ASPP is capable of making IPC with an excellent rigidity toughness balance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) experiments {{were conducted on}} a 25 vol % blend of a poly(ethylene-block-head-to-head <b>propylene)</b> <b>copolymer</b> (PE-PP) in polyisobutylene (PIB). PE/PIB and PE/PP chains are incompatible (the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter ł> 0), while PIB and PP are compatible (ł 0) at high temperatures. These interactions lead to an order-disorder transition at 150 (5 °C and macrophase separation at 251 (5 °C. The nature of the concentration fluctuations in the homogeneous state (155 °C < T < 246 °C) was studied by comparing the experimentally determined SANS profiles with theoretical calculations based on the multicomponent random phase approximation (RPA). Order formation at low temperatures is driven by two parameters: łPE/PIB and lPP (the statistical segment length of the PP block). The other temperature-dependent parameters drive the system away from the ordering transition. At high temperatures, the RPA predicts microphase separation, while experimental data (neutron and light scattering) indicate macrophase separation. This discrepancy is mainly due to {{the inability of the}} RPA to correctly account for the large length scale concentration fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of fillers {{has long been}} used to improve both the mechanical and electrical properties of polymers. While mechanical properties have been well investigated, only recently has more attention {{been paid to the}} effect of fillers on electrical properties. The main objective of this work is to study charge relaxation in filled ethylene <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymer.</b> Ethylene <b>propylene</b> rubber (EPR) <b>copolymer</b> is a polymer which is widely used as insulation in medium and high voltage cable. This EPR insulation is highly filled and can have as many as 20 additives. Although the major effect of these additives on mechanical performance is known the effect on the dielectric behavior is not well understood. Thermally Stimulated Discharge Current (TSDC) measurements and Time Domain Dielectric Spectroscopy (TDDS) are employed to characterize the dielectric behavior of clay (kaolin) filled ethylene <b>propylene</b> rubber (EPR) <b>copolymer.</b> The TSDC results show two peaks at - 30 ∘C and 50 ∘C. ^ The low temperature peak is affected by the type of base polymer and is attributed to the motion of polymer chain segments. The high temperature peak is caused by the {{addition of}} the clay filler and shows dipole behavior. This peak is thought to be due to a distribution of dipole relaxations caused by the polarization at the clay/polymer interface. This peak can be described using Maxwell-Wagner interfacial effects where the polarization is dependent on the particle shape. The TDDS results show a loss peak in the low frequency region (0. 001 Hz) which is also attributed to the interfacial polarization introduced by the clay. Although bulk interfacial effects are thought to be the main mechanism which causes the polarization, the results have also indicated that surface ions on the clay filler will affect the polarization. The effect of silane treated clay, ion exchange of the clay and the effect of adding red lead (an ion scavenger) strongly suggests that ion motion and type of ion will affect this mechanism. ...|$|R

Drop/Matrix combinations were composed of polystyrene drops of 0. 522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 0. 6 mm in diameter in polyethylene matrix, and ethylene 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c <b>propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> drops of approximately the same size in polypropylene matrix. The deformation and breakup processes were studied under steady state and time-dependent shearing conditions. Either for steady state or time-dependant shearing conditions, drop elasticity generated at relatively high shear rates helped the drops to align perpendicular to the flow direction, i. e., parallel to vorticity axis. Also, the most striking non-Newtonian effects for the high viscosity ratio systems were the surface erosion and the drop splitting mechanisms. The particles eroded off the main droplet surface were very fine, in the range of 1022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 50 m, and led to a significant reduction in main drop size before its final breakup.

The nanocomposites were prepared via direct melt mixing using high shear corotating twin screw extruder. The {{effects of the}} process as well as adding amaleated-Polyethylene MAPE compatibilizer were assessed by morphology studies, thermal analysis and mechanical testing. From SEM and TEM investigations, a separate dispersion of filler and rubber in the PP matrix prevails in the PP/EPR/SiO 2 systems. Encapsulation of the filler particles into the elastomer takes place when MAPE is used, promoting filler/polymer interactions and resulting in a simultaneous improvement in stiffness and toughness. Interestingly, {{the results indicated that}} high-shear processing is an effective method to improve the dispersion of the EPR phase and fillers through the matrix. The dispersed phase droplet size was reduced with the increase of the shear rate by varying the screw rotation speed from 300 to 800 rpm, which induces a high shear stress exerted onthe materials. To sum up, what is expected from an efficient compatibilization-process association is the reduction of the dispersed elastomer domains characteristic size, their stabilization by creation of an interphase and thus, enhanced mechanical properties...|$|R

Samples {{recovered from the}} ram-facing direction of LDEF, which received vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation and atomic-oxygen impingement, and samples from the trailing edge, which received almost exclusively VUV exposure, were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The most significant result of this investigation was found on samples that received only VUV exposure. These samples possessed a hard, embrittled surface layer that was absent from the atomic-oxygen exposed sample and from unexposed control samples. This surface layer is believed to be responsible for the 'synergistic' effect between VUV and atomic oxygen. Overall, the investigation revealed dramatically different morphologies for the two samples. The sample receiving both atomic-oxygen and VUV exposure was deeply eroded and had a characteristic 'rolling' surface morphology, while the sample that received only VUV exposure showed mild erosion and a surface morphology characterized by sharp high-frequency peaks. The morphologies observed in the LDEF samples, including the embrittled surface layer, were successfully duplicated in the laboratory...|$|R

The DSC results for the blends of 50 / 50 and 30 / 70 compositions show two clear glass transition temperatures, indicating that the blends are two-phase systems. With the addition of compatibilizer, the separation between the two glass transitions decreased, suggesting an increased interaction between the blend components with compatibilizer. At 5 wt % of compatibilizer, the separation between the T(g) s reduced in both 50 / 50 and 30 / 70 blends. The positron results, for the blends without compatibilizer showed an increase in relative fractional free volume, as the EPDM content in the blend is increased. This suggests the coalescence of free volume of EPDM with the free volumes of PTT due to phase separation. However, the effect of compatibilizer in the blends was clearly seen with the observed minimum in free volume parameters at 5 % of the compatibilizer, further suggesting that this percent of compatibilizer seems to be the optimum value for these blends.
