5|$|The Narragansett <b>Pacer</b> {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the creation of the American Saddlebred, the Standardbred and the Tennessee Walking Horse. The breed was also combined with French pacers to create the Canadian <b>Pacer,</b> a breed especially suited to racing over ice and which also contributed substantially to the creation of the Standardbred. In the early 19th century, <b>Pacer</b> mares were bred to stallions of the fledgling Morgan breed. However, the Morgan breed was selected for a trot as an intermediate gait, and thus ambling horses were frowned upon, so most Narragansett/Morgan crosses were sold to Canada, the Caribbean, and South America, so the bloodlines did not remain within the Morgan breed. Other breeds indirectly influenced by the Narragansett <b>Pacer</b> include the Rocky Mountain Horse, a gaited breed started in Kentucky, and the Tiger Horse, a gaited breed with Appaloosa patterning.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett <b>Pacer,</b> while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a <b>Pacer</b> during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known <b>Pacer,</b> a mare, died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pacer</b> is {{an album}} {{released}} in October 1995 by the Amps, Kim Deal's side project from her group the Breeders, {{who took a}} break from playing together beginning in late 1994.

The band recorded <b>Pacer</b> at several studios in the USA and in Ireland, with different engineers each time, including Steve Albini, Bryce Goggin, and John Agnello.|$|E

5|$|The Narragansett <b>Pacer</b> was {{the first}} horse breed {{developed}} in the United States, but is now extinct. It {{was developed in the}} United States during the 18th century and associated closely with the state of Rhode Island, and it had become extinct by the late 19th century. The <b>Pacer</b> was developed from a mix of English and Spanish breeds, although the exact cross is unknown, and they were known to and owned by many famous personages of the day, including George Washington. Sales to the Caribbean and cross-breeding diminished the breed to the point of extinction, and the last known <b>Pacer</b> died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pacer</b> was {{released}} in October 1995. The group toured the United States, Europe, and Australia, with bands including the Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, and Guided by Voices. Critics commented on the loose and rough quality of these performances. The Amps continued as a group until 1996, when Deal changed their name back to the Breeders. By 2000, Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley had left the band; they were all at times involved in various projects with Guided by Voices' Robert Pollard. Deal's next album, the Breeders' Title TK, {{was released}} seven years after <b>Pacer.</b>|$|E

5|$|The third type was the Canadian <b>Pacer,</b> {{which was}} {{historically}} better documented {{than the other}} two types. Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England. The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice. From there, they were exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s. Pedigrees were not maintained, so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace. The Canadian <b>Pacer</b> influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.|$|E

Then, in 1999-2000 season, the <b>Pacers</b> made the NBA Finals for the first time, ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Lakers.

Most F models were also retired between 1967 and 1973, but 23 survived as {{trainers}} until late 1978.

Skinning {{on the lower}} wing and fuselage was replaced, and various structural components were renewed. The fleet of D models stayed largely intact until late 1978, when 37 not already upgraded Ds were retired. The remainder were retired between 1982 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium <b>pacer</b> Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Hutton then edged a {{ball from}} left-arm medium <b>pacer</b> Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after {{flicking}} the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton.

As the Knicks had a better regular season record, the series started in New York. In Game 1, the <b>Pacers</b> were down 6 points with 16.4 seconds left. Miller would single-handedly stun the Knicks by nailing a 3-pointer and then stealing the inbounds pass and tying the game with another 3-pointer. Knicks fan Spike Lee was just a few feet away. Miller would add 2 free throws and give the <b>Pacers</b> a legendary comeback win. The <b>Pacers</b> lost Game 2 and the series returned to Indiana. After four games, the <b>Pacers</b> took a 3-1 series lead. The Knicks would bounce back and force a 7th game at Madison Square Garden.

5|$|A batting all-rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium <b>pacer</b> Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also {{playing in the}} Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler. In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack {{was replaced by a}} batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler. Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton {{was the only one who}} was not a frontline bowler, and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No.6 or No.7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred <b>pacer</b> snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E
