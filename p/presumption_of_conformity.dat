50|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment falling {{within the}} scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN, CENELEC) and the International Organization for Standardization in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.|$|E

These include requirements for the design and construction of crafts such as boat design categories, craft identification, the owner’s manual, as well as integrity, structural and installation requirements. Other requirements apply to the exhaust and noise emissions from propulsion engines. To comply with the essential requirements, over 60 EN-ISO harmonised standards were developed, which provide guidelines to meet the essential requirements. Using the EN-ISO harmonised standards is voluntary and provides <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> with the Directive’s requirements.

The relevance of compliance with product safety standards has been extensively discussed, mainly in the USA.

40|$|The {{electrical}} equipment especially in critical facilities needs a seismic qualification {{and so the}} relative standard to define essential requirements to harmonize prescriptive protocols which ensure: - a minimum accepted level of integrity for the service continuity, - equipment tested in conventional configurations with benefits for all the stakeholders. Indeed, if design, installation and operation follow harmonized standards, they benefit from a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> that avoid liability for improperly designed and installed systems. A main objective pursued by this paper consists in fostering {{the definition of a}} seismic qualification of {{electrical equipment}}. The suggested approach can address the concept of a need for varying degrees of safety on equipment and define Equipment Seismic Levels (ESL) and Equipment Qualification Categories (EQC) of their earthquake inherent resistance.

40|$|Several European Union Members States {{exempted}} {{the implementation}} of the EMC Directive for defence contracts. According the lawyers, and validated in a court case, this is illegal, and thus the EMC Directive is applicable for military equipment too, except when an exemption for a clearly defined case has been granted. The European Commission confirmed this conclusion in an interpretative communication. The EMC Directive only gives essential requirements. The default route, giving <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> is making use of harmonized standards. The alternative route is the use of standards which have not been harmonised. Military standards are not harmonised, and are already in use as the reference in contracts between supplier and customer/user. Using the (test) evidence based on the military standards can therefore be used to prove compliance with the essential requirements of the EMC Directive, making additional testing superfluous. This paper describes the routes to compliance for military equipment...|$|E
40|$|For {{planning}} {{wireless communication}} systems the noise levels outside buildings have been used. The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) man-made noise levels {{are based on}} measurements performed in the 1970 s. Measurements carried out since then showed that the noise caused by ignition systems reduced, but man-made noise in business areas and city centers increased. But the interference scenario changed: from analog communication systems in relatively free space to digital systems in living areas, often semi-enclosed such as offices, industrial production areas, and even cars and trains. Measurements in these semi-enclosed environments show a much higher, up to 60 dB, manmade noise level. The higher noise level is not only due to a shorter distance {{to the source of}} emission, but mainly due to mistakenly assumption that compliance with a harmonized product standard is sufficient evidence of compliance with the European EMC directive. This is an incorrect and a wrong assumption. The EMC directive gives essential requirements to comply with. The use of harmonized product standards only gives a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> In a court case in a dispute on EMC of an electrical wheelchair, the key reference was the essential requirements and not the harmonized product standards. Several product standards have been developed with relaxed, or sometimes even no requirements. Some allow unlimited emission levels while others restricted the frequency range. These standards, although harmonized, are not in line with the essential protection requirements of the EMC directive...|$|E

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} of the European Court of Human Rights in Stichting Mothers of Srebrenica and Others v. the Netherlands addresses two very sensitive and complex issues: 1) the compatibility of jurisdictional immunities with the European Convention on human rights and 2) {{the relationship between the}} Convention and the UN legal order. The Strasbourg Case-law on these questions had recently revealed a more favourable attitude towards human rights protection. The decision under review marks a significant step backwards in that respect. The applicants submitted that the Dutch courts’ grant of immunity to the United Nations breached their right of access to court, and thus violated Article 6 of the Convention. The Court rejected the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. This holding is mainly based on the special nature of the dispute, involving the use by the Security Council of its powers under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. According to the Court, bringing United Nations military operations within the scope of national jurisdiction would mean allowing States to interfere with the Organization’s key mission to guarantee international peace and security. This notwithstanding, the Court did not refrain from expressing some considerations about the legal regime of immunities of international organizations which seem to indicate shift away from its previous Case-law. In the author’s opinion, the Court’s approach, especially in relation {{to the question of the}} scope of immunities enjoyed by the Organization on the basis of the international law obligations embodied in the Charter and in the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities, is open to criticism. The Court should have taken the opportunity to apply the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> of Security Council resolutions with human rights established in Al-Jedda also to these obligations. This stance could have led the Court to construe the availability of alternative dispute settlement mechanisms as a necessary condition for the grant of immunity...|$|E
