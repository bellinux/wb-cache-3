Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined.

The underutilized coal waste accumulates and forms waste pile. Its spontaneous combustion could lead to serious environmental problem, indicating it is particularly important to comprehensively treat the coal waste <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous combustion. According to the mechanism and characteristic of coal waste <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous combustion, this study classified the treatment in the different periods into diagnosis of spontaneous combustion, extinguishment, fire prevention and vegetation restoration.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} defective <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> stem shrinkage on the working behavior of pile foundations under vertical loadings, a numerical model was set up for the analysis of pile foundations. A series of contrastive analyses were made to a group piled foundations including a <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> defect of stem shrinkage in a shallow or a deeper depth and a <b>pile</b> foundation <b>with</b> normal <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> a three dimensional nonlinear finite-infinite element method. The basic working behavior of the <b>pile</b> foundation <b>with</b> a defective <b>pile</b> of stem shrinkage was initially revealed by the results of the analyses; and the basic rules of the affects of pile stem shrinkage defect on the distribution of axial forces among piles and the bending moments in pile caps were obtained. The results of this research are not only helpful for the understanding and rational judgment of the working mechanism, but also of practical importance in the assessment of the bearing behavior of pile foundations including defective <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> stem shrinkage and in the structural designs of piles and pile caps...|$|R

2500|$|Pittsburgh-seam coal, {{especially}} the highest-quality coal {{found in the}} Connellsville district, was the best coal in America for making coke. When converted into coke, it was sufficiently strong to withstand the weight of iron ore that was <b>piled</b> <b>with</b> coke inside iron furnaces. [...] It has {{a high proportion of}} carbon, which accelerates [...] combustion, and a low proportion of impurities, including ash and moisture, which retards combustion. Pittsburgh coal also has a low proportion of sulfur, which is critical to making high-quality iron. In addition, the Pittsburgh seam was located close to Pittsburgh, then the center of the growing American iron and steel industry. Coke had to be transported by water or rail to iron furnaces, and the Pittsburgh seam's proximity to iron furnaces gave the bed another competitive advantage over more distant coal seams that could produce coke.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and Spanish moss, or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants. At the same time early European settlers, oblivious to the [...] "protein-rich coasts" [...] all about them, starved from lack of protein. In 1735 beach seines were imported from France, and Cajun fishermen in Louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun, as they still do today. In the mid nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants arrived for the California Gold Rush, many from the Pearl River Delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries. Some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to San Francisco Bay, particularly the small inch long Crangon franciscorum. These shrimp burrow into the sand to hide, and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so. The catch was dried {{in the sun and}} was exported to China or sold to the Chinese community in the United States. This {{was the beginning of the}} American shrimping industry. Overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery. It was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts. These shrimp were so abundant that beaches were <b>piled</b> <b>with</b> windrows from their moults. Modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area.|$|E
2500|$|When Hooker's lead {{elements}} {{entered the}} mountain pass, Cleburne {{allowed them to}} get to within fifty yards of his men before ordering them to open fire. Reeling from the first volleys, the astonished Federals fell back, but quickly regrouped and mounted one furious counterattack after another, seeking first to turn Cleburne's right flank (where the 33rd Alabama was), then his left. Each renewed assault ran into a withering Confederate response, described by one history as [...] "a wall of fire;" [...] one of Cleburne's regiments exhausted its ammunition, and resorted to throwing rocks before the reserve came up and relieved them. Ringgold Gap became a slaughterhouse {{over the next four}} hours as Hooker fed regiment after regiment into the fray, only to see each thrown back with severe losses; Private Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry described the gap as having [...] "the appearance of a roof of a house, shingled with dead Yankees... From the foot {{to the top of the}} hill was covered with the slain, all lying on their faces... The ground was <b>piled</b> <b>with</b> dead Yankees; they were lying in heaps." [...] Once his columns had reached safety further south in Dalton, Bragg ordered Cleburne to pull back; he withdrew his men, and Hooker took possession of the pass around 2PM. In the midst of all the carnage, the 33rd Alabama had lost only one man; their division as a whole had lost only twenty killed and 201 wounded, while holding off a Federal force four times their number for nearly five hours.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} loading test on steel <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> web of {{different}} corrugation profiles {{has been carried}} out to study the performance of <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> trapezoid web in resisting loadings. Hypothetically, the inclined part of the corrugated web can provide an extra skin friction capacity of the pile. In the full scale tests, maintained load and constant rate of penetration tests were carried out. Six piles of different web corrugations were used in the test, all of which had the dimension of 200 x 80 mm and 5. 0 m length. Maintained load test and constant rate penetration test on all the pile types had been carried out. The force versus settlement was plotted, designated as the resistance behaviour of the steel pile section against the vertical load. Comparison had been made to present the differences of the skin friction resistance capacities between both types of piles. The pattern of the settlement and end bearing capacity of the pile were also analyzed. The test results indicate that the total bearing capacities of <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> trapezoid web are higher than that of the flat web section of the same cross section area. The bearing capacities of <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> full corrugations are in the range of 30 kN while the <b>piles</b> <b>with</b> flat web are only 20 kN. The study shown the trapezoid-section pile {{can be used as a}} better alternative to the conventional-section pile in term of the load bearing capacity...|$|R
40|$|Peter Hegarty Abstract. We study a {{variation}} of the combinatorial game of 2 -pile Nim. Move as in 2 -pile Nim but with the following constraint: Provided the previous player has just removed say x> 0 tokens from the <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> less tokens, the next player may remove x tokens from the <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> more tokens. But for each move, in “a strict sequence of previous player- next player moves”, such an imitation takes place, the value of an imitation counter is increased by one unit. As this counter reaches a pre-determined natural number, then by the rules of this game, if the previous player once again removes a positive number of tokens from the <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> less tokens, the next player may not remove this same number of tokens from the <b>pile</b> <b>with</b> more tokens. We show that the winning positions of this game in a sense resemble closely the winning positions of the game of Wythoff Nim- more precisely a version of Wythoff Nim with a Muller twist. In fact, we show a slightly more general result in which we have relaxed the notion of what an imitation is. 1...|$|R
