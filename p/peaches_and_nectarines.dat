25|$|Being {{a rather}} neutral grape, Australian winemakers first {{approached}} Chardonnay {{in the same}} manner they were making wine from the similarly neutral Sultana grape. Aromatic yeast were added and maceration was extended to get more flavors from skin contact. While the style of Australian Chardonnay is mostly characterized by the mass-produced products of the hot Riverland region, the cooler climates of the Southern Highlands in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have been creating more crisp, less oaked wines with lime notes. In the Cowra region, Chardonnay's citrus notes are emphasized while Hunter Valley examples have more richness and smoky notes. The Adelaide Hills and Yarra Valley produce a more Burgundian style while Mount Barker in the Great Southern wine region of Western Australia produces Chardonnay that more closely resembles those of Chablis. A rare, isolated clone exists in the Mudgee region that locals believe traces its ancestry back to some of the first vines brought to Australia in the 19th century. While the wine made from this clone is not particularly distinguished, it can still be of very good quality. Overall, there has been a shift in style since the 1980s from deep golden, oily wines with melon and butterscotch flavors to lighter, paler Chardonnays with more structure and notes of white <b>peaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarines.</b> Sparkling wines from Chardonnay are produced in the cool regions of Geelong, Adelaide Hills, Macedon Ranges and Tasmania.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} Major Randolph took her with Adele {{in a light}} cariole over the ranch. Although his domain was nearly {{as large as the}} {{adjoining}} wheat plain, it was not, like that, monopolized by one enormous characteristic yield, but embraced a more diversified product. There were acres and acres of potatoes in rows of endless and varying succession; there were miles of wild oats and barley, which overtopped them as they drove in narrow lanes of dry and dusty monotony; there were orchards of pears, apricots, <b>peaches,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarines,</b> and vineyards of grapes, so comparatively dwarfed in height that they scarcely reached to the level of their eyes, yet laden and breaking beneath the weight of their ludicrously disproportionate fruit. What seemed to be a vast green plateau covered with tiny patches, that headed the northern edge of the prospect, was an enormous bed of strawberry plants. But everywhere, crossing the track, bounding the fields, orchards, and vineyards, intersecting the paths of the whole domain, were narrow irrigating ducts and channels of running water.|$|E
60|$|In most {{of these}} cases of crossed varieties, and {{in some of the}} cases of crossed species, the colours proper to both parents {{appeared}} in the seedlings, as soon as they first flowered, in the form of stripes or larger segments, or as whole flowers or fruit of different kinds borne on the same plant; and in this case the appearance of the two colours cannot strictly be said to be due to reversion, but to some incapacity of fusion. When, however, the later flowers or fruit produced during the same season, or during a succeeding year or generation, become striped or half-and-half, etc., the segregation of the two colours is strictly a case of reversion by bud-variation. Whether all the many recorded cases of striped flowers and fruit are due to previous hybridisation and reversion is by no means clear, for instance with <b>peaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarines,</b> moss-roses, etc. In a future chapter I shall show that, with animals of crossed parentage, the same individual has been known to change its character during growth, and to revert to one of its parents which it did not at first resemble. Finally, from the various facts now given, {{there can be no doubt}} that the same individual plant, whether a hybrid or a mongrel, sometimes returns in its leaves, flowers, and fruit, either wholly or by segments, to both parent- forms.|$|E
60|$|These are {{the main}} {{principles}} in this matter; which, like nearly all other right principles in art, we moderns delight in contradicting as directly and specially as may be. We continually look for, and praise, in our exhibitions the sculpture of veils, and lace, and thin leaves, {{and all kinds of}} impossible things pushed as far as possible in the fragile stone, for the sake of showing the sculptor's dexterity. [Footnote: I do not mean to attach any degree of blame to the effort to represent leafage in marble for certain expressive purposes. The later works of Mr. Munro have depended for some of their most tender thoughts on a delicate and skilful use of such accessories. And in general, leaf sculpture is good and admirable, if it renders, as in Gothic work, the grace and lightness of the leaf by the arrangement of light and shadow --supporting the masses well by strength of stone below; but all carving is base which proposes to itself slightness as an aim, and tries to imitate the absolute thinness of thin or slight things, as much modern wood carving does, I saw in Italy, a year or two ago, a marble sculpture of birds' nests.] On the other hand, we cast our iron into bars--brittle, though an inch thick--sharpen them at the ends, and consider fences, and other work, made of such materials, decorative! I do not believe {{it would be easy to}} calculate the amount of mischief done to our taste in England by that fence iron-work of ours alone. If it were asked of us by a single characteristic, to distinguish the dwellings of a country into two broad sections; and to set, on one side, the places where people were, for the most part, simple, happy, benevolent, and honest; and, on the other side, the places where at least a great number of the people were sophisticated, unkind, uncomfortable, and unprincipled, there is, I think, one feature that you could fix upon as a positive test: the uncomfortable and unprincipled parts of a country would be the parts where people lived among iron railings, and the comfortable and principled parts where they had none. A broad generalization, you will say! Perhaps a little too broad; yet, in all sobriety, it will come truer than you think. Consider every other kind of fence or defence, and you will find some virtue in it; but in the iron railing none. There is, first, your castle rampart of stone--somewhat too grand to be considered here among our types of fencing; next, your garden or park wall of brick, which has indeed often an unkind look on the outside, but there is more modesty in it than unkindness. It generally means, not that the builder of it wants to shut you out from the view of his garden, but from the view of himself: it is a frank statement that as he needs a certain portion of time to himself, so he needs a certain portion of ground to himself, and must not be stared at when he digs there in his shirt- sleeves, or plays at leapfrog with his boys from school, or talks over old times with his wife, walking up and down in the evening sunshine. Besides, the brick wall has good practical service in it, and shelters you from the east wind, and ripens your <b>peaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarines,</b> and glows in autumn like a sunny bank. And, moreover, your brick wall, if you build it properly, so that it shall stand long enough, is a beautiful thing when it is old, and has assumed its grave purple red, touched with mossy green.|$|E

40|$|The Agricultural Research Council Institute for Deciduous Fruit Technology (ARC–Infruitec) {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in the growth and development of the <b>peach</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> industry in South Africa. This institute’s <b>peach</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> research programme has developed 96 cultivars since 1937 that have been extensively used in the local industry. The programme accounted for two thirds of the stone fruit cultivars bred at ARC–Infruitec between 1996 and 2012. Based on the number of cultivars released between 1990 and 1996, the research programme was ranked 7 th in the world. The Institute’s various research outputs have led to farmers reaping higher yields and the expansion of the industry’s production area, which used to be restricted to the Western Cape Province. The research outputs have also enabled industry stakeholders to explore new lucrative marketing windows and increase the production capacity in the canning sector. Despite these contributions, there still remains an inadequate understanding of the benefits of research for the industry stakeholders who are expected to provide the financial resources that are required for the delivery of this research service. In addition, the rate of decay of research investment benefits is also unknown thus, investors fail to appreciate the full effect of their research investment in the <b>peaches</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> industry. Therefore, this study serves to supplement the aggregate level rate of return studies that have been done in the past. It is envisaged that the accurate attribution of research benefits at this level will bring a better appreciation of the rate of return on the industry stakeholder’s investment in research and will end the continued decreasing trend of research investment in the Institute, a trend that is threatening research and research benefit generation. The study has approached this task by reporting on the degree of use of the technologies that the Agricultural Research Council has released into the industry through its <b>peach</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> research programme, <b>and</b> also by performing a rate of return calculation. The relationship between the stakeholders’ research investment and the industry output has been modelled using a supply response function. This econometric model uses a 41 –year time series that stretches from 1971 to 2012. The results of the regression analysis show that the magnitude of production increase associated with a ten percent increase in research investment, ranges from 3. 1 percent to 12. 5 percent. A Marginal Internal Rate of Return of the programme of 55. 9 percent is estimated. The analysis also shows that the returns of investment in <b>peach</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> research reach their maximum benefit level in the 13 th year after investment and thereafter continue being positive and of increasing significance for an undefined period of time. The calculated <b>peach</b> <b>and</b> <b>nectarine</b> research programme’s rate of return is relatively high and shows that the investment is valuable. This figure lies within the range of other rate of return calculations which have been done for similar South African research programmes. It is advisable for industry stakeholders to increase their research investment in order to ensure future profits in the industry.
