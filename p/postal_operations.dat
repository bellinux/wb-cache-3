This offer was rejected by {{the government}}, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.|$|E

2500|$|By policy, the USPS is {{reluctant}} to establish direct to door delivery to new addresses, and now requires special approvals to initiate this service (<b>Postal</b> <b>Operations</b> Manual, Section 631.2) Instead, the USPS has insisted upon centralized mail delivery in virtually all newly constructed residential housing developments, condominiums, and gated communities by requiring or incentivizing the builder or developer to install larger NDCBU (Neighborhood Delivery Collection Box Unit) stations. CBUs and NDCBUs are both commonly known as cluster mailboxes. [...] The NDCBU is a centralized community mail station with compartments for the centralized delivery of mail to multiple recipients at multiple addresses within a single neighborhood development or community.|$|E

It was then relocated to GPO premises in Bournemouth to be nearer to the Continent and therefore provide a more efficient service to the troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) serving in France and Belgium. Correspondence addressed to [...] "APO England" [...] and to Army and RAF units serving overseas tended at the GPO was circulated to the HPD RE. The Depot, whose primary responsibility was to collect, sort and despatch military mail to its final destination, also acted as a recruitment, training and reinforcement depot, as well as, a Records Office for the RE (PS) and a supply centre for Postal units worldwide.In May 1941 the Depot was redesignated the Home Postal Centre RE (HPC RE) and relocated to Nottingham, where the organisation requisitioned, for operational and billeting purposes, a hundred and forty of the city's buildings, including; the Vyvella factory premises, the Hickings buildings, the GPO's Queen Street offices and Trent Bridge Cricket ground.

50|$|Fort McLoughlin {{operated}} between 1832 and 1842. When {{the fort}} was closed, the village remained. At some point a white trader acquired legal {{title to the}} land that the fort had occupied. This trader operated a store for some time on the site during the late 1800s. His store incorporated a postal service - using the name Bella Bella. When the Heiltsuk relocated to the current site of Bella Bella - the store {{went out of business}} and the <b>postal</b> <b>operation</b> was moved across the channel to the BC Packers cannery site. Eventually this also closed and the postal service was moved to the small non-Aboriginal community of Shearwater. When the Heiltsuk began operating a postal service in their community - the name Bella Bella was not available - so the alternate name - Waglisla was used.|$|R
30|$|The CL concept {{exploits}} a new {{spirit of}} collaboration and commercialises social networks {{in a way}} that can be beneficial from an economic, social and environmental point of view [46]. However, as leading enterprises (retailers and LSPs) are embracing this paradigm shift in the distribution of work, by outsourcing to the crowd in the cloud [18], much of the thinking and discussion about CL has developed from the practitioner’s side [26]. Examples of such initiatives include Myways, a terminated pilot project of DHL that was launched in Sweden [53], bringr, an experiment by the Belgian <b>postal</b> <b>operation</b> bpost [54] and efforts of retailer Walmart in the USA, at first with in-store customers that served as crowd, later on in cooperation with CL start-ups Lyft, Deliv and UberRUSH [55]. The latter example demonstrates the importance for businesses starting up in the increasingly competitive delivery service industry to collaborate with traditional or mature companies. The collaboration between fashion e-retailer Zalando and CL initiative Trunkrs for last-mile deliveries in Amsterdam possibly fosters advantages for Trunkrs, such as brand awareness, consumer trust and user generation [56].|$|R

40|$|Postal crimes {{have long}} been an issue of public and {{governmental}} concern, and compared to relative international and national law enforcement entities; there are many lessons to be learned. There are significant differences between Canada and United States in regards to law enforcement within postal services. The number of postal related crimes is greater in the United States than in Canada, however the characteristics and dynamics of postal crimes and incidents are often identical. Mail is a crucial government service with legislated rights and responsibilities; mass-marketing fraud, vandalism and theft of property {{by the general public}} remain significant interrelated postal crime issues. This project paper examines the contrast between postal crimes and the objective of law enforcement and investigative bodies legislated to manage them. In addition, the implications of these findings and recommendations to law enforcement training and policy are outlined. The Canada Post Security and Investigation Services are analyzed through a qualitative lens. It is suggestive that the Security and Investigation Services would benefit from initiatives regarding the compilation of data in relation to postal crimes; extending their security leadership and providing a recognized security standard for the nation’s exclusive <b>postal</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Developing and {{maintaining}} an International Addressing Standard {{is an important}} prerequisite for effective <b>postal</b> <b>operation</b> and for interconnecting the global network. The Post, the end customers and the overall mailing community benefit from well defined addressing standards {{and the use of}} country-based templates. Adopting and using address standards leads to the following benefits: • Improves the value of mail as a means of communication • Provides for the efficient processing of international mail that, with country-specific addressing tools, can result in international mail being processed as efficiently as addressed domestic mail • Fosters the exchange of postal-related information between postal operators • Promotes the compatibility of UPU and international postal initiatives • Allows the Post to work closely with postal handling organizations, customers, suppliers and other partners, including various international organizations. A primary advantage to having access to country-specific templates reflecting a standardized address format is improved deliverability of mail. Properly formatted mail supports automation compatibility, barcode accuracy, carrier route assignments; pre-sort levels, postage payment accuracy, timely and consistent processing, and improved customer satisfaction. From the postal administration viewpoint, the use of complete and correct address information can result in reduced operational and delivery costs. In addition, by improving the efficiency and reliability of mail, we improve the value of mail as a communications medium with the overall result being an increase in the volume of mail. From the customer viewpoint, complete and correct address information increases the surety that a mailpiece be delivered to the intended recipient without delay. It fosters reliability – {{one of the most important}} features that customer value. Paper was downloaded in pdf format from [URL] This document consists of a paper and a presentation. [URL]...|$|R
