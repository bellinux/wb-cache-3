40|$|Libraries sign a {{wide variety}} of {{licensing}} agreements that specify terms of both access and use of a publisher’s electronic collections. Adding easily accessible licensing information to collections helps ensure that library users comply with these agreements. This article will describe the addition of licensing <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> resource displays using Mondo by Queen’s University and Scholars Portal (a service of the Ontario Council of University Libraries). We will give a brief introduction to Mondo and explain how we improved Mondo to add the license <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> different library systems. The systems we used are an ILS (Voyager), an OpenURL Link Resolver (360 Link), and a Discovery System (Summon). However, libraries can use Mondo to add the license <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> other library systems which allow user configurations...|$|R

50|$|If the {{delegation}} is for very specific rights, {{also known as}} fine-grained, such as with Role-based access control (RBAC) delegation, then {{there is always a}} risk of under-delegation, i.e., the delegator does not delegate all the necessary <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> perform a delegated job. This may cause the denial of service, which is very undesirable in some environments, such as in safety critical systems or in health care. In RBAC-based delegation, one option to achieve delegation is by reassigning a set of <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> the role of a delegatee; however, finding the relevant permissions for a particular job is not an easy task for large and complex systems. Moreover, by assigning these <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> a delegatee role, all other users who are associated with that particular role get the delegated rights.|$|R
