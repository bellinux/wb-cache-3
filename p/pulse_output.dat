However, the G-M tube produces a <b>pulse</b> <b>output</b> {{which is the}} same magnitude for all detected radiation, so a Geiger counter with an end window tube cannot distinguish between alpha and beta particles.

40|$|Multimodal medical {{image fusion}} (MIF) plays an {{important}} role in clinical diagnosis and therapy. Existing MIF methods tend to introduce artifacts, lead to loss of image details or produce low-contrast fused images. To address these problems, a novel spiking cortical model (SCM) based MIF method has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method can generate high-quality fused images using the weighting fusion strategy based on the firing times of the SCM. In the weighting fusion scheme, the weight is determined by combining the entropy information of <b>pulse</b> <b>outputs</b> of the SCM with the Weber local descriptor operating on the firing mapping images produced from the <b>pulse</b> <b>outputs.</b> The extensive experiments on multimodal medical images show that compared with the numerous state-of-the-art MIF methods, the proposed method can preserve image details very well and avoid the introduction of artifacts effectively, and thus it significantly improves the quality of fused images in terms of human vision and objective evaluation criteria such as mutual information, edge preservation index, structural similarity based metric, fusion quality index, fusion similarity metric and standard deviation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{pulsed power}} {{amplifier}} operating at a nominal 250 MHz with 2 kW (63 dBm) output {{was designed to}} meet the specifications for an application in a pulsed EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectrometer and was built by Tomco Technologies of Adelaide, South Australia. Key design features were pulse fidelity for short (e. g., 40 ns) RF <b>pulses,</b> <b>output</b> noise blanking after the <b>pulse,</b> and <b>output</b> power linear with input power from very low levels up to 2 kW output. A summary of the specifications, design, and performance of the amplifier is presented. The 2 kW RF amplifier tested has approximately 12 ns rise times and 15 ns fall times, permitting the formation of approximately 40 ns RF pulses. It has negligible amplitude droop over microsecond-long pulses and negligible phase change over microsecond long pulses. There was observable but small phase change during the rise and fall times of the pulse.

50|$|A PCNN is a {{two-dimensional}} neural network. Each neuron {{in the network}} corresponds to one pixel in an input image, receiving its corresponding pixel’s color information (e.g. intensity) as an external stimulus. Each neuron also connects with its neighboring neurons, receiving local stimuli from them. The external and local stimuli are combined in an internal activation system, which accumulates the stimuli until it exceeds a dynamic threshold, resulting in a <b>pulse</b> <b>output.</b> Through iterative computation, PCNN neurons produce temporal series of pulse outputs.

50|$|Proportional {{counters}} in {{the form}} of large area planar detectors are used extensively to check for radioactive contamination on personnel, flat surfaces, tools and items of clothing. This is normally {{in the form}} of installed instrumentation because of the difficulties of providing portable gas supplies for hand-held devices. They are constructed with a large area detection window made from such as metallised mylar which forms one wall of the detection chamber and is part of the cathode. The anode wire is routed in a convoluted manner within the detector chamber to optimise the detection efficiency. They are normally used to detect alpha and beta particles, and can enable discrimination between them by providing a <b>pulse</b> <b>output</b> proportional to the energy deposited in the chamber by each particle. They have a high efficiency for beta, but lower for alpha. The efficiency reduction for alpha is due to the attenuation effect of the entry window, though distance from the surface being checked also has a significant effect, and ideally a source of alpha radiation should be less than 10mm from the detector due to attenuation in air.|$|E

ODE-LOCKED semiconductor lasers are important M sources of short optical pulses for optical communica-tions, optoelectronic measurement systems, and physics ex-periments. Active and hybrid activelpassive mode-locking {{are the most important}} modulation techniques for these appli-cations because of their amplitude and temporal stability [l] and the presence of a system timing reference. However, actively mode-locked external cavity semiconductor lasers with a single gain segment are very susceptible to multiple pulse formation [2]. The undesired secondary pulses are initiated by reflections from imperfect antireflection coatings on the laser-diode facet. The reflected pulse is then amplified because the main pulse does not fully deplete the gain and current drive to the segment may still be creating new carriers. Schell et al. [3] have calculated that even a very good antireflection coating, will cause multiple pulse generation at the round-trip time of the diode laser. In this letter we show that incorporation of reverse-biased in-trawaveguide saturable absorber segments [4] into the cavity suppresses the multiple pulse generation problem.
