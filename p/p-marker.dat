50|$|A related {{concept is}} that of phrase marker or <b>P-marker,</b> as used in {{transformational}} generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented {{in the form of}} a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further transformational rules.|$|E
40|$|Kuno-i A {{system is}} {{proposed}} here for assigning a derived <b>P-marker</b> {{to a given}} transformed sentence and obtaining the corresponding base <b>P-marker</b> at the same time. Rules of analytical phrase-structure grammar for such a system have associated with them i~formation pertaining to the transfor-mational histories of their own derivation. When a phrase-structure analysis of the sentence is obtained, the set of grammar rules used for the analysis contains all the information necessary for the direct mapping of the derived <b>P-marker</b> into the corresponding <b>P-marker.</b> The system {{can also be used}} for decomposing a given complex sentence into &quot;kernel&quot; sentences for the purpose of structure matching between a query sentence and stored document sentences in information retrieval. An experimental program for the proposed system has been written and is currently tested with a small sample grammar. Study is underway {{to see if there is}} any mechanical procedure for obtaining an smalytical phrase structure grammar of the proposed type for a given transformational grammar...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} locative predicate-complement form-class in German is described {{within the framework of}} a generative grammar consisting of a phrase-structure (PS) component, a semantic (S) component, and a transformation (T) component. The S-component is interposed between the PS-component and the T-component. The PScomponent generates the deep {{internal structure}} of the locative form-class {{as a function of the}} metaelement "irgendwo, " assigning hierarchical relationships and groupings in the process. The S-component translates the "irgendwo"-quantified syntactic patterns of the <b>P-marker</b> into their corresponding semantic denotational patterns, resulting in an S-marker, and then returns the derivation to its <b>P-marker</b> at the level of the locative class symbols. The T-component then operates on this level, if necessary, to obtain the derived <b>P-marker</b> and thus the surface grammar. The metaelement "irgendwo " proves to be more than a syntactic filter assigning locative structure. It proves to be a semantic filter that reveals the indexical symbolic nature of the locative adverbs and their symbolic relationships to each other as well as to the locative prepositional phrase...|$|E
5000|$|Phrase markers, or <b>P-markers,</b> were {{introduced}} in early transformational generative grammar, as developed by Noam Chomsky and others. A phrase marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by applying phrase structure rules; this may then undergo further transformations. Phrase markers may be presented {{in the form of}} trees (as in the above section on constituency-based parse trees), but are often given instead in the form of bracketed expressions, which occupy less space. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the constituency-based tree given above may be something like: ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{have described}} several classes of methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. Although the RI class is resistant {{because of an}} altered target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, the RIII class derived from RI cells is somewhat more resistant because of a moderate amplification of the altered dhfr structural gene (Flintoff et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 2 : 275 - 285, 1982). In one RIII line, a translocation between the short arm (p) of chromosome 2 and the long arm (q) of chromosome 5 was observed, and the amplified RIII gene complex was mapped to the p arm of the 2 <b>p-marker</b> chromosome derived from the translocation (Worton et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1 : 330 - 335, 1981). We tested the hypothesis that chromosomal translocation is a general feature of RIII cells and that such translocation involves a site {{at or near the}} dhfr structural gene. Thus, we examined four independently derived RIII-type mutants and found that each had a moderate amplification of the dhfr gene sequences, and karyotype analysis revealed that each carried a translocation involving the 2 p arm at or near band 2 p 25. That this chromosomal rearrangement involves a site near the dhfr locus was demonstrated by mapping the altered but unamplified structural gene coding for the RI phenotype to the short arm of an unaltered chromosome 2. This suggests that a highly specific rearrangement involving an exchange at or near the site of the unamplified gene is a necessary prerequisite for the amplification process. A model for gene amplification involving chromosomal rearrangements and sister chromatid exchange is described...|$|E
