The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump.

40|$|A {{model of}} the volumetrically-controlled {{hemodialysis}} circuit. We developed a model that predicts the hemodynamics of the volumetrically-controlled circuit used to administer high flux hemodialysis. The equations simulate the entire blood side of the circuit so that blood and dialysate pressures can be predicted from a knowledge of circuit component and patient characteristics. An alternative method of computation has also been devised which permits measured <b>circuit</b> <b>pressures</b> {{to be used to}} predict patient blood access pressure, dialyzer resistance to flow and membrane hydraulic conductivity. Success of the model was evaluated by measuring both <b>circuit</b> <b>pressure</b> and component characteristics. The model successfully predicted <b>circuit</b> <b>pressures</b> when measured component characteristics were employed as model inputs. Conversely, the model accurately predicted circuit component characteristics when measured pressures were employed as inputs (8 patients, 30 dialyses). Specific predictions of the model include the following. Elevations of patient blood access pressure will cause blood and dialysate pressures to rise equivalently without affecting the rate of backfiltration or location of pressure equilibrium along the dialyzer axis. Elevated hematocrit is predicted to increase <b>circuit</b> <b>pressures</b> to a degree that is similar to a poorly functioning blood access, however, high hematocrit markedly augments backfiltration and moves the point of pressure equilibrium toward the dialyzer entrance. We conclude that the model provides a predictive tool {{that can be used to}} optimize circuit design.

It was not clear whether these dinosaurs had high blood pressure simply to support the blood column or to support the high blood flow rates required by endothermy or both.However, recent analysis of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for blood flow rate and hence metabolic rate. The holes are called nutrient foramina, and the nutrient artery is the major blood vessel passing through to the interior of the bone, where it branches into tiny vessels of the Haversian canal system. This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion. Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to stress fractures and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of allometry. Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion. Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in ectothermic reptiles. Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals. Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with endothermy.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>pressure</b> sensing <b>circuit</b> for {{non-invasive}} RF/microwave {{blood glucose}} sensors {{is presented in}} this paper. RF sensors are of interest to researchers for measuring blood glucose levels non-invasively. For the measurements, the finger is a popular site that has {{a good amount of}} blood supply. When a finger is placed on top of the RF sensor, the electromagnetic fields radiating from the sensor interact with the blood in the finger and the resulting sensor response depends on the permittivity of the blood. The varying glucose level in the blood results in a permittivity change causing a shift in the sensor’s response. Therefore, by observing the sensor’s frequency response {{it may be possible to}} predict the blood glucose level. However, there are two crucial points in taking and subsequently predicting the blood glucose level. These points are; the position of the finger on the sensor and the pressure applied onto the sensor. A variation in the glucose level causes a very small frequency shift. However, finger positioning and applying inconsistent pressure have more pronounced effect on the sensor response. For this reason, it may not be possible to take a correct reading if these effects are not considered carefully.

Flow-induced corrosion {{is one of}} the most prevalent tube damage mechanisms in steam generators of power plants.

The system uses reverse osmosis (RO) and a batch principle of operation to overcome the problem of concentration factor which prevents continuous-flow RO systems from ever reaching this limit and thus achieving the minimum possible specific energy consumption, SEC.
