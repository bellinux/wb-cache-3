25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure {{if it is to}} be a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code.

Data envelopment analysis is used to compute an insurer's <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance</b> including technical, allocative, cost, and revenue efficiency. We then employ truncated bootstrapped regression to test the relation between <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance</b> and corporate governance. The {{results show that the}} characteristics of corporate governance influence the <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance</b> of non-life insurers. In particular, board independence, diligence, and firm size {{have a positive impact on}} the <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance</b> of the Thai non-life insurance companies. However, audit committee size, diligence, divergence between voting rights and cash flow rights, board tenure, board age, as well as board ownership have a negative impact on the <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance.</b> Finally, our empirical evidence also indicates that there is an unclear relation between an insurer's <b>efficiency</b> <b>performance</b> and the board size, the proportion of financial expertise on an audit committee, and the board compensation. ...|$|R

40|$|Airport {{benchmarking}} {{depends on}} airport operational <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> indicators, which are important issues for business, operational management, regulatory agencies, airlines and passengers. There are several sets of single and complex indicators to evaluate airports <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> {{as well as}} several techniques to benchmark such infrastructures. The general aim of this work is the development of airport <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> predictive models using robust but flexible methodologies and incorporating simultaneously traditional indicators (number of movements and passengers, tons of cargo, number of runways and slots, area of terminals both of passenger and cargo) as well as new (emergent) constraints as ramp incidents and volcano ashes. Specifically this work: firstly shows the <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> evolution of a set of airports under several constraints based on two multidimensional tools, Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA, by the use of Macbeth - Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); and secondly compares the obtained results either with Macbeth or with DEA. Whilst DEA is a linear programming based technique for measuring the relative performance of organizational units in the presence of multiple inputs and outputs, MCDA/Macbeth uses <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> indicators to support benchmark results, being useful to evaluate not only the real importance of the selected indicators but also its correct weight. This work is divided as follows: first, a state of the art review concerning airport operational <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> indicators, and DEA and MCDA tools and techniques; second, the impacts on airports operational <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> of emergent operational factors (ramp incidents) and sudden meteorological/natural phenomenon (volcano ashes); third, a study on the feasibility of the incorporation of such inputs in airport <b>performance</b> and <b>efficiency</b> predictive models; fourth, the presentation of some case studies concerning a set of selected airports; fifth, some insights and challenges about future research still under development. We believe that new models are needed to benchmark airports simultaneously based on scientific techniques robust but flexible to accommodate new (emerging) constraints and useful for those responsible for airport management in different processes of decision making...|$|R
