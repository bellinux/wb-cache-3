40|$|In {{the quest}} of finding {{sustainable}} solution to {{solid waste management}} problems in Ghana, this research formulated as its goal, to mitigate policy constraints to sustainable solid waste management in Ghana. This research goal and objectives were addressed through an empirical study that involved interviews and administration of two sets of questionnaires, one set to members of parliament {{and the other to}} members of the general public. The development of questionnaires was influenced by a conceptual policy development model “The Bridge Model of Policy Development”. Administration of questionnaires to members of the general public was accomplished through random sampling within churches and mosques in three cities in Ghana; Accra, Kumasi, and Takoradi. The percentage response for members of the general public was 38. 9 % and that for members of parliament was 18 %. Prioritization of policy options was achieved through “Differentiated Perception Ranking”, a method devised by this research process. The results revealed the relative importance of constraints to sustainable solid waste management in Ghana, the relative difficulty of mitigating constraints, and the relative difficulty of implementing policy options among others. These results were integrated with the principles of sustainability into producing a policy package for sustainable solid waste management in Ghana. Das Hauptziel dieser Forschungsarbeit ist die Entwicklung von politischen Auflagen für eine nachhaltige Lösung der Abfallmanagementprobleme in Ghana. Grundlagen dieser Arbeit bilden die Befragung von Mitgliedern des <b>Parlaments</b> und der breiten Allgemeinheit. Für die Befragung sind spezielle Fragenbogen nach einem konzeptionellen Entwicklungsmodel mit dem englischen Namen „The Bridge Model of Policy Development“ entwickelt worden. Die Befragung wurde willkürlich in den Kirchen und Moscheen in den Städten Accra, Kumasi und Takoradi durchgeführt. 38, 9 % der Befragten gehören der allgemeinen Öffentlichkeit an und 18 % sind Mitglieder des <b>Parlaments.</b> Eine Priorisierung der politischen Handlung konnte erreicht werden durch eine Aufstellung einer Rangfolge, bei der während dieser Forschung entwickelten Methode zum Einsatz kam. Die Ergebnisse enthüllen die relativen Vor- und Nachteile von Auflagen bei einem nachhaltigen Abfallmanagement in Ghana und unter anderen die Schwierigkeiten bei der Umsetzung von politischen Optionen.

Using simple game theory, the paper analyzes the working properties of the different implementation procedures that are known as 'comitology'. The Council of the European Union employs these procedures when it delegates some of its policymaking power to the Commission as part of Union legislation. We show how the balance of power is determined by the current comitology procedures, and how this balance would change if {{the role of the}} European Parliament were strengthened in the comitology game.

In {{the long run it}} is obvious that a high dependency on import of resources with the increasing demand of the population {{will not be able to}} provide Europe with so much needed easy accessible and reasonably priced energy. The integration process in Europe lasts more than fifty years now but energy policy is even after the ratification of the Lisbon treaty in controll of the national <b>parlaments</b> of member countries. Even though the options and posibilitie of the countries differ in the long run a closer cooperation is mandatory. The thesis is about the united energy policy in Europe and the development it went through since the beginning of the integration process in the fifties of last century.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a case study}} of the scope of subsidiarity review exercised by the Swedish Riksdag within the Early Warning Mechanism (EWM). It takes its starting point in the theoretical debate on the scope of subsidiarity review reaching the conclusion that the Swedish case confirms both Kiiver’s definition of the scope of the review to include legality and proportionality, and Jancic’s more recent article arguing for a broader review to include substance besides the principle of legality and proportionality. The connection between issues concerning the scope of the review within the EWM and several of the arguments in favour of a reform of the EWM is that national parliaments are not apt to make legal assessments such as a strictly legal approach to the review would suggest. In light of this, the Swedish case is interesting taking into account that the Committee on the Constitution has the task to provide a yearly analysis of the review exercised by sectoral committees, including questions related to method and the outcome of the review on the EU-legislative process. The {{article provides}} a critical assessment {{of the role of the}} Committee on the Constitution within the Swedish scrutiny procedure, reaching the conclusion that the Committee’s evaluation suffers several methodological weaknesses; weaknesses that do effect the impact and efficiency of the Swedish scrutiny process. The Swedish model for scrutiny of subsidiarity within the EWM combines a fully decentralised review by sectoral committees with the yearly ‘helicopter perspective’ offered by the Committee on the Constitution. The primary task of the Committee on the Constitution is to act as protector of decentralisation by identifying creeping competence overstretches. Taken together this could be a strong model of scrutiny within the EWM should the Committee on the Constitution, or whatever body is entrusted with the overall analysis, take is task to provide methodological guidance seriously.

40|$|Sweden {{currently}} has no legislated regulation of lobbying, but the professional lobbyist can voluntarily subscribe to, among others, the professional code of standars {{created by the}} trade association of Public Relations, Precis. There is an ongoing discussion in Sweden to regulate lobbying, both in mass media and in politics. This study examines this debate and focus on which arguments there are for and against lobbying regulation in Sweden. It also attempts to identify the differences, if there are any, between left and rights parties with regards to their views on regulation of lobbying. Tha main method used was document analysis of parliamentary bills which have been raised concerning a lobbying regulation in Sweden. In the theory section, I include four different types of requirements placed on democratic lobbying (se for example Jaatinen 1998, Kitchen 1999, Larsson 2005, Möller 2009 and Naurin 2001). The research showed the need for transparency {{to be the most}} prominent, followed by requirement of equal acces to diffrent social groups to lobby. The document analysis focus on the arguments that are given to regulate lobbying in Sweden. The arguments for regulating lobbying presented of the parliamentary bills include measures taken to prevent covert lobbying, to create more equal opportunities to lobby, to that the kind of self-regulation practiced by the proffesional lobbyists by Precis proffesional standars has shortcomings, to that the PR industry will expand and that lobbying is at least commom in Sweden as in other <b>parlaments.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need to}} review how other countries have regulated lobbying. The study shows that among the parliamentary bills, The European Parliament regulatory system is the largest role model of other parliaments regulating lobbying. Furtheremore it shows that a registration system is the type of regulation advocated by the most of the politicians behind the researched parliamentary bills. The counter-arguments to a lobbyng regulation in Sweden, identified trough the document analysis and interviews in this study, are that ethics and morality of the individual are more important than rules and laws and a skepticism that a registration system can record people's lifes, which from a democratic point of view is not desirable. Other counter-arguments are that the community allready has so many rules and laws and that a regulatory system can discriminate less economically affluent groups in society. The study has shown that one can devise some differences between left- and right-wing views concerning policies for regulating lobbying in Sweden. This because no parliamentary bills has brought on a lobbying regulation by any of the so- called red parties and the majority of the bills are raised by politicians from the right-wing Moderate Party. One can also see diffrences in the arguments of regulating lobbying by politicians. The bourgeous side seems tho think that the most important requirement of lobbying from a democratic perspective is transparency while the Swedish Green Party is focusing on the lack of equal access between different social groups to lobby...|$|R
