5|$|Boydell's Shakespeare project {{contained}} three parts: {{an illustrated}} edition of Shakespeare's plays; a folio of <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> the gallery (originally {{intended to be}} a folio of <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints would hang.|$|E

5|$|Photographs of the 19th century often now {{show the}} {{limitations}} of the technology used, yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced albumen silver <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> wet collodion glass-plate negatives.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{published}} {{collections of}} Raverat's work. The first, by Reynolds Stone, presents {{many of her}} engravings <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> Raverat's original blocks; the second, by Joanna Selborne and Lindsay Newman, presents some 75 engravings <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> the blocks, and has long listings of Raverat's work. (The second editions of these books are not <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> the original blocks.) The catalogue of the 1989 exhibition at Lancaster University includes a useful bibliography.|$|R
50|$|The {{residents}} of the island (the nontourists) classify themselves in two ways: born on the island (BOI) and islander by choice (IBC). “BOI” is cited in <b>print</b> <b>from</b> at least 1956 and “IBC” is cited in <b>print</b> <b>from</b> 1975.|$|R
50|$|Banknotes were {{originally}} hand-written; {{although they were}} partially <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> 1855. Since 1970, the Bank of England's notes have featured portraits of British historical figures.|$|R
5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Ansel Adams {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his {{photographs}} of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

5|$|Theropods, {{including}} spinosaurids, {{could not}} pronate their hands (rotate the forearm so the palm faced the ground), but a resting {{position on the}} side of the hand was possible, as shown by fossil <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> an Early Jurassic theropod. A 2014 paper describing new material of Spinosaurus, proposed that its legs were too short for it to move effectively on land. The reconstruction used in the study was an extrapolation based on different sized individuals, scaled to what was assumed to be the correct proportions. Palaeontologist John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College of the University of London has expressed scepticism to the new reconstruction, and cautioned that using different specimens can result in inaccurate chimaeras. Scott Hartman also expressed criticism because he believed the legs and the pelvis were inaccurately scaled (27% too short) and didn't match the published lengths. However, responses from Ibrahim et al. to Mark Witton have been positively received as reliable. The 2015 re-description of Sigilmassasaurus Evers et al. 2015 doubted whether the material assigned to Spinosaurus by Ibrahim et. al. belonged to it.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, Talbot {{helped set}} up an {{establishment}} in Baker Street, Reading, for mass-producing salted paper <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> his calotype negatives. The Reading Establishment, as it was known, also offered services to the public, making <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> others' negatives, copying artwork and documents, and taking portraits at its studio. The enterprise was not a success.|$|E

25|$|Other notable {{versions}} are by Tosa Mitsuoki, who lived from 1617 to 1691. His paintings are closely based on Heian style {{from the existing}} scrolls from the 12th century and are fully complete. The tale was also a popular theme in Ukiyo-e <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> the Edo period.|$|E

25|$|The ACMAA’s nineteenth-century print {{collection}} {{also includes}} {{a copy of the}} landmark Hudson River Portfolio (1821-25) {{based on the work of}} painter William Guy Wall (1792–after 1864) and engraver John Hill (1770–1850); original copper plate etchings of Native Americans as depicted in field studies by Karl Bodmer (1809–1893); a complete set of planographic <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> George Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio (1844); and ornithological <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> John James Audubon’s landmark book The Birds of America (published 1827-38).Examples of work in the collection by other noted expeditionary artists include rare nineteenth-century field studies by Edward Everett (1818–1903), Richard H. Kern (1821–1853), John H. B. Latrobe (1803–1891), Alfred Jacob Miller (1810–1874), and Peter Rindisbacher (1806–1834); nineteenth-century views of the American West by John Mix Stanley (1814–1872) and Henry Warre (1819–1898); and early views of San Francisco by Thomas A. Ayres (1816–1858). See Expeditionary art and depictions of Native American life (above) for more information on American expeditionary art and artists.|$|E
25|$|His {{popularity}} and prolific output may in part {{have been his}} undoing, though. From 1803 through 1817, his work became more static, even as it became more popular. He continued to produce large quantities of prints, but the quality as a rule did not match that of his earlier days. Occasional <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> this period, however, show his old brilliance.|$|E

25|$|The ACMAA owns a {{complete}} set of <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> Richard Avedon’s In the American West series, a project commissioned by the ACMAA in 1979. In recent years the museum has largely focused on acquiring and displaying photographs by contemporary artists including Dawoud Bey (b. 1953), Sharon Core (b. 1965), Katy Grannan (b. 1969), Todd Hido (b. 1968), Alex Prager (b. 1979), Mark Ruwedel (b. 1954), and Larry Sultan (1946–2009).|$|E
25|$|The first {{permanent}} photoetching was {{an image}} produced in 1822 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, {{but it was}} destroyed in a later attempt to make <b>prints</b> <b>from</b> it. Niépce was successful again in 1825. In 1826 or 1827, he made the View from the Window at Le Gras, the earliest surviving photograph from nature (i.e., {{of the image of}} a real-world scene, as formed in a camera obscura by a lens).|$|E
25|$|Some of Leavitt Hunt's {{personal}} {{prints were}} donated {{by his family}} after his death to the Library of Congress, where {{they are part of}} the permanent photographic collection.
