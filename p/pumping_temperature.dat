It says about a difference between these systems in the binding energy between the evacuated molecules and the carbon atom. The spin subsystem 2 is characterized by the smallest binding energy, which we attribute to the edge carbon atoms at the carbon flakes. In fact, the smallest binding energy exists between carbon atoms located at the nearest flake-neighbors and it is being broken under pumping out. Spin subsystem 3 is characterized by the largest spin concentration (by 2  ÷  3 order as large as spin concentrations for subsystems 1 and 2), which results in the largest linewidth and the line shape typical for 2 D spin subsystems. This suggests that spin subsystem 3 belongs to dangling carbon bonds at the surface of carbon flakes. This subsystem is observed mainly at the <b>pumping</b> <b>temperature</b> T ≥  100  °C and its contribution is larger if the <b>pumping</b> <b>temperature</b> increases up to T =  300  °C. It means that the binding energy for these carbon atoms with gas molecules is larger than for the edge atoms.|$|E

Dabei wird der Druckaufbau im Schmiersystem des Motors als Kriterium herangezogen. Als Laborverfahren fuer die Ermittlung der Grenzpumptemperatur wurden die nach ASTM D 4684 - 87 (Mini-Rotary-Viskosimeter) und nach CEC L- 32 -A- 82 (Brookfield-Viskosimeter) standardisierten Verfahren eingesetzt. Durch Messung des Fliess- und Schmierverhaltens sollte untersucht werden, ob eine bessere Korrelation zum Laborverfahren zu erreichen ist, wenn der Volumenstrom anstelle des Drucks als Kriterium herangezogen wird. Aus den Ergebnissen der Volumenstrommessungen wurden unter Verwendung der Hagen-Poiseuille'schen Gleichung naeherungsweise Viskositaeten ermittelt, die aber sehr stark vom jeweiligen Abkuehlungsverlauf abhaengen. Fuer die verwendeten Motoren konnten die fuer eine sichere Oelversorgung minimal erforderlichen Oelstroeme abgeleitet werden. (orig.)

30|$|In past decades, a {{progressive}} decrease in conventional oil reserves {{has led to}} a dramatic increase in production of heavy crude oil. However, transportation of such highly viscous crude oil through pipelines is a major challenge for petroleum industries especially in offshore conditions. Heavy crude oils have viscosities of more than 1000  mPa s at room temperature. However, viscosity of crude oil should be less than 200  mPa s at 15  °C for its transportation through pipelines (Kessick and Denis 1982). The flowability of crude oil at the <b>pumping</b> <b>temperature</b> is an important factor that affects pipeline transportation. Heavy crudes usually have higher pour points due to high content of high molecular weight components, such as waxes, asphaltenes and resins. In conditions where the atmospheric temperature is below the pour point, crude oil gels completely and causes severe transportation problems. Especially in the cold offshore environment, waxes and asphaltenes deposit over inner surfaces of pipelines and eventually clog the pipelines, which further increases the pumping cost.|$|E

Secondary flow <b>pumping,</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure data were recorded for two gas eductor system models. The first, previously tested under hot flow conditions, consists of a primary plate with four tilted-angled nozzles and a slotted, shrouded mixing stack with two diffuser rings (overall L/D = 1. 5).

A portable pyrometer with a surface probe was used for the second model in order to identify any hot spots at the external surface of the mixing stack, shroud and diffuser rings.

However, the deeper part of these aquifers [30 - 150 m] may constitute an alternative for water exploitation and present unpolluted water due to long residence times. We investigated a site exploited for drinking water at a depth of 100 m. A clear reactivity has developed close to the pumping well, pumping inducing autotrophic denitrification reactions with pyrite.

This technique allows for the in situ characterization of the silicon substrate surface in real-time during the growth of thin silicon films. CVD reactions can be monitored at reduced pressure, and substrate temperatures up to 800 ∘C. The application of this technique can help improve the understanding of the heterogenous reactions involved in silicon CVD from silane as well as provide a means of improving feedback control during film growth through probing and manipulation of surface species concentration. ^ The development of the EFTIR technique involved the design, construction, and optimization of a CVD-IR reactor system. This overall system includes the vacuum <b>pumping,</b> <b>temperature</b> control, and mass flow systems as well as the reactor and optics. The system was optimized sufficiently so that the techique could be applied to identify surface species in situ during silicon CVD from silane at substrate temperatures about 800 ∘C and pressures on the order of 1 Torr. ^ Emission FTIR spectra collected in situ and real-time show features remaining constant during steady-state film growth, consistent with the expected behavior of surface species. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the samples show epitaxial silicon thin film growth with minute amounts of polycrystalline silicon possibly near the substrate edges. Profilometry is used to determine the thickness of the grown films and is consistent with estimates of film thickness obtained from the XTEM images, yielding growth rates of 153 ± 7 A/min. ^ Deconvolution of the emission FTIR spectra shows a features near 2050 cm- 1 ± 8 cm- 1 which is assigned to the assymmetric stretch of coupled silicon monohydride (SiH). A tentative assignment of features near 2095 cm- 1 ± 15 cm- 1 to the uncoupled SiH and the symmetric stretch of coupled SiH is also made. ^ Desorption experiments seem to indicate that SiH is not readily removed from the surface at 650 ∘C under 230 mTorr of flowing nitrogen, but easily removed at 750 ∘C. These observations suggest that SiH may not desorb through first order kinetics under inert environments and may be reactively desorbed by silane during CVD. ...|$|E

The main problems the project were facing was how the test system should be designed and how the simulation of the heat <b>pump's</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors would be to mimic a heat pump. Another question mark was which communication interface was best suited for the test system. The method for constructing the test system was based {{on the use of the}} simulation technology Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL).
