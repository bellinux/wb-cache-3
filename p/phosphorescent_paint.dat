5000|$|The model {{aircraft}} was {{coated with a}} <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> which was transparent and invisible under naturalistic lighting. Using a motion controlled camera loaded with color film, the miniature was first photographed under illumination made to resemble bright sunlight against a jet-black background. Then, the camera loaded with high-contrast B&W film, the model was rephotographed with exactly the same motions, again with a black background, but illuminated by bright ultraviolet light (a blacklight). This caused the <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> to glow evenly, and the model registered as a featureless white silhouette. This was the background matte element. A negative print provided the foreground matte.|$|E
50|$|Menken's {{painting}} style utilized unconventional mediums, particularly reflective {{materials such}} as glass, <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> and sequins. She attributed this to her desire to capture movement in her paintings, something that would eventually influence her move to film {{as well as her}} films' emphasis on the theme of light.|$|E
2500|$|Decorative (or [...] "figural") lamps {{in which}} the cathode is shaped as a flower, animal, etc.. The figures inside these lamps were {{typically}} <b>painted</b> with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paints</b> to achieve a variety of colors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} phosphorescent or ‘glow in the dark’ {{paint and}} its problems, charac- teristics and treatment possibilities, while using an artwork without title (1968, RMT, En- schede) by IMI Giese as case study. To understand {{the problems that}} can occur with this little examined material, {{it is crucial to}} know how phosphorescence works and what the composition and properties of different phosphorescent pigments are. The conservation challenges for this specific artwork are mostly due to the properties and composition of the paint: the lacunas for instance are a direct effect of the stickiness of the paint layer. The challenging search began for a <b>phosphorescent</b> retouching <b>paint</b> with an identical daylight colour and an afterglow with a similar colour, intensity, and duration as the original Wiedolux paint. Since all readily available <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paints</b> and pigments did not match the properties of the original paint layer, it was necessary to manipulate self- made <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paints.</b> The ways of manipulation have been tested through visual and technical analysis. This study provides insight into the results of the test sequences and offers useful information about the way conservators can adjust the properties of a phos- phorescent retouching material to suit their needs...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} pressure {{data acquisition}} system for testing of pressure sensitive <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paints</b> was designed, assembled, and tested. The purpose of the calibration system is the evaluation and selection of pressure sensitive paint chemistries {{that could be used}} to obtain global aerodynamic pressure distribution measurements. The test apparatus and setup used for pressure sensitive paint characterizations is described. The pressure calibrations, thermal sensitivity effects, and photodegradation properties are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} {{was purchased by}} the Tate Gallery in 1999. [...] It was included in a mid-career retrospective of Ofili's work at Tate Britain in 2010, and selected by the Tate as its initial painting to have a high-resolution gigapixel image included in the Google Art Project, together with an image taken in the dark to highlight the <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cirith Ungol {{was based}} on Tolkien's design, but Richard Taylor felt it was [...] "boring", and {{redesigned}} it with more tipping angles. The interior set, like Minas Tirith, was built as a few multiple levels that numerous camera takes would suggest composed a larger structure. The miniature was sprayed with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> and lit from below with black lights to create its unearthly glow.|$|E
5000|$|This type {{of paint}} {{has been used}} to mark escape paths in {{aircraft}} and for decorative use such as [...] "stars" [...] applied to walls and ceilings. It is an alternative to radioluminescent paint. Kenner's Lightning Bug Glo-Juice was a popular non-toxic paint product in 1968, marketed at children, alongside other glow-in-the-dark toys and novelties. <b>Phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> is typically used as body paint, on childrens' walls and outdoors.|$|E
50|$|While {{studying}} with Leonard Baskin, Hannock began {{experimenting with}} <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paints,</b> creating large scale, imaginary landscapes that glow when placed under black lights. These luminous canvases were {{an attempt to}} simulate glowing movie screens and {{became the basis for}} the artist's first museum shows at the Smith College Museum of Art (where he was the youngest artist ever to be given a one-man show) and the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{experimental}} setup {{to model the}} pheromone trail based foraging behaviour of ants using a special <b>phosphorescent</b> glowing <b>paint.</b> We have built two custom addons for the e-puck robot that allow for trail laying and following on the glowing floor, {{as well as a}} way for the robots to mimic the ants capability of using polarization patterns as a means of navigation. Using simulations we show that our approach allows for efficient pathfinding between nest and potential food sources. Experimental results show that our trail and sun compass add-on boards are accurate enough to allow a single robot to lay and follow a trail repeatedly...|$|R
500|$|Leterrier cited Andy Serkis' {{motion capture}} portrayals of Gollum and King Kong in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong, respectively, as the {{standard}} he was aiming for. Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's [...] "thunder claps"). <b>Phosphorescent</b> face <b>paint</b> applied to the actors' faces and strobe lighting would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer. Others including Cyril Raffaelli provided motion capture for stunts and fights, after the main actors had done video referencing. Leterrier hired Rhythm and Hues to provide the CGI, rather than Industrial Light & Magic who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk. Visual effect company, Image Engine, spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle. Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall key frame animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary [...] "finesse [...] superhero quality". Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.|$|R
50|$|Other Chinese discoveries and inventions {{from the}} Medieval period, include: block printing, movable type printing, <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> endless power chain drive and the clock {{escapement}} mechanism. The solid-fuel rocket {{was invented in}} China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of gunpowder (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the Ming Dynasty also sent large fleets for maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> is {{commonly}} called [...] "glow-in-the-dark" [...] paint. It {{is made from}} phosphors such as silver-activated zinc sulfide or doped strontium aluminate, and typically glows a pale green to greenish-blue color. The mechanism for producing light {{is similar to that}} of fluorescent paint, but the emission of visible light persists long after it has been exposed to light. Phosphorescent paints have a sustained glow which lasts for up to 12 hours after exposure to light, fading over time.|$|E
50|$|According to the Scottish {{researcher}} Joseph Needham, the Chinese {{made many}} first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early seismological detectors, matches, paper, the double-action piston pump, cast iron, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed drill, the suspension bridge, natural gas as fuel, the magnetic compass, the raised-relief map, the propeller, the crossbow, the south-pointing chariot, and gunpowder. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: block printing and movable type, <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> and the spinning wheel.|$|E
50|$|Science {{historian}} Sherrie Lynne Lyons {{wrote that}} the glowing or light-emitting hands in séances could easily {{be explained by the}} rubbing of oil of phosphorus on the hands. In 1909 an article was published in The New York Times titled Paladino Used Phoshorus. Carrington confessed to having painted Palladino's arm with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> however he claimed to have used the paint to track the movement of her arm, to detect fraud. There was publicity over the incident and Carrington claimed his comments had been misquoted by newspapers.|$|E
5000|$|Catcher's mitts {{are called}} [...] "mitts" [...] {{because they lack}} {{individual}} fingers, like mittens. They have extra padding and a hinged, claw-like shape that helps them funnel fastballs into the pocket and provide a good target for pitchers. Some catchers use mitts with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> around the ridges to provide a clearer target for the pitcher. In addition, catcher's mitts come in single hinge and dual hinge varieties. If required to catch a knuckleball, a catcher will typically use an even larger mitt. Some knuckleball catchers have even experimented with using first baseman's mitts, as described below.|$|E
5000|$|Protect Me From What I Want, the 15th work {{commissioned}} for the BMW Art Car Project. Painted on a BMW V12 LMR, the titular refrain {{is written}} in metal foil and outlined with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint.</b> Phrases written on the car's side-pods are [...] "You are so complex, you don't respond to danger" [...] and [...] "The unattainable is invariably attractive". The car's rear wing reads [...] "Lack of charisma can be fatal" [...] and [...] "Monomania is a prerequisite of success". The car was withdrawn from the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans race, but saw active competition in the 2000 Petit Le Mans in the U.S., finishing fifth overall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} is in mixed media, including acrylic paint, oil paint, and polyester resin. [...] Against a golden background, it depicts {{the portrait of}} a black woman with braided hair weeping. Each tear includes an collaged image of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in 1993 and whose mother, Doreen, was leading a campaign in 1998 for an inquiry into the failed murder investigation; the campaign for the inquiry was successful, with the final report declaring in 1999 that the police department conducting the investigation was [...] "institutionally racist". The {{painting is}} sometimes described as being a portrait of Doreen Lawrence. Barely visible in <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> (but clearer in dark conditions) are the words [...] "R.I.P. Stephen Lawrence 1974-1993".|$|E
5000|$|Also a {{titanium}} {{version of}} this camera was available as the 9Ti. The 9Ti had the same features as its regular counterpart {{with the exception of}} the silver finish and lighter weight of the titanium shell, a [...] "wet type" [...] rubber grip, knobs with relief labels in orange color instead of the standard model's knobs with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> and a brown leather shoulder strap. It also received four additional custom functions for a total of 25.A lighter magnesium vertical grip VC-9M was available as well.The camera came out in 1999 in limited quantities only and with 4-digit serial numbers. It was sold out in 2001 already. A small batch of Dynax 9Ti bodies with 8-digit serial numbers in the [...] range and lacking the accessories surfaced in Germany between 2002 and 2006 (presumably assembled by Minolta's European Service Center in Bremen from 9Ti spare parts), dubbed the Dynax 9Ti II to distinguish it from the original 4-digit limited series of the 9Ti.|$|E
50|$|Manzoni's work changed irrevocably {{after visiting}} Yves Klein's {{exhibition}} 'Epoca Blu' at the Galleria Apollinaire in Milan, January 1957. This exhibition consisted of 11 identical blue monochromes. By {{the end of}} the year he had ceased producing work influenced by the prevailing trends in Art Informel, to works that responded directly to Klein's monochromes. Called Achromes, they invariably looked white but were actually colourless. In these paintings Manzoni experimented with various pigments and materials. Initially favouring canvases coated in gesso (1957-1958), he also worked with kaolin, another form of white clay often used in the production of porcelain. The kaolin works are generally made from clay covered canvases folded horizontally, or sometimes cut-out squares of canvas coated in the clay and adhered onto the canvas; he created just nine large-scale relief paintings depicting folded cloth. As well as Yves Klein, these works showed the influence of Lucio Fontana and Alberto Burri and the American artist Robert Rauschenberg, who had painted neutral white canvases in 1951. Later he would create Achromes from white cotton wool, fiberglass, rabbit skin and bread rolls. He also experimented with <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> and cobalt chloride so that the colours would change over time. In addition to these fabricated materials, the artist's own bodily products and features became art. In addition to his famous Merda d'Artista, in which Manzoni's own excrement became a series of art objects, the use of fingerprints, blood, and breath also figured into his experimental body of work.|$|E
5000|$|While {{many critics}} of {{automobile}} styling rate the 1955 through 1959 Imperials highly, {{the design of}} the 1960-1963 period is more controversial. At that time, Exner was increasingly struggling with the Chrysler president and board. [...] "It was during 1962 Exner was dethroned as president of design in Highland Park. His successor was Elwood Engel, lured away from Ford to lead Chrysler Corporation along a more conventional path. Exner continued as a consultant through 1964, after which he had no further involvement." [...] This source also states, [...] "When he was good, he was very good ( [...] re: styling). When he was bad.... it was the epitome of excessive design. Sales dropped off and the board stepped in." [...] Exner's son went on further, in a 1976 interview, [...] "it was time for a change. Their image needed changing. Dad was a great designer and he was always ahead of his time. He gained more freedom from Chrysler in his designs of the modern Stutz." [...] This same source gives blow-by-blow accounts how Chrysler Corporation was revived through corporate changes in leadership. [...] "But on the product front, the influence of Tex Colbert (ousted President of Chrysler in 1961) and Virgil Exner was still present, and it wouldn't be entirely washed away until 1965".Despite the annual styling changes, all 1960-63 models featured a similar space age dashboard. The steering wheel was squared-off at top and bottom, designed for better leg room and view through the windshield in the straight ahead position. Dashboard lighting was electroluminescent, which used no incandescent lamps: electricity running through a five-layer laminate caused the <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> to glow in the dark. Chrysler called it [...] "Panelescent", and it was shared on some Chrysler models. The effect was eerie and surprisingly modern, with its glowing green face and bright red needles. The 1960-63 models were also united by a distinctive side trim that started above the headlights and that ran at a slight downward angle almost {{to the end of the}} rear fender (except in 1963 when it would actually wrap all the way around the rear of the car) that was undercut by a slight indent in the sides from the front until just before the rear wheel housing.|$|E
50|$|The Victoria & Albert Museum {{commissioned}} Collishaw with {{a monumental}} onsite project, Magic Lantern, which - {{installed in the}} cupola above the entrance - appropriated {{the architecture of the}} V&A creating a beacon of light, complete with an attendant swarm of moths, and was visible across London during the winter months of 2010 - 2011.This is not an exit, 2013 at Blain|Southern Gallery, London, saw Collishaw return to medium of oil painting. However, as is usual with his practice, nothing is literal; the primary source material - magnified images drawn from the pages of glossy magazines - is a simple metaphor, one part of a prism conceived to examine moral questions provoked by the excessive binge culture that preceded the global financial crisis. When seen from a distance, these large-scale works appear to be abstract paintings constructed on a classic modernist grid; closer inspection reveals them to be scraps of advertisements for luxury goods culled from ‘lifestyle’ magazines like Tatler and Vogue. But this is only partially the case; they are in fact facsimiles of the precisely folded, origami-like ‘wraps’ used by drug dealers to package cocaine, complete with powdery traces of the narcotic.In 2014 Collishaw held a solo exhibition at Galleria Borghese, Rome, titled Black Mirror whereby he responded to the works in the Borghese collection. Three paintings by Caravaggio (Madonna and Child with St. Anne - Dei Palafrenieri, David with the Head of Goliath, Saint Jerome Writing) appear and disappear behind the surfaces of large mirrors framed in black Murano glass. The figures are animated to appear as though posing for the painting; breathing, blinking and shifting their weight in front of us. Everyday people caught {{in the process of being}} transformed into religious icons, trapped like spectres in an indeterminate space between the real world and the realm of the painting. The Massacre of the Innocents by Ippolito Scarsella was referenced by a fourth work on the ground floor of the museum. Featuring over 300 characters, the Biblical tale of genocide is re-enacted in All things Fall, as a cornucopia of savagery comes to life in a heaving mass of kaleidoscopic brutality - forever trapped in a frenzied purgatory of interminable violence.Collishaw held a major retrospective at New Art Gallery Walsall, in 2015. The exhibition included photography, film, sculpture and installation and testified to the richness and breadth of Collishaw’s practice, highlighting and exploring some of the overriding themes and preoccupations within his work. Works from 1996 through to 2015 were presented over two floors, including his ambitious installation, Deliverance (2008), repeated projections onto walls coated in <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>paint</b> present ghostly figures that appear suddenly and then slowly fade, only to be replaced by another. Drawing on the news coverage of the 2004 Beslan siege, Collishaw makes reference to the seemingly insatiable appetite of the press for images of disaster and trauma and of the complex and often ambivalent ways in which we as viewers respond to these distressing scenes. The exhibition included works from the photographic series’ Single Nights (2007), Insecticides(2006-ongoing) and Catching Fairies (1996) as well as the sculptural series The Venal Muse (2012-15) in which brightly coloured flowers, presented in vitrines, reveal on close inspection evidence of disease and decay. New Art Gallery Walsall also staged the UK premier of Collishaw’s acclaimed zoetrope, All Things Fall.Concurrent to the exhibition at Walsall, Collishaw presented In Camera, a work commissioned by GRAIN and The Library of Birmingham, inspired by the Library’s internationally renowned photography collection.In 2016, Collishaw created two striking new installations for the follies in the 18th century landscape surrounding Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal - a National Trust World Heritage Site in Yorkshire, UK. A co-commission between the Trust and Blain|Southern, the works drew upon the history of the buildings and are optical illusions that echo ghosts of the past. The Banqueting House became the site for a major new 3D zoetrope titled Seria Ludo. The work is a glowing, strobe lit chandelier, covered with 186 carousing Lilliputian figures. As it spins, the zoetrope animates the tableaux, bringing scenes of drunken revelry to life as characters - including a swinging monkey - eat, drink, fight and dance. In contrast, the Temple of Piety - serenely stationed at the edge of the garden’s Moon Ponds, is the setting for a work that is more tranquil, The Pineal Eye sees two parabolic mirrors face each other. The resulting optical effect creates an ethereal mirage of the Roman depiction of piety, the Grecian daughter feeding her imprisoned father from her breast, which also appears as a relief on the back wall of the Temple. In addition to the pictorial beauty offered by the water gardens, they also function as hydraulic balancing systems for the river Skell that flows through Fountains Abbey. Illustrating this form of release was one of Collishaw's main objectives when creating Seria Ludo and The Pineal Eye, two works which illustrate an explosion of tension, with themes that plumb into the follies' principles of pleasure and piety.|$|E
