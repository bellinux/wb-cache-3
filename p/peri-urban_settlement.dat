40|$|Fuelled by rapid urbanisation, urban spatial {{expansion}} is increasingly encroaching on the rural hinterland of large metropolises around the world, making {{a type of}} spatiality {{referred to as the}} “peri-urban” an important focal point for urban studies. Peri-urban residential settlement development in Chinese cities has been put on a fast track in recent years, however, its current situation has been little documented and its implications for sustainability not well understood. The main contributions of this research to the existing literature is considered to be two-fold: Firstly, this research has filled the research gap by providing a more up-to-date empirical study of <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlement</b> development in the Chinese city of Tianjin with a specific focus on residential settlements and presenting the current and emerging challenges that face sustainable <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlement</b> development; Secondly, this research has also made contributions to research in the context of sustainability by adopting an integrated research methodology that combines case-study-based systemic evaluation with assessment of stakeholder perspectives and decision-making dynamics. In this study, a theme-based evaluation framework is developed and used to assess the sustainability outcome of three recently developed peri-urban residential settlement cases in Tianjin, China, with each representing one typical <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlement</b> type, i. e. rural resettlement project; affordable housing compound; and suburban commercial housing estate. Their specific approaches to achieving sustainable development are discussed, and remaining problems and challenges are identified and analyzed with suggestions for the complementary approaches and progression in the planning and management of peri-urban settlements. The evaluation framework is also used to examine the perceptions of the stakeholders of urban development on peri-urban sustainability. By making a comparison between the delivered sustainability outcome of the settlement cases and the stakeholders’ perceptions on sustainability, it was revealed that lower levels of sustainability performance in the settlement development outcome coincided, to a large extent, with lower levels of conformation on the conceptions of sustainability between the decision-makers of the development and the residents of the communities developed...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} nature and creation of common places in informal <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlements</b> in North India through negotiation and sharing. It aims to develop a profound understanding {{of the effect of}} the post-hoc introduction of amenity buildings and city infrastructure in the creation of common places. The approach takes collaborative architectural making as a catalyst for civic empowerment and social change, discussed primarily through first-hand experience of practical small-scale live interventions in two urban conditions of scarce resources. These interventions serve as case studies, The research hypothesises that the social structure and order of shared spaces is continually transforming, adjusting and being re-made to accommodate the changing urban conditions within low-income settlements. The informal negotiation of these common spaces creates a shared collective identity. This study suggests that collaborative place-making engenders a renewed understanding or interpretation (by the urban migrant/citizen) of the nature of common places, in which the origins or memory of the traditional rural village are transformed into a new situation of the urban village within the host city. Central to the research was the development of spatial practices through small-scale interventions in two <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> which acted as vehicles for understanding the civic and institutional order of town for all constituents (including myself as PhD by Practice).

While the prevalence of postnatal depression is high, there are no prevalence data on antenatal depression in South Africa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and correlates of depressed mood in pregnancy in Cape Town <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlements.</b> Methods This study reports on baseline data collected from the Philani Mentor Mothers Project (PMMP), a community-based, cluster-randomized controlled trial on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. The PMMP aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based intervention for preventing and managing illnesses related to HIV, TB, alcohol use and malnutrition in pregnant mothers and their infants. Participants were 1062 pregnant women from Khayelitsha and Mfuleni, Cape Town. Measures included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Derived AUDIT-C, indices for social support with regards to partner and parents, and questions concerning socio-demographics, intimate partner violence, and the current pregnancy. Data were analysed using bivariate analyses followed by logistic regression. Results Depressed mood in pregnancy was reported by 39 % of mothers. The strongest predictors of depressed mood were lack of partner support, intimate partner violence, having a household income below R 2000 per month, and younger age.

We also explored whether infant socio-emotional development benefitted from book-sharing. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Carers of 14 - 16 month-old infants were randomized to 8 weeks’ training in book-sharing (n = 49) or a wait list control group (n = 42). In addition to the cognitive measures reported previously, independent assessments were made at base line and follow-up of carer-infant interactions during book-sharing and toy play.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of an intervention designed to improve the mother-infant relationship and security of infant attachment in a South African <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlement</b> with marked adverse socioeconomic circumstances. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Khayelitsha, a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlement</b> in South Africa. Participants 449 pregnant women. Interventions The intervention was delivered from late pregnancy and for six months postpartum. Women were visited in their homes by previously untrained lay community workers who provided support and guidance in parenting. The purpose of the intervention was to promote sensitive and responsive parenting and secure infant attachment to the mother. Women {{in the control group}} received no therapeutic input from the research team. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes: quality of mother-infant interactions at six and 12 months postpartum; infant attachment security at 18 months. Secondary outcome: maternal depression at six and 12 months. Results The intervention was associated with significant benefit to the mother-infant relationship. At both six and 12 months, compared with control mothers, mothers in the intervention group were significantly more sensitive (6 months: mean difference= 0. 77 (SD 0. 37), t= 2. 10, P< 0. 05, d= 0. 24; 12 months: mean difference= 0. 42 (0. 18), t=- 2. 04, P< 0. 05, d= 0. 26) and less intrusive (6 months: mean difference= 0. 68 (0. 36), t= 2. 28, P< 0. 05, d= 0. 26; 12 months: mean difference=- 1. 76 (0. 86), t= 2. 28, P< 0. 05, d= 0. 24) in their interactions with their infants. The intervention was also associated with a higher rate of secure infant attachments at 18 months (116 / 156 (74 %) v 102 / 162 (63 %); Wald= 4. 74, odds ratio= 1. 70, P< 0. 05). Although the prevalence of maternal depressive disorder was not significantly reduced, the intervention had a benefit in terms of maternal depressed mood at six months (z= 2. 05, P= 0. 04) on the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale). Conclusions The intervention, delivered by local lay women, had a significant positive impact {{on the quality of the}} mother-infant relationship and on security of infant attachment, factors known to predict favourable child development.

From 2000 onwards, this partnership ran South Africa’s first antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme. Due to the province’s limited experience in 1999 in implementing and monitoring an ART programme, and the National Health Department’s opposition to the public provision of ART, this partnership was instrumental in piloting and later scaling-up the Western Cape’s ART programme.

40|$|Ebola has had significant, {{negative}} {{effects in the}} rapidly expanding, unregulated areas of peri-urban and urban West Africa. The residents of these areas maintain vital connections with rural populations while intermingling with and living {{in close proximity to}} urban and elite populations. These interconnections fuel the spread of Ebola. The degradation of natural resources, temporary housing, inadequate water supplies, hazardous conditions and dense concentrations of people in peri-urban areas exacerbate the potential for zoonotic disease spread. Yet the peri-urban remains largely unacknowledged and under-addressed in development. In considering the intersections between Ebola, <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlements</b> and urbanisation, we must recognise that: basic hygiene and isolation of the sick are frequently impossible; disease control through quarantine often ignores poor people’s patterns of movement and immediate material needs; quarantine can reinforce the political exclusion of peri-urban residents; and there exists the potential for future zoonotic disease emergence in peri-urban contexts. Development must acknowledge these ever-burgeoning settlements and address the ability of the poor to live safely. This includes the provision of decent hygiene and sanitation, context-appropriate forms of disease containment, the recognition of the peri-urban poor as legitimate citizens, and improved understandings of human/animal interactions.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} an environmental health ecological framework between {{the quality of}} infrastructure, utilities and resident’s practices to health problems reported in three Nueces County, Texas colonias. Populated by predominantly low-income, minority families, these <b>peri-urban</b> <b>settlements</b> are characterized by substandard housing, lacking traditional sewage systems, potable drinking water and pluvial drainage. It was hypothesized that those without indoor toilets, pluvial drainage and regular garbage collection {{would be more likely}} to report health problems. The study found that keeping trash for over a week was statistically related to gastrointestinal illness and eye infections. Having indoor toilets in conjunction with substandard septic tanks was statistically related to gastrointestinal illness, respiratory problems and skin infections. The lack of pluvial drainage was statistically significantly, while not related to a particular disease. The argument is made that flooding problems may have contributed to the sanitation problems. Specifically, drainage problems affect the septic tanks and cause backflow to the indoor toilets. Although a small sample, the findings show that people who live in colonias are at risk for disease because structural measures to improve sanitation are not available...|$|R
