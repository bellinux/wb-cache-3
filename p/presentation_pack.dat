50|$|According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) world NCS {{production}} has been practically stagnant {{since the mid}} 1980s, after modest increases in the previous twenty years, stabilizing at about 12 to 14 million metric tons per year. The real amount produced may be greater given the difficulties in tracking small scale on-farm production. However, whilst production of NCS has been declining in Asia, it has been rising, even if only slowly, in Latin America. NCS production in Latin America reached an all-time high in 2011, surpassing the two million metric ton level for the first time. This compares to around 1.6 million tons 20 years earlier. In Colombia, the share of sugarcane allocated to production of NCS is now the highest worldwide, at 40%. In Brazil, output rose from an estimated 280,000 tons in 2005 to 470,000 tons in 2011.NCS is traded mostly locally in un-branded, solid presentations, such as blocks, cones or other shapes. Such a feature limits its consumption given the difficulties involved in dealing with these solid presentations {{in the kitchen and}} in industry. In some countries (for example, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Costa Rica) solid NCS is being progressively replaced by user-friendly, branded, granulated <b>presentations,</b> often <b>packed</b> in plastic or paper bags for use at home and also as an industrial sweetener for the preparation of beverages and many other processed foods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{survey the}} price {{differences}} between originators and generics for a selected basket of molecules and to analyze {{similarities and differences}} {{with regard to the}} countries included and their generic policies. METHODS: Ex-factory prices as of November 2011 of five molecules provided from the Pharma Price Information (PPI) service of the Austrian Health Institute were analyzed for 16 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, UK). The selected molecules were gemcitabine, mycophenolate mofetil, olanzapine, risperidone and sumatriptan. For a specific <b>presentation</b> (same <b>pack</b> size, dosage and pharmaceutical form) of each molecule, the prices of the original product and the “most common generic” as defined by PPI were compared. RESULTS: Considerable variations among the extent of price differences between originator and generic were identified (gemicitabine: lowest price difference of 1. 4 % between originator and generic in Belgium and highest difference of 73. 4 % in Portugal; mycophenolate mofetil: 3. 4 % Norway – 71. 7 % Netherlands; olanzapine: 0. 1 % Spain – 97. 1 % Sweden; risperidone: 0. 9 % Netherlands – 97. 3 % UK; sumatriptan: 5. 8 % Greece – 95. 0 % Denmark). Further, no difference at all between originator and generic prices was found for some molecules in a few countries (Norway: for 4 of the 5 molecules analyzed; Spain: 3; Belgium: 2; in Austria, France and Greece for one molecule respectively). For the five molecules of the sample, Greece, Spain, Ireland and Norway consistently displayed lower price differences whereas Denmark, Finland and Sweden tended to show higher differences between originator and generic prices. CONCLUSION: Even if this research is illustrative and not representative due to the small sample size, results suggest confirming large differences across Europe. It appears that countries (e. g. Denmark, Sweden) with strong generic policies, particularly based on competition and involving elements of enforcement, tend to have higher differences between originator and generic prices. Further research, notably with a broader basket, is recommended. </p...|$|R

However, men prefer red meat, no matter its price. The most prefered meat sorts in order of their importance are chicken meat, pork and beef.
