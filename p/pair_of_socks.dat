5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks</b> and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E

The locals batted first again and declared on 191/6 after 40 overs, Ray Illingworth taking 4/65 off 13 overs. This was easily passed by the MCC, who made 196/3 off 31.6 overs, Geoff Pullar hitting 51, Barrington 47 and captain Colin Cowdrey 43 as they batted on to 243 all out.|$|E

The bridegroom's dress in early times consisted of a short loincloth of hand-woven cloth (Dhoti), a shawl to cover his shoulders, and a red handkerchief on the head (Leis). Later, his dress consisted of a white loincloth with a red and gold hem (todop), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat (Kutanv), a shawl on the shoulders, and a towel (Urmal) on the head. The bridegroom wore a Chakrasar (neck chain) around his neck. He wore a pair of sandals or at least a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks.</b> At present, most Mangalorean Catholic couples opt for a White wedding, where the bridegroom wears a suit, while the bride wears a white wedding gown. The traditional style of wedding is becoming exceedingly rare.|$|E
500|$|As Quartermaster, Foster {{attempted}} to secure supplies from every source. In December 1862, according to University of Georgia professor and historian Kenneth Coleman, Foster [...] "appealed to every {{woman in the}} state of Georgia to send him a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks</b> for the army." [...] Another notable effort was the campaign to secure 50,000 socks from organizations such as the [...] "Young Ladies' Patriotic Society" [...] (pledging one garment a week from each member) as well as from individual girls and women of Georgia. In October 1863, Foster placed announcements in newspapers throughout the state, asking for contributions. He pledged to make available an ample supply of yarn, for those knitters willing to undertake the task, but lacking in material. Foster also asked them to attach their names to their work, so that a complete and detailed record could be maintained of each contribution and contributor. In his request, he expressed hope that the socks would: ...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriological {{follow-up}} {{samples were}} taken from 41 chicken (Gallus gallus) flocks in floor systems, where Salmonella enterica (Salmonella) had been detected either directly in bacteriological samples or indirectly by serological samples. Three types of follow-up samples were compared to each other within each flock: 1) 5 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks,</b> analysed as 5 samples, 2) 2 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks,</b> analysed as one sample, and 3) 60 faecal samples, analysed as one pooled sample. Agreement between sampling methods was evaluated by the following statistical tests: 'Kappa', 'The adjusted rand', McNemar's test for marginal symmetry, Proportion of agreement P 0, P +, P -, and Odds Ratio. The highest agreement {{was found between the}} 2 types <b>of</b> <b>sock</b> sampling, while the lowest agreement was found by comparing 60 faecal samples with 5 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks.</b> Two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks</b> analysed as one pool appeared to be just as effective in detecting S. enterica as the 60 faecal samples. In broiler flocks, 5 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>socks</b> were used both in the routine samples taken at about 3 weeks of age for the establishment of infection of the flock, and as one of the follow-up samples taken shortly before slaughter age, which means that the only notable differences between the 2 sampling rounds were the age of the broilers and of their litter. S. enterica was detected more frequently in samples from broilers about 3 weeks old, than in similar samples taken from broilers a few days prior to slaughter at ca. 33 – 40 days of age. </p...|$|R
