40|$|There are {{different}} <b>schemes</b> based on <b>observers</b> {{to detect and}} isolate faults in dynamic processes. In the case of fault diagnosis in instruments (FDI) there {{are different}} diagnosis schemes {{based on the number}} of observers: the Simplified <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (SOS) only requires one observer, uses all the inputs and only one output, detecting faults in one detector; the Dedicated <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (DOS), which again uses all the inputs and just one output, but this time there is a bank of observers capable of locating multiple faults in sensors, and the Generalized <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (GOS) which involves a reduced bank of observers, where each observer uses all the inputs and m- 1 outputs, and allows the localization of unique faults. This work proposes a new scheme named Simplified Interval Observer SIOS-FDI, which does not requires the measurement of any input and just with just one output allows the detection of unique faults in sensors and because it does not require any input, it simplifies in an important way the diagnosis of faults in processes in which it is difficult to measure all the inputs, as in the case of biologic reactors...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, it has become widely {{recognized}} that the management strategies of world fisheries must ensure sustainability of bycatch {{as well as of}} target species. South Africa implemented a <b>pilot</b> <b>observer</b> programme from 1995 to 2000 to collect data on the levels and patterns of bycatch and discards in the demersal trawl fishery. Here, the results of that programme are used in conjunction with information on bycatch value and compliance to assess the issues and problems regarding bycatch and discarding in the fishery. In general, bycatch components can be placed into one of three categories (discarded bycatch, retained bycatch, and processing waste), each of which present different management problems and require different management approaches. The results were used to formu-late a bycatch management plan for the demersal trawl fishery in South Africa. Given the need to continue monitoring bycatch, the per-formance of the <b>pilot</b> <b>observer</b> programme is reviewed, and the levels of sampling effort required for a national programme are discussed...|$|R

A dedicated nonlinear <b>observer</b> <b>scheme</b> (DNOS) for fault detection and identification in reconstructible systems is proposed. INTRODUCTION State observation of nonlinear dynamical systems is becoming a growing topic of investigation in the specialized literature. The reconstruction of the time behaviour of state variables remains a major problem both in control theory and process diagnosis. Researchers attention is being particularly focused on the design of adaptive observers for on-line process state estimation. There is increasing awareness that to ensure robustness in performance requires simpler and stable adaptive <b>observer</b> <b>schemes.</b> Linear systems have received considerable attention (Luenberger, 1966), (O'Reilly, 1983) leading to several stable adaptive observer systems (Kreisselm [...] ...|$|R
