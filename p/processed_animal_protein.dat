40|$|Re-authorization of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> (PAPs) in EU, {{derived from}} {{by-products}} of human food production, could increase manufacturing of proteins for feed ingredients {{and reduce the}} need of imported proteins mainly of plant origin. The PAPs production is largely done by the rendering process during which authorized animal by-products are heat treated to extract valuable <b>protein</b> and <b>animal</b> fat, ensuring sterilizing conditions of raw incoming materials. Proteins exposure to certain processing conditions induces two important chemical changes, racemization of amino acids and formation of cross-linked amino acid. These changes are associated with appreciable reduction of protein digestibility and nutritional value. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the effect of heat treatment on amino acid racemization in <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> of poultry origin and related nutritional implications by evaluation of their in vitro digestibility. The results reported confirm the detection of racemized amino acids in <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins,</b> especially D-aspartic acid, as realistic indicators of thermal treatments during PAP manufacturing. In our results, the severe (115 °C) and prolonged heat treatment (180 minutes) revealed a D-Asp content of 28. 1 %. Prolongation of temperature treatment (20, 30 and 180 min, at 115 °C) significantly (P< 0. 05) affects in vitro protein digestibility, which decrease from 86. 0 %, in no-treated sample, to 78. 3 % and 79. 1 % after 20 and 30 min, respectively, and to 76. 3 % after 180 min.

40|$|Recently, {{due to the}} {{detection}} of cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, it has become necessary to use animal meals differently. The EU Council Decision of 4 December 2000 forbade use of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> to make feeds for cattle, swine, and poultry. Meat and bone meal (MBM) is rich in macro- and microelements {{as well as in}} organic substance, and hence it can be a viable alternative to mineral fertilizers containing N and P. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of increasing doses of MBM applied every second year as an organic fertilizer on maize (Tea mays L.) grown for grain. A two-factorial field experiment with a randomized block design was carried out in 20102011, in north-eastern Poland. Experimental factor I was MBM dose (2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, and 5. 0 Mg ha- 1 applied every second year), and experimental factor II was the year of the study (two consecutive years). Increasing MBM doses applied every second year increased maize grain yield and improved grain plumpness, in comparison with mineral fertilization. The highest yield-forming effect was observed when MBM was applied at 3 Mg ha- 1. Macronutrient uptake by maize plants and macronutrient concentrations in maize grain were affected by the year of the study rather than MBM dose. The results of a 2 -yr experiment indicate that MBM is a valuable source of N and P for maize grown for grain, and that it is equally or more effective when compared with mineral fertilizers...|$|E
40|$|Directive 2003 / 126 /EC {{defines the}} method for the {{determination}} of constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and poultry bones {{on the basis of}} some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (<b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>protein).</b> For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check of animal feedingstuffs, the presence of bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments...|$|E

The application of such methods by control laboratories implies that the method has been validated including an assessment of its robustness. Successful transferability between laboratories is considered an important robustness criterion of the method. However, corresponding guidelines regarding the design of such a study relevant to this field are missing. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept that was applied to check for the transferability of a qualitative assay for the detection of banned MBM in feedingstuffs at trace level based on real time PCR. This approach can be of interest for other research groups working in the development of real-time PCR methods and in their use by control laboratories. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{ingredients}} and <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> are alternative feedstuffs for fish feeds in aquaculture. However, their use can introduce contaminants like pesticides {{that are not}} previously associated with marine Atlantic salmon and gilthead sea bream farming. This study covers the screening of around 800 pesticides by gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry in matrices throughout the entire marine food production chain. Prior to analysis of real-world samples, the screening methodology was validated for 252 pesticides to establish the screening detection limit. This was 0. 01 mg kg− 1 for 113 pesticides (45 %), 0. 05 mg kg− 1 for 73 pesticides (29 %) and > 0. 05 mg kg− 1 for 66 pesticides (26 %). After that, a quantitative methodology based on GC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (GC-APCI-MS/MS) was optimized for the pesticides found in the screening. Although several polar pesticides, of which pirimiphos methyl and chlorpyriphos-methyl were most dominant, were found in plant material and feeds based on these ingredients, {{none of them were}} observed in fillets of Atlantic salmon and gilthead sea bream fed on these feeds.

40|$|Due to {{a growing}} {{aquaculture}} industry, demand for high-quality proteins for aquatic feeds is increasing. Non-ruminant <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> (PAPs) have shown great potential for this purpose. Safe reintroduction of non-ruminant PAPs in aqua feed requires methods that can discriminate ruminant and non-ruminant PAPs at contamination levels at or below 2 %. Because the official European Union method lacks species specificity, the performance of MELISA-TEK™ Ruminant, a commercial immunoassay, combined with the MELISA-TEK High Sensitivity Sample Extraction kit was evaluated. Various non-ruminant PAPs spiked with ruminant PAPs (processed at 133, 137, 141, and 145 °C) were analyzed. Results showed an overall specificity of 99 %, indicating no cross-reaction with non-ruminant PAPs. The sensitivity of the assay strongly depended on both processing temperature and proportion of muscle fibers of the ruminant PAPs. Overall sensitivity of samples with 1 and 2 % ruminant PAPs was 92 and 100 %, respectively. For ruminant PAPs processed at 133 and 137 °C, the sensitivity was 100 % for both 1 and 2 % ruminant spikes. Overall accuracies were 96 and 99 % for 1 and 2 % ruminant spikes, respectively. In conclusion, the MELISA-TEK Ruminant assay showed satisfactory results, {{which makes it a}} suitable candidate method to enable safe reintroduction of non-ruminant PAPs in aqua feed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} possible markers to distinguish differences between land animals by using the microscopic method in association with computer image analysis. For this purpose bone fragments from poultry and mammals were obtained and analysed by microscopic method. Through a digital camera and an image analysis software 85 bone lacunae images have been processed and elaborated in order to obtain for each lacuna a monochrome mask on which several measurements were performed. Data were analysed by ANOVA and LDA. Results obtained in the present study indicated that of 32 descriptors processed by image analysis software, only 12 were significantly (P< 0. 001) different between mammalian and poultry. However, when morphometric measurements were analysed by LDA, 86 % of lacunae were correctly classified into the animal class of origin (i. e. mammalian as mammalian and poultry as poultry). By contrast 14 % of lacunae were incorrectly classified. In conclusion, data here presented indicate that some of descriptors used by image analysis appears promising not only for a reliable distinction between the different origins of animal meal at the level of vertebrate classes, but also for further characterisation and identification of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> in <b>animal</b> feeds...|$|R
40|$|The ban of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> (PAPs) in feed for farmed animals {{led to a}} {{significant}} reduction {{of the number of}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases. Presently, optical microscopy remains the only reference method for the detection of PAPs to be applied for official control as required by Commission Directive 2003 / 126 /EC. The legislation also foresees that other methods may be applied in addition to classical microscopy, if – for instance – they provide more information about the origin of the animal constituents. Therefore, alternative and complementary techniques were developed as such or in combination. The most promising ones seem to be PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), near infrared microscopy and imaging, as well as immunology. Within the framework of a PAP ban regardless of its species origin (total feed ban), most of the studies were mainly focused on the ability of the techniques to detect the presence of PAPs at 0. 1 % (mass percentage of constituents of animal origin in feed) as indicated as limit of detection in the official method protocol. A possible modification of the legislation requires that the techniques are also able to determine their species origin and to quantify them. The present paper gives a state of the art of the different methods...|$|R
