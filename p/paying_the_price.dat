25|$|Italy {{produced}} 12,000 aircraft {{during the}} course of the war–this despite an economy that was based on agriculture rather than technology. However, much of this production capacity was wasted on the failed development of the SIA 7. Italian army fighter pilots mostly found themselves flying either French Spad VIIs, Spad XIIIs, or Nieuports, or Macchi's knockoffs of Nieuports. The failure of the multi-purpose SIA 7 also left some Italian pilots flying obsolescent Farman and Voisin reconnaissance craft well into 1918, and <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> in blood. Italian naval aviators, however, were supplied with seaplane fighters by Macchi, such as the M.5 or the M.7, that were the equals of landbound fighters.|$|E

25|$|After {{delivering}} the verdict in his trial, {{all of the}} jurors swore that to their knowledge Arthur Hodge held no property in the British Virgin Islands. This was patently not true, but allowed the court to avoid condemning his property, and allowed his estate to pass to his 6 year old son, Henry Cecil Hodge (Arthur Hodge had adopted a new will leaving his estate to his son during the disputes with Musgrave and Martin which led to his execution, {{although there is no}} suggestion that he feared for his life at this time). Years later the Hodge estate burned down, and son Henry Cecil Hodge remarked that he would be <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for his father's sins forever.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{corruption}} {{were made on}} the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm's ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for its own purchase with its assets. Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove Aerolíneas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001. In , the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors, and went into administration; the salaries were paid by the Argentine Government, instead of using money coming from the SEPI. The payment of salaries for the upcoming months was suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat. On 6 June, flights to Auckland, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro were halted. Owing to a million debt with the fuel supplier, the suspension of the daily flight to Madrid, which also served Rome and was the last connection with Europe, followed a week later. After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.|$|E

500|$|Looking to {{forestall}} the impending legal imbroglio in early 1954, Hughes {{offered to buy}} out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio was sinking, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm, Buena Vista Pictures. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95% ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price.</b> With negotiations between the two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. For Hughes, this was the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement in the movie business. Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a [...] "systematic seven-year rape." ...|$|E

On June 16, 2015 District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sentenced him to a 17-month prison sentence {{to be followed by}} three years of probation. Collyer also ordered Gonzalez to stay out of Washington, D.C., give the secret Service access to his medical records, and give up his firearms and weapons. She addressed Gonzalez directly, saying [...] "No more guns, no more machetes, no more knives, no more tomahawks. Got it?" [...] Gonzalez said [...] "I would like to apologize. I am sorry for my actions. I never meant to harm anyone. I want to commit to maintain my treatment that started at the prison." [...] Prosecutor Vincent Cohen, who had recommended 18 months in prison, stated [...] "Mr. Gonzalez is now <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for his foolish decision to jump the fence and run inside the White House. The prison sentence imposed by the court should deter others from taking actions that needlessly put the First Family and White House employees at risk." ...|$|E
