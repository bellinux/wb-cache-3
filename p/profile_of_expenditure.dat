40|$|International audienceIndia's {{energy sector}} is today in transition. The {{principles}} of public management (which has prevailed up to now) are being revised, {{as the present}} situation cannot be sustained in the future, neither in terms of financing nor in terms of physical performance of the sector. The aim is to rapidly improve the efficiency and volume of operations on the Indian energy scene. This reform is designed to benefit the economy in a large way. However, it also has costs, for example that of the initial gestation period necessary {{for the private sector}} to take over the supply side. This paper explores detailed energy policy options so as to decrease or even minimize these costs. To do so, it compares a reference case with an alternative policy in which the pace and modes of the reform vary. It assesses the cost differences of the two options, using a range of five cost items highlighting the differential. The comparison of the total amounts of these items {{as well as of the}} <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> suggests that today's reform scenario may not be the optimal one.

Objective. In {{order to determine the}} actual value of anaestesiological services, we started with the analysis of activity based costing (ABC) analysis. Methods. Retrospectively, in 2005 and 2006, we estimated the direct costs of anestesiological services (salaries, drugs, supplying materials and other: analyses and equipment.) of the Institute of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. The group included all anesthetized patients of both sexes and all ages. We compared direct costs with direct expenditure, “each cost object (service or unit) ” of the Republican Health-care Insurance. The Summary data of the Departments of Anaesthesia documented in the database of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. Numerical data were utilized and the numerical data were estimated and analyzed by computer programs Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and SPSS for Windows. We compared using the linear model of direct costs and unit costs of anaesthesiological services from the Costs List of the Republican Health-care Insurance. Results. Direct costs showed 40 % of costs were spent on salaries, (32 % on drugs and supplies, and 28 % on other costs, such as analyses and equipment. The correlation of the direct costs of anaestesiological services showed a linear correlation with the unit costs of the Republican Healthcare Insurance. Conclusion. During surgery, costs of anaesthesia would increase by 10 % the surgical treatment cost of patients. Regarding the actual costs of drugs and supplies, we do not see any possibility of costs reduction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit two {{well-known}} facts regarding lifecycle expenditures.

All other nondurable categories we study show no decline in mean expenditure over the life cycle nor do they show an increase in cross sectional dispersion over the life cycle. We provide evidence that the categories driving life cycle consumption are either inputs into market work (clothing and transportation) or are amenable to home production (food).

However, there are few sources of nationally representative {{information that can be}} used to develop life tables that incorporate cause-specific mortality.

Insofar as national data sources can be found to compare to the estimates of these models, the results are comparable. For example, the survival figures are comparable to the life table figures supplied as part of the series of vital statistics of the United States.

40|$|Usual {{projections}} <b>of</b> {{health care}} <b>expenditure</b> combine age-sex <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> health <b>expenditure</b> and scenarios <b>of</b> population projection. However, {{it has been}} shown repeatedly that both age-sex specific health expenditures and the population structures in the future are highly uncertain and most projections turned out wrong. Therefore, the projections based on the traditional approach are often unhelpful in evaluating future health care expenditures. In this project we try to improve upon the existing literature by incorporating uncertainties in population projection and future age-sex specific health expenditure. Combining the stochastic population projection with age-specific health expenditure we obtain probabilistic distributions <b>of</b> health <b>expenditure.</b> The median projection shows that public health expenditure will increase by about 40 % during the next 47 years, that is, an average annual increase of 0. 74 %. There is a 10 % chance that the expenditure will increase by more than 66 % during the projection period, which corresponds to an annual increase of 1. 1 %. At the optimistic side the total public health expenditure will grow only by 17 % (0. 35 % annual) with a 10 % probability. The main part of the increase in total expenditure is driven by the increase in average per-capita expenditure due to ageing. The average per-capita expenditure increases by 33 %, from 980 in 2004 to 1307 euros in 2050. If we assume that real per-capita public health expenditure increases by the same rate as per-capita GDP, the share of the public health expenditure in GDP will increase from 5 % today to 6. 7 % in 2050, solely due to demographic change. One factor that could reduce the expenditure pressure in the future is that with decreasing mortality rate there will be fewer people in their last year of life. This, combined with the fact that a major part <b>of</b> health <b>expenditure</b> is driven by decedents, could reduce future health expenditure. Our estimation suggests that distinguishing hospital costs by survival status could reduce somewhat (by about 8 %) total hospital expenditure in 2049...|$|R

Findings Households using inpatient care experienced catastrophic expenditures most often (31. 0 % in 2000, compared with 15. 1 % and 14. 6 % in 2002 and 2004, respectively). During the two post-UC periods, the incidence <b>of</b> catastrophic <b>expenditures</b> for inpatient services at private hospitals was 32. 1 % for 2002 and 27. 8 % for 2004. For those using inpatient care at district hospitals, the corresponding catastrophic expenditures figures were 6. 5 % and 7. 3 % in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The catastrophic expenditures incidence for outpatient services from private hospitals moved from 27. 9 % to 28. 5 % between 2002 and 2004. In 2000, before universal coverage was introduced, the percentages of Thai households who used private hospitals and faced catastrophic expenditures were 35. 8 % for inpatient care and 36. 0 % for outpatient care. Impoverishment increased for poor households because of payments for inpatient services by 84. 0 % in 2002, by 71. 5 % in 2004 and by 95. 6 % in 2000. The relative increase in out-of-pocket impoverishment was found in 98. 8 % to 100 % of those who were poor following payments made to private hospitals, regardless of type of care.

Pregnant C 57 BL/ 6 J female mice were fed a protein-deficient diet (6 % protein). Undernourished offspring (UO) and controls (CO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed a 20 % control diet. The 24 -h <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure,</b> feeding behavior, physical activity, and whole-body substrate preference was assessed using 8 -wk UO and CO weaned onto control diet. Blood chemistries, glucose tolerance, and expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism were analyzed in 8 - and 20 -wk-old CO and UO fed control or a high-fat diet. UO exhibited IUGR with catch-up growth at 8 wk of age and increased severity of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by 20 wk of age. Therefore, fetal malnutrition in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse increases sensitivity to diet-induced obesity. Abnormal daily rhythms in food intake and metabolism, increased lipogenesis, and inflammation preceded obesity in the UO group. Arrhythmic expression of circadian oscillator genes was evident in brain, liver, and muscle of UO at 8 and 20 wk of age. Expression of the clock-associated nuclear receptor and transcription repressor Rev-erbα was reduced in liver and muscle of UO. Altered circadian physiology may be symptomatic of the metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR, and altered feeding behavior and substrate metabolism {{may contribute to the}} obese phenotype...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{estimating}} {{and comparing}} the determinants <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> behaviour <b>of</b> visitors in {{two types of}} museums. An ad-hoc survey was conducted between June and September 2011 among the visitors of the principal museums of the two provinces of Bolzano and Trento: the South Tyrol Museum of Archeology (Bolzano), hosting the permanent exhibition of the “Iceman” Ötzi, and the Museum of Modern and Contemporaneous Art of Trento and Rovereto (MART). The double-hurdle procedure of Heien and Wessels (1999) is used {{in order to obtain}} consistent estimates and split the process of spending decision into the stages of ‘activation’ and ‘outcome’. Results highlight two distinct <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> visitors. Spending of the modern art museum visitor was positively related to her cultural interest, whereas the <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the archaeological museum guest was more ‘generalist’. ...|$|R

Federally funded biomedical research expenditures increased nominally, 0.7% (adjusted for inflation), from 2003 to 2007. Previous reports showed {{a stark contrast}} in federal investment, from 1994 to 2003, federal funding increased 100% (adjusted for inflation).|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the behaviour of time-series data has {{been a matter of}} concern to researchers and practitioners in a variety of fields ranging from social science and economics to engineering. Also, the behaviour of many phenomena within fields relating and peripheral to construction is described as a time series. Typically, the time-series analysis is carried out in order to forecast the future values of the series. These techniques, however, are also used to abstract the generalities within the series, hence facilitating the replication <b>of</b> the entire <b>profile,</b> reflecting only the main characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>profile.</b> There is a variety of techniques that can be applied to a set of time-related data. The choice of the technique is, therefore, dependent {{on the nature of the}} problem and the characteristics of the data. The diversity of available techniques is, on the one hand an advantage for all analysts. However, this diversity is also an indication that there is no universal technique that is applicable to a diversity of time-series data. This work fundamentally addresses the issue of smoothing and curve-fitting techniques rather than predicting and forecasting. A technique is offered which is tested against a set of criteria that are designed to focus on the accuracy of imitation and the practicality of operation: the ability to deal with a large number of time-series sets of data in a consistent, replicable and automated way. The viability of the technique is demonstrated by its application to <b>expenditure</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> a large number of construction projects. The size of the sample and the diversity in the <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expenditure</b> patterns provided an appropriate testing ground for the universality of the model. The results indicated that the model can effectively transform a jagged time series into a smooth pattern, while complying with a set of criteria many of which are common to several other research works relating to time-series data analysis. The proposed technique sequences a number of basic smoothing methods and the process involves the treatment and incorporation of the residual values. Smoothing, forecasting, time series, project expenditure pattern,...|$|R
40|$|From 1995 to 2005, {{the average}} urban {{household}} saving rate in China rose by 7 percentage points, to about {{one quarter of}} disposable income. Saving rates increased across all demographic groups and the age <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> savings has an unusual pattern in recent years, with younger and older households having relatively high saving rates. We argue that these patterns are best explained by the rising private burden <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on housing, education, and health care. These effects and precautionary motives may have been amplified by financial underdevelopment, including constraints on borrowing against future income and low returns on financial assets...|$|R
