30|$|In recent years, oil–water {{separation}} {{has been}} widely researched to reduce the influences of industrial wastewater and offshore oil spills. A filter membrane with special wettability can achieve the separation because of its opposite wettability for water phase and oil phase. In the field of filter membrane with special wettability, <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes have been much investigated because of the associated high efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, and low cost. This article {{provides an overview of}} the research progress of the <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membrane fabrication and discusses the future developments in this field.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{existing}} oil–water separation <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes can utilise {{the special}} wettability of the membrane surface to separate an oil–water mixture and has advantages {{such as high}} efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, good mechanical property and low cost. However, there are some aspects where these filter membranes need improvement for effective treatments of industrial wastewater and offshore crude oil spills. First, the environmental adaptability of the filter membranes needs to be enhanced and its working stability in extreme conditions, such as strong acid and alkali, high-concentration salt solution and corrosive liquid, needs to be strengthened, and its mechanical strength should be improved {{to adapt to the}} real environment. In addition, the material and modification reagents for fabricating the filter membrane need to be eco-friendly during fabrication and application processes. Furthermore, the fabricating process should be simple, and the manufacturing cost should be reasonable {{to meet the needs of}} large-scale production. 3 D printing technology has shown outstanding advantages, such as waste minimization, freedom of design, mass customization and the ability to manufacture complex structures [85]. Biomimetic super-hydrophobic structure [86] and superhydrophobic PLA membrane [87] have been printed for oil-water separation. Those results show that 3 D printing technology made fabrication process of complex micro-nano structure become easier. Based on this technology, oil-water separation membrane with higher efficient can be gotten in the future. Finally, when the oil–water mixture is in an emulsion state, the filter membrane needs to maintain the oil–water separation capability. An oil–water mixed emulsion is generally defined as oil–water dispersion [88] with a droplet diameter of less than 20  μm, and existing studies of oil–water separation by <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes rarely report the separating conditions for a mixed liquid in an emulsion state. Jiang et al. [52] prepared a superhydrophilic–underwater superoleophobic stainless steel mesh that can preliminarily separate oil–water mixed emulsions using a one-step solution coating method with methyltrimethoxysilane, but this filter membrane cannot completely separate oil–water mixture emulsions, since the apertures of many existing oil–water separation <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes are too large. This remains an urgent challenge in the field of oil–water separation by <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes that need to be solved.|$|E

Applications for sintered <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filters</b> in manufacturing processes include carbonation, aeration, ozone treatment, steam injection and oxygen stripping.

30|$|Because {{of their}} low cost, high plasticity, high thermal {{stability}} and good mechanical properties, metal materials {{have been well}} studied for use as filter membranes with special wettability for oil–water separation. This special wettability {{can be achieved by}} coating the membranes with metal nets and a porous metal through physical and chemical methods. In 2004, Feng et al. [11] sprayed hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto a stainless steel mesh to create a superhydrophobic–superoleophilic filter membrane and reported that this kind of filter membrane was first applied in the oil–water separation field. Subsequently, many <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes with special wettability, fabricated through coating [12], surface oxidation [13] and chemical surface modification [14], were successfully used for oil–water separation. This paper briefly introduces the oil–water separation theory of filter membranes with special wettability and analyses the fabrication, advantages and disadvantages of oil–water separation <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes. The filter membranes are classified into three types according to their properties: filter membranes with superhydrophobic–superolephilic property, with superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties and with hydrophilic switchable wettability. In addition, future developments in this field are discussed.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of oil–water separation by <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes with special wettability is the superwetting behaviour on the contact interfaces {{of the solid}} phase, water phase, and oil phase [15]. Since there is equilibrium between the oil–water interfacial tension and the permeating power from the intercepted liquid phase, this special filter membrane can achieve a selective separation in an oil–water mixture. Therefore, constructing a superwetting surface is the key process to the fabrication of oil–water separation filter membranes.|$|E

40|$|An {{all-metal}} High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter {{has been}} recently developed {{as an alternative}} to traditional HEPA filters fabricated with conventional glass fibers. This metal filter was developed utilizing sintered porous metal media fabricated from nickel metal powder. One specific application is the potential for replacement of glass fiber HEPA filters currently used in High Level Waste (HLW) tank ventilation systems at various Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear waste storage sites in the US. The glass filters are subject to a shortened life span due to their deterioration from moisture condensation and therefore must be disposed of when spent. The disposal process is costly, creates solid waste, and is hazardous since the site personnel are at risk of exposure to radiation. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) began investigating the use of porous metal as a HEPA filter material in 1996. This effort subsequently lead to a DOE funded development. This project, under DOE funding, developed novel technology to replace the glass fiber HEPA filters with a regenerable and more durable filter.

A compliant blade is mounted onto a linear guide assembly and driven by a stepper motor to filter the API mixture through a <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter.</b> The mixture enters into the middle of the filtration unit; the excess ethyl acetate and dissolved contaminants are pulled through the filter by a vacuum pump, leaving the desired API molecules on the filter surface. The API is then moved across the filter by the blade to output collectors at either end. The unit itself takes up 0. 03 cubic meters, an eighth of the size of the current equivalent production model. This unit has been tested to successfully filter the API from the rest of the mixture and will help determine if a rotary or linear style filtration system should be used as the final design. by Katherine Wing-Shan Wong.

The results from the first Fluorox run made with crude UF/sub 4 / showed that 85. 3 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / was accounted for, with 17. 9 % being collected in cold traps and the remainder being consumed in various side reactions. Installation was completed of apparatus to study the electrolytic removal of nickel on an engineering scale from concentrated HRT fuel solution. An extremely low yield stress of 0. 02 lb/sq ft was measured for a thoria-urania slurry containing 2. 5 wt. % Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and spherical particles of 1. 7 micron mean diameter. Preliminary data on the rate of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K from sulfate solutions were correlated with a simple spherical diffusion model. Laboratory scale studies to determine the effect of reflux time, HNO/sub 3 / concentration, and air sparge on chloride removal from APPR-type Darex dissolver product showed that an air sparge is definitely beneficial in chloride removal. Preliminary cyclic cleaning tests showed that boiling 25 % caustic solution was adequate for cleaning type F (20 micron) <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> elements fouled in the absence of filter aid with siliceous sludge from Darex solvent extraction feed solutions. Sections of unirradiated stainless steel-clad UO/sub 2 /, sheared into lengths of 1 / 2 in., 1 in., 2 in., and 2 3 / 4 in., were leached free of UO/sub 2 / with 10 M HNO/sub 3 / in 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively.

Currently, the most common approach to cleaning the gas stream at high temperature and pressure is by filtering the particulate with a <b>porous</b> ceramic or <b>metal</b> <b>filter.</b> However, because these dusts frequently have small size distributions, irregular morphology, and high specific surface areas, they can have very high gas flow resistance resulting in hot-gas filter system operating problems.

The particle collection e$ciency for the impactor with the <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> substrate is higher than that with the #at plate substrate below the cutpoint, and numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The dimensionless parameter "(; / 2 Kt) (D /=) has been introduced to deter-mine the excess particle collection e$ciency,, by the <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> substrate in the limit ofStP 0. The theory explains the experimental data of the excess collection e$ciency very well. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of strut thickness on the room and high temperature compressive properties of block-type Ni-Cr-Al powder <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> with ~ 3000 μm pore size manufactured using a new powder process. Two block-type Ni-Cr-Al <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> with different strut thicknesses were manufactured. The strut thicknesses of two block foams were 340 μm (A) and 383 μm (B), respectively. Room temperature, 500 °C, 650 °C and 800 °C compressive tests were performed. The compressive results identified typical elastic, plateau and densification regions of foam material in all temperature conditions. Regardless of the strut thickness, compressive strength (maximum peak stress) decreased as deformation temperature increased. In all deformation temperature ranges, the compressive strength measured higher in the <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> with greater strut thickness (B). The high temperature deformation behavior of powder <b>porous</b> <b>metal</b> was confirmed {{to be affected by}} the structural factor and microstructural factor of the <b>porous</b> <b>metal.</b> With the findings described above, this study also discussed the high temperature deformation mechanism of the Ni-Cr-Al metal foam based on fracture surfaces after the high temperature compressions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Lotus-type <b>porous</b> <b>metals,</b> whose {{pores are}} aligned in one {{direction}} by unidirectional solidification, have a unique combination of properties. These are expected as revolutionary engineering materials with anisotropy of the properties. For the industrial use of the lotus-type <b>porous</b> <b>metals,</b> a reliable joining technology is required. We already reported the melting property of a few lotus-type <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> by laser welding. These results indicated that these materials possessed anisotropy of melting property with the pore direction perpendicular and parallel to the specimen surface, especially remarkable anisotropy was obtained for the copper specimen owing to the difference of the laser energy absorption to the specimen surface. In this report, the three-dimensional heat transfer analyses, which {{take into account the}} difference of the laser energy absorption comparing with the anisotropy of thermal conductivity inherent to lotus-type <b>porous</b> <b>metals,</b> were performed by commercial code with user-defined subroutine. Predicted profile of weld fusion zone is in good agreement with the cross-sectional view obtained by experiments. 1...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{critical}} issues in orthopaedic regenerative medicine is the design of bone scaffolds and implants that replicate the biomechanical properties of the host bones. <b>Porous</b> <b>metals</b> have found themselves to be suitable candidates for repairing or replacing the damaged bones since their stiffness and porosity can be adjusted on demands. Another advantage of <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> lies in their open space for the in-growth of bone tissue, hence accelerating the osseointegration process. The fabrication of <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> has been extensively explored over decades, however only limited controls over the internal architecture {{can be achieved by}} the conventional processes. Recent advances in additive manufacturing have provided unprecedented opportunities for producing complex structures to meet the increasing demands for implants with customized mechanical performance. At the same time, topology optimization techniques have been developed to enable the internal architecture of <b>porous</b> <b>metals</b> to be designed to achieve specified mechanical properties at will. Thus implants designed via the topology optimization approach and produced by additive manufacturing are of great interest. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of topological design and manufacturing processes of various types of <b>porous</b> <b>metals,</b> in particular for titanium alloys, biodegradable metals and shape memory alloys. This review also identifies the limitations of current techniques and addresses the directions for future investigations. 15 page(s...|$|R
