50|$|During an IGC {{experiment}} a pulse or constant {{concentration of}} a known gas or vapor (<b>probe</b> <b>molecule)</b> is injected down the column {{at a fixed}} carrier gas flow rate. The retention time of the <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> is then measured by traditional GC detectors (i.e. flame ionization detector or thermal conductivity detector). Measuring how the retention time changes {{as a function of}} <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> chemistry, <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> size, <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> concentration, column temperature, or carrier gas flow rate can elucidate a wide range of physico-chemical properties of the solid under investigation.

A very weakly acidic <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> can be used to minimize disturbing neighboring sites so that a more accurate measure of surface acidity or basicity can be obtained.

The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film.

In IGC {{the roles of the}} stationary (solid) and mobile (gas or vapor) phases are inverted from traditional analytical {{gas chromatography}} (GC). In GC, a standard column is used to separate and characterize several gases and/or vapors. In IGC, a single gas or vapor (<b>probe</b> <b>molecule)</b> is injected into a column packed with the solid sample under investigation. Instead of an analytical technique, IGC is considered a materials characterization technique.|$|E
50|$|Microviscosity can be probed by {{measuring}} the rotational correlation time of a <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> using either fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or the linewidths of the probe's electron spin resonance. The friction experienced by a single particle {{can be thought of}} as a microscopic viscosity (microviscosity) and should not necessarily agree with the bulk viscosity since it is a measure of the probe's local friction whereas bulk viscosity analogously would be the measure of an infinitely large probe. Both the crowding density and relative size of each co-solute in a mixture will contribute to the measured microviscosity as assessed by altered translational mobility.|$|E

In adsorption based methods, {{the size of the}} adsorbate molecule (the <b>probe</b> <b>molecule),</b> the exposed crystallographic planes at the surface and measurement temperature all affect the obtained specific surface area. For this reason, in addition to the most commonly used Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (N2-BET) adsorption method, several techniques have been developed to measure the specific surface area of particulate materials at ambient temperatures and at controllable scales, including methylene blue (MB) staining, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) adsorption, electrokinetic analysis of complex-ion adsorption and a Protein Retention (PR) method.|$|E
50|$|Two {{promising}} {{methods for}} {{the description of}} the acid-base properties of metal oxides are Calorimetric measurements of adsorption enthalpies and Temperature Programmed desorption. The measurement of the heat of adsorption of basic or acidic probe molecules can give a description of acidic and basic sites on metal oxide surfaces. Temperature programmed desorption provides information about acid-base properties by saturating the surface with a <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> and measuring the amount that desorbs from the surface as a function of temperature. The calorimetric method provides a quantitative thermodynamic scale of acetate properties by measuring the heat of adsorption. Calorimetric methods can be considered to give a measure of the total acidity or basicity as it is not discriminate to either Lewis or Brønsted sites. However, when differential heats of adsorption are combined with other techniques, such as IR spectroscopy, the nature and distribution of acid-base adsorption sites can be obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Membrane {{fluidity}} can {{be described}} by {{two different types of}} motion: rotational and lateral. In ESR, rotational correlation time of spin probes is used to characterize how much restriction is imposed on the probe by the membrane. In fluorescence, steady-state anisotropy of the probe can be used, in addition to the rotation correlation time of the fluorescent probe. Fluorescent probes show varying degree of preference for being in an environment of restricted motion. In heterogeneous membranes, some probes will only be found in regions of higher membrane fluidity, while others are only found in regions of lower membrane fluidity. [...] Partitioning preference of probes can also be a gauge of membrane fluidity. In deuterium NMR, the average carbon-deuterium bond orientation of the deuterated lipid gives rise to specific spectroscopic features. All three of techniques can give some measure of the time-averaged orientation of the relevant (<b>probe)</b> <b>molecule,</b> which is indicative of the rotational dynamics of the molecule.|$|E

40|$|Oxygen {{chemisorption}} {{has been}} studied on sulfided Mo catalysts supported on Si 02 with differing dispersions {{as a function of}} pretreatment. It was found that presulfided samples purged in He at 350 "C chemisorb about half as much 0 2 as samples reduced first in H 2 at 350 "C, followed by He purge at the same temperature. From this study in combination with other studies of chemisorption of <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> such as H 2 S, CO, 0 2, and NO on sulfided Mo catalysts, a two-site chemisorption model is proposed. The adsorption sites are intrinsically related to the geometric and electronic character of the MoS 2 two-dimensional layer structure. Frontier orbital concepts and Hoffmann's theory of bonding on surfaces are employed to postulate the selectivity in chemisorption of <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> on the two adsorption sites and to correlate quantitatively the chemisorption amount of various <b>probe</b> <b>molecules.</b> The model suggests that Mo-S sites with unsaturated coordination located in S-Mo-S layers are adsorption sites for <b>probe</b> <b>molecules</b> HzS, CO, 02, and NO, while S sites located in S- S layers only adsorb 0 2 and NO...|$|R

Herein, a new colorimetric method, perichromism, {{has been developed}} to distinguish between amorphous and crystalline material, based on diffuse reflection ultraviolet–visible (UV-visible) spectroscopy. A <b>probe</b> <b>molecule,</b> phenol red, at 0. 1 % w/w concentration was added to sucrose and dissolved in water. The solution was freeze-dried, which resulted in an amorphous excipient with the <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> incorporated in an intimate mixture. The samples were then stored at a selected controlled temperature and relative humidity to allow control of crystallization of the sucrose. The amorphous or crystalline nature of each sample, both with and without {{the addition of the}} phenol red <b>probe</b> <b>molecule,</b> was monitored through X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that sucrose remained amorphous when stored in an atmosphere with a relative humidity below 32 %; above this level, crystallization occurred. It was found that the presence of the <b>probe</b> <b>molecule</b> did not alter the extent of crystallinity of sucrose. Analysis of the samples containing the phenol red probe by diffuse reflection spectroscopy revealed that spectra could be classified into two groups depending on the λmax. Furthermore, correlation of the diffuse reflection spectra with X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry data showed that sucrose was amor-phous in one group and crystalline in the other group, thereby revealing that diffuse reflection spectroscopy can, when phenol red is used as a <b>probe</b> <b>molecule,</b> quickly and easily determine whether sucrose is crystalline or amorphous...|$|E
