40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{predicting}} disk access response times given a trace of previous disk activity using a linear regression model. We build two models and corresponding features to de-scribe different situations, the request-based model, {{in which we have}} all the information about the <b>prior</b> <b>requests,</b> and trace-based model, in which we predict the response time for a new trace of requests(workload). In addition, the fractal nature of the accesses is examined and a power-law established. This fractal distribution is then used to distinguish between idle and busy periods. In the trace-based model, where many ideal features are not available, a KNN(k-nearest neighbor) method is used to select a previously seen trace from the training data which is similar to the testing data. The accuracy of both models is assessed and conclusions drawn as to which features are most important to predicting response times, and why that might be...|$|R

50|$|The men {{who were}} against Atahualpa's {{conviction}} and murder argued {{that he should be}} judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa agreed to accept baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; he was baptized as Francisco. On 29 August 1533 Atahualpa was garrotted and died a Christian. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was taken, probably at his <b>prior</b> <b>request,</b> to its final resting place in Quito. Upon de Soto's return, he was furious; he had found no evidence of any secret gathering of Atahualpa's warriors.|$|E

5000|$|The United States has {{formally}} {{declared war}} against foreign nations five separate times, each upon <b>prior</b> <b>request</b> by the President of the United States. Four of those five declarations came after hostilities had begun. James Madison {{reported that in}} the Federal Convention of 1787, the phrase [...] "make war" [...] was changed to [...] "declare war" [...] in order to leave to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks but not to commence war without the explicit approval of Congress. Debate continues as to the legal extent of the President's authority in this regard. Public opposition to American involvement in foreign wars, particularly during the 1930s, was expressed as support for a Constitutional Amendment that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war. Several Constitutional Amendments, such as the Ludlow Amendment, have been proposed that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.|$|E
