50|$|The units, streams, {{and fluid}} systems of {{chemical}} plants or processes {{can be represented}} by block <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> which are very simplified <b>diagrams,</b> or <b>process</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> which are somewhat more detailed. The streams and other piping are shown as lines with arrow heads showing usual direction of material <b>flow.</b> In block <b>diagrams,</b> units are often simply shown as blocks. <b>Process</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> may use more detailed symbols and show pumps, compressors, and major valves. Likely values or ranges of material flow rates for the various streams are determined based on desired plant capacity using material balance calculations. Energy balances are also done based on heats of reaction, heat capacities, expected temperatures and pressures at various points to calculate amounts of heating and cooling needed in various places and to size heat exchangers. Chemical plant design can be shown in fuller detail in a piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) which shows all piping, tubing, valves, and instrumentation, typically with special symbols. Showing a full plant is often complicated in a P&ID, so often only individual units or specific fluid systems are shown in a single P&ID.|$|R
