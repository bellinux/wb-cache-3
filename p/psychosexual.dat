5|$|Ann {{is found}} {{some time later}} by the police, {{clutching}} Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. He seems to accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own <b>psychosexual</b> explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face {{on one of the}} officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have <b>psychosexual</b> consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E

25|$|In rodents, estrogens (which are locally {{aromatized}} from androgens in the brain) play {{an important}} role in <b>psychosexual</b> differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior; the same is not true in humans. In humans, the masculinizing effects of prenatal androgens on behavior (and other tissues, with the possible exception of effects on bone) appear to act exclusively through the androgen receptor. Consequently, the utility of rodent models for studying human <b>psychosexual</b> differentiation has been questioned.|$|E

25|$|Gallati has {{suggested}} that the placement of the two oldest girls, {{at the edge of a}} darkened and ambiguous entryway, is symbolic of their maturation into an unknown future.

25|$|A {{relatively}} rare, but dramatic, {{side effect}} associated with trazodone is priapism, {{likely due to}} its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated {{that the incidence of}} any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated <b>psychosexual</b> side effects in women, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.|$|E
25|$|Human {{choices in}} acting on {{sexuality}} are commonly influenced by cultural norms which vary widely. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. The pioneering researcher Sigmund Freud believed {{that humans are}} born polymorphously perverse, which means that any number of objects could {{be a source of}} pleasure. According to Freud, humans then pass through five stages of <b>psychosexual</b> development and can fixate on any stage because of various traumas during the process. For Alfred Kinsey, another influential sex researcher, people can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation, with only small minorities fully heterosexual or homosexual. Recent studies of neurology and genetics suggest people may be born predisposed to various sexual tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in <b>psychosexual</b> development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able {{to let go of the}} rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{presented}} {{his theory of}} <b>psychosexual</b> development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).|$|E
500|$|David Edelstein wrote, [...] "Alien {{remains the}} key {{text in the}} 'body horror' subgenre that flowered (or, {{depending}} on your viewpoint, festered) in the seventies, and Giger’s designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate — how’s that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a <b>psychosexual</b> invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled." ...|$|E

He started writing during his {{short-term}} {{residence at the}} MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, United States, and finished the novel in Berlin, Germany; he had accepted {{a grant from the}} German Academic Exchange Service in 1999. Eugenides spent the first few years trying to establish the narrative voice for his novel. He wanted to [...] " [...] epic events in the third person and <b>psychosexual</b> events in the first person". According to Eugenides, the voice [...] "had to render the experience of a teenage girl and an adult man, or an adult male-identified hermaphrodite".|$|E

[...] biggest source of pleasure". The first volume's cover sees Shakira holding a baby girl in her arms; the artwork for the second album shows a nude Shakira (covered by tree branches), with the infant sitting in the tree. She stated that both covers alluded to psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's theory that infants begin discovering the world through their mouths during the oral stage of <b>psychosexual</b> development.|$|E
500|$|Kim Ki-young (October 10, 1919 [...] February 5, 1998) was a South Korean film director, {{known for}} his {{intensely}} <b>psychosexual</b> and melodramatic horror films, often focusing on the psychology of their female characters. Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea {{after the end of}} World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In [...] 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas {{for the rest of the}} decade.|$|E
500|$|Despite their stereotypical [...] "queerness", The Daily Cardinal {{reported}} in 1930 {{that a majority}} of Experimental College students participated in sport, and that a number joined intramural teams, pledged for Greek life, and joined campus clubs. However, the students abnormally read an average of 16 non-assigned books each semester and had an average of [...] "only two dates a month", which the paper considered abnormal amid hints of homosexuality. As these claims became widespread, Meiklejohn imported psychiatrist Frankwood Williams from New York to study the students' sexual habits. He found the students to be [...] "warped and twisted" [...] as [...] "normal for ... their age", praised the program for aiding their <b>psychosexual</b> growth where others inhibit, and concluded that the advisers made the students subservient to their demands even as they spoke in praise of student autonomy.|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Blue Jeans", was {{influenced}} by hip hop and has a minimalist beat that recalls songs by Timbaland. Del Rey also raps in a few verses of the song such as [...] "You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer [...] Love you more than those bitches before". [...] "Off to the Races" [...] has been lyrically described as [...] "a freak show of inappropriate co-dependency", with a chorus that recalls Sheryl Crow's [...] "down and out drunken loner persona" [...] in her 1994 single [...] "Leaving Las Vegas". Pryia Elan of NME noted the track [...] "almost falls {{under the weight of}} this persona. There's none of 'Video Games' measured, piano-led reflection. Instead the <b>psychosexual</b> rumblings of the lyrics and the dual voices she uses off set the comparatively simple musical shades on display." ...|$|E
500|$|Genre {{conventions}} are satirized and mocked {{throughout the}} film. In American noirs, heroes, or anti-heroes, typically {{strive to be}} the best in their field. Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players. The femme fatale—a noir staple—Misako, does not simply entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself. She tries to kill him, wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things. Hanada's libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period, such as James Bond, though perversely exaggerated. Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada's boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond's [...] "shaken, not stirred" [...] martini order. The film also deviates from the opening killer-for-hire scenario to touch on such varied subgenres as <b>psychosexual</b> romance, American Gothic thriller and Odd Couple slapstick.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez from Billboard {{magazine}} {{compared the}} video with Madonna's work and American Horror Story, concluding [...] "he spine-tinglingly glam... video for this track is worth Beyoncé's case for {{making this a}} simultaneous visual-and-audio experience alone". Describing the video as [...] "scary", Lindsay Weber from Vulture further called it the singer's best impression of American Horror Story. Jason Newman from the website Fuse described the video as [...] "equally frightening part Korean horror film, part Lynchian <b>psychosexual</b> fantasy." [...] The Fader editor Michael Zelenko noted the clip presented a classic story where an [...] "innocent guest [...] caught in ghost-infested hotel". Insanul Ahmed of Complex described the visual as [...] "creepy". ABC News journalist Michael Rothman compared the video's opening with horror movies and The Ring in particular {{and went on to}} praise it overally as Beyoncé's [...] "best yet". Trent Wolbe of The Verge criticized Åkerlund's work on the album, feeling that his contributions [...] "feel like boring opulence porn", something he found on [...] "Haunted".|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{found that}} {{homosexual}} {{men were more}} likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers. Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers were more likely to describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the [...] "result of an unusually strong maternal identification", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ <b>psychosexual</b> development. Homosexual men were less likely to give positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They {{were also more likely to}} feel more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, [...] "Unfavorable relationships with fathers" [...] have a weak connection to [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences".|$|E
500|$|Nandini Ramnath, {{writing for}} the website Scroll.in, noted that Moondram Pirai {{contains}} elements common in Balu Mahendra's other films: [...] "realism, evocative and naturalistic cinematography, strong performances, and <b>psychosexual</b> themes that drive the characters to make unusual and often tragic choices." [...] Hari Narayan of The Hindu compared Moondram Pirai to another Haasan film, Guna (1991). In both narratives, the protagonist’s image of an ideal dreamgirl animate his antics. Cheenu, according to Narayan, [...] "looks like a melange of [...] Keats’ tragedy and [...] Freud’s psychoanalysis." [...] Narayan explains the idea of Cheenu keeping Bhagyalaskhmi with him not only {{as an act of}} sympathy and love, but also with the intention to preserve her like a portrait. Narayan also states that the character, Robert Ledgard's (Antonio Banderas) attraction to Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) in Pedro Almodóvar's Spanish film The Skin I Live In (2011), is similar to Cheenu's attraction to Bhagyalakshmi. When Bhagyalakshmi recovers her memory and forgets him, Cheenu is hesitant to come back to his quiet existence, realising that in reality, dreams feel like its antithesis.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying <b>psychosexual</b> pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for NME in 1980 Chis Salewicz {{described}} the album as [...] "being {{probably the best}} album this year by a British band". In his review of the album for Smash Hits, Ian Cranna said that the album was [...] "proof positive that there's just no substitute for a good song delivered with power and emotion". Cranna added, [...] " [...] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody (but not obscure) personal lyrics, all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat, ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice." [...] Reviewing the album in 1981 for Rolling Stone magazine, David Fricke awarded it {{four out of five}} stars and said when describing McCulloch's vocals, [...] " [...] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding, combining Jim Morrison-style <b>psychosexual</b> yells, a flair for David Bowie-like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic". He went on to say, [...] "Behind him, gripping music swells into Doors-style dirges ('Pictures on My Wall'), PiL-like guitar dynamics ('Monkeys'), spookily evocative pop ('Rescue') and Yardbirds-cum-Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner ('Do It Clean,' 'Crocodiles')". Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine Blenders website, reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said, [...] " [...] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill, with Will Sergeant's desperate, mantra-like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations." ...|$|E
