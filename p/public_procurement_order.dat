The purposeof {{the paper is}} to investigate whether <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> can be applied as a political instrument. The empirical data consists of a selection of government agencies and how well these government's governing documents have implemented the current government's National <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> Strategy. In <b>order</b> to analyze the degree of implementation, three different implementation theories are applied. The theories applied are implementation from an upside down perspective, implementation from a bottom and up perspective and implementation based on ability, will and understanding. In order to delimit the essay to a reasonable extent, the study aims to focus on how socially responsible <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> {{have been included in}} the governing documents. The question that is aimed to be answered is: to what extent has the objective of socially responsible in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> been implemented in the governing documents? The second question is: Is social responsibility more prominent in governing documents that were updated after launching the national <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> strategy. the third question is: what possible implementation barriers can be identified when implementing the national procurement strategy. The method used in the essay is essentially a quantitative content analysis that is complemented by a qualitative interview survey.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore what {{performance}} indicators that exist within <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> in defence sector context and how such performance indicators can be categorized.   Methodology - For the {{purpose of this}} thesis, an abductive approach was applied. This thesis is characterized as an exploratory multimethod qualitative research, which emphasize a single case study and a comprehensive research literature review. The empirical data was collected using semi-structured interviews, observations and documentary. The empirical data was analyzed using a data display and analysis, whereas a descriptive and content analysis was used for the research literature review.     Findings - Initially, a comparison between the conducted research literature review and the empirical study resulted in 117 performance indicators were abled to be identified. Furthermore, with support from the research literature review, the empirical study and the frame of reference, categorizations of performance indicators were possible. Through research literature review, the author were able to identify eight dimensions cost, quality, time, flexibility, sustainability, innovation, risk and compliance, all of which can be aligned to <b>public</b> <b>procurement.</b> Through the empirical study, seven elements were identified as categories. These elements include business strategy and development, operations management, category management, supplier management, customer management, procurement and expert and system support, all of which with aligned performance indicators.  Through the frame of reference, three decision-levels were used as categorization of performance indicators. The decision-levels could either be strategic, tactical or operational. Finally, a merger of decision-making levels and elements resulted in a conceptual model, visualizing how elements with aligning performance indicators within <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> could be organized and structured.     Research limitations - At first, this thesis uses only one database for the research literature review, limiting the search result of publications concerning the research topic of this thesis. Secondly, single cases study within the defece sector, which limits the amount of information and may prevent transferability possibilities for other <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> organizations.   Future research - From the result of this thesis, several potential research opportunities has been discovered. First, following-up and measure PIs in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> in <b>order</b> to justify the “real” compliance to rules and regulation. Another one is possible challenges with implementing PIs in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> organizations. Lastly, measuring process maturity in public organization would allow benchmarking possibilities among public organizations and defece sector procurement. ...|$|R

Environmental purchasing tools such as Green <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> (GPP) are {{seen by many as}} the solution to greener purchasing decisions in order to obtain and maintain not only a more sustainable construction sector but also a more sustainable economy. The purpose of this research is to determine and examine the key barriers to and drivers of implementing GPP in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> departments in <b>order</b> to reduce the effect construction works have on the environment. There was limited literature on the uptake of GPP in Ireland so the focus was on the uptake of GPP among EU member states. After analysing all aspects of GPP in the literature review, questionnaires were distributed to all key stakeholders of GPP to establish its uptake in Ireland while also indentifying its barriers and drivers. Finally, two interviews were carried out with industry professionals to add more depth to the questionnaire’s findings. In compiling the results and findings from these interviews and questionnaires it was apparent that the uptake of GPP as an environmental tool among <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> departments is extremely slow and non-existent in most cases. The findings highlight the key barriers such as the perception that greener products and services are more expensive, lack of resources, lack of training and lack of support from higher authorities.

The current essay discusses the possible tensions between competition in the market and the regulation of <b>public</b> <b>procurement.</b> <b>Public</b> contracts have been used to implement additional policy goals, such as social and environmental aspects or to aid small business.

The study concludes that first of all the arrival of the EU <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directive was greeted by <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> tenders as well as business interest organisations as a welcomed opportunity to revise <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> rules and to end the poor ambience between interest actors. They perceived the rules as inflexible and hostile towards innovation. Especially the public procurers and the businesses were fed up with situation were complaints imposed high transactions costs. As the above mentioned actors did not find the new <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directive to offer sufficient change, actions were taken especially by KL in order to establish a unique Danish <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law with clearer and less rigid rules. The result has been a process in which many compromises have been made, but where the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> committee nonetheless has managed to create adjustments in regards to the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directives and its shortcomings. Thus, based on the empirical findings the study concludes that somewhat fragile political compromise was created to cope with the poor procurement culture.
