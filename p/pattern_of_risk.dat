40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Psychological Association via [URL] striking feature of human decision making is the fourfold <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> attitudes, involving risk-averse behavior in situations of unlikely losses and likely gains, but risk-seeking behavior in response to likely losses and unlikely gains. Current theories to explain this pattern assume particular psychological processes to reproduce empirical observations, but do not address whether it is adaptive for the decision maker to respond to risk in this way. Here, drawing on insights from behavioral ecology, we build an evolutionary model of risk-sensitive behavior, to investigate whether particular types of environmental conditions could favor a fourfold <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> attitudes. We consider an individual foraging in a changing environment, where energy is needed to prevent starvation and build up reserves for reproduction. The outcome, in terms of reproductive value (a rigorous measure of evolutionary success), of a one-off choice between a risky and a safe gain, or between a risky and a safe loss, determines the risk-sensitive behavior we should expect to see in this environment. Our {{results show that the}} fourfold <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> attitudes may be adaptive in an environment in which conditions vary stochastically but are autocorrelated in time. In such an environment the current options provide information about the likely environmental conditions in the future, which affect the optimal <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> sensitivity. Our model predicts that risk preferences should be both path dependent and affected by the decision maker's current state...|$|E

Methods Analysis of data from a longitudinal birth cohort to assess the prevalence and distribution <b>of</b> multiple <b>risk</b> behaviours by gender at age 15 – 16 years {{with a focus on}} alcohol use at age 10, 13 and 15 years. Results By age 15 years, over half of boys and girls had consumed alcohol and one-fifth had engaged in binge drinking with no clear difference by gender. At age 15 – 16 years, the most prevalent risk behaviours were physical inactivity (74 %), antisocial and criminal behaviour (42 %) and hazardous drinking (34 %). Boys and girls engaged in a similar number of behaviours but antisocial and criminal behaviours, cannabis use and vehicle-related risk behaviours were more prevalent among boys, whilst tobacco smoking, self-harm and physical inactivity were more prevalent among girls. Conclusion Multiple risk behaviour is prevalent in both genders during adolescence but the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>risk</b> behaviour varies between boys and girls.

40|$|One of the stylized facts {{underlying}} prospect {{theory is}} a four-fold <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> preferences. People {{have been shown}} to be risk seeking for small probability gains and large probability losses, while being risk averse for large probability gains and small probability losses. Another fourfold <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> preferences over outcomes, postulated by Harry Markowitz in 1952, has received much less attention and is currently not integrated into prospect theory. In two experiments, we show that risk preferences may change over outcomes. While we find people to be risk seeking for small outcomes, this turns to risk neutrality and later risk aversion as stakes increase. We then show how a one-parameter logarithmic utility function fits such stake effects significantly better under prospect theory than the power or exponential functions mostly used when fitting prospect theory models. We further investigate the extent to which the use of ill-suited functional forms to represent utility may result in violations of prospect theory, and whether such violations disappear when using logarithmic utility...|$|E

Risk among teenagers varies greatly by driving situation; it is particularly low in some situations (e. g., the learner period) and particularly high in others (e. g., right after licensure, late at night, with passengers present). In some of these high-risk driving situations, risk is elevated for drivers of all ages (e. g., late night driving), in others risk is elevated more for teens than adults (e. g., driving after consuming alcohol), and in others the risk is unique to teen drivers (e. g., having passengers).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of Bayesian {{hierarchical}} spatial models {{has become}} widespread in disease mapping and ecologic studies of health–environment associations. In {{this type of}} study, the data are typically aggregated over an extensive time period, thus neglecting the time dimension. The output of purely spatial disease mapping studies is therefore the average spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> over the period analyzed, but the results do not inform about, for example, whether a high average risk was sustained over time or changed over time. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how including the time dimension in disease-mapping models strengthens the epidemiologic interpretation of the overall <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> METHODS: We discuss a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that simultaneously characterize and estimate the stable spatial and temporal patterns as well as departures from these stable components. We show how useful rules for classifying areas as stable can be constructed based on the posterior distribution of the space–time interactions. We carry out a simulation study to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the decision rules we propose, and we illustrate our approach in {{a case study of}} congenital anomalies in England. RESULTS: Our results confirm that extending hierarchical disease-mapping models to models that simultaneously consider space and time leads to a number of benefits in terms of interpretation and potential for detection of localized excesses...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{exposures}} {{and predictions}} {{of child development}} outcomes typically estimate the independent effects of individual exposures. As a rule though, children are not exposed piecemeal to individual or single risks but, rather, {{they are exposed to}} clusters <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Many <b>of</b> these clusters <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> are better thought of as comprising a developmental "circumstance" with a substantial duration, over which period, additional risk exposures also accumulate. In this paper we examined the distribution <b>of</b> 16 single <b>risk</b> exposures for low language ability using latent class analysis across a sample of approximately 4000 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. The best fitting model identified six distinct classes. 46 % of children were in a Developmentally Enabled group, 20 % were in a group typified as Working Poor families, 10 % of children were in group typified as Overwhelmed group, 9 % of children were in a group defined by Child Developmental Delay, 8 % of children were in a group defined by Low Human Capital, and 7 % of children were in a group defined by Resource Poor non-English Speaking background families.

Yet the ability to respond to temporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> predation <b>risk</b> in environments inhabited by highly diverse predator communities, such as rainforests and coral reefs, has received surprisingly little attention. In this study, we investigated whether juvenile marine fish, Pomacentrus moluccensis (lemon damselfish), have the ability to learn to adjust the intensity of their antipredator response to match the daily temporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> predation <b>risk</b> they experience. Groups of lemon damselfish were exposed to one of two predictable temporal risk patterns for six days. "Morning risk" treatment prey were exposed to the odour of Cephalopholis cyanostigma (rockcod) paired with conspecific chemical alarm cues (simulating a rockcod present and feeding) during the morning, and rockcod odour only in the evening (simulating a rockcod present but not feeding). "Evening risk" treatment prey had the two stimuli presented to them in the opposite order. When tested individually for their response to rockcod odour alone, lemon damselfish from the morning risk treatment responded with a greater antipredator response intensity in the morning than in the evening. In contrast, those lemon damselfish previously exposed to the evening risk treatment subsequently responded with a greater antipredator response when tested in the evening. The results of this experiment demonstrate that P. moluccensis have the ability to learn temporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> predation <b>risk</b> and can adjust their foraging patterns to match the threat posed by predators at a given time of day.
