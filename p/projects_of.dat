5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors {{including}} William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels {{of land in}} Oakland {{for the purpose of}} erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, but wanted to use their own East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930.|$|E

5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E

5|$|Other architects {{chose the}} era's simpler styles, like Arts and Crafts, as a contrast. The marble-and-brick 1905 YMCA {{building}} on Second Street, and the six-story Caldwell Apartments at State and Second streets {{are two of}} the district's best examples of that style. The latter building, built in 1907, was also the first large-scale apartment building in the city. The Colonial Revival style would also leave its mark in Troy with several buildings. Most notable among them is the Hendrick Hudson Hotel {{on the east side of}} Monument Square, a six-story structure that was the largest building ever built in the city at the time. <b>Projects</b> <b>of</b> similar scale, and the city's annexation of the village of Lansingburgh to its north, helped swell its population to over 72,000 in 1930, its alltime peak.|$|E
