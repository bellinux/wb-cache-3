40|$|The regioselectivity of {{photoinduced}} electron-transfer (PET) {{reactions of}} unsymmetrical phthalimides {{is controlled by}} the spin density distribution of the intermediate radical anions. ROHF ab initio calculations were found to be most suitable for atomic spin density analysis. Intramolecular PET reactions of quinolinic acid imides were studied with the potassium butyrate and hexanoate 1 a,b and a cysteine derivative 3. The photocyclizations products 2 a,b and 4 were formed with moderate regioselectivities (68 : 32, 57 : 43, and 81 : 19) showing preferential ortho cyclization. The intermolecular reaction of <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> and potassium isobutyrate with N-methylquinolinic acid imide (5) yielded as addition products the dihydropyrrolo[3, 4 -b]pyridines 6 a,b with slight ortho regioselectivity (55 : 45). In contrast to these low regioselectivities, the PET reaction of <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> with the methyl ester of N-methyltrimellitic acid imide (9) yielded solely the para addition product 10. Likewise, the intramolecular photoreaction of the cysteine derivative 7 gave a 75 : 25 (para/meta) mixture of regioisomeric cyclization products 8. The regioselectivity originates from donor-acceptor interactions prior to electron transfer and differences in spin densities in the corresponding imide radical anions. The results of DFT and ab initio calculations for the radical anions of the quinolinic acid imide (11 *-) and the methyl ester of trimellitic acid imide (12 *-) were in agreement with the latter assumption: spin densities in 11 *- were higher for the imido ortho carbon atoms (indicating preferential ortho coupling); for 12 *- the spin densities were higher for the imido para carbon atoms (indicating preferential para coupling). These correlations became more significant when the additional spin densities at the carbonyl oxygen and the adjacent carbon atoms were taken into account. The cyclization selectivities for 2, 4, and 8 deviate from the intermolecular examples probably because of ground-state and solvent effects...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA ANS Panel {{provides}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} propionic acid (E 280), sodium propionate (E 281), calcium propionate (E 282) and <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> (E 283) which are authorised as food additives in the EU and have been previously evaluated by the SCF and JECFA. JECFA allocated an ADI “not limited”. The SCF concluded that <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> could {{be added to the}} list of preservatives and established an ADI ”not specified”. Propionates are naturally occurring substances in the normal diet. The Panel considered that forestomach hyperplasia reported in long-term studies in rodents is not a relevant endpoint for humans because humans lack this organ. Based on the reported presence of reversible diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the oesophagus the LOAEL for a 90 -day study in dogs was considered by the Panel to be 1  % propionic acid in the diet and the NOAEL to be 0. 3  % propionic acid in the diet. The Panel considered that there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The Panel concluded that the present database did not allow allocation of an ADI for propionic acid - propionates. The overall mean and 95 th percentile exposures to propionic acid - propionates resulting from their use as food additives (major contributor to exposure) ranged from 0. 7 - 21. 1 and 3. 6 - 40. 8 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Panel noted that the concentration provoking site of contact effect in the 90 -day study in dogs (1 % propionic acid in the diet) is a factor of three higher than the concentration of propionic acid - propionates in food at the highest permitted level and concluded that for food as consumed, there would not be a safety concern from the maximum concentrations of propionic acid and its salts at their currently authorised uses and use levels as food additives...|$|E

The film was prepared by casting technique. When incorporated at 1. 40 % and above, potassium sorbate decreased the tensile strength (about 22 %) and increased the elongation (about 55 %) of control film; whereas, it increased the water vapour permeability by 15 % only when added at 2. 66 %. At 2. 66 %, benzoic acid reduced the tensile strength by 24 % and sodium propionate increased elongation by 17 %. These two antimicrobials did not change the water vapour permeability.

40|$|ABSTRACT Single {{muscle fibers}} from rabbit soleus and {{adductor}} magnus and from semitendinosus muscles were peeled {{to remove the}} sarcolemma and then stimulated to release Ca 2 ' by (a) caffeine application or (b) ionic depolarization accomplished via substitution of choline chloride for <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> at constant [K+] X [Cl-] in the bathing solution. Each stimulus, ionic or caffeine, elicited an isometric tension transient {{that appeared to be}} due to Ca 21 released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The peak magnitude of the ionic (Cl [...] induced) tension transient increased with increasing Cl- concentration. The application of ouabain to fibers after peeling had no effect on either type of tension transient. However, soaking the fibers in a ouabain solution before peeling blocked the Cl [...] induced but not the caffeine-induced tension transient, which suggests that ouabain's site of action is extracellular, perhaps inside transverse tubules (TTs). Treating the peeled fibers with saponin, which should disrupt TTs {{to a greater extent than}} SR membrane, greatly reduced or eliminated the Cl [...] induced tension transient without significantly altering the caffeine-induced tension transient. These results suggest that the Cl [...] induced tension transient is elicited via stimulation of sealed, polarized TTs rather than via ionic depolarization of the SR...|$|E
40|$|Stimulation {{of taste}} receptors with sodium chloride, sodium acetate, sodium propionate, and the {{respective}} potassium salts gave concentration-response profiles, measured electrophysiologically, which are remarkably {{consistent with a}} two-state allosteric mechanism. The allosteric constant or equilibrium constant for the transition between the active and inactive receptor states is low, resulting in {{a condition in which}} small differences in ion affinities for the two states are sufficient to significantly alter the equilibrium. Receptor activators, such as sodium ion, displaced the equilibrium toward the active receptor state by virtue of a higher affinity for that state, whereas receptor inhibitors, such as acetate and propionate ions, displaced the equilibrium in the opposite direction {{as a result of a}} higher affinity for the inactive state. The low allosteric constant increased about 10 -fold after treatment with the protein modification reagent dimethyl(2 -hydroxy- 5 -nitrobenzyl) sulfonium bromide, resulting in a marked reduction in the response to sodium chloride and sodium propionate without a significant change in ion affinities. In order to fully resolve the potassium response characteristics, it was necessary to consider both a potassium activation site and a potassium inhibition site. Analysis of the response from sodium chloride/potassium chloride mixtures showed that sodium ion is competitive with potassium binding at the activation site but not the inhibition site. With <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> as the stimulus, the effect of both a receptor activator and a receptor inhibitor was quantitatively consistent with depression of the response below a water baseline level at low stimulus concentrations. Estimation of active and inactive state dissociation constants for each anion and cation permitted accurate prediction of the response magnitude for a range of cation ratios in sodium chloride/potassium chloride mixtures and anion ratios in sodium chloride/sodium propionate mixtures. The association of salty taste with receptor activators and bitter taste with receptor inhibitors may be relevant to the generation of these taste qualities...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical {{methods have}} been widely {{neglected}} by industry for the search of novel pharmaceutical lead compounds. The photodecarboxylative addition of various carboxylates to phthalimides has been developed in our group as a powerful access to hydroxyl- and methylene-isoindolinones. Likewise, the intramolecular version yields the corresponding cyclisation products. In this thesis the intermolecular version, i. e. the photodecarboxylative addition of carboxylates to phthalimides, has been further investigated. Various heteroatom-substituted carboxylates have been studied {{in order to establish}} a mechanistic understanding of the photoinduced electron transfer processes involved. N-methylphthalimide was used as a model substrate and was irradiated at λ = 300 nm in aqueous acetone and in the presence of excess amounts of potassium carboxylates, the latter generated from the corresponding carboxylic acid and potassium carbonate. The evolution of carbon dioxide was tested using barium hydroxide solutions and was deemed positive when barium carbonate precipitation was formed. Among the carboxylates used were alkyl-, benzyl- and heteroatom-substituted carboxylates. Alkylated amino acid derived carboxylates solely underwent photoreduction whereas N-acylated amino acid readily furnished the desired addition products. To investigate the possibility of deactivation by certain electron-donors, various phthalimides with potential electron-donor substituents in the N-side chain have been studied. In these cases <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> served as model carboxylate. In an extension of the decarboxylative addition, alkyl benzoylformates were irradiated in the presence of sulphur-containing carboxylates and the corresponding addition products were obtained in moderate to good yields. Due to their less favourable electrochemical properties, these compounds do not undergo photoinduced electron transfer reactions with alkyl-, benzyl- or oxygen-containing carboxylates, respectively. The optimised irradiation conditions were applied to the synthesis of AKS- 186 and its derivatives. AKS- 186 has demonstrated promising cardiovascular drug activities and became readily accessible from N-(4 -acetoxybenzyl) phthalimide using the developed photochemical method as key-step. Depending {{on the nature of the}} chosen carboxylate the addition products were obtained in poor to good yield of 10 - 76 %.

Using first-order factorial designs, reliable models were constructed, revealing the effects of some common ingredients of bread (such as salt, sugar, glycerol, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, calcium <b>propionate)</b> and their interactions on the MFSL (optimisation parameter) with and without ethanol surface spraying. The effectiveness of preservation was ranked as potassium sorbate + ethanol > calcium propionate + ethanol > potassium sorbate > calcium propionate.

40|$|Growth of {{spoilage}} {{fungi in}} bread and other bakery products is currently controlled {{with the addition}} of weak acid preservatives. Consumers demand more natural products and thus {{there is a need to}} reduce the amount of chemical preservatives added to foods, or to identify alternative, more 'natural' antifungal compounds with strong biological activity. This thesis reports on several areas of research undertaken in the project: evaluation of sub-optimal concentrations of existing preservatives, under different environmental conditions, on growth and ochratoxin A (OT A) production by six bread spoilage moulds; efficacy of new/natural antifungal compounds for possible use in bread preservation; evaluation of the impact of preservation hurdles on ecophysiology of the spoilage fungi, including niche overlap; and mechanisms of action of preservatives on hydrolytic enzymes. It was found that the use of currently applied levels of the existing preservatives <b>potassium</b> sorbate, calcium <b>propionate</b> and sodium benzoate were effective, under low pH environments (pH 4. 5) at completely controlling growth of spoilage moulds (Aspergillus ochraceus, Eurotium repens, Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium corylophilum and Penicillium verrucosum) on wheat flour-based substrates over a period of 30 days. At higher pH levels, the efficacy decreased being almost nil at pH 7. 5. The use of sub-optimal concentrations of weak acid preservatives led in most cases to reductions in lag times and/or stimulation of mould growth and ochratoxin A production by P. verrucosum strains.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of ATP and absence of Ca 2 +, muscle crossbridges have either MgATP or MgADP. Pi bound at the active site (S. B. Marston and R. T. Tregear, Nature [Lond. ], 235 : 22 : 1972). The behavior of these myosin adenosine triphosphate (M. ATP) crossbridges, both in relaxed skinned rabbit psoas and frog semitendinosus fibers, was analyzed. At very low ionic strength, T = 5 degrees C, mu = 20 mM, these crossbridges spend a large fraction of the time attached to actin. In rabbit, the attachment rate constants at low salt are 10 (4) - 10 (5) s- 1, and the detachment rate constants are approximately 10 (4) s- 1. When ionic strength is increased up to physiological values by addition of 140 mM <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate,</b> the major effect is a weakening of the crossbridge binding constant approximately 30 - 40 -fold. This effect occurs because of a large decrease, approximately 100 -fold, in the crossbridge attachment rate constants. The detachment rate constants decrease only 2 - 3 -fold. The effect of ionic strength on crossbridge binding in the fiber {{is very similar to}} the effect of ionic strength on the binding of myosin subfragment- 1 to unregulated actin in solution. Thus, the effect of increasing ionic strength in fibers appears to be a direct effect on crossbridge binding rather than an effect on troponin-tropomyosin. The finding that crossbridges with ATP bound at the active site can and do attach to actin over a wide range of ionic strengths strongly suggests that troponin-tropomyosin keeps a muscle relaxed by blocking a step subsequent to crossbridge attachment. Thus, rather than troponin-tropomyosin serving to keep a muscle relaxed by inhibiting attachment, it seems quite possible that the main way in which troponin-tropomyosin regulates muscle activity is by preventing the weakly-binding relaxed crossbridges from going on through the crossbridge cycle into more strongly-binding states...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of receptor-channel {{activation}} and desensitization {{have been}} compared at voltage-clamped snake slow and twitch fibre end-plates maintained in an isotonic <b>potassium</b> <b>propionate</b> solution. Miniature end-plate current (m. e. p. c.) decay was slower and less voltage dependent at slow fibre end-plates than at twitch fibre end-plates. The peak m. e. p. c. amplitude versus voltage relationship and reversal potential were similar {{at the two}} end-plate types. Acetylcholine-induced noise and m. e. p. c. s were recorded at slow fibre end-plates. At most slow fibres the spectral density was not adequately fitted by a single Lorentzian function. Rather, the observed spectral density was greater at high frequencies than the values predicted using the m. e. p. c. decay rate. The noise could be well described by the sum of two Lorentzian functions, one of which corresponded to a single Lorentzian function with the corner frequency determined by the m. e. p. c. decay rate. The shape of the carbachol concentration-peak end-plate current relationship was similar at both slow and twitch fibre end-plates. However, for all concentrations tested, the peak carbachol-induced end-plate current (e. p. c. carb.) value was markedly less at slow fibre end-plates than at twitch fibre end-plates. The onset of desensitization was determined using two methods. The first concerned analysis of {{the time course of}} decay of the e. p. c. carb. from a peak value during the sustained application of agonist. The second involved a double-perfusion technique in which a 'desensitizing' dose was applied for varying intervals before the application of a second 'test' dose of carbachol. With both methods the development of desensitization at both end-plate types was dependent on carbachol concentration and duration of exposure. At each end-plate type the time course of desensitization onset often exhibited two components; one with a time constant of seconds and a slower component having time constants in the range of tens to hundreds of seconds. The slope of the relationship between carbachol concentration and equilibrium desensitization at slow and twitch fibre end-plates was close to two, suggesting that two molecules of agonist are probably bound during the development of desensitization. However, for all concentrations tested, desensitization developed more rapidly and to a greater extent at twitch fibre end-plates than at slow fibre end-plates. The voltage dependence of the 3 min steady-state desensitization produced by 108 microM-carbachol was very similar (approximately - 0. 0250 mV- 1) at both fibre types.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of potassium sorbate as a preservative for stored corn at 18, 24, and 30 % moisture contents was studied. Growth and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus decreased with increasing levels of sorbate treatment. The sorbate {{was more effective}} on corn with lower moisture contents and in sealed containers. The effect of potassium sorbate on growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds was studied {{in the presence of}} selected competing molds in yeast extract sucrose (YES) broth which were separated by a dialysis membrane (MWCO 12, 000). Growth of competing molds reduced growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds. The colonizing ability of aflatoxin producing molds in the presence of competing molds was studied on the surface of corn meal agar or corn kernels. Aspergillus flavus was more competitive on damaged corn kernels with 18 % moisture than on undamaged kernels with 26 % moisture. Aspergillus niger was the competing mold most effective in reducing growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds in YES broth with or without sorbate treatment. The presence of A. niger and sorbate had an additive effect in reducing aflatoxin production. A. niger was most competitive in YES broth containing 0. 25 % yeast extract and 20 % sucrose. Neither of the aflatoxin producing molds were competitive in glucose ammonium nitrate broth in all compositions studied. <b>Potassium</b> sorbate, calcium <b>propionate,</b> and natamycin were applied to non-sterilized corn kernels containing inoculated spores of A. flavus. All treatments increased the number of corn kernels dominated by A. flavus. Aflatoxin production was reduced by potassium sorbate and calcium propionate at the 0. 4 % level. When A. flavus and A. niger were inoculated on autoclaved corn, only treatment with potassium sorbate reduced the number of kernels dominated by A. flavus. Aflatoxin production was reduced by 0. 2 and 0. 4 % sorbate, and 0. 4 % calcium propionate. ...|$|R
