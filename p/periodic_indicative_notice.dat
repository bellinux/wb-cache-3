5000|$|A {{competitive}} procedure {{allowing for}} negotiation with companies before finalisation of their tenders was introduced through Article 29 of the 2014 Directive (Regulation 29 in the UK Regulations). Contracting authorities using this procedure {{are required to}} provide to the market a description of their needs, {{the characteristics of the}} goods, works or services to be procured, and the award criteria which will ultimately be used to determine which business is to be awarded the contract to supply. Companies are invited through a contract <b>notice</b> or prior <b>indicative</b> <b>notice</b> to express interest in being invited to tender, and selected companies are then invited to submit an initial tender. Negotiations may take place between the contracting authority and each business in order to [...] "improve the content" [...] of each tender, before invitations are issued to submit a final tender. Final tenders are then evaluated against the previously published award criteria and a contract awarded.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to establish the Effects of Exchange Rate Movements on Fuel Price Changes in Tanzania, the case of Dar es salaam city. The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the magnitude of the effects brought by exchange rate movements on fuel price changes in Tanzania, study the appropriate measure to avert or minimize the adverse impact taken by the government of Tanzania. Secondary data has been mostly used in this research. Primary data has been obtained through close ended and structured questionnaires supplemented by observation and face to face interviews. According to the findings, there is a direct relationship between the current trend of fuel price changes and the movements of exchange rate. The study also showed that there is an inappropriate association between the extent of fuel price changes and the movements of exchange rate, thus the appreciation or depreciation of foreign exchange does not tally with fuel price changes in the country. The study showed that fuel computation and <b>periodic</b> <b>indicative</b> price done by Ewura are wrongly applied and do not reflect the actual movements of exchange rate. The study revealed that foreign exchange appreciation or depreciation has immediate effect on fuel price changes because of weakness of local currency which causes Ewura as Government Regulatory Authority to use this weakness of TZS over USD to set and change the fuel prices every now and then...|$|R
50|$|A Kepler {{object of}} {{interest}} (KOI) is a star observed by the Kepler spacecraft that is suspected of hosting one or more transiting planets. KOIs come from a master list of 150,000 stars, which itself is generated from the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). A KOI shows a <b>periodic</b> dimming, <b>indicative</b> of an unseen planet passing between the star and Earth, eclipsing part of the star. However, such an observed dimming is not a guarantee of a transiting planet, because other astronomical objects—such as an eclipsing binary in the background—can mimic a transit signal. For this reason, the majority of KOIs are as yet not confirmed transiting planet systems.|$|R
40|$|We are {{exploring}} {{the theory that}} binary central stars of planetary nebulae are a contributing factor {{in the formation of}} planetary nebulae. We search for this photometric variability in central stars of planetary nebulae because consistent <b>periodic</b> variability is <b>indicative</b> of a close binary system. The variability of our targets is assessed with the image subtraction software, ISIS. We find that the central stars of the planetary nebulae (CSPNe) Hen 2 - 84 and NGC 6326 show variability. A preliminary light curve for Hen 2 - 84 shows periodic behavior, suggesting a binary system. Of the remaining targets observed, with sufficient data, seven do not appear to have substantial variability detected through ISIS and two targets have undeterminable variability...|$|R

40|$|The {{location}} of proteins on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated by trimethylpsoralen photoreaction of embryos disrupted by gentle homogenization. After photoreaction, the mtDNA was isolated and {{the pattern of}} DNA crosslinking was determined by electron microscopy of the DNA under totally denaturing conditions. In contrast to nuclear DNA, which showed <b>periodic</b> crosslinks <b>indicative</b> of a nucleosome structure, most of each mtDNA molecule exhibited uniformly heavy crosslinking. A 10 % region of the mtDNA was, however, protected from psoralen crosslinking in a distinctive manner: five uncrosslinked segments were closely clustered in the mtDNA. Four were 394 +/- 13 (SD) base pairs in size, while the fifth measured about 200 base pairs. These protected segments mapped within the A+T-rich region of the mtDNA, extending {{from the end of}} the A+T-rich region near the Bg 1 II cleavage site to the center of the A+T-rich region. Protection of this part of the mtDNA from crosslinking was interpreted to be the result of association with proteins in the mitochondrion because mtDNA that was deproteinized before the photoreaction was uniformly crosslinked over its entire length. The origin of replication of the mtDNA is also located at the center of the A+T-rich region, which suggests that the protection from the psoralen photoreaction may be due to proteins involved in membrane attachment or replication...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} and equilibrium of {{the solid}} state reaction between barium carbonate and cupric oxide have been examined thermogravimetrically. The reaction rate {{is found to be}} dominated by effects of nucleation and diffusion of carbon dioxide produced. A mathematical model incorporating these effects, along with considerations of heat transfer, is found to satisfactorily correlate the conversion-time data. The reaction is found to follow the stoichiometry BaCO 3 + CuO half arrow right over half arrow left BaCuO 2 + CO 2 although at temperatures above 1123 K, some evidence of BaO is also seen through X-ray diffraction. In the pelletized samples, incomplete conversion is <b>noticed</b> <b>indicative</b> of pore closure effects leading to transport limitations. The latter is also independently confirmed by porosity and surface area measurements. Data on the reaction equilibrium are also obtained and, in conjunction with Van 2 ̆ 7 t Hoff 2 ̆ 7 s relation, are used to obtain a correlation for the endothermic heat of reaction as a function of temperature...|$|R
40|$|Small {{amplitude}} (50 μm) reciprocating wear of hydrogen-containing {{diamond-like carbon}} (DLC) films of different compositions has been examined against silicon nitride and polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) counter-surfaces, and {{compared with the}} performance of an uncoated steel substrate. Three films were studied: a DLC film of conventional composition, a fluorine-containing DLC film (F-DLC), and silicon-containing DLC film. The films were deposited on steel substrates from plasmas of organic precursor gases using the Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition (PIIID) process, which allows for the non-line-of-sight deposition of films with tailored compositions. The amplitude of the resistive frictional force during the reciprocating wear experiments was monitored in situ, and the magnitude of film damage due to wear was evaluated using optical microscopy, optical profilometry, and atomic force microscopy. Wear debris was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. In terms of friction, the DLC and silicon-containing DLC films performed exceptionally well, showing friction coefficients less than 0. 1 for both PMMA and silicon nitride counter-surfaces. DLC and silicon-containing DLC films also showed significant reductions in transfer of PMMA compared with the uncoated steel. The softer F-DLC film performed similarly well against PMMA, but against silicon nitride, friction displayed nearly <b>periodic</b> variations <b>indicative</b> of cyclic adhesion and release of worn film material during the wear process. The results demonstrate that the PIIID films achieve the well-known advantageous performance of other DLC films, and furthermore that the film performance can be significantly affected by the addition of dopants. In addition to the well-established reduction of friction and wear that DLC films generally provide, we show here that another property, low adhesiveness with PMMA, is another significant benefit in the use of DLC films...|$|R

The experiment {{examined the effects of}} extended practice on inattention blindness and detection of changes to the driving environment in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Participants were paid to drive a simulated road regularly over 3 months of testing. A range of measures, including detection task performance and driving performance, were collected over the course of 20 sessions. Performance from a yoked Control Group who experienced the same road scenarios in a single session was also measured. The data showed changes in what drivers reported <b>noticing</b> <b>indicative</b> of inattention blindness, and declining ratings of mental demand suggesting that many participants were “driving without awareness”. Extended practice also resulted in increased sensitivity for detecting changes to road features associated with vehicle guidance and improved performance on an embedded vehicle detection task (detection of a specific vehicle type). The data provide new light on a “tandem model” of driver behavior that includes both explicit and implicit processes involved in driving performance. The findings also suggest reasons drivers are most likely to crash at locations very near their homes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} {{into the nature of}} everyday driving, with a particular emphasis on the processes that govern driver behaviour in familiar, well - practiced situations. The research examined the development and maintenance of proceduralised driving habits in a high-fidelity driving simulator by paying 29 participants to drive a simulated road regularly over three months of testing. A range of measures, including detection task performance and driving performance were collected over the course of 20 sessions. Performance from a yoked control group who experienced the same road scenarios in a single session was also measured. The data showed the development of stereotyped driving patterns and changes in what drivers <b>noticed,</b> <b>indicative</b> of in attentional blindness and “driving without awareness”. Extended practice also resulted in increased sensitivity for detecting changes to foveal road features associated with vehicle guidance and performance on an embedded vehicle detection task (detection of a specific vehicle type). The changes in attentional focus and driving performance resulting from extended practice help explain why drivers are at increased risk of crashing on roads they know well. Identifying the features of familiar roads that attract driver attention, even when they are driving without awareness, can inform new interventions and designs for safer roads. The data also provide new light on a range of previous driver behaviour research including a “Tandem Model” that includes both explicit and implicit processes involved in driving performance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Factors {{explaining}} the greater susceptibility of preterm infants to severe lower respiratory infections with {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) remain poorly understood. Fetal/newborn lambs are increasingly appreciated as a model to study key elements of RSV infection in newborn infants due to similarities in lung alveolar development, immune response, and susceptibility to RSV. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that preterm lambs had elevated viral antigen and developed more severe lesions compared to full-term lambs at seven days post-infection. Here, we compared the pathogenesis and immunological response to RSV infection in lungs of preterm and full-term lambs. Methods Lambs were delivered preterm by Caesarian section or full-term by natural birth, then inoculated with bovine RSV (bRSV) via the intratracheal route. Seven days post-infection, lungs were collected for evaluation of cytokine production, histopathology and cellular infiltration. Results Compared to full-term lambs, lungs of preterm lambs had a heightened pro-inflammatory response after infection, with significantly increased MCP- 1, MIP- 1 α, IFN-γ, TNF-α and PD-L 1 mRNA. RSV infection in the preterm lung was characterized by increased epithelial thickening and <b>periodic</b> acid-Schiff staining, <b>indicative</b> of glycogen retention. Nitric oxide levels were decreased in lungs of infected preterm lambs compared to full-term lambs, indicating alternative macrophage activation. Although infection induced significant neutrophil recruitment into the lungs of preterm lambs, neutrophils produced less myeloperoxidase than those of full-term lambs, suggesting decreased functional activation. ConclusionsTaken together, our data suggest that increased RSV load and inadequate immune response {{may contribute to the}} enhanced disease severity observed in the lungs of preterm lambs...|$|R
