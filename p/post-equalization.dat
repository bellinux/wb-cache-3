40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{two stage}} hybrid {{interference}} cancellation and equalization framework is proposed for interference cancellation in the uplink of multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The first stage uses time domain equalization to suppress co-channel interference, mitigate asynchronism, and shorten the <b>post-equalization</b> channel response {{to be no}} longer than {{the length of the}} cyclic prefix. The second stage performs lowcomplexity single tap equalization and detection in the frequency domain. The framework is developed specifically for spatial multiplexing and is applied to multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems with asynchronism between users as well as to single-user MIMO-OFDM systems. Various equalizer design methods are proposed that determine the coefficients directly from the training data and are compared with methods based on channel estimates. The equalizer coefficients and <b>post-equalization</b> channel response are found by solving a joint optimization that maximizes the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the frequency domain. Simulations compare various training based methods and show the proposed methods provide good bit error rate (BER) and SINR performance in a variety of interference scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} concept of {{combined}} equalization is investigated for coded uplink MC-CDMA. For combined-equalization it is presumed that channel state information (CSI) {{is available at}} the transmitter (Tx) {{as well as at the}} receiver (Rx). As a result, combined-equalization achieves considerable performance improvements over preor <b>post-equalization</b> applied alone if the corresponding preand <b>post-equalization</b> techniques within combined-equalization are chosen in a preferred way. For combined-equalization the design criterion at Tx is optimal power assignment with respect to CSI rather than avoidance of multiple-access interference (MAI), whereas MAI cancellation followed by maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the almost interference free signal is the main task at Rx. Thus, combined-equalization offers two degrees of freedom - at Tx and Rx - in order to resolve the two contrary design goals of optimal power allocation with respect to the fading channel and MAI supression/avoidance. As a result, improved single-user bounds for MC-CDMA systems transmitting over fading channels are achieved in the case of combined-equalization. Simulation results show that these improved single-user bounds can be approached very closely even for fully-loaded systems if the combined pre- and postequalization techniques are chosen accordingly...|$|E

30|$|The {{simulation}} results validate the correctness of analytically found optimal criteria of subcarrier selection. For up to a moderate number of users, {{as is the}} case in indoor optical wireless communication systems, the amount of transmit power reduction can be significant. A typical data transmission rate of 10 Mbps with 64 subcarriers and QPSK modulation is used as an example case. For post-equalization-based subcarrier selection, reductions ranging from 10 to 24 dB are observed while 8 to 18 dB are observed for pre-equalization-based subcarrier selection with the BER requirement of 10 − 4. Finally, analytical comparison of both cases reveals that pre-equalization always performs no worse than <b>post-equalization</b> in terms of the BER for the same optical transmit power.|$|E
30|$|The above {{model is}} used to derive upper bounds for a fixed DC bias by {{employing}} pre-equalization and <b>post-equalization</b> schemes. For each case under investigation, CSI {{is assumed to be}} available at the transmitter or at the receiver as per post- or pre-equalization requirements, respectively. Then these fixed biases, denoted by Bpost and Bpre, are employed in finding the optimal criteria for subcarrier selection in both cases. The following two subsections show the analytical models for both cases along with the derivation of conservative bounds for fixed DC biases. In both cases, subcarrier selection is based on maximizing the argument of the Q function in the BER expression, where the Q function is the complementary cumulative distribution function of zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian random variable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} the {{performance}} of a combined equalization for multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems is analytically evaluated. Combined equalization consists in performing both pre-equalization at the transmitter and <b>post-equalization</b> at the receiver in order to counteract fading and multi user interference. In this paper we consider partial combining (PC) at the transmitter and threshold orthogonality restoring combining (TORC) at the receiver in the downlink of a MC-CDMA system affected by fading. The analytical framework here proposed allows the derivation of the bit error probability (BEP) and the bit error outage (BEO) and their dependence on the number of subcarriers, the number of active users, the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) averaged over smallscale fading, the partial combining parameter and the threshold of the detector. Moreover, the dependence of the TORC threshold on the other system parameters is derived, providing a thereshold adaptive variation tracking slow processes fluctuations.

40|$|Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{promises}} improved spectral efficiency, coverage, and range, {{compared to}} conventional (small-scale) MIMO wireless systems. Unfortunately, these benefits {{come at the}} cost of significantly increased computational complexity, especially for systems with realistic antenna configurations. To reduce the complexity of data detection (in the uplink) and precoding (in the downlink) in massive MIMO systems, we propose to use conjugate gradient (CG) methods. While precoding using CG is rather straightforward, soft-output minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection requires the computation of the <b>post-equalization</b> signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR). To enable CG for soft-output detection, we propose a novel way of computing the SINR directly within the CG algorithm at low complexity. We investigate the performance/complexity trade-offs associated with CG-based soft-output detection and precoding, and we compare it to exact and approximate methods.

30|$|Nowadays, most {{wireless}} communication systems employ coherent demodulation on the receiver side.

In recent standards, for example long-term evolution (LTE), a certain adjustment is allowed for the power radiated on the pilot symbols. This additional degree of freedom creates space for a further optimization of the system performance. In this article, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system and investigate how to distribute the available power between data symbols and pilot symbols under transmissions over time-variant channels so that the overall throughput is maximized. We choose the <b>post-equalization</b> signal-to-interference and noise ratio as the cost function and solve the problem analytically.
