40|$|One-hundred {{and twenty-five}} {{families}} in the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program were {{assigned to one of}} five treatments to encourage parents to obtain health care service following the dental screening of their children: (a) a control procedure, in which parents were given a dentist's name; (b) a multiple contact procedure, in which parents received a postcard and two telephone call reminders; (c) a <b>problem-solve</b> procedure, in which a social worker aide conducted a brief session with the parent; (d) an incentive procedure, in which parents selected among four gifts that were contingent on seeking care; (e) an incentive + <b>problem-solve</b> procedure, in which the latter two treatments were combined. The multiple contact, incentive, and incentive + <b>problem-solve</b> techniques were significantly more effective in initiating dental visits than the control procedures. Families assigned to the intensive strategies were most likely to complete treatment. A cost-efficiency analysis showed the multiple contact technique to be a low-cost and highly effective procedure...|$|R

5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a <b>problem-solving</b> task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and <b>problem-solving</b> experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses offer many {{possibilities}} in biological research, including {{their ability to}} regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their <b>problem-solving</b> skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.|$|E

Though it was initially rejected for sale on the Steam platform, Valve later offered to sell the game after it received high praise from game journalists; further attention came from the game's release alongside one of the Humble Indie Bundles. The game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices. Reviewers found the game's open-ended <b>problem-solving</b> nature as a highlight of the title. SpaceChem was incorporated into some academic institutions for teaching concepts related to both chemistry and programming.|$|E

In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and <b>problem-solving</b> skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and <b>problem-solving</b> are apparent.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to <b>problem-solving.</b> This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
