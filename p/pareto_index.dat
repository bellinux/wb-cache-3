Most of the known procedures are based on the minimization of (an estimate of) the asymptotic mean square error of the Hill estimator for the <b>Pareto</b> tail <b>index.</b> The principal drawback of these approaches is that they involve the {{estimation of}} nuisance parameters, and therefore lead to complicated selection procedures. Instead, we propose to use Pareto quantile plots and build a prediction error estimator. The latter depends on the quantile at which the data are truncated, and it is minimized to find the optimal number of extreme order statistics used for estimating the <b>Pareto</b> tail <b>index.</b> The main advantages of the new approach are computational simplicity and the absence of estimation of nuisance parameters. The prediction error estimator is actually a generalization of Mallows' Cp to non-normal regression models. Through a simulation study involving several data generating models, we show that our prediction error criterion performs very well in terms of MSE compared to other procedures. The proposed method is also successfully applied to alluvial diamond deposits, finance,income, and insurance data...|$|R

The observations, partitioned into N independent samples of sizes n, lead to N sample means whose empirical distribution function is the main estimation tool. The estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal as N →∞, while n remains fixed. Its behavior is illustrated in a simulation study.

40|$|A model {{based on}} first-degree family {{relations}} network {{is used to}} describe the wealth distribution in societies. The network structure is not a-priori introduced in the model, it is generated in parallel with the wealth values through simple and realistic dynamical rules. The model has two main parameters, governing the wealth exchange in the network. Choosing their values realistically, leads to wealth distributions in good agreement with measured data. The cumulative wealth distribution function has an exponential behavior in the low and medium wealth limit, and shows the Pareto-like power-law tail for the upper 5 % of the society. The obtained <b>Pareto</b> <b>indexes</b> are in good agreement with the measured ones. The generated family networks also converges to a statistically stable topology with a simple Poissonian degree distribution. On this family-network many interesting correlations are studied, and the main factors leading to wealth-diversification and the formation of the Pareto law are identified.

If the data in the tail are not exactly but only approximately Pareto, then the MLE can be biased, i. e. it is not robust, and consequently the choice of k is also biased. We propose instead a weighted MLE for the <b>Pareto</b> tail <b>index</b> that downweights data “far” from the model, where “far” will be measured by the size of standardized residuals constructed by viewing the Pareto model as a regression model. The data that are downweighted this way do not systematically correspond to the largest quantiles. Based on this estimator and proceeding as in Ronchetti and Staudte (1994), we develop a robust prediction error criterion, called RC-criterion, to choose k. In simulation studies, we will compare our estimator and criterion to classical ones with exact and/or approximate Pareto data. Moreover, the analysis of real data sets will show that a robust procedure for selection, and not just for estimation, is needed...|$|R

In this work, we explore an “inverse problem” by simulation, that is, by simulating each neuron indeed only responds to a very limited number of stimuli among {{a very large number of}} neurons and stimuli, to assess whether the population sparseness is always larger than the single-neuron selectivity. Our simulation results show that the population sparseness exceeds the single-neuron selectivity in most cases even if the number of neurons and stimuli are much larger than several hundreds, which confirms the observations in Lehky et al. (2011). In addition, we found that the variances of the computed kurtosis and <b>Pareto</b> tail <b>index</b> are quite large in some cases, which reveals some limitations of these two criteria when used for neuron response evaluation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} predictability of electricity {{prices in the}} Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, {{as well as in}} the US Mid-C market. Using scale-dependent detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the probability distribution analysis we show that the studied markets exhibit strongly anti-persistent properties suggesting that their dynamics can be predicted based on historic price records across the range of time scales from one hour to one month. For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month as well as for on- and off- peak electricity data. These scenarios represent sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets. The estimated values of the <b>Pareto</b> <b>indices</b> suggest that the prediction of these events can be statistically stable. The results obtained provide new relevant information for managing financial risks associated with the dynamics of electricity derivatives over time frame exceeding one day.
