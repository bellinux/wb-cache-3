40|$|A {{domestic}} power {{faces an}} enemy and commits terrorist atrocities {{to increase its}} likelihood of victory. A foreign patron can grant aid to the power but prefers fewer or no atrocities. To avoid the need to compromise with the foreign patron, the domestic power may create (or stop suppressing) independent paramilitaries that commit even more atrocities. Once the paramilitaries are set up, aid flows and the atrocity level is high. After this stage of “atrocity overshooting ” is reached, the domestic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> <b>gears</b> and tries to restrict the atrocity level the paramilitaries are committing. Case studies of Colombia and Northern Ireland illustrate the model. JEL Numbers: D 74, N 4, K 33 Parties to a military conflict are often aligned with outlaw paramilitaries that use terror to {{increase the likelihood of}} victory. A government might fight a rebellion with conventional military tactics while paramilitaries simultaneously terrorize rebel sympathizers. In other cases it is the rebels who are aligned with the paramilitaries, with paramilitary atrocities serving to demoralize the establishe...|$|R
50|$|On lap 36, {{the most}} {{dramatic}} moment of the race came when Power's car suddenly {{ground to a halt}} on course just before the pit entrance. A malfunctioning clutch control unit prevented <b>Power</b> from <b>shifting</b> <b>gears</b> and eventually forced him into neutral, causing his car to grind to a halt. While he would eventually be able to continue, it would not be until he had already lost 8 laps, thus ending any chance Power still had at winning the championship. The lone caution of the race flew for this incident. Both Pagenaud and Montoya were able to make it into the pits prior to the caution flying, though, allowing Pagenaud to maintain his lead, while Montoya managed to come back out in sixth. After pit stops were done, the running order was Pagenaud, Castroneves, Charlie Kimball, and Graham Rahal.|$|R

The mathematic models of the transmission including the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism and synchronizer were developed in MATLAB. The model of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism was developed to analyze the travel map of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> lever and the model of the synchronizer was developed to obtain the force-time curve of the synchronizer during the slipping time. The model of the synchronizer was used to investigate the relationship between the performances of the transmission and the variation of parameters during <b>gear</b> <b>shifting.</b> The mathematic models of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism and the synchronizer provided a rapid design and verification method for the transmission with ring spring...|$|R

40|$|The Joyce Foundation {{launched}} <b>Shifting</b> <b>Gears</b> in 2007 {{with the}} goal of helping six Midwest states significantly increase the number of low-skilled adults with the education and skills they need to succeed in the 21 st century economy. Between 2007 and 2011, the Foundation awarded a total of about $ 8 million in grants to Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, with the expectation that officials in these states would pursue a systems change agenda for making existing education and skills development systems work better for adult learners. <b>Shifting</b> <b>Gears</b> emphasized the need for aligning policy and priorities across adult basic education, workforce development, and community and technical college systems to improve adult transitions to postsecondary education. State officials were expected to identify innovative strategies for serving lowskilled adults in new ways that, over time, would be infused into these systems and the mainstream operations of their local providers and institutions. The premise of <b>Shifting</b> <b>Gears</b> was that states would be able to bolster postsecondary success of low-skilled adults if the old ways of delivering education and related services were replaced with more effective and aligned approaches. The Joyce Foundation recognized that change would not come easily or quickly and was unlikely to be realized during {{the first five years of}} <b>Shifting</b> <b>Gears.</b> Accordingly, this evaluation focuses on the extent to which each of the six states "gained traction on the ground" by implementing their innovative strategies within local institutions and providers of education and skills development. This evaluation specifically focuses on the innovative strategies that connected a state's adult basic education (ABE) system with its community and technical college system. The overarching evaluative questions answered by this report from the first five years of <b>Shifting</b> <b>Gears</b> are: To what extent have states begun to adopt and implement an innovative strategy to improve transitions from adult basic education into community and technical colleges, including serving participants in these new ways? What are the factors that influenced progress in the states to adopt and implement these innovative strategies during the initiative...|$|R
