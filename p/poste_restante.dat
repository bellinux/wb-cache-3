25|$|On 6 December 2010, {{a number}} of paid-for {{services}} including Admail, post office boxes and private postboxes {{were removed from the}} Inland Letter Post Scheme (ILPS) and became available under contract. Several free services including petitions to parliament and the sovereign, and <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> were removed from the scheme.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} April 1969, Adamson {{left the}} Department of Economic Affairs, just as rumours {{circulated}} that the Department would be abolished. He intended to seek another position in the steel business. In the meantime {{he decided to take}} a long holiday and go on a three-month safari drive across the Sahara with his wife. Just as they were about to depart, John Davies telephoned to tell Adamson {{that he was about to}} leave his job as Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry and to suggest that Adamson put his name forward. The Adamsons went on their holiday as arranged, leaving <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> addresses in Algiers and Cairo, and it was at the latter where Adamson received the letter formally inviting him to take up the post.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Malta {{abandoned}} the sterling system and adopted the Maltese pound, where 10 mils = 1 cent and 100 cents = 1 pound. An issue showing the new coins was issued, {{and this was}} followed by three overprints on the 1965 definitive. A new definitive issue showing various local scenes was issued on 31 March 1973, and an airmail set commemorating the setting up of Air Malta was issued a year later. All these were designed by Emvin Cremona, who had by now become a Knight of Malta, but by now his designs were looking dated and tired. In October 1974 the Posts & Telephones Department moved the GPO to Auberge d'Italie, while the Central Mail Room, registered letter branch and <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante</b> were relocated to the former Garrison Chapel.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante</b> {{there was}} a letter for her--more than a letter, a parcel, {{apparently}} a book.|$|E
60|$|I'm leaving to-day for Dover, and a {{line from}} you to-morrow or Monday would find me {{certainly}} at <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Abbeville.|$|E
60|$|I {{have written}} to Nice for letters, {{and hope to}} get them to-night. Continue to address <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante.</b> Take care of yourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father {{is sending}} to the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante.</b> Shall {{he have the}} {{pleasure}} of directing the messenger to ask {{if there are any}} letters for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Montague Dartie, <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Buenos Aires.' I should {{hurry up}} with the steps, if I were you. He fairly fed me up last night." ...|$|E
60|$|But one of {{the party}} had desired letters to be sent <b>poste</b> <b>restante,</b> Amsterdam. The post-office is hard by that awful palace where the Atlas is, and which we really saw.|$|E
6000|$|... from you, dearest Mrs. Martin, and direct, 'M. Browning, <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Pisa'--it is best. Just {{before we}} left Paris I wrote to my aunt Jane, and from Marseilles to Bummy, but from neither have I heard yet.|$|E
6000|$|He replied {{still more}} compactly. [...] "By all means. I {{will send you}} some {{circular}} notes, <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Rome. That will be on your way. Good wishes to you, Stephen. I'm glad {{you want to go}} east instead of just staying in Switzerland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she {{certainly}} owes you that much, after all your suffering for her. I've asked the banker in Nuremberg to forward our {{letters to the}} <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> in Ansbach. Isn't it good to see the crows again, after those ravens around Carlsbad?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Patrick re-directed Anne Silvester's {{letter to}} Arnold, at the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Baden. A second letter, which had arrived that morning (addressed to Arnold {{in a legal}} handwriting, and bearing the post-mark of Edinburgh), was {{forwarded}} in the same way, {{and at the same}} time.|$|E
60|$|Having {{obtained}} a gracious {{permission from the}} lady of the school, I am going to show my companions the Sala of the Peschiere this morning. It is raining intensely hard in the regular Genoa manner, so that I can hardly hope for Genoa's making as fine an impression as I could desire. Our boat for Naples is a large French mail boat, and we hope to get there on Tuesday or Wednesday. If the day after you receive this you write to the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Rome, it will be the safest course. Friday's letter write <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Florence. You refer to a letter you suppose me to have received from Forster--to whom my love. No letter from him has come to hand.|$|E
6000|$|Three {{days later}} I reached Milan, {{a day before}} the formal opening of the Peace Congress. But I found a {{telegram}} had come that morning to the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante</b> to banish all thought of my pacific mission from my mind. It came from Paris and its blue ribbon of text ran: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not aware}} that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this morning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum," [...] he said. [...] "I knew you at once--but--I mean, that I {{concluded}} Mr. Casaubon's address would {{be found at the}} <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> and I was anxious to pay my respects to him and you as early as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|The Fates did not, however, ordain that Clive Newcome should pass all {{his life}} at Naples. His Roman banker {{presently}} forwarded a few letters to his address; some which had arrived after his departure, others which had been lying at the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> with his name written in perfectly legible characters, but which the authorities of the post, according to their custom, would not see when Clive sent for them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good soul, {{she always}} writes at Christmas {{and on my}} birthday. I {{know as well as}} {{possible}} that I shall find a letter <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> wherever she heard of me last, and that she hasn't done--I'm ashamed to say for how long--really, I think not since I let her know that I couldn't stand Ivy Lodge, Dockforth, at any price, when she wrote to Monaco on seeing poor Houghton's death in the paper.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a couple}} of days they arrived at the {{beautiful}} Lugano, and, as usual, their first walk was to the post-office, but disappointment awaited them. There had been some letters addressed to the name of Morville, but the Signor Inglese had left orders that such should be forwarded to Como. Amabel, in her best Italian, strove hard to explain the difference between the captain and Sir Guy, the Cavaliere Guido, as she translated him, who stood by looking much amused by the perplexities of his lady's construing; while the post-master, though very polite and sorry for the Signora's disappointment, stuck to the address being Morville, <b>poste</b> <b>restante.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "On the thirteenth, Midwinter--being then very busy--asked if I {{would save}} him {{a loss of}} time by {{applying}} for any letters which might have followed us from Naples. I {{had been waiting for}} the opportunity he now offered me; and I determined to snatch at it without allowing myself time to hesitate. There were no letters at the <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> for either of us. But when he put the question on my return, I told him {{that there had been a}} letter for me, with alarming news from 'home.' My 'mother' was dangerously ill, and I was entreated to lose no time in hurrying back to England to see her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I enclose," [...] she said, [...] "a bank {{note for}} ten pounds to assist you. I {{am about to}} travel abroad, but must, under {{existing}} circumstances, dispense with {{the services of a}} maid. In the course of my travels I expect to be in Brussels. If, therefore, you have anything to tell me or to ask of me, write to me at the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante</b> of that city, {{and in the course of}} six mouths or so I am tolerably sure to send for the letter. In fact, I shall expect to find a letter from you. Do not think that I have forgotten you or your faithful services, though for a moment I am not able to call you to my side. Be patient." ...|$|E
60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--I am in consternation and vexation on {{receiving}} your letter. What {{you must}} have thought of me all this time! Of course I never saw the letters which went to Rome. Letters sent to <b>Poste</b> <b>restante,</b> Rome, are generally lost, {{even if you are}} a Roman: and we are no Romans, alas! nor likely to become such, it seems to me. There's a fatality about Rome to us. I waited for you to write, and then waited on foolishly for the settlement of our own plans, after I had ascertained that you were not in Devonshire, but in France as usual. Now, I can't help writing, though I have written a letter already which must have crossed yours--a long letter--so that you will have more than enough of me this time.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR CHARLES, - Yours (with enclosures) of the 16th to hand. [...] All work done.

60|$|I pencilled {{a note to}} my American {{that night}} from Hornberg, {{detailing}} the circumstance; but I am sorry to say, for the discredit of humanity, that when those two students wrote the same evening from their inn in the village to order Manitous, they did not mention my name, doubtless under the misconception that by suppressing it they would save my commission. However, it gives me pleasure to add per contra (as we say in business) that when I arrived at Lucerne {{a week or so}} later I found a letter, <b>poste</b> <b>restante,</b> from Mr. Cyrus Hitchcock, inclosing an English ten-pound note. He wrote that he had received two orders for Manitous from Hornberg; and 'feeling considerable confidence that these must necessarily originate' from my German students, he had the pleasure of forwarding me what he hoped would be the first of many similar commissions.|$|E
60|$|Do {{write to}} me at Venice, <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> that I may know you are {{thinking}} of me and excusing me kindly. If you knew how uncertain and tormented we have been. I won't even ask Robert to add a line to this, he is so overwhelmed with a flood of businesses; but he bids me speak to you of him as affectionately and faithfully (because affectionately) as I have reason to do. So kind it was in you to think of taking the trouble of finding us an apartment! So really sensible we are to all your warm-hearted goodness, with fullness of heart on our side too. And, after all, we are not parting! Either we shall find you in Italy again, or you will find us in Paris. I have a presentimental assurance of finding one another again before long. Remember us and love us meantime.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use {{to think}} of that, until we know where she will be. I don't see at present how {{it is to be}} done, but I know that there is always a way if one can think of it. You {{telegraph}} to me every day <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Ostend, or wherever I am stopping. I will send you the name of the hotel I put up at directly I get there. You had better send someone down at once to Ryde to let you know what she is doing, and when she comes up to town; it is just on the cards that they may not come for a bit, but may go for a cruise in Mallett's yacht, as they did last autumn. Anyhow, let me know, and if I telegraph for you to come over, cross by the next boat.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR HENLEY, - I hope {{to leave}} Monastier this day (Saturday) week; thenceforward <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Alais, Gard, is my address. 'Travels with a Donkey in the French Highlands.' I am no good to-day. I cannot work, nor even write letters. A colossal breakfast {{yesterday}} at Puy has, I think, {{done for me}} for ever; I certainly ate more than ever I ate {{before in my life}} - a big slice of melon, some ham and jelly, A FILET, a helping of gudgeons, the breast and leg of a partridge, some green peas, eight crayfish, some Mont d'Or cheese, a peach, and a handful of biscuits, macaroons, and things. [...] It sounds Gargantuan; it cost three francs a head. So that it was inexpensive to the pocket, although I fear it may prove extravagant to the fleshly tabernacle. I can't think how I did it or why. It is a new form of excess for me; but I think it pays less than any of them.|$|E

6000|$|It may be {{that other}} motives, besides those {{connected}} with George Aspel, induced the man in grey to visit the General Post-Office, {{but we do not}} certainly know. It is quite possible that a whole host of subsidiary and incidental cases on hand might have induced him to take up the Post-Office like a huge stone, wherewith to knock down innumerable birds at one and the same throw; we cannot tell. The brain of a detective must be essentially different from the brains of ordinary men. His powers of perception--we might add, of conception, reception, deception, and particularly of interception--are marvellous. They are altogether too high for us. How then can we be expected to explain why it was that, on arriving at the Post-Office, the man in grey, instead of asking eagerly for George Aspel at the Inquiry Office, or the Returned Letter Office, or the <b>poste</b> <b>restante,</b> as any sane man would have done, began to put careless and apparently unmeaning questions about little dogs, and to manifest a desire to be shown the chief points of interest in the basement of St. Martin's-le-Grand? ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MOTHER, - You {{must not}} expect to hear much from me {{for the next two}} weeks; for I am near starting. Donkey {{purchased}} - a love - price, 65 francs and a glass of brandy.

6000|$|... "He {{thanked me}} for suiting myself to his plans, {{with more of}} his old {{gentleness}} and kindness than I had seen in him for some time past. The good news from Armadale on the previous day seemed to have roused him a little from the dull despair {{in which he had}} been sunk since the sailing of the yacht. And now the prospect of advancement in his profession, and, more than that, the prospect of leaving the fatal place in which the Third Vision of the Dream had come true, had (as he owned himself) additionally cheered and relieved him. He asked, before he went away to make the arrangements for our journey, whether I expected to hear from my 'family' in England, and whether he should give instructions for the forwarding of my letters with his own to the <b>poste</b> <b>restante</b> at Turin. I instantly thanked him, and accepted the offer. His proposal had suggested to me, the moment he made it, that my fictitious 'family circumstances' might be turned to good account once more, as a reason for unexpectedly summoning me from Italy to England.|$|E
6000|$|Will wrote from Rome, {{and began}} {{by saying that}} his {{obligations}} to Mr. Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was plain {{that if he were}} not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited rascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks would be like saying, [...] "I am honest." [...] But Will had come to perceive that his defects--defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed to--needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his relative's generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He trusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible, by showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was indebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards himself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He was coming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were obliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His friend Naumann had desired him to take charge of the [...] "Dispute"--the picture painted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon's, Will would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante</b> in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if necessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He enclosed a letter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art, begun with her in Rome.|$|E
6000|$|And yet {{without this}} word that you cannot fit with a meaning and hardly with a memory, {{you would be}} sitting in a very {{different}} chair at this moment and looking at a very different tablecloth. As a practical modern phrase I do not commend it; if my private critics and correspondents in whom I delight should happen to address me [...] "G. K. Chesterton, <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Ethandune," [...] I fear their letters would not come to hand. If two hurried commercial travellers should agree to discuss a business matter at Ethandune from 5 to 5.15, I am afraid they would grow old in the district as white-haired wanderers. To put it plainly, Ethandune is anywhere and nowhere in the western hills; it is an English mirage. And yet but for this doubtful thing you would have probably no Daily News on Saturday and certainly no church on Sunday. I do not say that either of these two things is a benefit; but I do say that they are customs, and that you would not possess them except through this mystery. You would not have Christmas puddings, nor (probably) any puddings; you would not have Easter eggs, probably not poached eggs, I strongly suspect not scrambled eggs, and the best historians are decidedly doubtful about curried eggs. To cut a long story short (the longest of all stories), you would not have any civilization, far less any Christian civilization. And if in some moment of gentle curiosity you wish to know why you are the polished sparkling, rounded, and wholly satisfactory citizen which you obviously are, then I can give you no more definite answer geographical or historical; but only toll in your ears the tone of the uncaptured name--Ethandune.|$|E
6000|$|So {{you were}} at Astley's t'other night. [...] "Now, Mr. Stickney, sir, what can I come for to go for to do for to bring for to fetch for to carry for you, sir?" [...] "He, he, he! Oh, I say, sir!" [...] "Well, sir?" [...] "Miss Woolford knows me, sir. She laughed at me!" [...] I see him run away after this; not on his feet, but {{on his knees and}} the calves of his legs alternately; and that smell of sawdusty horses, which was never in any other place in the world, salutes my nose with painful distinctness. What do you think of my {{suddenly}} finding myself a swimmer? But I have really made the discovery, and skim about a little blue bay just below the town here, like a fish in high spirits. I hope to preserve my bathing-dress for your inspection and approval, or possibly to enrich your collection of Italian costumes on my return. Do you recollect Yarnold in [...] "Masaniello"? I fear that I, unintentionally, [...] "dress at him," [...] before plunging into the sea. I enhanced the likeness very much, last Friday morning, by singing a barcarole on the rocks. I was a trifle too flesh-coloured (the stage knowing no medium between bright salmon and dirty yellow), but apart from that defect, not badly made up by any means. When you write to me, my dear Stanny, as I hope you will soon, address <b>Poste</b> <b>Restante,</b> Genoa. I remain out here until the end of September, and send in for my letters daily. There is a postman for this place, but he gets drunk and loses the letters; after which he calls to say so, and to fall upon his knees. About three weeks ago I caught him at a wine-shop near here, playing bowls in the garden. It was then about five o'clock in the afternoon, and he had been airing a newspaper addressed to me, since nine o'clock in the morning.|$|E
