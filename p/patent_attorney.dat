5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their <b>patent</b> <b>attorney,</b> Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year, and an American <b>patent</b> <b>attorney,</b> Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, [...] "Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I {{would like to say}} 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." [...] Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: [...] "I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics.

500|$|The team first {{approached}} the cable television industry, and the prototype {{attracted the attention}} of TelePrompter Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968. The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the [...] "Brown Box" [...] due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing. With the system now largely complete, Baer and Harrison were unsure who to approach to sell it until a Sanders <b>patent</b> <b>attorney</b> recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only RCA was willing to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again. The three creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Marketing Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.|$|E

5000|$|The National Association of Patent Practitioners (NAPP) is a United States {{non-profit}} organization of <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> and <b>patent</b> agents and those {{working in the}} patent field.

5000|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{must also}} be {{admitted}} {{to the practice of}} law in at least one state or territory of the U.S. or in the District of Columbia. In the time since the USPTO issued the first patent in 1790, approximately 73,000 citizens have passed the USPTO registration examination, allowing them to register to prosecute patent applications. (This total does not include current patent examiners, who are not allowed to serve as <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> or agents and thus do not appear on the list of enrolled practitioners.) Today, roughly 45,000 people are on the list of registered <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> and agents, with slightly less than 34,000 of them also licensed to practice law. [...] Of the states, California has the most <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> (and agents), followed by New York and Texas. Per capita, Delaware has more <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> (and agents) than any state (not including DC). Both <b>Patent</b> <b>Attorneys</b> and <b>Patent</b> Agents are generally required to have a technical degree (such as engineering, chemistry or physics) and must take and pass the USPTO registration examination (officially titled Examination for Registration to Practice in Patent Cases Before the United States Patent and Trademark Office). Since <b>patent</b> <b>attorneys</b> are admitted to practice law in a state or territory, they can additionally provide legal services outside the Patent Office if practicing within the jurisdiction they are admitted to practice or if the law of the jurisdiction otherwise permits them to practice although not admitted in that jurisdiction. These legal services include advising a client on matters relating to the licensing of the invention; whether to appeal a decision by the Patent Office to a court; whether to sue for infringement; whether someone is infringing upon the claims of a client's issued patent; and conversely, whether a client is infringing the claims of someone else's issued patent. Patent agents cannot provide legal services of this nature, nor can they represent clients before the Trademark Office part of the USPTO.|$|R
