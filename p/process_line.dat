Since ammonia is a pungent, cryogenic, and corrosive refrigerated liquid, several problems are encountered in systems {{in which it is}} used. For example, ammonia has a low boiling point (− 33  °C), so the <b>process</b> <b>lines</b> should be able to prevent temperature variations.

However, different projects may require different processes. Defining a separate process for each potential project context is expensive and error-prone, since these processes must simultaneously evolve in a consistent manner. Moreover, an organization cannot envision all possible project contexts in advance because several variables may be involved, and these may also be combined in different ways. This problem is even worse in small companies since they usually cannot afford to define more than one <b>process.</b> Software <b>process</b> <b>lines</b> are {{a specific type of}} software product lines, in the software process domain.
