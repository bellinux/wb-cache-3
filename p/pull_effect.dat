5000|$|Z guard - {{also known}} as the 93 guard is a {{position}} where the practitioner locks his feet together and clamps down on the opponents thigh while using their top leg knee to exert pressure into the opponents hip. The position is very effective due to the biomechanics involved. The more the top player is pressuring into the top leg the tighter they lock the guard onto themselves while exerting more energy than the bottom player. Z-guard has many defensive characteristics as well as many offensive. It is a solid foundation providing entries into [...] "deep half" [...] and or [...] "half single"as well as traditional half guard techniques. The Z-guard is a must for any practitioner as it creates a strong barrier between you and your opponent with the top knee controlling that distance while there is a push <b>pull</b> <b>effect</b> happening with the bottom leg.|$|E

In this paper, focusing on corporate debt issuance, we apply the contemporary push-pull theory to establish whether bond issuance are {{pushed by the}} firms due to internal considerations, or pulled by the enticement of exogenous forces. We explore the impact of eight firm-specific push attributes and four systematic pull factors on the likelihood and volume of five types of debt issued, and disentangle the relative significance of push and <b>pull</b> <b>effects.</b> We find three key results. First, unconditionally, both firm-specific push attributes and exogenous pull factors are relevant.

The test results suggest that, together with the Oak vertical roots, which keep the little depth rooted soil zone to the deep and more stable soil mass, the side roots of the Oak, with their <b>pulling</b> <b>effect,</b> are able to make less against little depth instability in the forest slopes, such as little depth slide, to a certain degree...|$|R

The efficiency results are analyzed using Markov Spatial Transition Matrices to provide insights into the transition of regions between efficiency levels, considering their local spatial context. The results indicate that geography {{plays an important role}} in manufacturing competitiveness. In particular, regions with more competitive neighbors are more likely to improve their relative efficiency (<b>pull</b> <b>effect)</b> over time, and regions with less competitive neighbors are more likely to lose relative efficiency (drag effect).

40|$|Homophily, the {{tendency}} of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, {{has been identified as}} a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily {{is the result of a}} socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6, 000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a <b>pull</b> <b>effect,</b> where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance.

40|$|Why {{do people}} switch their mobile phones? What factors make them {{to stick with}} their current phones? This thesis' {{objective}} {{is to find out}} the influences behind consumer mobile phone switching behavior. Academic literature has examined mobile phone switching surprisingly little since the focus has been on mobile phone related adoption research. This thesis aims to fill that gap of lacking mobile phone switching behavior research. An inductive approach is applied on a qualitative data set that was collected from 249 university students from three different continents to determine the consumer expressed reasons to switch and not to switch mobile phones. The results are organized based on consumer responses and examined in the light of PPM framework as well as mirrored to the established adoption literature such as the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovations framework. The findings suggest that mobile phones of any sort are increasingly switched to smartphones. The main reasons pushing people to switch mobile phones were identified as rational reasons such as dissatisfaction with reliability and advanced functionalities of the device being switched from along with external forced influences. The main reasons pulling towards attractive alternatives were identified as personal desires, advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors again along with external social influences. Additionally, brand influence and price value perceptions were pinpointed as pulling clearly towards smartphone adoption. The main elements preventing individuals from wanting to switch their mobile phones were determined as attachment to familiar advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors. In a general level, the <b>pull</b> <b>effect</b> is the strongest force leading to switching and the principal causes for this <b>pull</b> <b>effect</b> stem from associations to functional elements of the mobile phones...|$|E

Looking at adjacent counties with different AFDC separated by a state border, McKinnish (2005, 2007) finds a modest migration effect. Despite the potential for large effects, she concludes that welfare migration is probably not substantial given small existing cross-border differentials. This finding is similar to Bailey (2005), who also shows that while AFDC benefits did affect residential choice in the late 1980 s, the effects are modest for 10 % increases in benefit levels–particularly when considering most low-income single mothers migrate to their state of birth regardless of the welfare benefit generosity.|$|E

Alternative attractiveness, on the other hand, positively influences switching intentions, comprising a <b>pulling</b> <b>effect</b> that encourages subscribers to migrate to other providers. In spite of the promotional benefits offered by new service providers, Taiwanese mobile phone subscribers generally remain with their original providers. For instance, when subscribers perceive that there are no significant influences between service satisfaction and switching costs associated with different providers, what encourages subscribers to stay with their original providers is habit strength. Oftentimes, it is difficult for subscribers with strong habits to be attracted by promotions offered by alternative service providers.
