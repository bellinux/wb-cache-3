We conducted a proof-of-concept study to explore the potential to achieve targeted plant populations consistently and to reduce variability in plant spacing by sowing additional seed and thinning emerged plants. In one onion crop, replicated plots were sown at half the standard within-row plant spacing (72 mm). Eight weeks after sowing, plant spacing was recorded in each plot, and then thinned using templates that identified plants to be removed based on spacing from the last retained plant (<b>plant</b> <b>distance</b> thinning), or at fixed distances {{from the start of}} the plot (fixed distance thinning). Plant-distance thinning treatments reduced within-row spacing variability (coefficient of variation (CV) 75 % pre-thinning to 34 % post-thinning). The mean spacing (74 mm) was similar to that of the control plots (73 mm; CV 61 %). Fixed-distance thinning treatments increased the mean and CV to 115 mm and 84 % respectively. A survey of six commercial onion fields showed that they varied significantly in within-row plant spacing variance (< 0. 001). Sowing more thickly, and then thinning small-seeded crops like onions shows promise in reducing plant spacing variability, extending the existing use of this approach from crops such as lettuce where automated thinning is being developed.

Growth characteristics of all trees within the plot of each <b>planting</b> <b>distance</b> were evaluated, while physical-mechanical properties were represented by 6 selected trees of each <b>planting</b> <b>distance.</b> The results showed that growth characteristics were significantly influenced by tree spacing, while wood properties were not. The wider spacing (3 by 3 m) tends to produce bigger stem diameter, but shorter tree height, shorter clear bole height, and greater branches. Although tree spacing of 3 by 3 m is more favored by the farmers since it provides more space for agroforestry activity, such spacing is not recommended to be applied in order to produce the best timber from teak plantation...|$|R
40|$|Damage often {{occurs as}} a result of the plant. But this issue did not receive serious {{attention}} from all parties on whether the owner of the building or the maintenance. The study covers made in this thesis, the researcher would like to see how trees element can cause damage to the building elements, to investigate the damage due to plants on building surrounding in Education area and to evaluate individual awareness on the implication of plants on building elements. When trees are planted too close to a building, the roots of them are causing damages to that building in both direct and indirect ways. In many cases, these subterranean problems go unnoticed, until cracks appear on surfaces. The remedial works for such cases can be always difficult and expensive. This research was carried out to identify the causes and effects of not using the safe <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> and then it is extended with a detail survey to find safe distances using three categories of trees, which are most common in Malaysia. It was noted that the direct damages to civil structures are very common here in Malaysia. It was observed that the damage from large or matured tree like Lime, Ash and etc. is much greater than other trees. Therefore, its’ safe <b>planting</b> <b>distance</b> is around 10 meters and above. Safe <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> for Tamarind and Royal Poinciana are in a range between 6 to 7 meters. For Jack and Mango tree, it is about 4 to 5 meters. So these safe <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> has represented numerically in this report...|$|R
30|$|Under field conditions, {{the effect}} of {{different}} application rates (100 – 1000  kg ha− 1) of RP-EC with PSM and with a combination ratio of RP and compost (50 : 50  W/W), applied 7 days before sowing, on nodulation, growth and productivity of chickpea compared to control (60  kg P ha− 1 using DAP) was investigated at the University research farm. The treatments were arranged using randomized complete block design (RCBD) in triplicate. For sowing, hand drill was used to maintain row to row distance of 40  cm. After a week, plant to <b>plant</b> <b>distance</b> (30  cm) was maintained by thinning. The recommended rate of N and K (25 and 25  kg ha− 1) were applied in control using urea and sulfate of potash (SOP). Remaining N and P were applied through urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) after analysis and calculations for available N and P in treatments where RP-EC was applied. Rhizobia and PSM inoculum were prepared using standard methods as described above and were applied in all the treatments. The inoculated seeds were sown in respective plots (1.5  ×  1.5  m 2). Similar standard methods as described in pot experiments were adopted for the estimation of agronomic and yield parameters at maturity and P contents from grain and straw samples (Olsen et al. 1954; Ryan et al. 2001). Each treatment in triplicate was randomly selected using a square meter ring and plants were harvested at the flowering stage for nodulation parameters. Number of nodules plant− 1 were counted manually and their dry wt. using digital balance.|$|E
40|$|An ideal soybean {{cultivar}} is the {{one that}} achieves the greatest yield consistently across many environments regardless of environmental conditions. The objective of this experiment was to determine the soybean seed yield stability by AMMI method. A total of ten soybean genotypes, which consisted of eight soybean promising lines (G 100 H/SHRW- 60 - 38, SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 73, SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 68, SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 66, G 100 H/SHRW- 34, SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 5, SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 70, and SHRW- 60 /G 100 H- 75) and two soybean check varieties (Kaba and Wilis) was evaluated at six soybean production centers in Yogyakarta, Banyuwangi and West Nusa Tenggara during 2011. The field experimental design for each location was completely randomized design with four replicates. Each genotype was planted on 2. 4 m x 4. 5 m plot size, 40 cm x 15 cm <b>plant</b> <b>distance,</b> with 2 plants/hill. Stability analysis on seed yield was based on the AMMI method. The combined analysis showed that the genotype and GEI were highly significant for seed yield. The AMMI of the first significant interaction principal component (PC 1) accounted for 66. 07 % of the total variation. Based on AMMI 1 biplot, G 1 (G 100 H/SHRW- 60 - 38) and G 5 (G 100 H/SHRW- 34) showed higher yield stability. However, the most stable genotype (G 5) produced low yield. The other stable genotype (G 5) showed highest soybean yield, and therefore it is proposed to be released as a new improved soybean variety...|$|E
40|$|Foraging {{behavior}} of root feeding organisms strongly affects plant-environment-interactions and ecosystem processes. However, {{the impact of}} plant chemistry on root herbivore movement in the soil is poorly understood. Here, we apply a simple technique to trace the movement of soil-dwelling insects in their habitats without disturbing or restricting their interactions with host plants. We tagged the root feeding larvae of Melolontha melolontha with a copper ring and repeatedly located their position {{in relation to their}} preferred host plant, Taraxacum officinale, using a commercial metal detector. This method was validated and used to study the influence of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) on the foraging of M. melolontha. TA-G is stored in the latex of T. officinale and protects the roots from herbivory. Using behavioral arenas with TA-G deficient and control plants, we tested the impact of physical root access and <b>plant</b> <b>distance</b> on the effect of TA-G on M. melolontha. The larvae preferred TA-G deficient plants to control plants, but only when physical root contact was possible and the plants were separated by 5 cm. Melolontha melolontha showed no preference for TA-G deficient plants when the plants were grown 15 cm apart, which may indicate a trade-off between the cost of movement and the benefit of consuming less toxic food. We demonstrate that M. melolontha integrates host plant quality and distance into its foraging patterns and suggest that plant chemistry affects root herbivore behavior in a plant-density dependent manner. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Se estudiaron cuatro distancias entre surcos (1, 2, 3 y 4 m) y tres entre plantas (1, 2 Y 3 m) en un diseño de paralelas divididas. Al reducir la distancia de plantación se incrementaron la altura de planta, de floración y el rendimiento, mientras que disminuyeron el diámetro del tallo y número de hojas. No se afectaron las {{variables}} número de nudos, tiempo de trasplante a floración y cosecha, tiempo de cosecha, incidencia de virosis, número de frutos por planta y calidad. El rendimiento fue fuertemente afectado por la distancia de siembra. El mayor rendimiento (57. 1 t/ha) en un período de 2 meses se obtuvo al separar los surcos 1 m y 2 m las plantas.

Four distances between rows (1, 2, 3 and 4 m) and three between ptants (1, 2 and 3 m) were studied, using a split plot design with three repetitions. A reduction in <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> increased the height of plant, flowering and yield; however the stem diameter and leaf number decreased. Number of nodes, period of time from transplanting to flowering and harvest, harvest time, virus incidence, number of fruits per plant as well as its quality were not affected by variation on <b>planting</b> <b>distances.</b> The yield was strongly affected by <b>planting</b> <b>distances.</b> The best yield (57. 1 t/ha) over a period of harvest of 2 months was obtained with a 1 m between rows and 2 m between plants...|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{the effects of}} cultivar, row spacing and different stages of maturity on qualitative characteristics of tomato (ascorbic acid, total soluble solids (TSS), β-carotene and lycopene) have been evaluated. Experiment was performed by factorial analysis with 3 replicates in completely randomized design (CRD). First treatment was three cultivars of tomato, second treatment was four <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> and third treatment was different stages of maturity. The results showed that all treatments had significant influence on the levels of ascorbic acid, soluble solids, β-carotene and lycopene. Generally, wider spacing and deep red fruits had the highest quality.
