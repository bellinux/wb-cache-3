50|$|Some {{species may}} cause demyelinating polyneuropathies. The <b>purging</b> <b>buckthorn</b> (R. cathartica) is a {{widespread}} European native species {{used in the past}} as a purgative, though its toxicity makes this a very risky herbal medicine and it is no longer in use.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds and}} leaves are mildly {{poisonous}} {{for people and}} animals, but are readily eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. The toxins cause stomach cramps and laxative effects that may function in seed dispersal. The chemical compounds responsible for this laxative effect are anthraquinone and emodin. The species name cathartica and the common name <b>purging</b> <b>buckthorn</b> refer to this effect.|$|E
