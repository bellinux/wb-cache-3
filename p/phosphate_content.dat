2500|$|In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a {{professor}} of Botany at St John's College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin, Falkenham and Kirton and investigated their composition. Realising their potential {{as a source of}} available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources. [...] Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high <b>phosphate</b> <b>content.</b> The major area of extraction occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company. There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood. The industry declined in the 1880s but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions. A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the area of interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} artery ligation on myocardial ultrastructure, high energy <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were {{studied in the}} isolated, perfused working rat heart model. The changes in ultrastructure, mitochondrial function and high energy <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> of the ischaemic tissue were characteristic of severe ischaemic damage, showing a good correlation between ultrastructural and functional changes. To determine whether these changes could be prevented, reduced or delayed by beta-blockade, propranolol (3 x 10 - 7 and 3 x 10 - 6 M) {{was added to the}} perfusate. In our model propranolol did not exert a protective effect on the ultrastructure, tissue high energy <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> and mitochondrial oxidative function except for a significant increase in QO 2 (State 3) with propranolol at a concentration of 3 x 10 - 7 M.

40|$|The {{effects of}} chlorpromazine, an {{inhibitor}} of both Ca 2 + flux and phospholipase activity, on myocardial ultrastructure, function and metabolism were assessed during normothermic ischaemic cardiac arrest and reperfusion of the isolated working rat heart. Normothermic ischaemic cardiac arrest produced {{significant changes in}} myocardial ultrastructure, high energy <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation within 20 min. Reperfusion of untreated hearts subjected to 20 and 25 min ischaemia failed to restore mitochondrial function, mechanical activity and ATP contents to control, pre-ischaemic levels. Morphological signs of ischaemic injury regressed, especially in the subendocardial layer. Pretreatment of hearts with chlorpromazine did not prevent the ischaemia-induced changes in myocardial ultrastructure and mitochondrial function. However, during reperfusion the chlorpromazine-treated, totally ischaemic hearts (20 to 25 min) exhibited improved coronary flow rates, and ultrastructural and mechanical recovery. The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process and tissue high energy <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> were not affected by the drug. Articl...|$|R

The microorganisms used organics in the carbonaceous meteorites as the carbon source. Algae and plant cultures grew well also on Mars meteorites because of their high bio-available <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents.</b> The Martian materials achieved soil fertility ratings comparable to productive agricultural soils. This offers some data relating to terraforming of Mars.|$|R

Differences were observed in the proportions of phosphorylated isoforms of tau protein (containing four tubulin-binding motifs) present in white and grey matter. In white matter, isoforms containing four tubulin-binding motifs are mainly present in a phosphorylated form.

Post-monsoon, dry winter and monsoon field measurements showed <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> {{in the range of}} 0.09 – 0.18, 0.05 – 0.42, and 0.10 – 0.16 mg/L, respectively, indicating that between-station variation was lowest during the monsoon period.|$|R

Inorganic <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> of mesophyll cells were shown to be highly dependent on phosphate nutrition.

30|$|Jain et al. [26] have {{reported}} the dose-dependent effect of KAuCl 4 on primary root length of Arabidopsis seedling. It was {{observed that the}} treatment of the root with 10  ppm KAuCl 4 triggered a significant increase in length, but at higher concentrations (25, 50 and 100  ppm), a significant decrease occurred. Obviously, low dose of KAuCl 4 stimulates the root growth whereas higher doses inhibit it. It has been referred to the production of ROS or stress-induced antioxidants [74]. Also, at higher doses, iron is depleted and an increase in zinc and <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> occurs. As a consequence of decrease in iron content in root tips and increase in monodispersed gold nanoparticle, an increase in iron-responsive genes is triggered [26].|$|R

The treatment also re-stored myocardial ATP and creatine <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> and attenuated the decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate during reperfusion.

40|$|The {{determination}} of phosphates and polyphosphates has been effected using an hybrid electrode, {{which consists of}} a glucose oxydase enzymic membrane and a Solanum tuberosum tissue slice. This membrane, rich in acid phosphatase, catalyses the glucose- 6 -phosphate hydrolysis. This reaction is quantitatively inhibited by phosphate. Several factors involved in the electrode response, like substrate concentration, pH, ionic strength and type of buffer are discussed in detail. At a 4. 10 - 4 M glucose- 6 -phosphate concentration, the linear ranges of phosphates and polyphosphates are, respectively, 6. 10 - 5 M to 1, 6. 10 - 3 M and 3. 10 - 5 M to 1. 10 - 3 M.

40|$|Phosphatic chalks were {{deposited}} {{during the}} mid-Santonian to early Campanian between 85 Ma and 83 Ma in NE France and southern England. The beds contain abundant brown granular phosphate, largely consisting of phosphate-filled and coated foraminiferal tests, phosphatized macrofossil fragments, faecal pellets, phosphatized intraclasts and vertebrate remains. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> typically range from 5 – 20 % P 2 O 5. Beds 1 – 20 m thick occur within elongate 1 km long, 250 m wide and 30 m deep erosional basins (‘cuvettes’), {{cut into the}} underlying Coniacian–Santonian white chalks. Several superimposed cuvettes with consistent orientations may occur. Cuvettes are floored by phosphatized, bored and encrusted hardgrounds, and contain unique faunal assemblages that include ahermatypic colonial corals, and encrusting oyster and worm patches. Belemnites, fish and reptile remains are common. Extensive reworking by currents and biota occurred during the deposition of the phosphate. Gravity flow led to the dislocation and redeposition of basal hardground blocks {{and the formation of}} synsedimentary slump folds. Phosphatic chalks accumulated in water depths of between 70 m and a few hundred metres in oxic, current-swept areas of an open epicontinental sea of normal salinity. High surface productivity, moderate organic-carbon fluxes, reduced sedimentation rates and high rates of sediment mixing led to the precipitation of phosphate within hardground surfaces and carbonate grains. Bacterial decomposition of organic matter raised <b>phosphate</b> <b>contents</b> in pore waters and promoted the geochemical conditions necessary for phosphate precipitation. Phosphate precipitates, now transformed to carbonate fluorapatite, include μm-sized ovoid bodies and massive coatings interpreted to be of microbial origin. Phosphatization was a rapid process occurring under mixed aerobic/anaerobic redox conditions in the upper decimetre of the sediment column, close to the sediment–water interface. Phosphatization took place predominantly {{within the confines of the}} cuvettes, where phosphate grains became concentrated by current winnowing and transport. Phosphatic chalk sedimentation occurred on the NE and northern margins of the Anglo-Paris Basin following regressive events that enabled bottom currents to erode the cuvettes and maintain productivity and the other sedimentary conditions necessary for phosphate accumulation...|$|R

Silica and calcium sulphate were found to remain inert, while alumina consumed part of the soluble phosphate. Melilite showed it complex process of dissolution and precipitation of amorphous aluminium phosphates.
