25|$|Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises {{had seen}} a {{demonstration}} of the German Magnetophon in June 1947—the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, {{at the end of the}} war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> of high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered his Ampex company, which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.|$|E
50|$|The 737 Magnetic Core Storage Unit {{serves as}} RAM and {{provides}} 4,096 36-bit words, {{the equivalent of}} 18,432 bytes. The 727 Magnetic Tape Units store over five million six-bit characters <b>per</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
50|$|VERA {{was capable}} of {{recording}} about 15 minutes (e.g. 4,572 meters) of 405-line black-and-white video <b>per</b> <b>reel,</b> and the picture tended to wobble because the synchronizing pulses that keep the picture stable were not recorded accurately enough.|$|E
50|$|Video {{recorders}} {{were sold}} for US $50,000 in 1956, and videotapes cost US $300 <b>per</b> one-hour <b>reel.</b> However, prices gradually dropped over the years; in 1971, Sony began selling videocassette recorder (VCR) decks and tapes into the consumer market.|$|R

50|$|Many early {{videotape}} recordings {{were not}} preserved. While much less expensive (if repeatedly recycled) and more convenient than kinescope, {{the high cost}} of 3M Scotch 179 and other early videotapes ($300 <b>per</b> one-hour <b>reel)</b> meant that most broadcasters erased and reused them, and (in the United States) regarded videotape as simply a better and more cost-effective means of time-delaying broadcasts than kinescopes. It was the four time zones of the continental United States which had made the system very desirable in the first place.|$|R
50|$|Paris, je t'aime is {{the first}} feature film to be fully scanned in 6K and {{mastered}} in 4K in Europe (as opposed to the normal 2K). Encoding the image took about 24 hours <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> (at Laboratoires Éclair).|$|E
50|$|A virtual reel {{that has}} 256 virtual stops <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> would allow up to 2563 = 16,777,216 final positions. The {{manufacturer}} {{could choose to}} offer a million dollar jackpot from a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.|$|E
50|$|Disk {{images were}} {{originally}} (in the late 1960s) used for backup and disk cloning of mainframe disk media, the early ones were {{as small as}} 5 megabytes and as large as 330 megabytes, and the copy medium was magnetic tape, which ran as large as 200 megabytes <b>per</b> <b>reel.</b> Disk images became much more popular when floppy disk media became popular, where replication or storage of an exact structure was necessary and efficient, {{especially in the case}} of copy protected floppy disks.|$|E
50|$|Tibor Reel was {{established}} in 1976 and manufacturing operations moved to Florida. Based in Delray Beach, the company employs 30 people and produces approximately 4,000 <b>reels</b> <b>per</b> year. Except for the ball bearings, the machining and assembly are done at the family-owned factory. The reel was eventually renamed the Billy Pate.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} days of {{television}} until about 1958, live television was used heavily, except for filmed shows such as I Love Lucy and Gunsmoke. Although videotape was invented in 1956, it cost $300 <b>per</b> one hour <b>reel</b> (...) meaning it was only very gradually adopted. Some genres, such as soap operas, did not completely abandon live broadcasts until the mid-1970s.|$|R
50|$|The CV-2000 was {{developed}} by Sony engineer Nobutoshi Kihara. On its release, each machine cost US$695. It used 1/2 in video tape in a reel-to-reel format, meaning the tape had to be manually threaded around the helical scan video head drum. The CV-2000 was one-tenth the weight and price of other analog video recording products of its era. It recorded television programs {{in black and white}} using the skip field process, which produced a maximum 200-lines resolution. The tape moved at a speed of 7.5 inches <b>per</b> second. Each <b>reel</b> of video tape cost US$40, and could hold one hour of video. Although CV-2000 was aimed at the home market, it was mainly used in business and educational institutions.|$|R

50|$|In 1946, Jack Mullin {{brought a}} Magnetophon {{magnetic}} tape recorder back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape; the recorder {{was one of the}} {{magnetic tape recorder}}s that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5 mm tape could record 20 minutes <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> of high-quality analog audio sound; Alexander M. Poniatoff then ordered his Ampex company to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophon for use in radio production. Bing Crosby eventually adopted the technology to pre-record his radio show, which was scheduled for a certain time every week, to avoid having to perform the show live, as well as having to perform it a second time for West Coast audiences.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1923, Kansas City, Missouri, {{animator}} Walt Disney {{created a}} short film entitled Alice's Wonderland, which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. After the bankruptcy in 1923 {{of his previous}} firm, Laugh-O-Gram Studios, [...] Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother, Roy O. Disney. Film distributor Margaret J. Winkler of M.J. Winkler Productions contacted Disney with plans to distribute {{a whole series of}} Alice Comedies purchased for $1,500 <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> with Disney as a production partner. Walt and Roy Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio that same year. More animated films followed after Alice. [...] In January 1926, with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street, the Disney Brothers Studio's name was changed to the Walt Disney Studio.|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{duration}} of a vinyl album is about 2 to 3 <b>reels</b> <b>per</b> side. Classical music and spoken word recordings can extend to over 3 reels on a side. If a side exceeds the average time, the maximum groove amplitude {{is reduced to}} make room for the additional program material. This can cause hiss in the sound from lower quality amplifiers when the volume is turned up to compensate for the lower recorded level. An extreme example, Todd Rundgren's Initiation LP, with 4 reels of music on one side, has a [...] "technical note" [...] at the bottom of the inner sleeve: [...] "if the sound does not seem loud enough on your system, try re-recording the music onto tape." [...] The total of around 4 - 5 reels often influences the arrangement of tracks, with the preferred positions being the opening and closing tracks of each side.|$|R
5000|$|The helical scan VTR (the HDV-100) used {{magnetic}} tape similar to 1" [...] type C videotape for analog recording. Sony in 1988 unveiled a new HDVS digital line, including a reel-to-reel digital recording VTR (the HDD-1000) that used digital signals between the machines for dubbing but the primary I/O remained analog signals. The large unit was {{housed in a}} 1-inch reel-to-reel transport, {{and because of the}} high tape speed needed, had a limit of 1-hour <b>per</b> <b>reel.</b> Sony, owner of Columbia Pictures/Tri-Star, would start to archive feature films on this format, requiring an average of two reels per movie. There was also a portable videocassette recorder (the HDV-10) for the HDVS system, using the [...] "UniHi" [...] format of videocassette using 3/4" [...] wide tape. The transport housing similar in appearance to Sony's D1/D2 Standard Definition Digital VTRs, but recorded analog HD. The small cassette size limited recording time.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. A digital {{recorder}} which writes or reads digital data at 8 {{megabits per second}} and has a storage capacity of 84 billion bits <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> of tape is described. The packing density is in excess of I million bits per square inch on conventional one-inch magnetic tape. The high packing density and transfer rate was achieved through the combination of phase-encoded digital electronics with a helical scan video transport. The use of the helical scan technique permitted extremely efficient utilization of the tape and permitted inclusion of other features, such as high-speed search (400 ips), individually addressable records, and self-threading and cartridge-loading capability...|$|E
40|$|Building on the ArchiveLaser® project, {{which was}} {{presented}} during the 2005 IS&T Archiving Conference, the further {{developments of the}} technology {{that have taken place}} in the follow-up NOAH project will be displayed in this paper. It will present a complete system that is able to store digital data as a bit stream on long-term stable optical film (microfilm) and retrieve it afterwards with simple optical scanners. The complete workflow has been demonstrated at the CeBIT fair in Hannover, Germany, in March 2006. One of the core achievements of our research is the density of more than I Terabyte <b>per</b> <b>reel</b> of film. This data carrier enjoys all the characteristics and advantages of an optical, analog data carrier: long-term durability of up to 500 years, no manipulation or virus attacks and independence from rapidly changing soft- and hardware generations. This workflow addresses storage providers, whose data necessarily has to be stored for more than 4 years and where the to tal cost of ownership, including a solid guarantee for future accessibility to this data, is crucial...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{energy in the}} Western world has istorically {{increased}} steadily and a steady increase is forecasted for the next decades. This steady increase together with the huge merging markets in India and China are setting new standards for the energy transmission. The distribution grid will grow to support more and bigger consumers and to facilitate that an increase in transmission voltage is needed. To withstand an increased transmission voltage the radius of the cable insulation are usually increased,which has drawbacks such as shorter cable length <b>per</b> <b>reel,</b> which in turn leading to more joints. This is both time consuming and decreases the reliability since joints are weak points in the insulation system. This thesis is aimed at introducing an active species, a voltage stabiliser, in cable insulation i. e. polyethylene to improve its resistance to a degradation mechanism called electrical treeing. This is a fast degradation mechanism which has a fast lapse from initiation to material breakdown when comparing with most other degradation mechanisms present in cable insulation. If this is the limiting mechanism for the breakdown of cable isolation an increase of field strength over the insulation would be possible. The effect of voltage stabilisers have been investigated and patented, however the mechanism behind voltage stabilisation {{has not yet been}} fully understood, nor has voltage stabilisers had a commercial significance. The voltage stabilisers presented in this study have all been synthesised in our laboratory. The selection of what voltage stabiliser to be synthesised has been facilitated by estimating their molecular properties by means of quantum mechanical calculations on a large number of potential molecules. The selection criteria has followed what Ashcraft et al. suggested for a series of alternating aromatics in the late 70 :s, that the efficiency is dependent of the ionisation potential of the voltage stabiliser. The quantum mechanical calculations have been seen to correlate well to experimental data both in the literature and measurements on the actual voltage stabilisers in our own lab. The assessment of the electrical treeing was done by developing a new method more suited for the assessment of lab scaled synthesised voltage stabilisers. This new method is utilising far less material than conventional and have shown to generate easily interpreted data mainly because of its visual analysis capabilities. This thesis has shown {{that it is possible to}} increase the electrical treeing resistance in cross-linked polyethylene used for high voltage cables with up to 50 % with such small additions as 0. 4 %wt...|$|E
