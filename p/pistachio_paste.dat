40|$|Pistachio processing, such as {{production}} of pistachio butter, {{is one of}} the ways to increase the added value of pistachio. Pistachio butter is a paste containing mainly milled, roasted pistachio kernel and sugar. In this investigation, the effect of two emulsifiers (lecithin and mono-di glycerids) at three levels of 0. 0, 1. 0, 2. 0 %, on the oil leakage and the effects of BHT as an antioxidant at three levels of 0. 00, 0. 01 and 0. 02 % on the peroxide values of <b>pistachio</b> butter and <b>paste</b> after 4 months storage at 20 °C were studied. Each experiment was performed in triplicates. Rheological and organoleptic tests were performed on the finished products. The results were statistically analyzed by a completely randomized Design and by making comparisons between the means via multiple range Duncan's test (P &lt; 0. 05). Roasting of the pistachios at 110 °C for 15 min was the best condition as determined by taste panelists. Moreover, addition of 15 - 25 % of sugar in butter formula, received the best score by the panelists. The results of organoleptic tests showed that the sample containing lecithin and mono-diglycerides had the least leakage of oil. Based on the results, pistachio butter produced in this investigation received higher score in terms of flavor and texture than industrial pistachio butter in the market. Results also showed that addition of BHT had a significant effect on shelf life of pistachio butter. Rheological experiments showed that pistachio butter produced in this investigation was 1. 5 times softer than its industrial counterpart. The results indicated that the best formula for {{production of}} pistachio butter was 72. 99 - 82. 99 % roasted pistachio kernels, 15 - 25 % sugar, 1 % lecithin, 1 % mono di glyceride and 0. 01 % BHT...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{roasting}} {{conditions on}} hardness, moisture content and colour of pistachio kernels Abstract: Roasting of whole-kernels {{is an important}} step in the production of <b>pistachio</b> <b>paste.</b> The effect of hot air roasting temperatures (90 - 190 °C) and times (5 - 65 min) on the hardness, moisture content and colour attributes (‘L’, ‘a ’ and ‘b ’ values and yellowness index) of both whole-kernel and ground-state were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Increases in roasting temperature and time caused a decrease in all the responses except for ‘a ’ value of ground-state. The interaction and quadratic models sufficiently described the changes in the hardness and colour values, respectively. The result of RSM analysis showed that hardness and colour attributes (‘L ’ and ‘b ’ values, yellowness index) of kernels and ‘a ’ value of ground-state could be used to monitor the roasting quality of whole-kernels. This study showed that the recommended range of roasting temperature and time of whole-kernel for the production of <b>pistachio</b> <b>paste</b> were 130 - 140 °C and 30 - 40 min, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Pistachio nut (Pistacia vera L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} delicious and nutritious nuts in the world. In order to {{increase}} the added value of the pistachio nuts, it is necessary to develop new products to meet consumer needs. This is the first paper on pistachio halva. The product was developed using <b>pistachio</b> <b>paste</b> (as main ingredient), mixture of sugar-glucose, egg white and citric acid. The effect of soapwort root extract (from saponaria officinalis) and Glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza glabra) as whitening and emulsifying agent in three levels (0. 00, 0. 10, and 0. 15 %) on the oil separation, consumer acceptance, and texture of pistachio halva was investigated. Sensory evaluation was carried out after 4 months storage at 20 ± 2 °C. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between samples with and without soapwort and glycyrrhizin. The oil separation (R = 0. 595, P= 0. 001), from halva were moderately correlated to the hardness. The sensory texture of halva was negatively correlated to the hardness (R =- 0. 694, P = 0. 000) and oil separation (R =- 0. 730, P = 0. 000). The sensory color (R = 0. 652, P = 0. 000) of halva was moderately correlated to the a-value. It is recommended that mixture of 0. 10 % soapwort root extract and 0. 10 % commercial Glycyrrhizin be used for the pistachio halva production. Using combination of soapwort root extract and Glycyrrhizin in the formulation of pistachio halva prevents oil separation from the product and increases its consumer acceptance. Development of pistachio halva would potentially increase the food uses of nuts and introduce consumers with a healthier non-animal snack food...|$|E
