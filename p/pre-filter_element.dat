50|$|The word caisson is {{also used}} as a name for an {{airtight}} housing for ventilation filters in facilities that handle hazardous materials. The housing usually has an upstream compartment for a <b>pre-filter</b> <b>element</b> and a downstream compartment for a high-efficiency filter element. It may have multiple sets of compartments. The housing has gasketed access doors {{to allow for the}} change out of the filter elements. The housing is usually equipped with connection points used to test the efficiency of the filters and monitor changes in the differential pressure across the filter media.|$|E

The {{results of these}} analyses indicate that overall there is light to moderate solids fouling of both the coalescer and <b>pre-filter</b> <b>elements.</b> The majority of the solids contain aluminum, sodium, silicon, and titanium, in oxide and/or hydroxide forms that we have noted before. The titanium is presumably precipitated from leached, dissolved monosodium titanate (MST) or fines from MST at ARP, and the quantity we find is significantly greater than in the past. A parallel report discusses potential causes for the increased leaching rate of MST, showing that increases in free hydroxide concentration of the feed solutions and of chemical cleaning solutions lead to faster leaching of titanium...|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago {{physical}} processes could only remove suspended solids from a water stream. Recent advances in technology now allow the removal of selected molecules and ions from a water stream by physical means using membranes. The membrane process has recently become very efficient and economically feasible for many industrial, commercial, municipal and even residential customers. Because of the infinitesimally small entities dealt with in this technology, blinding of the membrane surface becomes a chronic problem. To maintain the efficiency of this technology, pre-treatment must remove the greater bulk of the suspended solids to allow the membranes to efficiently remove selected dissolved solids. Five-micron bag and cartridge pre-filters have traditionally been used to treat the influent to membrane systems. The inherent nature of the <b>elements</b> in these <b>pre-filters</b> has restricted them to one-time use then being discarded and replaced by new elements. Under many conditions these <b>pre-filter</b> <b>elements</b> may be useful {{only for a few}} hours before replacement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{the nature}} of the {{material}} that goes into their composition the filter media include: pulverous, fibrous, fabric filters and filter membrans. pulverous filter media consist of diatomite (kieselguhr as a heat-treated diatomite), perlite or mixtures shall be deposited by alluvial and alluvial <b>pre-filter</b> <b>elements</b> on the surface. Filter media are crossed by a system of channels, random shapes with very small diameters, separated by a solid skeleton. Filtering {{is one of the oldest}} methods of clarifying wines but as improving the porous filter media, filtering technology has become an important method to stabilize wines (Serrano and Paetzold, 1994). Depending on porosity membranes, filtering can also ensure the microbiological stabilization of wine. Passing through the membrane does not affect wine quality, giving them the opportunity for reuse. Filtering ensures good stability and clarity of wines. Wine clarification by sedimentation during unduly prolonged technology and filtering ensures rapid separation (streaming) of wine. When filtering wine through porous layers, the particles in suspension to be involved in yeast sediment deposited in the bottom of the container and which could have a favorable role on wine olfacto-taste) may be retained on the surface or depth filter layer so that wine passing through filter surface should not affect its sensory qualities...|$|R
