40|$|Orthogonally protected, N-hydroxylated, linear tri- and tetra-amines were {{efficiently}} synthesised on Merrifield resin, {{which was}} modified with a <b>phenethyl</b> <b>bromide</b> linker. The polyamine frameworks were convergently prepared from the centre with reductive aminations and nucleophilic substitutions to elongate the polyamine backbone. The required N-hydroxy groups were introduced during the cleavage of the polyamine derivatives from the resin through Cope elimination...|$|E

They are classified into two subtypes, sigma 1 and sigma 2, both of which have unique characteristics. Sigma receptors in the central nervous system are thought to be involved in disorders such as psychoses, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. A number of human tumors also show high densities of sigma receptors. In this study, three novel compounds were synthesized with the intent of characterizing how their structural differences affect affinity for the sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors. We investigated derivatives of a potent sigma 1 selective agonist, 1 -(3 ', 4 '-dimethoxyphenethyl) - 4 -(3 ''-phenyl propyl) piperazine, developed by Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Specifically, the 4 '-methoxy moiety was replaced by benzyloxy, phenethyloxy and 3 -phenylpropyloxy substituents. These were prepared by reaction of the corresponding 4 '-phenol with base and treatment with <b>phenethyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> 3 -phenylpropyl bromide or benzyl bromide. For the phenethyl and 3 -phenylpropyl derivatives, a mixture of 40 % KOH and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (1 M in MeOH) was used as the base. Column chromatography provided these target compounds in 81 - 94 % purified yields. The benzyl derivative proved difficult to obtain using this procedure, and different conditions were used to synthesize this compound. The 4 '-phenol was reacted with benzyl bromide and potassium carbonate in ethanol to give the benzyl ether in 35 % yield after purification by column chromatography. All three compounds were characterized by 1 H NMR, and were analyzed by elemental analysis and HPLC. Currently, competition receptor binding studies are being run on the synthesized compounds to measure their affinities for sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors. NSF-REU/NIH Program in Radiochemistr...|$|E
