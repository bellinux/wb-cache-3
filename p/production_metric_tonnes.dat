40|$|Agricultural biomass {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a clean and renewable energy source, with increasing potential to replace conventional fossil fuels in the energy market. Uganda, like other developing countries, has a high dependency (91 %) on wood fuel, leading to environmental degradation. With a coffee <b>production</b> of 233 <b>Metric</b> <b>Tonnes</b> per annum, relating to 46. 6 Mega Tonnes of coffee husks from processing, transforming these husks into syngas through gasification can contribute to resolving the existing energy challenges. The objective {{of this article is}} to briefly review the energy potential of coffee husks through gasification, and how the gasification process could increase energy recoveries for coffee farmers. Previous Â findings indicate that the 46. 6 Mega Tonnes per year of coffee husks generated in Uganda, with a heating value of 18. 34 MJ/kg, is capable of generating 24 GWh of energy. This will address a 0. 7 % portion of the energy situation in Uganda, while protecting the environment...|$|R
