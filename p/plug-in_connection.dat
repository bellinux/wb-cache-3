40|$|Abstract. A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a {{local area}} network or other small network that does not require fixed infraestructure and consist of {{wireless}} or <b>plug-in</b> <b>connections.</b> In this kind of networks, mobility is a critical factor because mobile nodes need to communicate with other mobile nodes {{that are not in}} direct range, then these nodes must communicate via intermediary mobile nodes. Considering the high degree of mobility in these networks, the task of finding paths between the communication end points is really a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid routing scheme which combines both Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Multi-Agent System (MAS) techniques in order to provide high connectivity of nodes and reduce route discovery latency and the end-to-end delay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” The plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle allows vehicle propulsion from multiple internal power sources. Electric en-ergy from the grid can be utilized by means of the <b>plug-in</b> <b>connection.</b> An on-line energy management (EM) strategy is proposed to minimize the costs for taking energy from each power source. Especially in a dynamical energy market, an on-line optimization algorithm is desirable since energy prices change over time. By construction, the proposed EM system can operate with, and without prediction information. If predictions are available, an electronic horizon is applied to anticipate on up-coming events and further optimize the strategy. Illustrative examples are given to explain the added value for both solutions. Also the situation where energy is transferred back to the grid is considered. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the new agent framework XJAF and its application on distributed library catalogues. The framework {{is based on}} the Java EE technology and uses the concept of the plug-ins for implementation of the basic framework components. One important plug-in of the agent framework has been introduced into this system: the inter-facilitator <b>connection</b> <b>plug-in,</b> which defines how multiple facilitators form an agent network. The inter-facilitator <b>connection</b> <b>plug-in</b> is particularly important in both design and implementation phases in the field of distributed library catalogues. In order to substantiate the above statement, the framework has been used for implementation of the agent-based central catalogue of the library information system BISIS. Also, the framework has been used to implement the agent-based metadata harvesting system for the networked digital library of theses and dissertations (NDLTD). Both systems have been implemented at the University of Novi Sad...|$|R
40|$|Most {{mains-operated}} {{equipment in}} use today {{is connected to the}} supply via plugs and sockets. These are generally acceptable in benign environments but can be unsafe or have limited life in the presence of moisture. In explosive atmospheres and in under-sea applications special connectors must be used. This paper describes a technique, the Contactless Energy Transfer System (CETS), by which electrical energy may be transmitted, without electrical connection or physical contact, through non-magnetic media of low conductivity. CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10 mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables <b>plug-in</b> power <b>connections</b> to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, short-circuiting or sparking. Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured "plug and socket" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load even when there is relative motion. Load-source voltage matching may be made inherent to the system...|$|R
30|$|The {{downside}} {{of the new}} architecture is a tighter coupling with the BI server interfaces compared to the previous solution, which abstracted out the BI server interfaces behind more generic application server interfaces. The previous solution had a BI server agnostic interface in the application server that would allow jUCMNav to connect to any BI server. However, we believe that, with the plug-in based architecture of the new solution, one can write a plug-in adapter for each different BI server. So far, we have developed only one BI <b>connection</b> <b>plug-in</b> for IBM Cognos BI (IBM [2012]), which is the BI server we are using for our experiments.|$|R
40|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles {{will soon be}} connected to residential distribution networks in high quantities and will add to already overburdened residential feeders. However, as battery technology improves, plug-in {{electric vehicles}} will {{also be able to}} support networks as small distributed generation units by transferring the energy stored in their battery into the grid. Even though the increase in the <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicle <b>connection</b> is gradual, their connection points and charging/discharging levels are random. Therefore, such single-phase bidirectional power flows can have an adverse effect on the voltage unbalance of a three-phase distribution network. In this article, a voltage unbalance sensitivity analysis based on charging/discharging levels and the <b>connection</b> point of <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicles in a residential low-voltage distribution network is presented. Due to the many uncertainties in plug-in electric vehicle ratings and connection points and the network load, a Monte Carlo-based stochastic analysis is developed to predict voltage unbalance in the network in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles. A failure index is introduced to demonstrate the probability of non-standard voltage unbalance in the network due to plug-in electric vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the integration of}} plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in micro-grids. Extending a theoretical framework for mobile storage connection, the economic analysis here turns to the interactions of commuters and their driving behavior with office buildings. An illustrative example for a real office building is reported. The chosen system includes solar thermal, photovoltaic, {{combined heat and power}} generation as well as an array of plug-in electric vehicles with a combined aggregated capaci-ty of 864 kWh. With the benefit-sharing mechanism proposed here and idea-lized circumstances, estimated cost savings of 5 % are possible. Different pricing schemes were applied which include flat rates, demand charges, as well as hourly variable final customer tariffs and their effects on the operation of intermittent storage were revealed and examined in detail. Because the <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicle <b>connection</b> coincides with peak heat and electricity loads as well as solar radiation, it is possible to shift energy demand as desired in order to realize cost savings.

40|$|Abstract Background Since its inception, {{proteomics}} {{has essentially}} operated in a discovery mode {{with the goal}} of identifying and quantifying the maximal number of proteins in a sample. Increasingly, proteomic measurements are also supporting hypothesis-driven studies, in which a predetermined set of proteins is consistently detected and quantified in multiple samples. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a targeted mass spectrometric technique that supports the detection and quantification of specific proteins in complex samples at high sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, we describe ATAQS, an integrated software platform that supports all stages of targeted, SRM-based proteomics experiments including target selection, transition optimization and post acquisition data analysis. This software will significantly facilitate the use of targeted proteomic techniques and contribute to the generation of highly sensitive, reproducible and complete datasets that are particularly critical for the discovery and validation of targets in hypothesis-driven studies in systems biology. Result We introduce a new open source software pipeline, ATAQS (Automated and Targeted Analysis with Quantitative SRM), which consists of a number of modules that collectively support the SRM assay development workflow for targeted proteomic experiments (project management and generation of protein, peptide and transitions and the validation of peptide detection by SRM). ATAQS provides a flexible pipeline for end-users by allowing the workflow to start or end at any point of the pipeline, and for computational biologists, by enabling the easy extension of java algorithm classes for their own algorithm <b>plug-in</b> or <b>connection</b> via an external web site. This integrated system supports all steps in a SRM-based experiment and provides a user-friendly GUI that can be run by any operating system that allows the installation of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Conclusions Targeted proteomics via SRM is a powerful new technique that enables the reproducible and accurate identification and quantification of sets of proteins of interest. ATAQS is the first open-source software that supports all steps of the targeted proteomics workflow. ATAQS also provides software API (Application Program Interface) documentation that enables the addition of new algorithms to each of the workflow steps.

40|$|The {{trend of}} {{industrial}} networks including critical infrastructures {{to rely upon}} ubiquitous computing and the realtime collaboration of many devices, demand for more sophisticated security concepts for future electronic systems. Office- IT systems have a high dynamic and IT-security concerns can easily be implemented within the regular lifecycle. Industrial networks {{on the other hand}} undergo less change and have longer operational time, which makes them more vulnerable to security threats due to outdated hard- and software. With Ethernet and IP based protocols, as omnipresent communication technologies in industrial networks, IT-security is becoming a mandatory aspect since security considerations have not been taken into account during the initial production of many legacy systems. In this paper a concept for embedded plug-in devices is presented which secures the authenticity and integrity of communication flows between communicating network parties in such systems. An adjusted signature based Diffie-Hellman key exchange, utilizing a Trusted Platform Module, is used to establish a trusthworthy secure <b>connection</b> between embedded <b>plug-in</b> devices. The <b>connection</b> uses a message authentication mechanism for IP based protocols through an adapted HMAC employment without neglecting the safety aspect imperative for industrial networks. A key focus of the development is to strengthen the communication infrastructure between embedded plug-in devices whilst retaining especially the necessary realtime capabilities. Possible attack vectors and errors are discussed to argue that the developed mechanisms are secure in compliance with both: safety and security...|$|R
40|$|The CORBA-based Simulator was a Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) {{project that}} applied {{simulation}} techniques to explore critical questions about distributed control architecture. The simulator project used a three-prong approach comprised {{of a study}} of object-oriented distribution tools, computer network modeling, and simulation of key control system scenarios. This summary report highlights {{the findings of the}} team and provides the architectural context of the study. For the last several years LLNL has been developing the Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS), which is an abstract object-oriented software framework for constructing distributed systems. The framework is capable of implementing large event-driven control systems for mission-critical facilities such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Tools developed in this project were applied to the NIF example architecture in order to gain experience with a complex system and derive immediate benefits from this LDRD. The ICCS integrates data acquisition and control hardware with a supervisory system, and reduces the amount of new coding and testing necessary by providing prebuilt components that can be reused and extended to accommodate specific additional requirements. The framework integrates control point hardware with a supervisory system by providing the services needed for distributed control such as database persistence, system start-up and configuration, graphical user interface, status monitoring, event logging, scripting language, alert management, and access control. The design is interoperable among computers of different kinds and provides <b>plug-in</b> software <b>connections</b> by leveraging a common object request brokering architecture (CORBA) to transparently distribute software objects across the network of computers. Because object broker distribution applied to control systems is relatively new and its inherent performance is roughly threefold less than traditional point-to-point communications, CORBA presented a certain risk to designers. This LDRD thus evaluated CORBA to determine its performance and scaling properties and to optimize its use within the ICCS. Both UNIX (Sun Solaris) and real-time (Wind River VxWorks) operating systems were studied. Performance of ICCS deployment was estimated by measuring software prototypes on a distributed computer testbed and then scaled to the desired operating regime by discrete-event simulation techniques. A study of CORBA protocols continues to guide software optimization as NIF software is being implemented and tested. The message-driven nature of distributed control places heavy demands on computers and network switches, so a complementary simulation of network architectures for several protocols was undertaken using a network modeling tool (OPNET Modeler). Additional workflow simulations were developed in a general simulation tool (Simprocess) to assess system behavior of high-stress operational scenarios. Understanding the risks and decisions that trade-off in designing the framework and supporting hardware architecture was enhanced by a concurrent program of simulation and prototype validation of the ICCS applied to the NIF example...|$|R
