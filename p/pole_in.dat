5|$|In summary, {{the desired}} line L1 {{is defined by}} two points: the radical center G of the three given circles and the <b>pole</b> <b>in</b> C1 {{of one of the}} four lines {{connecting}} the homothetic centers. Finding the same <b>pole</b> <b>in</b> C2 and C3 gives L2 and L3, respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which one pair of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line L'k does not intersect its circle C'k for some k, there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.|$|E

5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South <b>Pole</b> <b>in</b> 1911.

From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North <b>Pole.</b> <b>In</b> the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
40|$|For a {{physical}} field theory, the tree-level amplitudes should possess only single poles. However, when computing amplitudes with Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulation, individual {{terms in the}} intermediate steps will contribute higher-order <b>poles.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we investigate the cancelation of higher-order <b>poles</b> <b>in</b> CHY formula with Pfaffian as the building block. We develop a diagrammatic rule for expanding the reduced Pfaffian. Then by organizing diagrams in appropriate groups and applying the cross-ratio identities, we show that all potential contributions to higher-order <b>poles</b> <b>in</b> the reduced Pfaffian are canceled out, i. e., only single <b>poles</b> survive <b>in</b> Yang-Mills theory and gravity. Furthermore, we show the cancelations of higher-order <b>poles</b> <b>in</b> other field theories by introducing appropriate truncations, based on the single pole structure of Pfaffian.

5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the <b>pole.</b> <b>In</b> January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
