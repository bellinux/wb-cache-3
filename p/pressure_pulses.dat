40|$|Abstract: The flows sudden-shrink and sudden-enlarge when passing {{orifice plate}} and {{streamlines}} dramatically changes. All these lead to flow velocity’s pulse, {{which leads to}} <b>pressure’s</b> <b>pulse.</b> The <b>pressure’s</b> <b>pulse</b> of flow {{in the vicinity of}} orifice plate is decided by orifice’s geometry. The characteristics of flow <b>pressure</b> <b>pulse</b> in the vicinity of orifice plate and its effects on cavications characteristics are researched in this paper. The researches results show that flow <b>pressure’s</b> <b>pulse</b> around orifice plate have two peak values: one is at the front of orifice; the other is at the vicinity of water’s reattachment point, the latter’s pulse amplitude is larger than the former’s.

50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative <b>pressure</b> <b>pulses</b> in the exhaust system at engine idle.

This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump.
