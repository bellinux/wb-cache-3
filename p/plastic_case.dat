5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.|$|E

25|$|The Platinum Koala {{never reached}} the {{popularity}} of the American Platinum Eagle, mostly because it has not been advertised in the US. Like most investment platinum coins, Platinum Koalas are sealed in a protective <b>plastic</b> <b>case.</b> The coins are sold at prices that reflect the current price of platinum, and not at the face value printed on the coin. Since November 1986, the Perth Mint has used more than 18 tonnes of platinum for minting. About 85% of the coins were sold abroad making the Gold Corporation (owner of the Mint) one of Australia's top 30 export earners.|$|E
25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} microphone in the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates. A waterproof version was used on nearly all U.S. Navy ships. Shure also designed the T-30 Throat Microphone for flight crews. A cloth strap held the T-30 against the throat, capturing the user's voice box vibrations directly and avoiding the background noise of the airplane. Shure also manufactured specialized headsets and the MC-1 oxygen mask microphone. In yet another example of the widespread use of Shure microphones by the U.S. military, U.S. lookout Private Lockhard used a Shure 700A microphone to announce his sighting of Japanese planes approaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of On December 7, 1941.|$|E

500|$|After the war, sales {{went from}} 800,000 {{a year to}} over one million. The French and German editions re-entered production, and new editions for Spain, Greece, Finland and Israel were first produced. By the late 1950s, Parker Brothers printed only game sets with board, pieces and {{materials}} housed in a single white box. Several copies of this edition were exhibited at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959. All of them were stolen from the exhibit. In the early 1960s, [...] "Monopoly happenings" [...] began to occur, mostly marathon game sessions, which were recognized by a Monopoly Marathon Records Documentation Committee in New York City. In addition to marathon sessions, games were played on large indoor and outdoor boards, within backyard pits, on the ceiling in a University of Michigan dormitory room, and underwater. In 1965, a 30th anniversary set was produced in a special <b>plastic</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Alum's {{antiperspirant}} and {{antibacterial properties}} contribute to its traditional {{use as an}} underarm deodorant.

50|$|The {{company was}} noted {{in its early}} days for {{releases}} in big cardboard boxes that opened like a book, colored in black, with cast credits on the inside. Some early releases under the Warner Home Video name also used this design. In early 1981, the company switched to <b>plastic</b> clamshell <b>cases,</b> with a multicolor design, with a few releases using the cardboard boxes and the multicolor designs, and to cardboard sleeves in 1985 for packaging, eliminating <b>plastic</b> <b>cases</b> by 1986. In the mid 1990s, the studio revived the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>cases</b> {{for a handful of}} releases from Warner Bros. Family Entertainment.|$|R

2500|$|... "Open-fit" [...] or [...] "over-the-ear" [...] (OTE) {{hearing aids}} are small behind-the-ear type devices. This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on the ear canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves the ear canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting {{in the middle of the}} ear canal space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the ear canal. Inside the ear canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical {{cartridge}} respirators use a cartridge {{to remove}} gases, {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or chemisorption. [...] A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> containing from 25 to 40nbsp&grams of sorption media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. [...] The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. [...] When filter cartridges become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.|$|E

2500|$|At the game's release, Epic Games {{released}} a Limited Collectors Edition. Some of the notable differences are a steel case {{instead of the}} regular <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> and an extra disc which contains artworks of environments and stages including Locust that {{never made it to}} the game, and extra content and behind footage of the making of Gears of War. The disc also contains a time-lapse on the creation of the [...] "Emergence" [...] mural. The game's disc and case has a different cover and instead features the Omen background. Another of the Collector's Edition extras is a book titled Destroyed Beauty which illustrates the game's back-story and includes concepts, sketches, and descriptions of the game's characters. The Collector's Edition also includes the same instruction manual and 48-hour Xbox Live Gold trial as the regular game does.|$|E

2500|$|A paper card {{version of}} the MP Handy Guide was {{published}} with folded card sliders for the war effort {{under the auspices of}} the UK Ministry of Defence during World War II and was intended for use by people knitting gloves, socks and balaclavas for the troops. In the 1960s, The Aero Needles Group Plc of Redditch, England produced the Knitters Companion, a pocket {{version of the}} complex counter, consisting of a pierced bar of black plastic containing seven knurled, white, rotary, numbered discs whose numbers would appear through the piercings in the bar. [...] As in the MP Handy Guide, the numbers were labelled Increase, Decrease, Rows and Times. It was supplied with a soft <b>plastic</b> <b>case</b> which was intended to maintain memory of the count by preventing accidental movement of the discs. In 1972, UK magazine Woman's Weekly gave away its own card variation of this, with the numbers on dials with rotary paper pointers to record rows, increases or decreases, and times. Like the MP Handy Guide it incorporated a small inch-ruler and needle gauge, but now added a tension gauge measure and centimetre ruler.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Apple {{introduced}} its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent <b>plastic</b> <b>case,</b> originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, {{is considered an}} industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports. It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic {{was applied to the}} Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's [...] "four-square product matrix" [...] (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals). More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September, and by October proved to be a large success.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{original}} form, iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent <b>plastic</b> <b>case,</b> which was refreshed early {{on with a}} sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only {{up and down on}} a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of iMac was announced in October 2012, with the [...] version released in November and the [...] version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.|$|E
