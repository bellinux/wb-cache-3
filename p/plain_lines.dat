60|$|Here {{our advice}} is simple but positive. Shopping {{should never be}} done over the {{telephone}} or by telegraph. The good housekeeper instead of telegraphing for his food will insist on seeing his food himself, and will eat nothing {{that he does not}} first see before eating. This is a cardinal rule. For the moment, then, the range must be turned low while our housekeeper sallies forth to devote himself to his breakfast shopping. The best costume for shopping is a simple but effective suit, cut in <b>plain</b> <b>lines,</b> either square or crosswise, and buttoned wherever there are button-holes. A simple hat of some dark material may be worn together with plain boots drawn up well over the socks and either laced or left unlaced. No harm is done if a touch of colour is added by carrying a geranium in the hand. We are now ready for the street.|$|E

6000|$|All {{this must}} be said to prepare the more fastidious modern for these papers, if he has never read them before. But when all this has been said there remains in them exactly what always remains in Dickens when you have taken away {{everything}} {{that can be taken}} away by the most fastidious modern who ever dissected his grandmother. There remains that primum mobile of which all the mystics have spoken: energy, the power to create. I will not call it [...] "the will to live," [...] for that is a priggish phrase of German professors. Even German professors, I suppose, have the will to live. But Dickens had exactly what German professors have not: he had the power to live. And indeed it is most valuable to have these early specimens of the Dickens work if only because they are specimens of his spirit apart from his matured intelligence. It is well to be able to realise that contact with the Dickens world is almost like a physical contact; it is like stepping suddenly into the hot smells of a greenhouse, or into the bleak smell of the sea. We know that we are there. Let any one read, for instance, one of the foolish but amusing farces in Dickens's first volume. Let him read, for instance, such a story as that of Horatio Sparkins or that of The Tuggses at Ramsgate. He will not find very much of that verbal felicity or fantastic irony that Dickens afterwards developed; the incidents are upon the <b>plain</b> <b>lines</b> of the stock comedy of the day: sharpers who entrap simpletons, spinsters who angle for husbands, youths who try to look Byronic and only look foolish. Yet there is something in these stories which there is not in the ordinary stock comedies of that day: an indefinable flavour of emphasis and richness, a hint as of infinity of fun. Doubtless, for instance, a million comic writers of that epoch had made game of the dark, romantic young man who pretended to abysses of philosophy and despair. And {{it is not easy to}} say exactly why we feel that the few metaphysical remarks of Mr. Horatio Sparkins are in some way really much funnier than any of those old stock jokes. It is in a certain quality of deep enjoyment in the writer as well as the reader; as if the few words written had been dipped in dark nonsense and were, as it were, reeking with derision. [...] "Because if Effect be the result of Cause and Cause be the Precursor of Effect," [...] said Mr. Horatio Sparkins, [...] "I apprehend that you are wrong." [...] Nobody can get at the real secret of sentences like that; sentences which were afterwards strewed with reckless liberality over the conversation of Dick Swiveller or Mr. Mantalini, Sim Tappertit or Mr. Pecksniff. Though the joke seems most superficial one has only to read it a certain number of times to see that it is most subtle. The joke does not lie in Mr. Sparkins merely using long words, any more than the joke lies merely in Mr. Swiveller drinking, or in Mr. Mantalini deceiving his wife. It is something in the arrangement of the words; something in a last inspired turn of absurdity given to a sentence. In spite of everything Horatio Sparkins is funny. We cannot tell why he is funny. When we know why he is funny we shall know why Dickens is great.|$|E

50|$|Sion Mills {{was laid}} out as a model linen village by the Herdman brothers, James, John and George. In 1835 they {{converted}} an old flour mill on the River Mourne into a flax spinning mill, and erected a bigger mill behind it in the 1850s. However, nearly everything in Sion Mills today was designed later, in the 1880s and 1890s, by James Herdman's son-in-law, the English architect William Frederick Unsworth. Sion House, a half timbered Elizabethan style mansion originally built in the early 1840s, was largely remodelled and expanded in the 1880s by Unsworth, {{around the same time}} as he was designing the first Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon (this theatre was destroyed by a fire in 1926). More modest half timbered buildings include the gatehouse, the Recreation Hall and Old St. Saviour's Church. Unsworth based his design for the polychrome Anglican church, the Church of the Good Shepherd (1909), on a church in Pistoia in Tuscany. This church is built in an Italian neo-Romanesque style. By contrast, the modern Church of St Teresa (1963, by Patrick Haughey), the Catholic place of worship, is admirable for its severely <b>plain</b> <b>lines</b> - a long rectangle with a striking representation of the Last Supper on the slate facade.

40|$|Left {{visuospatial}} neglect after {{right hemisphere}} damage is a lateralised disorder of spatial perception and cognition. A study is reported {{of the extent}} to which patients with left visuospatial neglect are susceptible to the illusory effects normally elicited by Muller-Lyer figures, in which inducing fins are located on one end or on both ends of a horizontal line. Seven patients with left visuospatial neglect and seven normal controls were tested on a task of horizontal-line bisection in which stimuli consisted of <b>plain</b> <b>lines</b> of three lengths (100, 150, and 200 mm), randomly interleaved with lines with unilateral or bilateral fins. As a group, normals made accurate bisection judgments in the baseline (no-fins) condition, and exhibited significant illusory effects in both the unilateral-fin and the bilateral-fin conditions. In contrast, patients made substantial rightward errors in the baseline condition, consistent with their neglect of the left end of the line. However, as a group, patients still exhibited significant illusory effects with left-sided outward-projecting fins on 100 mm lines and with left-sided inward-projecting fins on 150 mm lines. Moreover, at least one patient exhibited consistent illusory effects both for inward-projecting and for outward-projecting left-sided fins at all line lengths. Normal illusory effects in patients were also obtained with stimuli containing unilateral right-sided and bilateral fins. The existence of such effects with inducing elements on the contralesional extremity of horizontal line stimuli suggests preservation of low-level, perhaps preattentive, perceptual mechanisms responsible for coding elementary visual features. The results may be relevant for an understanding of the influence of attentional factors on illusory perception...|$|E

40|$|During {{the shift}} from the rule of Joseph Stalin to that of Nikita Khrushchev, people in the Soviet Union {{witnessed}} dramatic political, economic, and social changes, evident even in such private aspects of life as residential home interiors. The major architectural style of Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s era, known as Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s Empire Style, was characterized by grandeur and rich embellishments. The buildings 2 ̆ 7 interiors were similarly grandiose and ornate. By endorsing this kind of design, Stalin attempted to position himself as an heir of classical traditions, to encourage respect for his regime, and to signal his power. When Nikita Khrushchev became the country 2 ̆ 7 s leader shortly after Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s death in 1953, he proclaimed that 2 ̆ 2 excessive decorations 2 ̆ 2 were not only unnecessary, but harmful. As a result, the standardized panel buildings produced at his initiative were defined by straight, <b>plain</b> <b>lines,</b> and were devoid of literally any architectural details that were not considered functional. These changes in Soviet architecture were reflected in interior design and furnishings: the minimalist aesthetic became their defining characteristic. The {{purpose of this study}} is to gain, through examination of existing literature, new insight into why a transition to a minimalist aesthetic was happening in the 1950 s and 1960 s in Soviet urban interior design. To achieve this goal, the present thesis analyzes works by contemporary scholars on the subject and examines statements the Soviet government as well as Soviet architects and interior decoration specialists made regarding the state 2 ̆ 7 s views on architecture and interiors during the period of 1950 - 1960. While research has been published that explores some aspects of this stylistic transition, the present work is unique in that it identifies and focuses on three distinct reasons for the change to minimalism in Soviet urban residential interiors under Khrushchev: the deficit of apartment space, reduction of construction costs, and ideological motives...|$|E
