5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the <b>projections</b> <b>for</b> both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|There was {{controversy}} over {{the high cost of}} the line as a whole.

No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, Capcom {{announced}} they expected {{the game to}} sell 7 million copies {{by the end of}} the 2012 fiscal year, however the company lowered their expectations to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception. Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial <b>projections</b> <b>for</b> the fiscal year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.|$|E
5|$|The traffic <b>projections</b> <b>for</b> {{the bridge}} at the {{planning}} stage {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Strange earned $32.6 {{million on}} its opening {{day in the}} United States and Canada, {{including}} Thursday previews, with a total weekend gross of $85.1 million; IMAX contributed $12.2 million to the opening weekend gross, with 3D contributing $24 million. The film was the number one film for the weekend, and became the second largest opening in November for Disney. Initial <b>projections</b> <b>for</b> the film in late August 2016 had it earning as low as $50 million to as high as $88 million in its opening weekend, with projections revised to $65–75 million closer to the film's release. Doctor Strange remained the top film in its second weekend, and fell to second in its third, behind Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. In its fourth weekend, Doctor Strange was the third highest-grossing film, behind Fantastic Beasts and Moana. It fell to fifth in its fifth and sixth weekends, and by its seventh weekend had fallen to the ninth-highest-grossing place. It was projected to earn $255 million for its total domestic gross.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. <b>Projections</b> <b>for</b> the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior.
