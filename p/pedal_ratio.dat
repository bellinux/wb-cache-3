50|$|Brakes {{were also}} changed, {{with the front}} brakes {{increasing}} in diameter from 280 mm to 325 mm two pot calipers, and changes {{had been made to}} the brake booster calibration, brake bias and <b>pedal</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Liberty was {{relatively}} unchanged from the 2008 models {{with the exception}} of stiffer rear axle shafts and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, steering gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake <b>pedal</b> <b>ratio.</b> The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on brake pedal design of Formula Student vehicle. The first part of thesis {{is focused on}} main parts of carâ€™s brake systems. Main goal of thesis is to determine value of <b>pedal</b> <b>ratio</b> to gain optimal operating force acting on pedal. Low weight and functionality of the pedal were important factors affecting the research. The design of pedal arm and its holder was checked by final element method and was redesigned according to results...|$|E
25|$|Gear inches {{corresponds}} to the diameter (in inches) of the main wheel of an old-fashioned penny-farthing bicycle with equivalent gearing. Metres of development {{corresponds to}} the distance (in metres) traveled by the bicycle for one rotation of the <b>pedals.</b> Gain <b>ratio</b> is the ratio between the distance travelled by the bicycle and the distance travelled by a pedal, and is a pure number, independent of any units of measurement.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the design and {{implementation}} of the pedal box for the 2007 MIT Formula SAE car. Formula SAE is a collegiate competition in which groups of degree seeking students design and manufacture small formula style race cars to compete on design, cost, marketing, and performance. The pedal box {{is an integral part of}} the vehicle as the driver directly interacts with it making ergonomic considerations integral to the success of the design. The 2007 pedal box design emphasizes design for manufacture, adjustability, ergonomics and weight savings. An innovative design decreases the amount of space needed for the pedal box through the use of vertically mounted master cylinders while allowing for the d. river to adjust front to rear brake bias, brake <b>pedal</b> <b>ratio,</b> and location in the car. The design also causes a significant reduction in complexity and weight through a decrease in the number of components needed for manufacture. by Brad W. Schiller. Thesis (S. B.)
