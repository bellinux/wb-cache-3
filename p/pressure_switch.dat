5|$|The Laserex P90 laser {{systems have}} a weight of 131 g (0.29lb), {{and they are}} {{activated}} {{by means of a}} green <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> located {{on the underside of the}} weapon's pistol grip. The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off– disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training– low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat– high intensity for maximum visibility. The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the Training setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the Combat setting.|$|E
25|$|Ezima {{was filmed}} by the FBI while meeting with agent Sebold in New York, {{conclusive}} evidence of German-Japanese cooperation in espionage, {{in addition to}} meeting with Kanegoro Koike, Paymaster Commander of the Japanese Imperial Navy assigned to the Office of the Japanese Naval Inspector in New York. Ezima obtained a number of military materials from Duquesne, including ammunition, a drawing of a hydraulic unit with <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> A-5 of the Sperry Gyroscope, and an original drawing from the Lawrence Engineering and Research Corporation of a soundproofing installation, and he agreed to deliver materials to Germany via Japan. The British had made the Abwehr courier route from New York through Lisbon, Portugal difficult, so Ezima arranged an alternate route to the West Coast with deliveries every two weeks on freighters destined for Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E

5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual sump pump means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate.

25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
2500|$|... 22 October 2012: G-CHCN, an EC225 LP of CHC Scotia, ditched in the North Sea 32 {{miles south}} west of Shetland whilst {{en route from}} Aberdeen to the West Phoenix {{drilling}} rig. All 19 on board were rescued. [...] A special bulletin issued by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the main and standby oil pumps were not working; a 360-degree crack found on the bevel gear vertical shaft of the gearbox had prevented the oil pump gears from being driven. A worldwide grounding of the type was initiated in response. In both of the 2012 incidents, although the main gearbox lubrication system had failed, the backup system was working correctly but displaying an erroneous warning light, due to an incorrect specification of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch,</b> {{which led to the}} helicopters being ditched.|$|E
50|$|The {{contacts}} of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may {{be rated}} a few tenths of an ampere to around 15 amperes, with smaller ratings found on more sensitive switches.

50|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may be adjustable, {{by moving}} the {{contacts}} or adjusting tension in a counterbalance spring. Industrial pressure switches may have a calibrated scale and pointer to show the set point of the switch. A <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> will have a differential range around its setpoint in which small changes of pressure do not change {{the state of the}} contacts. Some types allow adjustment of the differential.|$|E

5000|$|Water level sensing <b>switch</b> type - <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to {{obstructions}} or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|R

50|$|A <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switch</b> for sensing {{fluid pressure}} contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Turning {{the mode}} switch does not {{turn on the}} lasers. A {{recessed}} button {{on top of the}} device is tapped once to briefly turn on the lasers or tapped twice to turn the lasers on until deactivated, either by pressing a third time or by turning the mode switch to off. Additionally, an extra <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> can be plugged into the rear of the device and then placed virtually anywhere, limited only by the length of the pressure switch's cord; typically one to two feet.
