40|$|The trans-resveratrol (RES) is an {{important}} substance in prevention and treatment of skin carcinogenesis. Though, the RES has low bioavailability and rapid metabolism when it administered orally, these factors could be circumvented by its dermal administration using solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). The {{aim of this study}} was to develop SLN with RES for use in antitumor therapy of melanoma. SLNs composed of stearic acid (SA) or <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate</b> (40) (PS 40); poloxamer 407; soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC) and the aqueous phase were made by sonication and it were added or not of 0. 1 % RES. The particle size, polydispersity index (PdI) and zeta potential were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The SLNs were analyzed by field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). An analytical method using HPLC-DAD was developed to quantify the RES. In vitro release and skin permeation/retention of SLN plus RES were conducted, as well as evaluation of depigmenting potency. The results concerning the average size, PdI and zeta potential of SLNs showed that formulations consisting of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate</b> (40) had a lower average diameter, ~ 20 nm, the addition of soy phosphatidylcholine promoted increases PdI and the formulations exhibited zeta potential smaller than - 6 mV. The DSC analysis showed no endothermic peak of the SLN with RES. Microscopic analysis suggest that material formed has nanometer distribution. The analytical method proved satisfactory in relation to RDC n° 899 / 2003 for RES. The formulations had release kinetics according Weibull's models and it were permeated through the skin up to 45 % after 24 hours. The formulation with RES and free RES were more effective than kojic acid in tyrosinase inhibition. The results suggest that formulations had potential for use in antitumor therapy of melanoma...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{influences}} of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate</b> (POES), PANTA, and pH on primary cultures of Mycobacterium genavense in BACTEC vials. As a model for primary cultures from tissue, seven different strains first isolated from AIDS patients (five from Switzerland and two from the United States) were inoculated into nude mice {{in order to obtain}} large amounts of bacilli to test different conditions simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that the size of the inoculum (10 [6] acid-fast bacilli/vial), an acid pH (pH 6. 0), and the absence of additives (POES and PANTA) significantly (P or = 100 or a GI of > or = 999 as criterion of success. In logistic regression analysis, all factors maintained a significant (P < 0. 001) independent effect, and no interactions were observed between them.

40|$|We {{used the}} BACTEC system to {{evaluate}} the effects of several decontamination methods {{and the addition of}} antibiotics on the viability of Mycobacterium ulcerans. The effects of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate</b> or egg yolk as supplements were also evaluated to determine their impact on the growth of M. ulcerans. Strains of different geographic origins were subjected to Petroff, reversed Petroff, oxalic acid, and mild HCl treatments. After treatment, the viability of each strain was assessed in the BACTEC system. All of the decontamination methods tested adversely affected bacterial viability. Treatment with mild HCl gave the best results, allowing better growth rates with some strains and causing a delay in growth with others, depending on the geographic origin of the strain. A mixture of polymyxin B, amphotericin B, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, and azlocillin did not significantly inhibit growth. Supplementing BACTEC medium with egg yolk markedly improved the recovery of M. ulcerans following the use of each of the decontamination methods. Our findings demonstrate a detri-mental impact on the viability of M. ulcerans by all of the decontamination methods currently in common use. This explains, at least in part, the difficulty often experienced in cultivating this organism from clinical specimens. Egg yolk should be added to enhance the rate of successful primary cultivation of M. ulcerans in the BACTEC system. Mycobacterium ulcerans is the cause of Buruli ulcer, a ne...|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous γ-alumina was {{synthesized}} by acid {{extraction of}} alumina from Kano kaolin using <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (40) <b>stearate</b> (PS) as a surfactant. The synthesized alumina was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption–desorption, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} attached with energy-dispersive X-ray (FESEM–EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TG–DTA). High-purity mesoporous γ-Al 2 O 3 with relatively large surface area and narrow pore size distribution was obtained. For comparison the preparation {{in the absence of}} surfactant was also carried out. In this study mesoporous alumina was also obtained {{even in the absence of}} the surfactant, however, the addition of PS resulted in modification on physical properties and morphology. The surface area increased from 169. 0  m 2 /g to 222. 7  m 2 /g, pore size from 4. 4  nm to 5. 6  nm and pore volume from 0. 32  cm 3 /g to 0. 45  cm 3 /g.

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) {{is one of}} {{the major}} obstacles limiting the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. Identification of new and effective MDR reversal agents is needed. In this study, the effects of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> 40 <b>stearate</b> (PS 40) on MDR were evaluated via the transport of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate vinblastine sulfate (VBL) through Caco- 2 cell monolayers and rat intestine tissue. The effects of PS 40 on the antitumor activity of VBL were examined through 3 -(4, 5) -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay and multidrug-resistant tumor-bearing mice. Results of the transport experiments showed that PS 40 reduced VBL efflux. The cytotoxicity of vinblastine to K 562 /ADR cells was significantly enhanced when the cells were cotreated with 100 or 150 μg/mL PS 40. In vivo data revealed that average tumor volume and average tumor weight were significantly less in the VBL+PS 40 group than in the VBL group. The inhibition rate for tumor growth was increased from 0. 06 (VBL group) to 0. 84 (VBL+PS 40 group). These results suggest that PS 40 may be a potentially useful adjuvant to enhance the therapeutic effects of P-gp substrates...|$|R
40|$|A semipermanent coating for {{preventing}} protein adsorption at physiological pH in kinetic capillary electrophoresis Protein adsorption {{to the inner}} capillary wall hinders the use of kinetic capillary elec-trophoresis (KCE) when studying noncovalent protein–ligand interactions. Permanent and dynamic capillary coatings have been previously reported to alleviate much of {{the problems associated with}} protein adsorption. The characteristic limitations associated with permanent and dynamic coatings motivated us to look at a third type of coating – semipermanent. Here, we demonstrate that a semipermanent capillary coating, designed by Lucy and co-workers, comprised of dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB) and <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (POE) <b>stearate,</b> greatly reduces protein adsorption at physiological pH – a necessary requirement for KCE. The coating (i) does not inhibit protein–DNA complex formation, (ii) prevents the adsorption of the analytes, and (iii) supports an elec-toosmotic flow required for many applications of KCE. The coating was tested in three physiological buffers using a well-known DNA aptamer and four proteins that severely bind to bare silica capillaries as standards. For every protein, a condition was found un-der which the semipermanent coating effectively suppresses protein adhesion. While no coating can completely prevent the adsorption of all proteins, our findings suggest that the DODAB/POE stearate coating can have a broad impact on CE at large, as it prevents the absorption of several well studied, highly adhesive proteins at physiological pH...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} found that approximately 3. 5 % of 428 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis yield uninterpretable {{results in the}} BACTEC pyrazinamide (PZA) susceptibility test system, because of inadequate growth. We tested the hypothesis that <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate</b> (POES), the ingredient of the reconstituting fluid for the test, {{was the cause of}} this growth inhibition. A total of 15 isolates known for their previously uninterpretable results and 100 randomly chosen clinical isolates were tested in parallel both with and without POES. Repeat testing of the isolates with previously uninterpretable results yielded results in the presence of POES in only seven (47 %). In the absence of POES, all gave interpretable results but one such result showed false resistance. For the other 100 clinical isolates, interpretable results were obtained with and without POES, but growth was enhanced in the absence of POES, especially in the PZA-susceptible strains. This was evidenced by a decreased time to attain a growth index of 200 in the control vial (4. 9 days without POES versus 5. 8 days with POES; P < 0. 001) and a higher mean growth index ratio on the day of interpretation of the test (7. 4 % without POES versus 2. 2 % with POES; P < 0. 001). However, the enhanced growth without POES led to 20 susceptible strains being misinterpreted as either resistant or borderline. We suggest that isolates of M. tuberculosis which yield uninterpretable results in the BACTEC PZA test system should be retested both with and without POES. If interpretable results indicating PZA resistance are obtained only in the absence of POES, the result should be confirmed by a pyrazinamidase assay or by the conventional proportion method. Routine omission of POES from the BACTEC test for all clinical strains is discouraged because of the unacceptably high false-resistance rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of drugs with biological membranes affect {{the delivery of}} drugs to the target sites within the body. Usually, a drug has to pass through several membranes {{in order to reach}} the target location. Because of this, knowledge on the {{interactions of}} drugs with biological membranes is essential not only for the understanding of the therapeutic action of existing drugs, but also in the discovery process of new candidates. This thesis explores the possible use of the physicochemical methods in the study of drug-membrane interactions. The emphasis of the thesis is on the various physicochemical approaches in determining the partition coefficient of drugs. As the properties of the drug carriers are equally important in drug delivery, attention is also focused on the physicochemical properties of drug carriers and their interactions with biological membranes. The most widely used parameter in the assessment of membrane permeability is the lipophilicity of a drug, which is most often expressed as the partition coefficient between two phases. In this thesis, the liposome-water partition coefficients of drugs were determined using two different methods, isothermal titration calorimetry and a new electrochemical method, which utilizes an electrified liquid-liquid interface. In addition, the partitioning to the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer was studied using contact angle measurements on three different hydrophobic model membranes. The physicochemical properties of cationic polymer/plasmid DNA complexes and their interactions with the cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were studied using dynamic light scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry and agarose gel electrophoresis. It was shown that the aggregation of polyethylene imine/plasmid DNA complexes can be controlled with the surfactant <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>stearate,</b> which also protects the complexes against the negative effects of extracellular GAGs. These findings are particularly relevant for ocular gene delivery, as the membranes in the eye have a very high content of GAGs. As a whole, this research addresses a number of important aspects of drug-membrane interactions from the physicochemical perspective. Various approaches to the partitioning of drugs were explored and three different experimental methods were used to determine the partition coefficients of eight drugs. Furthermore, physicochemical explanations were presented for a broad range of phenomena from the electrostatics of the binding of drugs to the aggregation of the DNA complexes...|$|E

Cessation of {{treatment}} before the recommended conclusion {{may lead to the}} emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for use in the treatment of M. tuberculosis. The NLCs comprised the following lipid phase: 2. 07 % <b>polyoxyethylene</b> 40 <b>stearate,</b> 2. 05 % caprylic/capric triglyceride, and 0. 88 % polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil; the following aqueous phase: 3. 50 % poloxamer 407 (F 1 –F 6), and 0. 50 % cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (F 7 –F 12); and incorporated the copper(II) complexes [CuCl 2 (INH) 2]·H 2 O (1), [Cu(NCS) 2 (INH) 2]· 5 H 2 O (2), and [Cu(NCO) 2 (INH) 2]· 4 H 2 O (3) to form compounds F 11. 1, F 11. 2, and F 11. 3, respectively. The mean diameter of F 11, F 11. 1, F 11. 2, and F 11. 3 ranged from 111. 27 ± 21. 86 to 134. 25 ± 22. 72 nm, 90. 27 ± 12. 97 to 116. 46 ± 9. 17 nm, 112. 4 ± 10. 22 to 149. 3 ± 15. 82 nm, and 78. 65 ± 6. 00 to 122. 00 ± 8. 70 nm, respectively. The polydispersity index values for the NLCs ranged from 0. 13 ± 0. 01 to 0. 30 ± 0. 09. The NLCs showed significant changes in zeta potential, except for F 11. 2, with F 11, F 11. 1, F 11. 2, and F 11. 3 ranging from 18. 87 ± 4. 04 to 23. 25 ± 1. 13 mV, 17. 03 ± 1. 77 to 21. 42 ± 1. 87 mV, 20. 51 ± 1. 88 to 22. 60 ± 3. 44 mV, and 17. 80 ± 1. 96 to 25. 25 ± 7. 78 mV, respectively. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the formation of nanoscale spherical particle dispersions by the NLCs. Differential scanning calorimetry determined the melting points of the constituents of the NLCs. The in vitro activity of copper(II) complex-loaded NLCs against M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv showed an improvement in the anti-TB activity of 55. 4, 27. 1, and 41. 1 times the activity for complexes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. An in vivo acute toxicity study of complex-loaded NLCs demonstrated their reduced toxicity. The results suggest that NLCs may be a powerful tool to optimize the activity of copper(II) complexes against M. tuberculosis.
