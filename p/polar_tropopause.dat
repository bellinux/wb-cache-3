On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17 km over the equator.

40|$|The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) {{has several}} well known biases that have {{important}} dynamical implications for research. Some {{examples of these}} biases include a cold temperature bias near the tropopause at high latitudes, systematic biases in the mean zonal wind, and transient momentum fluxes that are too strong. One method for investigating the impacts that these biases have is to use data assimilation techniques to reduce the bias and observe how the system reacts. The cold <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> temperature bias found in CAM is common to climate models. For the Northern Hemisphere, the bias is generally observed in the summer months. By assimilating a July 2003 set of observations {{in the region of}} this bias, we observe that reducing this bias forces the zonal jet and storm tracks to shift poleward. This finding mirrors the results of several earlier studies where the height of the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> influences the location of storm tracks and zonal jets by moving them equatorward as the height decreases, and poleward as the height increases as is predicted to occur with increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses...|$|E

Atmospheric structure data were obtained with S-band (2293 MHz) and X-band (8407 MHz) signals transmitted through the 40 and 85 km levels of the Venus atmosphere. Latitudes of - 68 to 88 deg at solar zenith angles of 8 - 166 deg were explored. The conversion of the data into acceptable form for the barometric equation to use the perfect gas law to obtain the temperature profiles is described. The temperature structures were more dependent on latitude than solar illumination conditions, with the greatest changes occurring in the circumpolar region.

The ozone climatology is used solely in the radiation scheme of the model. Several key differences between the model runs will be presented. The temperature and potential vorticity (PV) structure of the lower stratosphere, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, is significantly changed using the 1998 - 2000 ozone climatology. In the Southern Hemisphere summer, the lapse rate and PV-defined <b>polar</b> <b>tropopauses</b> are both at altitudes {{on the order of}} several hundred meters greater than the 1978 - 1980 climatological run. The 380 K potential temperature surf= is likewise at a greater altitude. The mass of the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (between the tropopause and 380 K surface) remains unchanged. The altitude differences are not observed in the Northern Hemisphere. The different ozone fields do not produce a significant change in the annual extratropical stratosphere-troposphere exchange of mass although slight variations in the spatial distribution of the exchange exist. We are also investigating a delay in the breakup of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex due to the differing ozone climatologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} Arctic {{radiosonde}} {{observations on the}} forecasting of the 2012 early August Arctic cyclone AC 12 —the “strongest” since records began—has been investigated using an observing system experiment (OSE). An atmospheric ensemble reanalysis (ALERA 2) {{was used as the}} control experiment (CTL) to reproduce the development of the Arctic cyclone and surrounding large-scale atmospheric fields. The OSE applies the same reanalysis as the CTL except for the exclusion of radiosonde observations from the German icebreaker Polarstern, which cruised near Svalbard during mid-July to early August 2012. Comparison of the two reanalyses revealed a difference in the upper tropospheric circulation over northern mid-Eurasia, just before the Arctic cyclone developed, {{in the form of a}} stronger <b>tropopause</b> <b>polar</b> vortex in the CTL. This indicated that the upper tropospheric field in the CTL had greater potential for baroclinic instability over mid-Eurasia. Ensemble predictions were then conducted using the two reanalyses as initial values at which the <b>tropopause</b> <b>polar</b> vortex approached northern mid-Eurasia. The CTL prediction reproduced the formation of the Arctic cyclone, but the OSE shows a significantly weaker one. These results indicate that the improved reproduction of upper tropospheric circulation in the Arctic region due to additional radiosonde observations from a mobile platform was indispensable for the prediction of AC 12. In particular, observations being acquired far from the Arctic cyclone affect the prediction of the cyclone via the upper tropospheric circulation in the atmospheric west wind drift...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} in polar latitudes during summer reveal {{a strong and}} persistent inversion layer as-sociated with the <b>polar</b> summer <b>tropopause.</b> This inversion layer {{is characterized by a}} temperature increase of; 8 K in the first 2 – 3 km above the tropopause and is observed throughout summer polar latitudes in both hemispheres. Radiosonde and GPS radio occultation temperature observations are used to document char-acteristics of the inversion layer, including its seasonal variability and modulation by synoptic meteorological systems (cyclones and anticyclones). Previous analyses have suggested a radiative mechanism for formation and maintenance of tropopause inversions, related to water vapor and ozone near the tropopause. Fixed dynamical heating (FDH) calculations are used herein to investigate this behavior in polar regions, based on observed seasonally varying profiles of water vapor (from satellite measurements) and ozone (from ozone-sondes). Water vapor exhibits a strong seasonal cycle throughout the troposphere and lowest stratosphere, with a pronounced summer maximum, which is primarily a result of the seasonally varying tropospheric temperatures. The FDH calculations suggest that enhanced summer water vapor leads to strong radiative cooling in a narrow layer near the tropopause, so that the radiative influence of water vapor provides a pri-mary mechanism for the summer inversion layer. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn a {{research}} flight on 10 July 2008, the German research aircraft Falcon sampled an air mass with unusually high carbon monoxide (CO), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and water vapour (H 2 O) mixing ratios in the Arctic lowermost stratosphere. The air mass was encountered twice {{at an altitude}} of 11. 3 km, ~ 800 m above the dynamical tropopause. In-situ measurements of ozone, NO, and NOy indicate that this layer was a mixed air mass containing both air from the troposphere and stratosphere. Backward trajectory and Lagrangian particle dispersion model analysis suggest that the Falcon sampled the top of a polluted air mass originating from the coastal regions of East Asia. The anthropogenic pollution plume experienced strong up-lift in a warm conveyor belt (WCB) located over the Russian east-coast. Subsequently the Asian air mass was transported across the North Pole into the sampling area, elevating the local tropopause by up to ~ 3 km. Mixing with surrounding Arctic stratospheric air most likely took place during the horizontal transport when the tropospheric streamer was stretched into long and narrow filaments. The mechanism illustrated in this study possibly presents an important pathway to transport pollution into the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> region...|$|E
40|$|A {{principal}} component analysis of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical zonal-mean tropopause variability at intraseasonal time scales is presented in this work. Wavy deformations of the tropopause dominate this variability and explain significantly more variance than changes in the extratropical-mean tropopause height. The first mode is well correlated with the zonal index. Analysis of the dynamical evolution of the modes shows that tropopause deformations are caused by anomalous wave breaking at the tropopause level occurring in a preexisting anomalous stratospheric polar vortex. Specifically, an intense (weak) polar vortex {{is associated with a}} rising (sinking) of the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause,</b> while anomalous wave breaking in the midlatitudes produces a dipolar tropopause change that is consistent with the anomalous meridional eddy flux of quasigeostrophic potential vorticity. These two forcings operate on different time scales and can be separated when the data are filtered at high or low frequency. Baroclinic equilibration seems to play a small role in the extratropical internal tropopause variability and the impact of tropospheric and stratospheric dynamics is quantitatively similar. A similar analysis for the Southern Hemisphere extratropics displays the same qualitative behavior.

40|$|The {{importance}} of stratospheric ozone depletion on the atmospheric circulation of the troposphere is studied with an atmospheric general circulation model, the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM 3), {{for the second}} half of the 20 th century. In particular, the relative {{importance of}} ozone depletion is contrasted with that of increased greenhouse gases and accompanying sea surface temperature changes. By specifying ozone and greenhouse gas forcings independently, and performing long, time-slice integrations, it is shown that the impacts of ozone depletion are roughly two to three times larger than those associated with increased greenhouse gases, for the Southern Hemisphere tropospheric summer circulation. The formation of the ozone hole is shown to affect not only the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> and the latitudinal position of the midlatitude jet: it extends to the entire hemisphere, resulting in a broadening of the Hadley cell and a poleward extension of the subtropical dry zones. The CAM 3 results are compared to and found to be in excellent agreement with those of the multi-model means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 3) and Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal 2) simulations. This study, therefore, yields a direct attribution of most Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation changes, in {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, to stratospheric ozone depletion. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to its harsh natural conditions, {{there had}} not been any {{intensive}} radiosonde observations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) until the year 2008, when a regional radiosonde observation network was implemented through a Sino–Japan joint cooperation project. This paper reports new findings on the structure of upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) layer, and provides evidence for stratosphere and troposphere exchange (STE) over the TP. Due to sparseness of high resolution sonde data, many previous studies assumed that there was only one thermal tropopause over the TP. Actually the radiosonde temperature profiles at pre-onset time of the Asian monsoon over the TP often exhibit a multiple tropopause (MT). The MT occurs in winter time with much higher frequency than any previous estimations over the Plateau. The MT during this time period is associated with tropopause folding near the subtropical westerly jet. The MT consistently varied with the movement of the jet. The MT becomes a single tropopause with the development of the monsoon. According to their height distribution, the MT can be divided into tropical and <b>polar</b> characterized <b>tropopauses.</b> Detailed analyses of MT characteristics are reported in this paper. Although some scientists have analyzed global MT events (with data including GPS radio occultation, ERA 40 data and Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive database), the frequency of their MT occurrences in winter season over the plateau is largely under-estimated. This significant difference must be caused by the coarse vertical resolution of these data. The stratospheric intruding episodes are generally associated with the presence of subtropical westerly jet stream over the Plateau. The subtropical jet causes dynamic tropopause foldings over the plateau, which have been observed by us as thermal MT events. Intrusions of high latitude stratospheric ozone rich air into the troposphere over the plateau give us a new explanation to why total column ozone in winter is higher than that in summer...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRossby wave trains (RWTs) are coherent envelopes of baroclinic waves that propagate on the midlatitude waveguide and {{are capable of}} producing downstream development. The waveguide is a region of heightened potential vorticity gradient along steeply sloping isentropic surfaces defining the mid-latitude jet stream. The goal {{of this research is}} to examine a climatology of objectively identified RWTs that result in downstream development over Europe, and to develop a methodology to subjectively determine the atmospheric phenomena responsible for triggering each. The purpose is to provide insight into the relative frequency of occurrence of RWTs triggered by each of four atmospheric disturbances over the North Atlantic to support future research into improving the predictability of waveguide perturbations and subsequent downstream development. A subset of RWTs is analyzed using dynamic tropopause, upper-level divergent outflow, sea level pressure, and Hovmöller plots. The RWT triggering mechanisms are identified and, when applicable, compared to known occurrences in climatology. Twenty-seven are (71 %) are triggered by warm conveyor belts associated with extratropical cyclones, three (8 %) by <b>tropopause</b> <b>polar</b> vortices, two (5 %) by the extratropical transition of tropical cyclones, and six (16 %) by diabatic Rossby vortices.

40|$|Model {{simulations}} {{with the}} Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) driven by wind {{fields of the}} National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were performed in the midlatitude tropopause region in April 2008 to study two research flights conducted during the START 08 campaign. One flight targeted a deep tropospheric intrusion and another flight targeted a deep stratospheric intrusion event, both {{of them in the}} vicinity of the subtropical and polar jet. Air masses with strong signatures of mixing between stratospheric and tropospheric air masses were identified from measured CO-O- 3 correlations, and the characteristics were reproduced by CLaMS model simulations. CLaMS simulations in turn complement the observations and provide a broader view of the mixed region in physical space. Using artificial tracers of air mass origin within CLaMS yields unique information about the transport pathways and their contribution to the composition in the mixed region from different transport origins. Three different regions are examined to categorize dominant transport processes: (1) on the cyclonic side of the <b>polar</b> jet within <b>tropopause</b> folds where air from the lowermost stratosphere and the cyclonic side of the jet is transported downward into the troposphere, (2) on the anticyclonic side of the polar jet around the 2 PVU surface air masses, where signatures of mixing between the troposphere and lowermost stratosphere were found with large contributions of air masses from low latitudes, and (3) in the lower stratosphere associated with a deep tropospheric intrusion originating in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Moreover, the time scale of transport from the TTL into the lowermost stratosphere is in the range of weeks whereas the stratospheric intrusions occur on a time scale of days...|$|R
40|$|Using High Resolution Dynamic Limb Sounder {{observations}} and ERA-Interim reanalysis this study {{demonstrates that the}} warm conveyor belt (WCB) is a mechanism responsible {{for the relationship between}} the double tropopause (DT) and the tropopause inversion layer (TIL), a relationship recently suggested in the literature based on idealized model simulations of baroclinic disturbances. Using these data sets, spatial and temporal characteristics of the DT-TIL relationship are examined over a 3 year period, 2005 – 2008. In the extratropics, results from satellite data show that as the TIL increases in strength, so does the frequency of the DT, regardless of season or hemisphere. The inverse relationship is found in the tropics. Using only DT profiles, zonal composites of wind, relative vorticity, and temperature from reanalysis data show that as the TIL increases in strength, the upper tropospheric circulation switches from cyclonic to anticyclonic, and the upward vertical motion increases. This result suggests the WCB as a mechanism since it is on the anticyclonic side of the jet and is characterized by the movement of tropical air poleward and upward from the surface. To verify this relationship, the vertical and horizontal development of a synoptic-scale baroclinic system is analyzed over a 4 day period. Results show the equatorward extension of the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause,</b> and thus the formation of the DT, due to the strengthening of the TIL in the region of vertical motion associated with the WCB. Moreover, this result suggests that air movement within the DT could originate from high latitudes when associated with a baroclinic disturbance...|$|E
40|$|The {{idealized}} {{test case}} proposed by Held and Suarez {{is carried out}} with the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM 5 of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The aim is to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} solutions of the spectral dynamical core to spatial and temporal resolution, and to evaluate the numerical convergence of the solutions. Low-frequency fluctuations at time scales as long as thousands of days are found in ultralong integrations. To distinguish the effect of changed resolution from the fluctuations caused by the internal variability, the ensemble method is employed in experiments at resolutions ranging from T 31 to T 159 with 16 to 81 vertical levels. Significance of the differences between ensembles is assessed by three different statistical tests. Convergence property of the numerical solution is concisely summarized by a ratio index. Results show that the simulated climate state in the Held-Suarez test is sensitive to spatial resolution. Increase of horizontal resolution leads to slight weakening and poleward shift of the westerly jets. Significant warming is detected in high latitudes, especially near the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause,</b> while the tropical tropopause becomes cooler. The baroclinic wave activity intensifies considerably with increased horizontal resolution. Higher vertical resolution also leads to stronger eddy variances and cooling near the tropical tropopause, but equatorward shift of the westerly jets. The solutions show an indication of convergence at T 85 L 31 resolution according to all the three statistical tests applied. Differences between integrations with various time steps are judged to be within the noise level induced by the inherent low-frequency variability...|$|E

40|$|Dramatic {{climate changes}} have {{occurred}} in recent decades over the Arctic region, and very noticeably in near-surface warming and reductions in sea ice extent. In a climatological sense, Arctic cyclone behaviour {{is linked to the}} distributions of lower troposphere temperature and sea ice, and hence the monitoring of storms can be seen as {{an important component of the}} analysis of Arctic climate. The analysis of cyclone behaviour, however, is not without ambiguity, and different cyclone identification algorithms can lead to divergent conclusions. Here we analyse a subset of Arctic cyclones with 10 state-of-the-art cyclone identification schemes applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The subset is comprised of the five most intense (defined in terms of central pressure) Arctic cyclones for each of the 12 calendar months over the 30 -yr period from 1 January 1979 to 31 March 2009. There is a considerable difference between the central pressures diagnosed by the algorithms of typically 5 – 10 hPa. By contrast, there is substantial agreement as to the location of the centre of these extreme storms. The cyclone tracking algorithms also display some differences in the evolution and life cycle of these storms, while overall finding them to be quite long-lived. For all but six of the 60 storms an intense <b>tropopause</b> <b>polar</b> vortex is identified within 555 km of the surface system. The results presented here highlight some significant differences between the outputs of the algorithms, and hence point to the value using multiple identification schemes in the study of cyclone behaviour.

40|$|During {{the recent}} winters water vapour has been {{accurately}} measured from different Arctic sites using balloon-borne Lyman-alpha FLASH-B hygrosonde. Here we {{present the results}} of 18 balloon water vapour soundings conducted at Sodankylä (67 N) and Ny-Alesund (79 N) during 2003 / 04, 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 winters. The obtained data set allows case studies and detailed characterization of stratospheric water vapour vertical distribution within different conditions in the Arctic polar stratosphere. Water vapour vertical distribution in the Arctic lower stratosphere is primarily affected by the dynamical effects of polar vortex and by phase aggregation at the temperatures below ice PSC threshold. The measured H 2 O profiles carry the signatures of different processes occurring in the Arctic winter stratosphere and reveal a detailed view on the Arctic UT/LS water vapour distribution. The measurements clearly demonstrate typical differences in stratospheric water vapour concentration {{inside and outside the}} vortex; for example in the polar vortex of 2003 / 04 at 20 hPa the difference reaches 1. 4 ppmv. Also it is pointed out that water vapour profiles obtained at the edge or close to the edge of vortex are characteristic by their laminated structure. As shown by the results of RDF-analysis this structure is not linked to dehydration but to differential advection of air masses originating from inside and outside the vortex. Thus water vapour is proved to be a valuable tracer for dynamical processes in the polar stratosphere. In the other case, the water vapour vertical profiles obtained at Ny-Alesund in January 2005 during the presence of PSCs clearly show the dehydration layers with reduced water vapour. Another focus is put here on the water vapour vertical distribution within the so called transition layer above the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause.</b> The existence of this transition layer may be caused by diffusion of water vapour through the smeared polar winter tropopause, whereas the vertical structure of the H 2 O profile is affected by the dynamical processes.

40|$|The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) {{community}} climate model version 2 (CCM 2) simulation of the circumpolar trough, surface air temperature, the polar vortex, cloudiness, winds, and atmospheric moisture and energy budgets are examined {{to validate the}} model's representation of the present-day Antarctic climate. The {{results show that the}} CCM 2 can well simulate many important climate features over Antarctica, such as the location and intensity of the circumpolar trough, the coreless winter over the plateau, the intensity and horizontal distribution of the surface inversion, the speed and streamline pattern of the katabatic winds, the double jet stream feature over the southern Indian and Pacific oceans, and the arid climate over the continent. However, there are also some serious errors in the model. Some are due to old problems but some are caused by the new parameterizations in the model. The model errors over high southern latitudes can be summarized as follows: The circumpolar trough, the polar vertex, and the westerlies in midlatitudes are too strong; the semiannual cycle of the circumpolar trough is distorted compared to the observations; the low centers of the circumpolar trough and the troughs in the middle and upper troposphere are shifted eastward by 15 deg - 40 deg longitude; the surface temperatures are too cold over the plateau in summer and over the coastline in winter; the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> continues to have a cold bias; and the cloudiness is too high over the continent. These biases are induced by two major factors: (1) the cloud optical properties in tropical and middle latitudes, which cause the eastward shift of troughs and surface low centers and the error in the semiannual cycle, and (2) the cold bias of the surface air temperature, which is attributed to the oversimulation of cloudiness over the continent, especially during summer, and the uniform 2 -m-thick sea ice. The constant thickness of sea ice suppresses the energy flux from the ocean to the atmosphere and hence reduces the air temperature near the coast during winter. Finally, although the simulated Antarctic climate still suffers these biases, the overall performance of the CCM 2 is much better than that of the CCM 1 -T 42. Therefore the CCM 2 is good enough to be used for climate change studies, especially over Antarctica...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} equable climates. The underlying physics of two mechanisms by which weak meridional temperature gradients might be maintained are studied. First, I examine the evolution of stratospheric dynamics and winter temperatures when the surface temperature gradient and tropospheric eddy energy decrease {{in order to assess}} whether large-scale conditions are more favorable for polar stratospheric cloud formation. Second, I examine whether the combination of high carbon dioxide and interactive, tropical cyclone dependent ocean mixing is sufficient to maintain a weak temperature gradient. I examine planetary wave generation, the energetics of the general circulation, and vertical wave propagation in a general circulation model with a resolved stratosphere forced with a weak surface temperature gradient. Compared to the present climate, transient eddy energy decreases, but stationary eddy energy does not. The <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> rises, which supports a weaker temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere, a weaker stratospheric jet, and an increase in the wave activity vertically propagating into the stratosphere. (cont.) As a result, the residual mean circulation strengthens and temperatures in the polar stratosphere change little even when the surface temperature gradient is quite weak. Temperatures in the Arctic polar vortex remain much warmer than radiative equilibrium, inhibiting large-scale polar stratospheric cloud formation. The height of the extratropical tropopause rises and the tropospheric lapse rate follows a moist adiabat when surface temperatures are warm, suggesting convection plays a significant role in setting extratropical tropospheric stratification during warm climates. The second part of the thesis addresses the role of tropical cyclone induced mixing in the oceans' general circulation. I examine the sensitivity of the oceans' meridional overturning circulation and heat flux to the locations at which mixing occurs. When confined to the tropical Atlantic, a robust single-basin circulation can be maintained, but the Indian and Pacific become quiescent, cut off from the dynamics occurring in the Atlantic. Mixing isolated in the tropical Pacific, however, can support a global circulation by mechanically lifting deep fluid parcels formed in the Atlantic, raising their potential energy. (cont.) The oceans' total heat flux is found to be sensitive to mixing in the tropics, in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and in the upper 400 meters of the ocean. Coupling mixing with a measure of tropical cyclone intensity and frequency creates a positive feedback between climate and the poleward energy flux. When combined with a parameterization of the background mixing that evolves with stratification, a warmer, less stratified ocean can support a stronger diapycnal mixing during warm climates with high loads of carbon dioxide. In these simulations, tropical cyclones are stronger and more frequent, providing an increased energy source for more vigorous mixing in the tropical oceans. Combined with a stratification-dependent mixing scheme, such mixing provides a sufficiently strong heat flux that is able to maintain weak sea surface temperature gradients. by Robert Lindsay Korty.
