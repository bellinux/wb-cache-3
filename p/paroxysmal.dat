5|$|The Chinese Huangdi Neijing (The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor) {{dating from}} ~300 BCE – 200 CE {{apparently}} refers to repeated <b>paroxysmal</b> fevers associated with enlarged spleens and {{a tendency to}} epidemic occurrence.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder <b>paroxysmal</b> dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a <b>paroxysmal</b> depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign <b>paroxysmal</b> positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign <b>paroxysmal</b> positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a <b>paroxysmal</b> cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of a <b>paroxysmal</b> cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E

25|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} <b>paroxysmal</b> kinesigenic {{dyskinesia}} (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements {{can take many}} forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of <b>paroxysmal</b> dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop <b>paroxysmal</b> choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} {{is caused}} by complement breakdown of RBCs due to an inability to make GPI. Thus the RBCs are not protected by GPI anchored proteins such as DAF.|$|E
25|$|Circulation or {{clotting}} conditions, such as peripheral vascular disease, polycythemia vera, sickle-cell anemia, <b>paroxysmal</b> nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, plasminogen or fibrinolysis disorders, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, or antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of <b>paroxysmal</b> hemoglobinuria {{was by the}} German physician Paul Strübing (Greifswald, 1852–1915) during a lecture in 1881, later published in 1882. Later comprehensive descriptions were made by Ettore Marchiafava and Alessio Nazari in 1911, with further elaborations by Marchiafava in 1928 and Ferdinando Micheli in 1931.|$|E
25|$|All {{people with}} AF are {{initially}} {{in the category}} called first detected AF. These patients {{may or may not}} have had previous undetected episodes. If a first detected episode stops on its own in less than 7days and then another episode begins, later on, the category changes to <b>paroxysmal</b> AF. Although patients in this category have episodes lasting up to 7days, in most cases of <b>paroxysmal</b> AF the episodes will stop in less than 24hours. If the episode lasts for more than 7days, it is unlikely to stop on its own, and is then known as persistent AF. In this case, cardioversion can be used to stop the episode. If cardioversion is unsuccessful or not attempted and the episode continues for a long time (e.g., a year or more), the patient's AF is then known as permanent.|$|E

25|$|Benign <b>paroxysmal</b> {{positional}} vertigo (BPPV) {{is the most}} common vestibular disorder and occurs when loose calcium carbonate debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion. Patients with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute, which occur with change in position.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} classification system {{was published by}} Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a medical scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity. He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a shortlasting, mild headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a <b>paroxysmal</b> headache {{on one side of}} the head.|$|E
25|$|Decreased {{platelet}} numbers {{may be due}} {{to various}} causes, including insufficient production (e.g., in myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura/ITP), and consumption due to various causes (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome/HUS, <b>paroxysmal</b> nocturnal hemoglobinuria/PNH, disseminated intravascular coagulation/DIC, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats. This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and <b>paroxysmal</b> supraventricular tachycardia. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.|$|E
25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary <b>paroxysmal</b> cerebellopathy, familial <b>paroxysmal</b> ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary <b>paroxysmal</b> cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E
25|$|Wolff–Parkinson–White {{syndrome}} (WPW) is {{a disorder}} {{due to a}} specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart which has resulted in symptoms. About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as <b>paroxysmal</b> supraventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for whooping cough. Pertussis toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. Whooping cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include <b>paroxysmal</b> cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis was first identified as the cause of whooping cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Benign <b>paroxysmal</b> {{positional}} vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder arising from {{a problem in}} the inner ear. Symptoms are repeated, brief periods of vertigo with movement, that is, of a spinning sensation upon changes in the position of the head. This can occur with turning in bed or changing position. Each episode of vertigo typically lasts less than one minute. Nausea is commonly associated. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes of vertigo.|$|E
25|$|High risk: atrial {{fibrillation}} and <b>paroxysmal</b> {{atrial fibrillation}}, rheumatic {{disease of the}} mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, papillary fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 1904 {{this theory}} was {{challenged}} by {{the discovery of a}} substance in the serum of patients with <b>paroxysmal</b> cold hemoglobinuria that reacted with red blood cells. During the following decades, a number of conditions could be linked to autoimmune responses. However, the authoritative status of Ehrlich's postulate hampered the understanding of these findings. Immunology became a biochemical rather than a clinical discipline. By the 1950s the modern understanding of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases started to spread.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> kinesigenic {{dyskinesia}} {{has been}} shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are benign <b>paroxysmal</b> positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo {{is a problem in}} a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening {{disease of}} the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, {{a part of the}} body's innate immune system. This destructive process occurs due to the presence of defective surface proteins on the red blood cell, which normally function to inhibit such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells within the blood vessels of the circulatory system, the red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) is considered an intravascular hemolytic anemia. Other key features of the disease, such as the high incidence of blood clot formation, are incompletely understood.|$|E
25|$|Benign <b>paroxysmal</b> {{positional}} vertigo {{is more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can {{exist in a}} few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, {{as well as other}} currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and <b>paroxysmal</b> nocturnal hemoglobinuria.|$|E
25|$|The troops worst {{affected}} had intense cyanosis and frothy exudation {{from the}} mouth and nose; some of the severe casualties who reached casualty clearing stations, had a pallor and collapse associated with phosgene poisoning. In a few cases cyanosis gave place to pallor before the victim died. The troops who died rapidly in the front line, about ninety minutes after {{the beginning of the}} attack, showed deep cyanosis and copious frothing, with <b>paroxysmal</b> coughing prominent in the early stages. The clinical evidence suggested that the gas cloud contained a low proportion of phosgene to chlorine. About twenty civilians were affected by the gas, though none severely, as they had been instructed in gas precautions and had been issued with respirators. The civilians had also protected themselves by closing windows and doors and by filling cracks with wet cloths; many also wore anti-gas helmets indoors.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{treatment}} with anti-vertigo medications {{may be considered}} in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, {{but in most cases}} are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of <b>paroxysmal</b> dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, {{in order to determine the}} most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is {{characterized}} by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder {{is also known as}} episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary <b>paroxysmal</b> ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. KV1.1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all motor output from the cerebellum. EA1 {{is an example of a}} synaptopathy. There are currently 17 KV1.1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function. As described in Table 1, most of the known EA1 associated mutations result in a drastic decrease in the amount of current through KV1.1 channels. Furthermore, these channels tend to activate at more positive potentials and slower rates, demonstrated by positive shifts in their V½ values and slower τ activation time constants, respectively. Some of these mutations, moreover, produce channels that deactivate at faster rates (deactivation τ), which would also result in decreased current through these channels. While these biophysical changes in channel properties likely underlie some of the decrease in current observed in experiments, many mutations also seem to result in misfolded or otherwise mistrafficked channels, which is likely to be the major cause of dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. It is assumed, though not yet proven, that decrease in KV1.1 mediated current leads to prolonged action potentials in interneurons and basket cells. As these cells are important in the regulation of Purkinje cell activity, it is likely that this results increased and aberrant inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thus, disrupted Purkinje cell firing and cerebellum output.|$|E
