50|$|With the {{development}} of reliable spring steel in Spain, the navaja could be fitted with a tempered steel, externally mounted backspring, making the design much more useful. The new spring-back navaja proved very popular throughout Spain and was later exported to or manufactured in other countries as well, particularly France and the island of Corsica.During {{the first part of}} the 18th century, the blade heel and backspring of the navaja were cleverly altered to provide a locking device for the blade. Pulling open the blade from the handle, the lock allowed the blade to rotate into the fully open position, where it locked into position. The locking mechanism itself consisted of pinion teeth (piñones or dientes) cut into the blade heel (talón de la hoja) that are engaged by a lug attached to either the backspring or a separate spring-loaded metal latch as the knife is opened. The last <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> serves to keep the blade locked in its fully opened position. The ratcheting-tooth lock-blade navaja was commonly referred to as a navaja de muelles or navaja de siete muelles. The metal-to-metal contact produces a distinctive clicking sound when the blade is opened, and the navaja de muelles was popularly termed the carraca in consequence. With its locking blade, the navaja de muelles was now a versatile fighting knife, able to safely deliver thrusts as well as slashes (cuts). The navaja de muelles proved sufficiently formidable as an offensive arm that it was specifically named by the Marqués de la Mina, the Spanish military governor of Catalonia, in his edict of 29 May 1750 prohibiting the carrying of armas blancas, or edged weapons.|$|E

The developed method for synthesis was used to determine the optimal geometry for a crowned helical pinion surface and was directed to localize the bearing contact and guarantee favorable shape and a low level of transmission errors. Two new methods for generation of the crowned helical pinion surface are proposed. One is based on the application of a tool with a surface of revolution that slightly deviates from a regular cone surface. The tool {{can be used as a}} grinding wheel or as a shaver.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.

40|$|Results of {{applying}} {{a variety of}} gear fault detection techniques to experimental data is presented. A spiral bevel gear fatigue rig was used to initiate a naturally occurring fault and propagate the fault to a near catastrophic condition of the test gear pair. The spiral bevel gear fatigue test lasted a total of eighteen hours. At approximately {{five and a half}} hours into the test, the rig was stopped to inspect the gears for damage, at which time a small pit was identified on a tooth of the pinion. The test was then stopped an additional seven times {{throughout the rest of the}} test in order to observe and document the growth and propagation of the fault. The test was ended when a major portion of a <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> broke off. A personal computer based diagnostic system was developed to obtain vibration data from the test rig, and to perform the on-line gear condition monitoring. A number of gear fault detection techniques, which use the signal average in both the time and frequency domain, were applied to the experimental data. Among the techniques investigated, two of the recently developed methods appeared to be the first to react to the start of tooth damage. These methods continued to react to the damage as the pitted area grew in size to cover approximately 75 % of the face width of the <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth.</b> In addition, information gathered from one of the newer methods was found to be a good accumulative damage indicator. An unexpected result of the test showed that although the speed of the rig was held to within a band of six percent of the nominal speed, and the load within eighteen percent of nominal, the resulting speed and load variations substantially affected the performance of all of the gear fault detection techniques investigated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define optimal tooth modifications, {{introduced}} by appropriately chosen head-cutter geometry and machine tool setting, to simultaneously minimize tooth contact pressure and angular displacement error of the driven gear (transmission error) of face-hobbed spiral bevel gears. As a result of these modifications, the gear pair becomes mismatched, and a point contact replaces the theoretical line contact. In the applied loaded tooth contact analysis it is assumed that the point contact under load is spreading over a surface along the whole or part of the “potential” contact line. A computer program was developed to implement the formulation provided above. By using this program the influence of tooth modifications introduced by the variation in machine tool settings and in head cutter data on load and pressure distributions, transmission errors, and fillet stresses is investigated and discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automatic procedure {{to optimize the}} loaded tooth contact pattern of face-milled hypoid gears with misalignments varying within prescribed ranges. A two-step ap- proach is proposed to solve the problem: in the first step, the <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> micro-topography is automatically modified to bring the perturbed contact patterns (as the assembly errors are varied within the tolerance limits) match a target area of the tooth, while keeping them off the edges; in the second step, {{a subset of the}} machine-tool settings is identified to obtain the required topog- raphy modifications. Both steps are formulated and solved as un- constrained nonlinear optimization problems. While the general methodology is similar to the one recently proposed by the same authors for the optimization at nominal conditions, here the ro- bustness issues with respect to misalignment variations are con- sidered and directly included in the optimization procedure: no a posteriori check for robustness is therefore required. Numerical tests show that nominally satisfactory and globally robust hypoid pairs can be designed by a direct process and within a unified framework, thus avoiding tiresome trial-and-error loops...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{a method of}} calculation for modifying tooth profiles {{in order to reduce}} load peaks due to the increasing stiffness of <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> caused by projections. The tooth stiffness of the pinion is increased by forming the tooth as a projection from the pinion, i. e. the wheel width is less than that of the pinion. The computer program is based on the finite element method. A study of the most important geometric parameters of gear teeth has been carried out and covers the range of usual spur gears. The study provided starting data from which approximate equations were derived. Favourable simple tooth edge modifications were determined for a number of different spur gears such as round flank modifications or bevelled modifications, which reduce load peaks {{as a result of the}} projections.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of various lenghts of notches in a <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth</b> root of a single-stage gear-unit upon the vibrations they produce are dealt with. Time signals obtained by experiments are analysed {{by means of}} different methods. Additionally, frequency analysis has been made, which helps predict the general state of a gear. A crack (notch) in the tooth root causes significant changes in tooth stiffness. This leads to a dynamic response, which differs from the one in concern to an undamaged tooth. A notch {{has been made in}} order to simulate the conditions close to the ones in concern to a fatigue crack in a tooth root. Amplitudes of time signal are, by frequency analysis, presented as a function of frequencies f. Digital frequency analysis has been carried out by means of Fourier Fast Transformation. The increase in amplitudes of certain frequencies in the spectrum, due to different lengths, is among the most important factors that indicate changes in a gear-unit.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{study on the}} effect of hob offset on the dynamic tooth strength of spur gears. The study was limited to equal and opposite offset val-ues applied to the pinion and gear to maintain the stan-dard operating center distance. The analysis presented in this paper was performed using {{a new version of the}} NASA gear dynamics code DANST. The operating speed of the transmission has a signifi-cant influence on the amount of hob offset required to equalize the dynamic stresses in the pinion and gear. In the transmission studied, at low speeds, the optimum hob offset value was found to fluctuate. At higher speeds, the optimum value was constrained by the minimum allowed thickness at the tip of the <b>pinion</b> <b>tooth.</b> For gears that must operate over a range of speeds, an average offset value may be used.
