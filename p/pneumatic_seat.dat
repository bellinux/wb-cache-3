40|$|In recent decades, {{the quality}} of life of many {{disabled}} people has improved. There are more and more devices for making handicapped people’s lives better. This accessibility has the aim of giving more independence to certain people with motor disabilities. Specifically, it focuses on two paraplegic children who have difficulties both in standing up from their wheelchairs as well as standing for short periods of time due to their condition. Therefore, they need a device that can help them to stand up from their wheelchair. This project was carried out in conjunction with a social organisation called Accessibility Chair with the objective to improve {{the quality of}} life of these two children and to make them less dependent on the help of other people. If successful, there are potentially many other children and adults that could benefit from the research that has been carried out and the prototype that has been designed and built by the team. The methods used to gain information about the subject and possible solutions include semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, desk‐research and field‐research. Desk and field research was done to find out what kind of existing products might aid these children. Meetings with the project supervisors, clients and physiotherapists also took place. After many brainstorming sessions as well as other creative sessions, the team decided on using multiple products together. Two different solutions were proposed and are detailed in the report. One is a winch combined with a harness, and the other is a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seat.</b> In addition, the testing and improvement phases of our prototypes are explained as well...|$|E
40|$|Landmines {{are a great}} {{threat to}} {{military}} vehicles and their occupants. Mine blasts can completely destroy vehicles and kill all the occupants or disable the vehicle and leave the occupants severely injured. Injuries sustained during a landmine blast come from fragmentation that enters the vehicle through a hull breach, hot gasses expanding through the vehicle, or shock created from the extreme pressure of the blast (Lafrance, L. P. 1998). Mitigating the high acceleration experienced by the occupants during survivable mine blasts {{is the focus of}} the research being addressed in this paper. Method The objective of the project reported in this paper was to prove the feasibility that <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seat</b> technologies that employ light-weight, foam-filled, inflatable air bladder seats and seat backs can be used to protect the crews of lightweight combat vehicles against the detrimental and injurious effects of mine blasts. This protection includes reducing the shock energy experienced by seated vehicle crews during mine blast initiation and at vehicle slam-down to below potentially injurious levels. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the proposed lightweight, foam-filled, inflatable mine blast attenuating seat. It will consist of specially designed interconnected seat and seat back lightweight, foam-filed, air bladders that are supported by a rigid frame. [] Results Air gun tests and finite element analyses were conducted to determine the effectiveness of a light-weight, foam-filled, inflatable air bladder seat shock isolation system in isolating a vehicle occupant from the injurious effects of a mine blast. Figures 2 through 5 show analytical and experimental results associated with a 65. 8 kg mass resting on an inflatable air bladder that is exposed to a shock input...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{mechanism}} and control algorithm for pneumatic relaxation system of suspension with vibration energy recuperation applied to standard vehicle operator seat (“Sibeko” company). Mathematical {{model of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>pneumatic</b> relaxation suspension with two additional air volumes was created. Pneumatic motor – recuperator activated by means of air flow from the one additional volume to another is installed in air piping between additional volumes. Computational research was made in Matlab/Simulink. Amplitude-frequency characteristics of transmission coefficient for standard and proposed suspensions were plotted for preliminary evaluation of vibration protection properties of seat suspension.

40|$|Handling {{of heavy}} {{vehicles}} such as tractors, trucks and buses require a large roll stiffness which causes large high accelerations at the seat level during impacts. To provide comfort and minimize the energy transfer from the chassis and the <b>seat</b> a <b>pneumatic</b> active <b>seat</b> suspension is proposed. An active seat suspension design and control algorithm under {{development at the}} University of Illinois at Chicago, UIC, is being developed and tested. Preliminary results are presented in this paper. The design of a passive suspension typically consists of optimizing the value of two parameters: the stiffness and the damping of the suspension. The general dynamic performance of the suspension {{is limited to the}} conditions under which these parameters were obtained. A change in the input conditions might lead to poor suspension and an amplification of the vibration transmitted to the body. The focus of this paper is a robust, semi-active suspension system with a variable controlled damping and using the body response an index measure to minimize the acceleration at the interface of the seat and operator. A summary of existing suspensions, such as MR and ER fluids, and spring loaded and dual valve shock absorbent will be discussed to highlight the need of a semi-active pneumatic suspension system design. Methods A model of the proposed suspension was developed in MATLB (Simulink) and different control strategies for the valve position in relation to the cylinder pressure tested. The effects of stiffening and softening resulting from pressure changes in the cylinder were examined. The vertical accelerations of the seat was computed for different control strategies and configurations of the suspension and compared to the response of a passive seat suspension. A lump -mass model was created to represent the human body including the head, the upper, middle and lower torso as well as the legs. The connective forces between body segments were modeled through modal analysis techniques from previous experiments at the Vehicle Technology Laboratory. ISO standards and absorbed power were used to evaluate the different configuration of the seat suspension system in relation to the dynamic response of the operator. Results Initial results of the semi-active suspension system show a significant reduction in the RMS value of the acceleration of the seat. A reduction of the total absorbed power by the operator is expected to provide an insight into the control strategies adapted in the active suspension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{development}} process of a <b>pneumatic</b> powered motion <b>seat</b> is being outlined {{as an example}} for mechatronic design. The fluid muscle of Festo AG provides stick slip free motion and is being used as displacement and pressure controlled actuator in a hexapod system for the first time. The process of design is supported by 3 D-CAD with the software tool SolidEdge. It provides the necessary data to use Rigid Body Simulation with the software tool CAMeLView. Actuator behaviour is acquired by using a test bench with similar environment to the designed application. An 80486 process controller system with modular periphery called PS- 1 made by Beck-IPC is beeing used. The programming is done by defining the control structure in a block oriented simulation environment followed by automated C++ code generation and compilation for the DOS 6. 22 operating system. The displacement control of the fluid muscle was possible due {{to the development of}} an incremental in-tube length measuring system. For this purpose the miniaturized magnetic linear encoder system had to be integrated into the membrane of the actuator. By using a six-actuator structure it is possible to move a person in the seat in three translatorical directions as well as three rotatorical orientations – all six degrees of freedom are available respective limited working ranges. By using the inverse transformation formalism for hexapod structures only forward position control of the motion seat is available. It is scheduled to implement the hexapod forward transformation to calculate the seat position and orientation in real-time in order to improve the control accuracy. The motion simulator will be an example for an interesting application of fluid muscles launched by Festo AG. It is the intention to present the simulator at the next Hanover fair...|$|R
40|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{suspension}} damper, semi-active dampers with only minimal power requirement could be applied to achieve variable damping to enhance suspension performance under complex vibration and shock environments. Magneto-rheological (MR) fluid based dampers offer significant potential for realizing semi-actively controlled variable damping with only minimal power. The MR-fluid dampers invariably exhibit considerable hysteresis, while the damping force varies with the intensity of applied electro-magnetic field and the nature of vibration in a highly nonlinear manner. A simulation model based on symmetric and asymmetric sigmoid functions is developed to fully characterize the properties of a MR-damper as function of excitation and control current. A comprehensive laboratory test program is undertaken to characterize the damping properties of a MR damper under wide ranges of excitations and control current. The essential fundamental features are identified for the modeling task, while the model parameters are identified using multi-parameter error minimization techniques. The validity of the proposed generic model is thoroughly examined by comparing the model response with the measured data under a wide range of excitations, particularly the force saturation and the hysteresis behaviour. An independent current function is further derived that could be integrated to reported regression-based hysteresis models to enhance their prediction abilities. From the results of the study, it is concluded that the refined Bouc-Wen and the proposed generalized sigmoid function model can fully characterized the nonlinear MR damping behaviour as function of applied current and excitation. A nonlinear analytical model of a <b>pneumatic</b> suspension <b>seat</b> including the motion limiting stops is developed for synthesis and analyses of the MR-damping control algorithms. The validity of the passive suspension seat model is thoroughly examined under various deterministic and random vibration excitations of varying intensities. The results suggest that attenuation of shock as well as vibration imposes difficulties design compromise of the passive damper. Owing to the strongly nonlinear properties of the suspension-seat and the MR-damper, such as hysteresis, saturation and end-stop impacts, a 'hi-lo' semi-active control algorithm is synthesized to realized modulation of the control current and thus the damping force following the skyhook control law. A continuous modulation function is further synthesized and integrated to ensure smooth transition between the 'hi' and 'lo' states. A relative position control is further introduced to limit the frequency and severity of shock motions caused by end-stop impacts. A set of performance measures is proposed to assess the characteristics of the semi-active and the resulting integrated controller under a wide range of excitations, including deterministic excitations of continuous and transient nature and random excitations of different vehicles. The potential performance benefits of the controller design are further investigated through a hardware-in-the-loop test and simulation program. The results are used to demonstrate the validity of the MR-damper and suspension seat models, and effectiveness of the control algorith...|$|R
