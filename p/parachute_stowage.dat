40|$|The Parachute Decelerator System (PDS) is {{comprised}} of all components associated with the supersonic parachute and its associated deployment. During the Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test (SFDT), for the Low Density Supersonic Decelerators Program, the PDS was required to deploy the supersonic parachute in a defined fashion. The PDS hardware includes three major subsystems that must function together. The first subsystem is the Parachute Deployment Device (PDD), which acts as a modified pilot deployment system. It {{is comprised}} of a pyrotechnic mortar, a Kevlar ballute, a lanyard actuated pyrotechnic inflation aid, and rigging with its associated thermal protection material (TPS). The second subsystem is the supersonic parachute deployment hardware. This includes all of the parachute specific rigging that includes the <b>parachute</b> <b>stowage</b> can and the rigging including TPS and bridle stiffeners for bridle management during deployment. The third subsystem is the Supersonic Parachute itself, which includes the main parachute and deployment bags. This paper summarizes the verification and validation of the deployment process, from the initialization of the PDS system through parachute bag strip that was done prior to the first SFDT...|$|E
