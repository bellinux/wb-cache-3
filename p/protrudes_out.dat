25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the {{potassium}} channel KCNE family and is one five single transmembrane domain voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel ancillary subunits. KCNE2 is composed of three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain <b>protrudes</b> <b>out</b> of the extracellular side of the cell membrane and is, thus, soluble in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, the transmembrane and C-terminal domains are lipid-soluble to enable the protein to incorporate into the cell membrane. The C-terminal faces the intracellular side of the membrane and may share a putative PKC phosphorylation site with other KCNE proteins.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} one handed devices was the {{automatic}} spring release, {{also known as a}} switchblade. An innovation to pocket knives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold [...] "Kit" [...] Carson often incorporate a [...] "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it <b>protrudes</b> <b>out</b> the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second [...] "Flipper" [...] {{on the opposite side of}} the blade, forming a small [...] "hilt guard" [...] such as a fixed blade knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.|$|E
2500|$|Plant disease {{resistance}} {{is the result}} of coevolution between the plant and pathogen. During Ustilago scitaminea infection, the fungus grows within the meristematic tissue and induces formation of flowering structures, which it colonises to produce its teliopores. The flowering structures, usually typical grass panicles, are transformed into a whip-like sorus that grows rapidly and <b>protrudes</b> <b>out</b> between the leaf sheaths. The development of sugarcane smut depends on the interaction among environment, the sugarcane variety and the pathogen itself. If the interaction between smut-resistant varieties and the pathogen is nonaffinity, {{disease resistance}} occurs; however, if the interaction between smut-susceptible varieties and the pathogen is affinity, disease susceptibility occurs. A series of physiological and biochemical changes, together with the molecular response, occur during the period between the appearance of the stress on plant from the invasion of the pathogen and the subsequent plant-pathogen interaction. Progress has been made in studies of the molecular basis of sugarcane smut resistance. [...] According to one study, the type of resistance is a single gene resistance [...] at the N52/219 gene site. [...] Furthermore this study talked about several different strains or races of Ustilago scitaminea. [...] Despite what has been learned, more studies on the molecular interaction in this pathosystem are needed to discover the mechanisms of smut resistance.|$|E
