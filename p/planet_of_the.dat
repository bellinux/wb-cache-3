5|$|<b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes is a 2001 American {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren. The sixth film {{produced in the}} <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes franchise, it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel {{of the same name}} and the 1968 film version. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but {{with the help of an}} ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.|$|E
40|$|Out of all {{atmospheric}} processes on <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, special attention will be devoted here to leading circulation of planetary or global scales, known as Rossby waves. These waves occur in all rotating fluids that have relative {{movement to the}} rotation system. Rossby waves exert dominant influence on so-called global weather. Based on <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> some properties of Rossby waves are made approximate analysis of weather conditions on <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Also, these considerations can serve as an introduction to weather forecasting on the planet. ...|$|R

5|$|With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Burton {{was hired}} as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes was {{released}} to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised. Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes.|$|E
5|$|A prequel was {{released}} to iTunes on 1 September 2012, and to Zune and Amazon Video on 2 September 2012.

The messenger provides space-time coordinates {{to the planet}} Skaro, home <b>planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daleks.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989.

The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between May and July 1996, it references the symbiote {{invasion in}} <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Symbiotes as a symbiote-eating alien (the Xenophage) arrives {{on earth to}} hunt the remaining symbiotes. Scream returns as an anti-hero after the events of Venom: Separation Anxiety to protect the hosts of the invasion symbiotes. Venom is hunted by the police, who blame it for the murders committed by the Xenophage. Venom and Scream kill the Xenophage and escape their police pursuit.|$|E
50|$|If {{a planet}} is {{detectable}} {{by both the}} radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be determined, {{as well as its}} density.

5|$|Development for a <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes remake {{started as}} far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the {{pre-production}} stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, after 20th Century Fox had greenlit James Cameron's {{version of}} the film remake, the company's video game division, Fox Interactive, started {{planning}} a video game tie-in. The film project went on hold when Cameron pulled out, but Fox Interactive remained confident a remake would progress eventually and continued with the game. Fox contracted French company Visiware as developer; with the film on hold, the creators developed their own story inspired by Boulle's novel and the original films. The game is an action-adventure in which the player controls astronaut Ulysses after he crashes on the <b>Planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apes. The game was developed for PC and PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|On Athas, the <b>planet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand {{less than}} 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires {{at least a}} week to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} close {{proximity}} to their parent star, hot Neptunes have a much greater rate and chance of transiting their star as seen from a farther outlying point, than <b>planets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same mass in larger orbits. This increases <b>the</b> chances <b>of</b> discovering them by transit-based observation methods.|$|R
