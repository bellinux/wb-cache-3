40|$|This chapter {{provides}} introductory {{concepts that}} serve as an entry point into {{other parts of the}} book. The planning problems considered here are the simplest to describe because the state space will be finite in most cases. When it is not finite, it will at least be countably infinite (i. e., a unique integer may be assigned to every state). Therefore, no geometric models or differential equations will be needed to characterize the discrete planning problems. Furthermore, no forms of uncertainty will be considered, which avoids complications such as probability theory. All models are completely known and predictable. There are three main <b>parts</b> to this <b>chapter.</b> <b>Sections</b> 2. 1 and 2. 2 define and present search methods for feasible planning, in which the only concern is to reach a goal state. The search methods will be used throughout the book in numerous other contexts, including motion planning in continuous state spaces. Following feasible planning, Section 2. 3 addresses the problem of optimal planning. The principle of optimality, or the dynamic programming principle, [1] provides a key insight that greatly reduces the computation effort in many planning algorithms...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The present chapter {{deals with}} the studies carried out in recent years at the University of Genoa, Italy, {{concerning}} the use of membrane contactors for air dehumidification and their integration into air-conditioning plants {{in order to improve}} the performances of heat pumps, thereby saving energy. In the first <b>part</b> of this <b>chapter</b> (<b>sections</b> 2 - 6) experimental and numerical studies regarding air dehumidification by means of hydrophobic membrane contactors and LiCl desiccant solutions are reported. Desiccant-membrane systems offer several potential benefits: large working membrane area per unit volume; no carryover of liquid-phase droplets; no pollution of the liquid phase by atmospheric dust; good dehumidification efficiency, and potential high-efficiency control {{of the quality of the}} handled air. Specifically, experimental tests on a plane-plate cross-flow membrane contactor prototype, made up of composite PTFE membranes fixed to PP supports, are described. A FORTRAN computer code able to study the behaviour of the contactor has been developed. Theoretical analysis involves mass and energy equations for both air and liquid desiccant. Moreover, heat and vapour mass fluxes through the membrane have been analysed. The agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data has been discussed. The possibility of using membrane contactors in air-conditioning systems is discussed in the second <b>part</b> of the <b>chapter</b> (<b>sections</b> 7 - 10). Specifically, the performances of a hybrid air-conditioning system in which a vapour-compression inverse cycle is integrated with an air dehumidification system working with membrane contactors and a hygroscopic solution have been investigated. This plant may be a valid alternative to traditional summertime air-conditioning systems, in which the air is cooled to below its dew-point temperature and subsequently reheated. The advantage of the hybrid system lies in the fact that the refrigeration device operates at a higher evaporation temperature than that of a traditional system, in which dehumidification is achieved through condensation. The proposed hybrid system involves simultaneously cooling and dehumidifying the air conveyed to the conditioned space in an air-solution membrane contactor. An LiCl solution is cooled by means of a vapour-compression inverse cycle using the refrigerant KLEA 410 A. The solution is regenerated in another membrane contactor by exploiting the heat exchanged by the condenser. A SIMULINK calculation programme was specially designed in order to simulate the system under examination in steady-state conditions. The performances of the system were analysed on varying the most significant operating parameters and were compared with those of a traditional air-conditioning plant in a typical case-study of summertime air-conditioning. The results of the simulations revealed significant energy savings, which, in particular operating conditions, may exceed 50...|$|R
