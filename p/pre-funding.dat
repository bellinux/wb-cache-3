50|$|The {{same reasons}} that make <b>pre-funding</b> a {{possible}} benefit to an employee {{participating in a}} plan make them a potential risk to employers setting up a plan. The employer has {{to make up the}} difference that the employee has spent from the flexible spending account but not yet contributed if other employees' contributions do not account for the money spent. The amount the employer loses due to <b>pre-funding</b> may eventually be partially, totally, or more than made up by employees that do not spend all of the money in their FSA account by the end of the plan year and grace period (see above).|$|E

50|$|Also in 2012, a {{small company}} called Plastic Imagination! {{announced}} Rise of the Beasts, a forthcoming line of minifigures with articulated arms and necks inspired by the original 1980s toys. The project launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, but the Kickstarter was cancelled <b>pre-funding</b> due to factory issues. In August 2014, factory test shots were posted as an update to the Kickstarter project and an estimated release date of full production figures was given as November or December 2014.

Changes to the original design include articulation at the neck, shoulders and waist, instead of just at the shoulders. Also the joints are using Glyos pegs.|$|E
50|$|One {{significant}} {{evolution of}} the leasing industry involved the collateralization of lease obligations in sale leaseback transactions. For example, a city would sell an asset to a bank. The bank would require lease payments and give the city an option to repurchase the asset. The lease obligations were low enough (due to the depreciation deductions the banks were now claiming) that the city could pay for the lease obligations and fund the repurchase of the asset by depositing most {{but not all of}} the sale proceeds in an interest-bearing account. This resulted in the city having <b>pre-funded</b> all of its lease obligations as well as its option to repurchase the asset from the bank for less than the amount received in the initial sale of the asset, in which case the city would be left with additional cash after having <b>pre-funded</b> all of its lease obligations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{possible and}} proposed {{responses to the}} “To Big (complex, interconnected, important) To Fail (TBTF) Problem”. It argues that the corporate governance of large shareholderowned deposit taking banks is particularly problematic because of the implicit insurance their shareholders and bondholders enjoy, at the taxpayers expense. This creates issues of moral hazard and also competitive inequality, because TBTF banks can raise funds more cheaply than non-TBTF banks. The US <b>pre-funded</b> deposit insurance scheme with risk-related premia does {{a pretty good job}} managing the moral hazard issues relating to non-TBTF banks. A parallel mechanism involving a special resolution regime for TBTF banks and the equivalent of deposit insurance with risk-related premia needs to be put in place. Whether the scheme should be <b>pre-funded</b> or operated on a ex post „polluter pays‟ basis, and the associated tax regime for TBTF banks needs further consideration. Bondholders should not enjoy the current level of protection and „Co-Co‟ bonds may be part of the solution. Consumer Protection is a good idea and deposit taking banks should be regulated as other „utilities‟ are in the UK. The corporate governance problem would be simpler if all retail deposit taking banks were mutual...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{expedite}} construction and relieve traffic pressures, the city agreed to <b>pre-fund</b> {{construction of the}} realignment by Peet, enabling the road to be completed and opened midway through 2006. Prior {{to the opening of}} this realignment however, the extension of Joondalup Drive from Wanneroo Road to Neaves Road was also completed and opened to traffic. This in turn caused a large number of heavy westbound vehicles to deviate through local roads within Banksia Grove to connect with Joondalup Drive.|$|R
50|$|One {{stipulation}} of the PAEA {{has caused}} controversy. It stipulates that the USPS {{is to make}} payments of $5.4 - $5.8 billion into the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, each year, from 2007 to 2016 in order to prefund 50 years of estimated costs. This requirement also explicitly stated that the USPS was to stop using its savings to reduce postal debt, which was stipulated in Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003. This is in addition to deductions from pay for federal contribution to social services. This <b>pre-funding</b> method is unique to the USPS. In June 2011, the USPS had to suspend its weekly payment of 115 million into the fund because it had reached 8 billion dollars in debt and the retirement plan had a surplus of 6.9 billion dollars.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the period}} 1996-97, Rutkowski {{led the team}} of Polish reformers (i.a. Marek Góra, Wojciech Misiąg, Aleksandra Wiktorow, Andrzej Bratkowski, Krzysztof Pater, Agnieszka Chłoń-Domińczak, Ryszard Petru) that {{prepared}} a path-breaking pension reform package in Poland. The reform entailed a move away from a traditional [...] defined-benefit pension system towards a modern and self-sustainable system based on principles of defined contributions and partial <b>pre-funding.</b> With strong support of the Plenipotentiaries for Pension Reform (Andrzej Bączkowski and Jerzy Hausner) and ministers of finance (Grzegorz Kołodko and Marek Belka) the first laws of the reform package were passed in 1997, and the second batch in 1998 (with Ewa Lewicka as the Plenipotentiary, Leszek Balcerowicz as the minister of finance, and Marek Góra as Rutkowski's successor {{as director of the}} Office for Social Security Reform) to clear the way for the new pension reform to start on January 1, 1999.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} ageing and makes a case for partial <b>pre-funding</b> of pensions. The argument is based on inter-generational fairness {{in a situation where}} pension expenditure as compared to wages increases due to low fertility and increasing longevity. We illustrate the approach by using data representing a typical EU Candidate Country of Central and Eastern Europe with a relatively high pension replacement rate. <b>Pre-funding</b> can take place within the public sector or in a privatised second pillar. We emphasise the need for a consistent framework to cover the many different institutional options available for pension financing. Pension system reform, partial <b>pre-funding,</b> ageing...|$|E
50|$|For {{pension plan}} sponsors, target {{benefits}} plan provide more flexibility than traditional defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans provide {{a high degree}} of benefit certainty for members, but for plan sponsors contribution rates are more uncertain and funding costs can be high. Defined benefit plans can also contribute to intergeneration inequality, as retired members continue to receive benefits, whether or not those benefits were adequately <b>pre-funded.</b> The reverse is true for defined contribution plans where the contribution certainty comes at the cost of complete benefit uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Superannuation Fund is a {{sovereign}} wealth fund in New Zealand.

5000|$|The {{design of}} a {{compulsory}} retirement savings scheme was drawn up {{as part of the}} coalition agreement between the National Party and New Zealand First following the 1996 general election. The proposed scheme was put to a referendum in 1997 and rejected by 92 per cent of votes, with only 8 per cent in favour. A move to a partially <b>pre-funded</b> or [...] "smoothed pay-as-you-go" [...] system was made with the creation of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund under the leadership of Labour Minister of Finance Michael Cullen in 2001.|$|R
40|$|Public {{policy makers}} are talking of a looming crisis in public pension arrangements. They {{emphasize}} demographic developments {{combined with the}} Pay-As-You-Go nature of public pension schemes. Their solution usually involves a reduction in benefits achieved by raising the retirement age, a move to <b>pre-funding,</b> and investing in equities. This paper examines the economic implications of such policies from an old Keynesian perspective. Such policies will not resolve the problem posed by having a large cohort of retirees, and may exacerbate it. <b>Pre-funding</b> could be deflationary and actually retard capital accumulation...|$|E
30|$|The {{key feature}} of {{changing}} the benefit design is to distinguish explicitly between the period insurance element and the <b>pre-funding</b> element of social benefits in addition to making any redistributive action outside the benefit scheme. While this may have limited bearing on the portability of benefits in disbursement, having a clearly identified <b>pre-funding</b> element should substantially ease portability for all social insurance-type benefits, except, perhaps, family benefits. For cash benefits, this is accommodated by the (partial or full) move from a defined benefit (DB) to a DC-type structure. DC benefits are inherently more portable than defined DBs.|$|E
40|$|Canada confronts {{an aging}} {{population}} {{in the form of}} the baby-boomers’retirement, an ever increasing lifespan and low past and current birth rates. The retirement system currently consists of a classical earnings based portion, the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (CPP), and a pure transfer portion, the Old-Age-Security program (OAS). The paper evaluates …nancial and welfare consequences of di¤erent retirement reforms that include a debt funded privatization of the CPP, as well as the evaluation of the <b>pre-funding</b> policy that overtaxes current generations to keep the CPP …nancially stable.

40|$|Public {{health and}} {{long-term}} care services are predominantly used by old people and financed by taxes paid by working-age people. Fluctuating sizes of generations create variations in tax rates, {{similar to what}} occurs in pension contribution rates. <b>Pre-funding</b> is a commonly suggested cure for this variation in pension systems: could and should expenditure on health and long-term care also be pre-funded, and if so to what degree? To address this question, we examine several <b>pre-funding</b> rules using Finland as an example. If {{the focus is on}} tax smoothing during the next few decades, an effective rule is a buffer fund whose construction is based on the current population forecast.

40|$|This paper evaluates intergenerational risk-sharing in {{the context}} of a <b>pre-funded</b> social {{security}} scheme. The central feature of the model is that labor-market distortions from risk-sharing transfers are explicitly taken into account. Equity risk manifests itself in the form of taxes and subsidies on the labor earnings of participants. The labor-supply choices of participants are assumed to be elastic with respect to wage-differentials, implying that risk-sharing transfers distort labor-supply choices. I show that labor-supply effects erode the gains from risk-sharing: financial shocks are primarily levied upon currently-living generations. The analysis thereby provides an economic justification for solvency rules that require pension funds to recover from their losses in a relatively short time-period...|$|R
