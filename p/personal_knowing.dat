Home confined consumers account for {{a significant percentage of}} the population that are termed disabled. Disability itself has not featured highly on the marketing and consumer behaviour research agenda, the case of home confinement has not been addressed. This research aims to contribute to understanding and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> about this population. The research adopted an interpretivist approach and drew on a radical constructivist epistemology to capture the lived experience and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> of home confinement. This methodology has not been employed within the consumer research discipline. Three individual cases of home confinement were explored over a two-year period by means of ongoing 'conversational' style interviews. This thesis argues that home confined consumers are actively involved in the identity construction process. The findings illustrate the diversity of the home confined experience, and the overriding need to establish an identity that is both in keeping with the personal reality of the lived experience, but, one that will equally establish an identity as stemming from an abelist perspective. The study accommodates the Consumer Response Model introduced recently into disability studies, which aims to capture the lived experience and is in keeping with the agenda of Consumer Culture Theory. This study also acknowledges the implications of the Transformatory Consumer Research agenda in relation to consumer wellbeing. Far from being the powerless, weak, and feeble consumers generally depicted in literature, the home confined consumers in this study overcome many barriers to consumption to remain active, powerful, independent agents of change, 'within' an abelist society. In conclusion, the study highlights survival consumption behaviour, in both physical and emotional terms, as the ability to capture not only abelism but also a non-institutionalized freedom.

40|$|Half {{a century}} after Michael Polanyi conceptualised ‘the tacit component’ in <b>personal</b> <b>knowing,</b> {{management}} studies has reinvented ‘tacit knowledge’—albeit in ways that squander the advantages of Polanyi’s insights and ignore his faith in ‘spiritual reality’. While tacit knowing challenged the absurdities of sheer objectivity, expressed in a ‘perfect language’, it fused rational knowing, based on personal experience, with mystical speculation about an un-experienced ‘external reality’. Faith alone saved Polanyi’s model from solipsism. But Ernst von Glasersfeld’s radical constructivism provides scope to rethink personal tacit knowing with regard to ‘other people’ and the intersubjectively viable construction of ‘experiential reality’. By separating tacit knowing from Polanyi’s metaphysical realism and drawing on Benedict Anderson’s concept of ‘imagined communities’, {{it is possible to}} conceptualise ‘imagined institutions’ as the tacit dimension of power that shapes human interaction.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to explore}} the connection between love and personal knowledge and what Jesus 2 ̆ 7 life and teaching reveal {{about the relationship between}} these. I want to distinguish that form of love or caring that makes relationships personal from those forms, like benevolence or compassion, where the concern is impersonal. It is commonly thought in contemporary Western culture that the autonomy necessary for mature moral agency or for the realization of one 2 ̆ 7 s unique personal identity is diminished by the influence of other persons. In contrast, I argue that the relational image of love, or agape, in the New Testament presents a conception of personal identity in which autonomy is found in and through intimate, personal relationships with God and others. Our identity is ultimately personal, that is, we are not fully who we are apart from being in relationships with others that are personal. A fresh examination of the New Testament image of love reveals a portrait of the self as one in which the capacities essential for personhood such as autonomy are not diminished through identification with God but instead are most fully realized. I argue that this identification involves a personal form of caring, one that is distinctly intimate, that when mutual constitutes a personal form of knowing. This personal knowledge is constituted by a particular pattern of engagement between persons and is more than the intellectual apprehension of propositions that are true about another person. I argue that directly engaging the New Testament {{as a part of a}} philosophical project is justified, in part, because adequately describing the moral character of this love requires a narrative. Only a story or exemplar can image in depth the volitional, desiderative, and emotional qualities of this love as well as its relational character. Moreover, I argue that joy is an essential emotional and desiderative component of this love and is necessary for intimate, <b>personal</b> <b>knowing.</b> I argue that this kind of <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> is capable of addressing the existential problem of meaning. On this account the human hunger for meaning, or significance, is one that finds its satisfaction not in theoretical or explanatory knowledge but in intimate, personal engagement with God and, through God, with others...|$|E

40|$|Research {{looking at}} tacit {{knowledge}} has been hindered {{by a lack}} of clarity regarding the relationship between explicitness and tacitness. Specifically, knowledge is commonly conceived of as possessing an explicit/tacit dichotomy, where it is either tacit or explicit, or continuous, where high (low) tacitness reflects low (high) explicitness. This paper extends work in the measurement of both explicit and tacit knowledge by employing overlooked aspects of Polanyi's epistemology. 225 knowledge source assessments are tested across 36 paired items. Results show strong support for separation between explicit and tacit knowledge constructs along with differential relatedness based upon the knowledge source under examination. Additionally, little support is found for a dichotomy, suggesting important implications for future research and practice. This paper uses Polanyi’s tacit and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> theories (Polanyi, 1958 a/ 1962, 1966) along with Searle’s work on intention and speech acts (Searle, 1969, 1983; Searle & Vanderveken, 1985) to empirically examine the argument that tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge are related but separate constructs. This paper addresses criticisms of the tacit knowledge dichotomy in knowledge-based research (Acar & Burns, 2001; Gerard, 2001; Gray, 2001; King & Zeithaml, 2001; Kogut & Zander, 1992) and builds a more comprehensive instrument for explicit and tacit knowledge’s examination in an effort to improve upon tacit knowledge’s utility and falsifiability (Bacharach, 1989). Because the items in this examination combine current conceptions of tacit knowledge in a unique manner, this study examines their content validity along with their content adequac...|$|E

Tutkimusaineisto hankittiin haastattelemalla lasten vanhempia ja ammattilaisia, keräämällä lasten sairauskertomustietoja sekä kuvanauhoittamalla lasten lääkärinvastaanottokäyntejä. Pitkäaikaistutkimuksessa käytettiin kvalitatiivisia ja myös kvantitatiivista analyysia. Tutkimus toteutettiin pääkaupunkiseudulla kehittävän työntutkimuksen hankkeen yhteydessä, jossa kehitettiin uusi yhteistoimintaa tukeva työväline ­ hoitosopimus. Lapsen hoidon kokonaisuus on usein vain hänen vanhempiensa tiedossa ja eri organisaatioissa toimivat ammattilaiset jäävät muualla annetusta hoidosta tietämättömäksi. Tämä aiheuttaa ongelmia tiedonkulussa, vastuun jakamisessa ja keskinäisessä luottamuksessa. Hoitosopimuksella tuotettiin yhteisen potilaan hoitoon yliorganisatorista jatkuvuutta muun muassa tiedonvälitys tehostui, päätöksenteko sai ennakoivia, kommunikatiivisia ja toisen hoitotahon toimintamahdollisuuksia parantavia piirteitä. Terveydenhuoltojärjestelmässämme pitkäaikaissairaan potilaan hoito voi jakautua useaan eri työyksikköön ja monelle ammattilaiselle. Nykyiset toimintarutiinit tukevat hyvää ja sujuvaa hoitoa organisaatioiden sisällä, mutta yliorganisatorinen hoito kangertelee. Terveydenhuollossa tulisikin pohtia tarvitaanko yhä tarkemmin standardoitua osaamisen jakamista vai keinoja, joilla luodaan toimivia suhteita ja yksilöllisesti improvisoituja ratkaisuja monisairaiden potilaiden yhteishoitoon. Institutional {{practice}} connecting patients, {{primary and}} secondary medical care is culturally and historically developed and takes place as daily routines. Still the actors treating the same patient {{have an opportunity to}} improvise their actions in the care-network. Collaborative activity across the organizational boundaries is studied here as a relation between children's parents, primary care physicians and hospital specialists who are taking into use a new co-operative tool called the care-agreement. The care-agreement was collectively developed in a project of the Children's Hospital. The research data of this study was collected during the project in 1997 ­ 1999. This is a longitudinal research with a naturally occurring ethnographic data that consists of a tape-recorded patients visits to hospital and primary care, interviews of the 16 child patients parents (24) and interviews of health care professionals (72) treating the children, plus each patient's medical files from every care provider including (561) doctor s appointment. The analysis of the data is done by using mostly qualitative, but also quantitative methods. Sociology of medicine and Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research are the theoretical framework of the study. Collaborative activity is investigated through referral practices, care responsibility, power, trust and object sharing within the personal and institutional relations of the partners involved in the child's care. Care responsibility was unclear and embraced contradictory accounts when the care was divided within a network. Multiple medical problems and fragmented health care systems are not producing continuity of management for an individual patient's care, if {{there is a lack of}} <b>personal</b> <b>knowing,</b> or of organizational tools for cooperation. The care-agreement prompted a wide range of new justifications of responsibility and made data transmission significantly better than before. It also brought a new kind of exchange between the partners like reciprocity of relationships and empowering. Historical analysis of the collaborative activity puts the critical pathways, continuity and care-processes into a new light - standardized and organizationally managed-care is not enough. There is a need for <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> and individual solutions as well when the patient's care is divided across levels of care. This study points out that it is possible to change clinical decision-making practices towards a collaboratively shared object of work through socially constructed artefacts. In other words, health care professional might act perfectly in their own organizations but their actions or non-actions always have unintended or intended affects on their colleagues in other organizations and on the care available to a patient...|$|E
40|$|Nursing {{has long}} been {{described}} as both an art and a science. More recently referred to as holistic practice, many nursing faculty have sought innovative teaching strategies, such as storytelling, to facilitate understanding of these two critical dimensions. As {{one of the oldest}} methods of communication, storytelling has been used {{in a variety of ways}} to facilitate learning in health care. In fact, there is a myriad of literature demonstrating the use of stories in nursing research, practice, and education. Despite these many examples however, there are no studies that analyze the actual content of students’ stories from a scholarly perspective. This dissertation seeks to further explore the benefits of storytelling and add to this dialogue by lending scholarly support for its use as a teaching strategy in nursing education. Using Carper’s (1978) original four Fundamental Patterns of Knowing as a guiding framework for narrative analysis, twenty-five personal stories written by junior level nursing students were examined for evidence of empirics, ethics, esthetics, and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing.</b> The study found many rich examples of patterns of knowing were threaded throughout the student’s stories. Additionally, by examining their own stories, students were able imagine their future role as practicing nurses and how they might one day react in similar circumstances. This is an important finding as much of nursing knowledge develops over time with ongoing patient care experiences. Stories then serve as a bridge for novice nursing students linking empirical and ethical discussions of the typical classroom with the art of practice embedded in personal and esthetic knowing. Lastly, this dissertation also addresses the benefits of storytelling to nursing faculty. By creating a safe space within their classrooms for students to share their personal experiences, teachers begin to move beyond the more customary empirical focus traditionally found in nursing education programs. Carper (1978) would consider this a therapeutic use of self and as such an important segue into helping both students and faculty experience the reciprocity needed for self-actualization and personal growth. Moreover, as faculty approach students and teaching with a more holistic stance, they can develop the congruence necessary for their own integrated knowing...|$|E

UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS, AMHERST Ph. D. UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS, AMHERST Directed by Genevieve Chandler ABSTRACT The {{changes in}} the {{healthcare}} environment, safety concerns of the practice setting and patient acuity has supported reform and research to identify areas for improvement (IOM, 2001, 2003). The Carnegie Foundation’s Educating Nurses, A Call for Radical Transformation (Benner, P., Sutphen, M., Leonard, V. 2 ̆ 6 Day, L., 2010) explored the state of American nursing education. Among the findings are: patient safety issues, higher patient acuity, the increased complexity of nurse’s work, shortages of nursing faculty and clinical learning sites, the current and predicted shortages of registered nurses, and the chaotic, fragmented hospital work environment. The call to action is to improve patient care through transforming the education of undergraduate nursing students. This study is a qualitative exploration of how nursing students develop practice knowledge in their undergraduate clinical experience. Clinical practice knowledge development is explored using the epistemological concepts of the discipline of nursing- empirics, aesthetics, ethics and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> as described by Carper (1978), unknowing by Munhall (1984) and sociopolitical knowing as described by White (1995). The study utilized individual interviews exploring the learning processes of developing nursing practice knowledge by undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students from UMASS at Amherst who have had clinical experiences in both a Dedicated Education Unit (DEU) and non-DEU clinical settings. Change {{in the education of}} nurses must be guided by research to support best practices. Clinical education is a crucial aspect of the practice development of student nurses. The development of nursing knowledge comes together in a model of Synergistic Clinical Education, incorporating the identified attributes supporting learning: the student, learning environments and relationships. This study supports the utilization of Dedicated Education Units as a clinical education model providing an optimal learning environment in which the development of nursing knowledge and clinical practice is more likely to happen than in any other clinical experience setting.

Data consisted of thel 6 transcribed dialogues, participants 2 ̆ 7 written summaries of self-love in healing, and participants 2 ̆ 7 selections of music, artwork and prose. Van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s method for thematic analysis, Drew 2 ̆ 7 s method for the {{development and use of}} a researcher 2 ̆ 7 s synthesis of intentionality, and phenomenological writing as method were used to analyze data. ^ Three major themes were identified (1) The Happening-Realizing of Self-love in Healing; (2) Discovering Self-love through Transformative Life Experiences; and (3) The Feeling-Being of Self-love in Healing. Theme # 1 involved two sub-themes: (a) realizing one 2 ̆ 7 s holistic self, and (b) awakening to one 2 ̆ 7 s spirit. Theme # 2 involved 4 sub-themes: (a) journaling, (b) leaving home or going away to college, (c) engaging in therapy, and (d) experiencing critical, abusive, or nurturing relationships. The last major theme comprised 3 sub-themes: (a) empowered freedom, (b) authenticity-strength, and (c) peace-harmony-joy. ^ Self-love was understood as a dynamic, holistic phenomenon of healing, authenticity and existential human being. Self-love in healing was an experience of enduring self-acceptance, perseverance and fully, freely participating in being. Self-love in healing was described as a feeling and awareness that involved meaningful and poignant self-realizations. These realizations were accompanied by visceral sensations and emotions that as a gestalt, created a peaceful, empowering transcendent experience. Self-love may be considered a tangible conduit to the soul. Findings were congruent with existential holistic perspectives of human being, healing, self-transcendence, expanding consciousness, authenticity, and spirituality. Implications for nursing concern self-love as a philosophy for holistic practice, particularly for self-awareness, <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> and therapeutic use of self. Further study and research will contribute to the refinement of these basic ideas, and {{to the development of a}} fully matured model of self-love as healing energy. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} used grounded theory methodology (GTM) {{to construct a}} conceptualization of personal knowledge within a knowledge management (KM) perspective. The need for the {{current research}} {{was based on the}} use of just two categories of knowledge, explicit and tacit, within KM literature to explain diverse characteristics of personal knowledge. The construct of tacit knowledge has often been explicated and debated in KM literature. The debate over tacit knowledge arose from the complex epistemological roots of tacit knowing and the construct of tacit knowledge popularized by organizational knowledge creation theory. The ongoing debate over tacit knowledge in KM literature has shed little light on personal knowledge within a KM perspective. The current research set aside the debate over tacit knowledge and pursued the construct of personal knowledge {{from the perspective of the}} knower using GTM. Thirty-seven interviews were conducted with fourteen participants. Interviews were audio recorded and coding was accomplished with the qualitative data analysis software MAXQDA. A total of eight categories were identified. These were organized into two groups. The core category being overwhelmed represented the absence of personal knowledge. The categories questioning self, seeking help, and microthinking fit under being overwhelmed. Together these categories were inverse indicators because they all decreased as knowledge acquisition progressed. The core category being confident represented the presence of personal knowledge. The categories remembering, multitasking, and speed fit under being overwhelmed. Together these categories were direct indicators because they all increased as knowledge acquisition progressed. Three significant conclusions were drawn from the current research. These conclusions led to the conceptualization of personal knowledge from a KM perspective. The first significant conclusion was the conceptualization of a process of knowing as Integrated Complexity: From Overwhelmed to Confident (ICOC). The second significant conclusion was <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> as first-person epistemology is a universally lived experience that includes commitments to internal and external requirements as well as a bias toward integration. The third significant conclusion was personal knowledge can be viewed as a complex adaptive system.

40|$|Sepsis is a devastating, {{life-threatening}} {{disease and}} {{a major problem for}} many newborns; it develops rapidly and requires expertise to identify the early, subtle signs to prevent death or disability. Evidence from nursing practice and philosophic inquiry indicates that nurses use diverse ways of knowing in their assessments. The purpose of this research was to address research questions concerning two areas: 1) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) nurses’ patterns of knowing in the assessment of infants with sepsis as related to dimensions of nursing practice; and 2) Test the psychometric properties of the Newborn Scale of Sepsis (SOS) as a diagnostic or assessment tool. The theoretical framework incorporated the epistemological theories of nurses Carper and Benner and philosopher of science Nagel. This study employed a prospective, correlational design with a convenience sample of 119 NICU nurses. Twenty-eight of these nurses also completed the Newborn SOS to document their assessments of 62 newborns for sepsis. Two instruments were used: 1) The 16 -item norm-referenced Nursing Patterns of Knowing (POK) scale (ɑ =. 82 and item-scale correlations ≥ 0. 33), and 2) The 13 -item Newborn Scale of Sepsis (SOS), developed to assist the novice nurse to assess for signs of sepsis (ɑ =. 65 and interrater reliability of 96. 3 %). Descriptive, psychometric, and correlational analyses were applied to the research questions. Results indicated that the more clinically experienced NICU nurses used a more integrated pattern of knowing when assessing newborns for signs of sepsis. The more experienced and competent nurses incorporated empirical, aesthetic and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing</b> in their assessments. More experienced nurses also used less authority-based knowing. More diversity in work experiences was negatively correlated with the sociopolitical pattern of knowing. Psychometric properties of the Newborn SOS indicated that, while its sensitivity was very good, its low specificity limited its usefulness as a diagnostic tool. It was concluded that the Newborn SOS can be used to assist novice nurses in developing pattern recognition of newborn sepsis. The Nursing POK has strong potential for use {{in a wide variety of}} studies examining nursing patterns of knowing in assessment of critical health conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{exploratory study}} sought to explore and analyse the perceptions of first year nursing students aged 18 - 25 years toward older persons in aged care facilities. The expectations of first year nursing students in relation to performing nursing care on older persons was also examined. The students’ perceptions were explored using a photo-elicitation technique to evoke an emotive response. By challenging and confronting the participants with realistic photographs of nursing care, this technique encouraged the research participants to engage in anticipatory reflection prior to their first aged care clinical placement. Data were gathered through demographic questionnaires and semi-structured photo-elicitation interviews. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis. Themes included dissecting {{what it means to}} be a nurse, recognising dependence, and the re-visioning of therapeutic relationships including considering patient dignity and empathising with older persons. A youthful reflection on the differences between young and old included participants’ fearing for themselves in future, and this was another identified theme. The photo-elicitation technique challenged and confronted participants as they became aware of the responsibilities of performing nursing care and their belief that they lacked emotional preparedness. Experiencing sensitivity and awkwardness to nakedness of older person’s bodies was also highlighted by most of the participants’ responses. The findings suggest that it is essential in this time of demographic change and the growing ageing population that nursing education responds to the challenge of an evolving health care system by providing qualified, experienced aged care nurses who are familiar with the reality of older people. Therefore, first year nursing students’ transition to aged care nursing clinical placement and the adoption of positive attitudes is paramount. Despite a large number of research studies highlighting nursing students’ disinterest in caring for older persons, there have been few studies investigating educational interventions that could assist in overcoming this negative trend. The findings from this study have important implications for teaching strategies aimed at understanding undergraduate nursing students. Using photography to elicit emotional responses can also assist with reflective practice, which can be useful to enhance self awareness and an aesthetic and <b>personal</b> <b>knowing.</b> Encouraging anticipatory reflection can help socially prepare nursing students, increase their readiness for learning and foster more positive attitudes to caring for older people prior to the students’ initial aged care clinical placement...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the essence of gerontology nursing. This project sought to look beyond the practical tasks and skills of gerontology nursing to reveal what is more than meets the eye and thereby explicate the essence of gerontological nursing practice. Gerontology nursing is troubled by its unpopular status and negative image that in turn has serious implications for the recruitment and retention of nurses who are both willing and able to work in this field of nursing. The purpose for doing this study was to unveil a deeper meaning and understanding of gerontology nursing, thus contributing to its value and worth as a speciality area of nursing. Conversations with four gerontology nurses were taped, transcribed and then analysed using van Manen’s (1990) approach to researching lived experience. From the analysis, four cardinal elements emerged: true acceptance, <b>personal</b> <b>knowing,</b> being present, and being alive. Those four cardinal elements were reworked and further analysed to reveal three central aspects or essences of gerontology nursing. These essences were the centrality of temporality, the interconnectedness of human relationships, and the significance of the lived body. Temporality is demonstrated by nursing application of objective, or clock time, as well as subjectively in regards to the lived time of the clients. Interconnectedness is the lived human relationship between nurse and client and is represented by commitment, presencing/giving of self, connecting, and knowing the client holistically. The third essence is corporeality, which is portrayed by the gerontology nurses’ distinguishing characteristics and their perception of the lived body of the nursed. The final analysis unveiled caring for the body, the act of seeing, and the joy of care as emergent essences of gerontology nursing. Language of nursing in relationship to ‘basic nursing care’ is critiqued for its potential to devalue gerontology nursing and, by association, old people. The significance of these findings is that there is more than meets the eye in gerontology nursing, however, it is not widely known. To balance the abundance of literature about the science of gerontology nursing practice more research needs to be focused on the art. Establishing and disseminating a clearer, complete picture of gerontology nursing would go toward not only changing its negative image, but may also address recruitment and retention issues. Furthermore, this study has highlighted the need to recruit nurses who possess the necessary personal attributes to ensure they ‘fit’ into gerontology nursing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the theory of}} knowledge in relativistic terms of Paul Feyerabend, stressing the importance of personal involvement in the research and theorizing. Since the topic is a constant and widely accepted premise the author is insisting {{that it has been}} actually ignored in the sociology and philosophy of science. It is apparent in discursive form, neglected in actual consequences for science in general. Defending the thesis of relativism had remained unacknowledged by the general scientific community. Biographies of mavericks and their struggle and exclusion from scientific community etc. had been constant in the history of science. Is science nowadays able to accept criticism and implement arguments of knowledge beyond the institutionalized standards? Throughout this article we argue that personal involvement creates biased scientific facts; acknowledging and applying tacit knowledge we move beyond personal involvement and create appropriate interpretations of facts and phenomena under investigation, where we reconsider the construction of facts and <b>personal</b> beliefs, <b>knowing</b> that our fields of expertise are incommensurable...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} with expert {{nurses in}} the UK how nursing wisdom {{can be developed}} in new and junior nurses. Carper's patterns of knowing and Benner's novice-to-expert continuum formed the theoretical framework. Employing a constructionist research methodology with participant engagement in co-construction of findings, data were collected via two separate cycles comprising four consecutive sessions followed by a nationally-advertised mini-conference. Empirical, ethical, <b>personal,</b> and aesthetic <b>knowing</b> were considered evident in junior nurses. Junior nurses in the UK seem to lack a previously-unrecognized domain of organizational knowing without which they cannot overcome hegemonic barriers to the successful development of nursing praxis...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{our understanding}} of how knowing creates value. It contributes to the interactionist perspectives on knowledge in three particular ways: first, it recognizes that knowledge is only valuable when it is enacted, i. e. know-how-in-action (KHiA). Second, it develops a typology of value creating options, i. e. clones, talent rich, resource rich and synergists, which represent multiple options that we can enact. These value creating types are sensitive to the socio-systemic and <b>personal</b> nature of <b>knowing.</b> Finally, it addresses the power dynamics within each value creating option. This lens re-introduces the individual power dynamics which impact on future value-creating processes...|$|R
