While at Brighton, Cowan started a <b>physiotherapy</b> business based near the Goldstone Ground.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails <b>physiotherapy</b> and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|<b>Physiotherapy</b> {{interventions}} include strength, {{endurance and}} gait training with graduated increases in mobility, maintenance of posture and alignment {{as well as}} joint function.

The injury is considered common in the athletes, and it was being treated with <b>physiotherapy.</b> Due to the problem, in the Men's 50 metre butterfly, Cielo struggled though the heats and the semifinals, but slumped to 6th in the final. On August 5, Cielo left the competition due to the increase of his injury.|$|E
5|$|The International Zone {{served as}} {{the hub of the}} Games Village, {{offering}} retail and entertainment services as well as a rendezvous location for visitors and Games participants.

25|$|Several {{mechanical}} techniques {{are used to}} dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest <b>physiotherapy</b> is used; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to loosen up secretions. Chest <b>physiotherapy</b> is beneficial for short-term airway clearance. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, {{as well as a}} vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.|$|E

25|$|Clearance of {{bronchial}} secretions {{is essential}} for good pulmonary health and can help limit injury from acute and chronic lung infections. Children and adults with increased bronchial secretions can benefit from routine chest therapy using the manual method, an a cappella device or a chest <b>physiotherapy</b> vest. Chest <b>physiotherapy</b> can help bring up mucous from the lower bronchial tree, however an adequate cough is needed to remove secretions. In people who have decreased lung reserve and a weak cough, use of an insufflator-exsufflator (cough-assist) device may be useful as a maintenance therapy or during acute respiratory illnesses to help remove bronchial secretions from the upper airways. Evaluation by a Pulmonology specialist however, should first be done to properly assess patient suitability.|$|E
