At the time, CAE, Continental Motor's turbine engine subsidiary, had developed the T65, a small turboshaft engine which was being considered by Bell for its new Model 206 helicopter.

25|$|The La-15 had a barrel-like fuselage, shoulder-mounted swept wings with 6 degrees anhedral, and {{stabilizers}} mounted {{high on the}} fin, {{almost a}} T-tail. It was popular with pilots because of its easy handling and reliability, and its pressurized cockpit was an advantage at high altitude. Nevertheless, official enthusiasm for the La-15 was mild, largely {{because it was a}} complex design that required complicated and expensive <b>production</b> <b>tooling.</b> Only 235 La-15s were built, serving with the Soviet Air Force until 1953.|$|E
500|$|Within {{two months}} of the project cancellation, all aircraft, engines, <b>production</b> <b>tooling</b> and {{technical}} data were ordered scrapped.

500|$|In 2010, USAF {{initiated}} {{a study to}} determine the costs of retaining F-22 tooling for a future Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). A RAND Corporation paper from this study estimated that restarting production and building an additional 75 F-22s would cost $17billion, resulting in $227million per aircraft, or $54million higher than the flyaway cost. [...] Lockheed Martin stated that restarting the production line itself would cost about $200million. <b>Production</b> <b>tooling</b> will be documented in illustrated electronic manuals stored at the Sierra Army Depot. Retained tooling will produce additional components; due to the limited production run there are no reserve aircraft, leading to considerable care during maintenance.

500|$|Unlike most {{previous}} projects, {{there were}} to be no prototypes. Under the [...] "development batch" [...] procedure pioneered by the Americans (and also used by English Electric for the Lightning), there would instead be a development batch of nine airframes, to be built using production jigs. The choice of proceeding to <b>production</b> <b>tooling</b> turned out to be another source of delay, with the first aircraft having to adhere to strict production standards or deal with the bureaucracy of attaining concessions to allow them to exhibit differences from later airframes. Four years into the project, the first few airframes had effectively become prototypes in all but name, exhibiting a succession of omissions from the specification and differences from the intended pre-production and production batches.|$|E
2500|$|Morattab, an SUV {{manufacturer}} {{based in}} Tehran, Iran, {{has produced the}} Herour, a clone of the Series, since 1962. The currently produced models are versions of the [...] "Series IV" [...] made by Santana Motor of Spain until the early 1990s, when the <b>production</b> <b>tooling</b> and design were sold to Morattab and shipped to Iran. As such unlicensed Morattab clones differ significantly from the final Series III built by Land Rover in the United Kingdom. For example, Series IV models have parabolic leaf springs, one-piece windscreens and fully fitted interiors. Morattab also fits locally built 1.8-litre 4-cylinder petrol engines derived from Nissan instead of the 2.25-litre 4-cylinder or 3.3-litre 6-cylinder engines fitted to the Santana Series IV.|$|E
2500|$|The Dash 80 {{fuselage}} {{was wide}} enough at [...] for five-abreast seating; two {{on one side}} of the aisle and three on the other. The fuselage diameter for the production KC-135 was widened to [...] and Boeing originally hoped to build the 707 fuselage with that width. By the time the Boeing company committed to production, the decision had been made to design the production model 707 as a six-abreast design, with a larger [...] diameter fuselage, after C.R. Smith, CEO of American Airlines, told Boeing he wouldn't buy the 707 unless it was an inch wider than the then-proposed Douglas DC-8 passenger jet. This decision did not unduly delay introduction of the production model since the -80 had been largely hand-built, using little <b>production</b> <b>tooling.</b>|$|E
