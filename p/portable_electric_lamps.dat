5000|$|In {{several of}} Jules Verne's science-fiction novels, {{so-called}} [...] "Ruhmkorff lamps" [...] are mentioned. These were an early form of <b>portable</b> <b>electric</b> <b>lamp.</b> The lamp {{consisted of a}} Geissler tube that was excited by a battery-powered Ruhmkorff induction coil. Initially the lamp generated white light by using a Geissler tube filled with carbon dioxide. However, the carbon dioxide tended to break down. Hence in later lamps, the Geissler tube was filled with nitrogen (which generated red light), and the glass was replaced with glass containing uranium salts (which fluoresced with a green light).|$|R

Saturday afternoon. The chimneys of Lincoln's Inn and the western sky beyond are seen through the window. There is a double writing table {{in the middle of the}} room, with a cigar box, ash pans, and a <b>portable</b> <b>electric</b> reading <b>lamp</b> almost snowed up in heaps of papers and books. This table has knee holes and chairs right and left and is very untidy. The clerk's desk, closed and tidy, with its high stool, is against the wall, near a door communicating with the inner rooms. In the opposite wall is the door leading to the public corridor. Its upper panel is of opaque glass, lettered in black on the outside, FRASER AND WARREN. A baize screen hides the corner between this door and the window.] ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{dry cell}} battery was invented in 1887. Unlike {{previous}} batteries, it used a paste electrolyte instead of a liquid. This was the first battery suitable for portable electrical devices, as it did not spill or break easily and worked in any orientation. The first mass-produced dry cell batteries came in 1896, and the invention of <b>portable</b> <b>electric</b> lights soon followed. <b>Portable</b> hand-held <b>electric</b> lights offered advantages in convenience and safety over (combustion) torches, candles and lanterns. The <b>electric</b> <b>lamp</b> was odorless, smokeless, and emitted less heat than combustion-powered lighting. It could be instantly turned on and off, and avoided fire risk.|$|R
5000|$|Gustave Trouvé next invented his “Photophore”, or {{battery-powered}} frontal headlamp, {{which he}} developed for a client, Dr Paul Hélot, an ear-nose-and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct shaft, lighting {{system could be}} oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouvé soon modified their frontal headlamp both for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as “luminous electric jewels” and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.In 1884, Trouvé fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport. He developed a <b>portable</b> <b>electric</b> safety <b>lamp.</b> [...] In 1887, Trouvé, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: εὕρηκα =“I have found”, translated into French “J’ai trouvé), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887).Around the same period, Trouvé, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. [...] He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy {{but at the time}} unheard-of flight of 80 meters.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} {{tungsten}} filaments replaced carbon that a <b>portable</b> <b>electric</b> light became a reality. An early pioneer was Joseph Swan who exhibited his first lamp in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1881 [...] and improved ones in subsequent years. The Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines set up in 1881 carried out extensive tests {{of all types of}} lamps and the final report in 1886 noted that there had been good progress made in producing <b>electric</b> <b>lamps</b> giving a light superior to that of oil lamps and expected economic and efficient lamps to become available soon. This {{turned out not to be}} the case and progress was slow in attaining reliability and economy. The Sussmann lamp [...] was introduced into Britain in 1893 and following trials at Murton Colliery in Durham it became a widely used <b>electric</b> <b>lamp</b> with 3000 or so reported by the company in use in 1900 [...] However, by 1910 there were only 2055 <b>electric</b> <b>lamps</b> of all types in use - about 0.25% of all safety lamps. [...] In 1911, an anonymous colliery owner, through the British government, offered a prize of £1000 (...) for the best lamp to specified requirements. There were 195 entries. It was won by a German engineer with the CEAG lamp, which was hand-held and delivered twice the illumination of oil lamps, with a battery life of 16 hours. Awards were made to 8 other lamps that met the judges' criteria. Clearly this stimulated development and over the next few years there was a marked increase in the use of <b>electric</b> <b>lamps,</b> especially the CEAG, Gray-Sussmann and Oldham, so by 1922 there were 294593 in use in Britain.|$|R
