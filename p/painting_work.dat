25|$|The {{sculpture}} artists likely {{worked at}} both excavating {{the rocks and}} making the intricate carvings of pillars, roof and idols; further, the sculpture and <b>painting</b> <b>work</b> inside a cave were an integrated parallel tasks. A grand gateway to the site was carved, {{at the apex of}} the gorge's horseshoe between caves 15 and 16, as approached from the river, and it is decorated with elephants on either side and a nāga, or protective Naga (snake) deity. Similar methods and application of artist talent is observed in other cave temples of India, such as those from Hinduism and Jainism. These include the Ellora caves, Ghototkacha caves, Elephanta Caves, Bagh Caves, Badami Caves and Aurangabad Caves.|$|E
2500|$|Professor [...] of Johns Hopkins University (see below) {{mentions}} that {{twice in the}} 20 years after 1947, Jane Frank suffered from illnesses which [...] "interrupted the work for long periods". The first of these catastrophes was a serious car accident in 1952, requiring multiple major surgeries and extensive convalescence, and the second was a [...] "serious and potentially life-threatening illness" [...] soon after her 1958 solo show at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The latter illness was so severe, according to Stanton, that it interrupted Jane Frank's <b>painting</b> <b>work</b> for about two years.|$|E

Huhne's office running costs during the 2007/2008 financial year were the 206th highest out of 645, his second home claims were 580th highest (or 65th cheapest) out of 645, and his total expense claims were below average, ranking 418th most expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Carolee Schneemann {{began her}} art {{career as a}} painter in the late 1950s. [...] Her <b>painting</b> <b>work</b> began to adopt some of the {{characteristics}} of Neo-Dada art, as she used box structures coupled with expressionist brushwork. [...] These constructs share the heavily textural characteristics found in the work of artists such as Robert Rauschenberg. [...] Schneemann described the atmosphere in the art community at this time as misogynistic and that female artists of the time were not aware of their bodies. [...] These works integrated influence by artists such as post-impressionist painter Paul Cézanne and the issues in painting brought up by the abstract expressionists. [...] Schneemann chose to focus on expressiveness in her art rather than accessibility or stylishness. [...] She still described herself as a formalist however, unlike other feminist artists who wanted to distance themselves from male-oriented art history. She {{is considered one of the}} [...] "first-generation feminist artists," [...] a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Rachel Rosenthal, and Judy Chicago. They were part of the feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. [...] Schneemann became involved with the art movement of happenings when she organized A Journey through a Disrupted Landscape, inviting people to [...] "crawl, climb, negotiate rocks, climb, walk, go through mud". [...] Soon thereafter she met Allan Kaprow, the primary figure of happenings in addition to artists Red Grooms and Jim Dine. [...] Influenced by figures such as Simone de Beauvoir, Antonin Artaud, Maya Deren, Wilhelm Reich, and Kaprow, Schneemann found herself drawn away from painting.|$|E
60|$|Though {{the end of}} {{this drama}} may have erred {{on the side of the}} grandiose, this may perhaps be forgiven the {{organizers}} in view of the occasion for which they prepared it. Nothing, however, could detract from the beauty and dramatic power of the opening and of many of the scenes. Moreover, the effects obtained by movement in the mass were almost intoxicating. The first entrance of the masses gave a sense of dumb and patient force that was moving in the extreme, and the frenzied delight of the dancing crowd at the victory of the French communards stirred one to ecstasy. The pageant lasted for five hours or more, and was as exhausting emotionally as the Passion Play is said to be. I had the vision of a great period of Communist art, more especially of such open-air spectacles, which should have the grandeur and scope and eternal meaning of the plays of ancient Greece, the mediæval mysteries, or the Shakespearean theatre. In building, writing, acting, even in <b>painting,</b> <b>work</b> would be done, as it once was, by groups, not by one hand or mind, and evolution would proceed slowly until once again the individual emerged from the mass.|$|E
