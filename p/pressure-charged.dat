5000|$|The {{overview}} given above may {{describe a}} modern {{version of the}} Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes [...] "a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It {{is clear from the}} context that [...] "gas" [...] means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The <b>pressure-charger</b> shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional [...] "compression control valve" [...] (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This [...] "will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads".|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} alcohol fuels in high performance <b>pressure-charged</b> engines such as are typical of the type being developed under the ‘downsizing’ banner. To illustrate this it reports modifications to a supercharged high-speed sports car engine to run on an ethanol-based fuel (ethanol containing 15 % gasoline by volume, or ‘E 85 ’). The ability for engines {{to be able to}} run on alcohol fuels may become very important in the future from both a global warming viewpoint and that of security of energy supply. Additionally, low-carbon-number alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol are attractive alternative fuels because, unlike gaseous fuels, they can be stored relatively easily and the amount of energy that can be contained in the vehicle fuel tank is relatively high (although still less than when using gasoline). These fuels also have a much higher octane rating than gasoline which makes them attractive as a fuel for <b>pressure-charged</b> engines, which are frequently knock-limited in their ignition advance curves. The modifications made to the engine include the reconfiguration of the fuel system to investigate making best use of the high latent heat of vaporisation of alcohol by injection of a proportion of the fuel mass before the supercharger - the so-called ‘wet compressor’ technique. With this configuration, engine performance data on E 85 with optimised engine management settings are presented and compared to the original gasolinefuelled performance. Discussion is made {{of the nature of the}} evaporative effect versus oxygen displacement, its effect on supercharger drive power and of the improvement of the spark advance curve as a result of the increase in octane rating of the fuel. To illustrate this response, curves when varying the percentage of fuel delivered upstream of the supercharger are presented. Some discussion of issues to be addressed on the fitment of such an engine to a vehicle is also made, together with how the wet compressor technique might be adopted with minimal impact on evaporative emissions. Conclusions as to the attractiveness of this approach in maximising ethanol-fuelled engine performance are drawn based on the results presented and the vehicle issues listed. There is also some discussion as to how to best configure an ‘omnivorous’ engine to make best use of a range of liquid fuels as they are introduced to the marketplace, with the best efficiency on each...|$|E
40|$|The Ultraboost project {{outlined}} {{in this paper}} seeks to develop a highly <b>pressure-charged,</b> downsized, spark ignition engine {{that is capable of}} a 35 % reduction in tailpipe CO 2 emissions over a naturally aspirated 5. 0 L V 8 while still maintaining performance, emissions and transient response. This project is especially ambitious since, in order to achieve this level of fuel economy improvement, a 60 % reduction in engine displacement is targeted with a BMEP of greater than 30 bar. What is more, achieving these targets in a gasoline engine with stoichiometric fuelling requires careful design and component selection in order to address the many challenges surrounding gasoline combustion under such high boost pressures. This paper describes a critical examination of the competing requirements of a heavily downsized, gasoline engine with a specific focus {{on the role of the}} boosting system in delivering these requirements. From this analysis, the optimal base boosting system configuration is investigated. In addition, a number of boosting technologies, ranging from the novel to the more traditional, are discussed in view of their ability to fulfil a role on the Ultraboost engine. A set of assessment criteria is presented in order to facilitate the selection process. Finally, a 1 -D GT-Power model of the Ultraboost engine equipped with the different boosting systems was used to generate an informed rating of all boosting options and permit a reliable comparison with respect to the targets of the project...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{investigations into}} improving the full-load and transient {{performance of the}} Ultraboost extreme downsizing engine by {{the application of the}} SuperGen variable-speed centrifugal supercharger. Since its output stage speed is decoupled from that of the crankshaft, SuperGen is potentially especially attractive in a compound <b>pressure-charging</b> system. Such systems typically comprise a turbocharger, which is used as the main charging device, compounded at lower charge mass flow rates by a supercharger used as a second boosting stage. Because of its variable drive ratio, SuperGen can be blended in and out continuously to provide seamless driveability, as opposed to the alternative of a clutched, single-drive-ratio positive-displacement device. In this respect its operation is very similar to that of an electrically-driven compressor, although it is voltage agnostic and can supply other hybrid functionality, too. In the work reported here a prototype SuperGen unit was tested on the Ultraboost extreme downsizing demonstrator engine and the performance compared to that of the originally-specified positive-displacement device. This engine has previously been described in detail and represents a 60 % downsizing factor versus a 5. 0 litre naturally-aspirated V 8, although the ‘standard’ baseline combination of supercharger and turbocharger was found in earlier work to be a limitation on achieving the full downsizing factor at low engine speed. The improvement in full-load performance in the area where the turbocharger cannot generate the required boost by itself is reported. The transient response of the combined system at low engine speed is also presented, together with part-load fuel economy data at several engine speed and load points. Finally, this part-load data is used for vehicle modelling work showing that a more-efficient high-pressure stage can bring further fuel economy benefits to extremely-downsized vehicle applications...|$|R
40|$|When {{appropriately}} sourced, bioethanol and biodiesel fuels {{provide an}} opportunity for nations to increase their energy independence or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supplying energy-dense fuels which are miscible with fossil-derived gasoline and diesel. These fuels can be used in low concentrations in vehicles with no modifications; in the case of ethanol, only minor changes in the fuel system materials together with a low-cost alcohol sensor are necessary for compatibility with a high concentration. Ethanol provides the beneficial property of having a high research octane number which can be exploited at the high-load operating conditions in modern <b>pressure-charged</b> spark ignition engines. However, the availability of sustainable feedstocks constrains the supply of biofuels, and this limits the level at which they are able to displace fossil fuels. The miscibility of methanol with both ethanol and gasoline enables the penetration of alcohols in the fuel pool to be increased. The present work describes the properties of specific mixtures of gasoline, ethanol and methanol which are blended to be iso-stoichiometric and iso-energetic replacements for mixtures of gasoline and ethanol. A simple analytical approach to the formulation of these ternary blends is described {{on the basis of the}} volumetric energy density of the pre-blended components, and a number of further physicochemical properties are characterised, including their stoichiometries, vapour pressures, distillation characteristics and propensities to phase separate. Data on the octane numbers of the blends are reported. The properties of quaternary iso-stoichiometric blends of water, gasoline, ethanol and methanol (the so-called hydrous ternary blends) are also examined...|$|E
40|$|An {{expedient}} {{route to}} improving in-vehicle fuel economy in 4 -stroke cycle engines {{is to reduce}} the swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. The full-load performance of a larger capacity engine can be achieved through pressure charging. However, for maximum fuel economy, particularly at part-load, the expansion ratio, and consequently the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in <b>pressure-charged</b> gasoline engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. In earlier work, the authors studied a pressure-charging system aimed at allowing a high CR to be maintained at all times. The operation of this type of system involves deliberately over-compressing the charge air, cooling it at the elevated pressure and temperature, and then expanding it down to the desired plenum pressure, ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-atmospheric at full-load. Due to the ability to support a high fixed CR, it is possible that an engine fitted with such a charging system could achieve fuel economy equal to or better than a Variable Compression Ratio unit, while permitting conventional engine architecture and assembly lines. The concept has been termed "Turboexpansion". This paper analyses some initial test bed results taken from an engine fitted with such a charging system, and discusses future development work intended to establish further the validity of the concept and hence its feasibility as a tool to facilitate aggressive engine downsizing. Additional theoretical analysis is presented which indicates constraints on the effectiveness of the system in terms of its sensitivity to the separate component efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|This {{high-speed}} automotive {{diesel engine}} {{was designed to}} achieve the greatest possible reliability in opera-tion, low operating and maintenance costs and maximum versatility of component and auxiliary arrange-ments, based on long experience of large-scale manufacture of engines for commercial vehicles and the increases in power output and time between overhauls made possible by improvements in design, materials, manufacturing processes, fuels and lubricants. Elimination of the cylinder high-pressure joint was {{a radical departure from}} current practice and promised considerable advantages in cooling, reducing thermal stress and freeing restrictions in cylinder-head porting layout. Thus the potential for operating at the highest rating now in use and for future development was improved. This paper deals with the design aims, describes the engine and outlines the development work with single and multi-cylinder engines that has been undertaken to ensure that each commercial variant meets the re-quirements of its rating. Vertical and horizontal configurations are used in naturally aspirated and <b>pressure-charged</b> versions. For automotive work, using mechanical transmissions, the drooping characteristic of the normal turbocharged engines torque curve at low speed is a serious disadvantage. Measures taken to over-come this are described. These included variations in camshaft timing, automatic variable control of injection timing and boost pressure control of fuel injection quantity to avoid undesirable smoke in the exhaust emission in addition to the normal development work of ensuring the highest practicable standards of mechanical, volumetric and combustion efficiency. Other methods such as special turbocharger matchings, including the waste-gate system of turbine by-pass, the system of auxiliary hydraulic drive of the turbocharger at low engine speeds and, as alternative to turbocharging, pressure charging by an aerodynamic pulse-converter are discussed. At {{the other end of the}} scale, considerable attention has been paid to increasing the maximum engine output by turbocharging with intercooling which promises to increase naturally aspirated power by over 100 per cent, if in road vehicles the problem of the intercooler, airlair or airlwater, can be dealt with satisfactorily...|$|E

Since 1997, GTI (then as Gas Research Institute) has investigated several military and industrial laser systems and their ability to cut and drill into reservoir type rocks.

The HPFL represents a potentially disruptive technology that, when compared to its competitors, is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair. To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone.

All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole.

40|$|The ever-changing {{demands from}} {{consumers}} for more fuel efficient vehicles necessitates automotive manufacturers developing ever more radical proposals for engine design. The latest trend from manufacturers is engine ”downsizing”; where a smaller, more efficient, engine is <b>pressure-charged</b> to recoup the lost full-load performance. An effect of downsizing is that engines now run at significant intake pressures. Additionally, implementation of simulation techniques {{as an integral}} part of the research and design process is becoming commonplace in the automotive industry. Whether or not current models can be considered reliable for combustion prediction at significantly elevated pressures, such as those experienced by downsized engines, is a main focus of the current work, predominantly assessed through how the crank-resolved in-cylinder pressure traces from prediction, compare to experiment. Experimental data was provided by four different engines: two Jaguar Land Rover multi-cylinder engines, one naturally aspirated, the other heavily downsized, and two University of Leeds bespoke research engines operating under naturally aspirated, or high pressure conditions representative of downsized engines. It was seen that the combustion models were not able to accurately predict combustion at different pressures without adjustment of the turbulence quantities, namely the length scale used to define the ”after-burning” process. Additionally, it is known that variability of combustion limits the performance of engines significantly; a better understanding of variability which may lead to mitigation methods would result in significant efficiency gains. The magnitude of variability in the four different engines is investigated in this work as well as the current capability in predicting the variability. Once a mean cycle was successfully matched, the variability of the engine cycles is accurately predicted for all engines and conditions by a random-number model, invoking variability on two parameters, u 0 and �, with Gaussian distribution. Moreover a novel method for assessing variability is proposed and is employed in a study to assess the influence of combustion variability at different stages of combustion. The variability of the combustion event was seen to be a strong function of the very early stages of combustion. The propensity for autoignition is also known to increase with operating pressure and temperature. The predictive capability, of two autoignition models, was assessed against experimental data. It was observed that a chemical kinetic based autoignition model was more able to predict autoignition over all engines, vis-´a-vis an empirically based model. In addition, it was also seen that a variability of autoignition within the engine existed, which was independent of burning rate. Finally, ”knocking” cycles were identified within the heavily supercharged, multi-cylinder research engine which defined the calibration limit of the engine. It was seen, however, that the frequency of pressure oscillations was beyond that traditionally seen for knock cycles...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There are currently many factors motivating car manufacturers to reduce the tailpipe CO 2 emissions from their products. One of the major routes to achieving reduced CO 2 emissions in spark-ignition 4 -stroke engines is to ‘downsize’ the swept volume which, among other advantages, reduces the proportion of fuel energy expended on pumping losses. The full-load performance deficit caused by reducing the swept volume of the engine is normally recovered by pressure charging. One of the limits to pressure charging is combustion knock, which is the unintended autoignition of the last portion of gas to burn in the combustion chamber after combustion has been initiated. This thesis presents results from investigations {{into a number of}} methods for suppressing knock, including (1) tests where the density of the intake air is closely controlled and the effect of charge air temperature is isolated, (2) where the latent heat of vaporization of a fuel is used to reduce the outlet temperature of a supercharger, and (3) where the engine architecture is configured to minimize exhaust gas residual carryover to the benefit of stronger knock resistance. Extensive comparison of this resulting engine architecture is made with published data on other strategies to reduce the effect of the knock limit on engine performance and efficiency. Several such strategies, including cooled EGR, were then investigated to see how much further engine efficiency (in terms of brake specific fuel consumption) could be improved if they are adopted on an engine architecture which has already been configured with best knock limit performance in mind. Within the limits tested, it was found that if the charge air density is fixed then the relationship between knock-limited spark advance and air temperature is linear. This methodology has not been found in the literature and is believed to be unique, with important ramifications for the design of future spark-ignition engine charging systems. It was also found that through a combination of an optimized direct-injection combustion system, an exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, and a 3 -cylinder configuration, an engine with extremely high full-load thermal efficiency can be created. This is because these characteristics are all synergistic. Against the baseline of such an engine, other technologies such as excess air operation and the use of cooled EGR are shown to offer little improvement. When operating a <b>pressure-charged</b> engine on alcohol fuel, it was found that there exists a maximum proportion of fuel that can be introduced before the supercharger beyond which there is no benefit to charge temperature reduction by introducing more. Strategies for reducing the amount of time when such a system operates were developed in order to minimize difficulties in applying such a strategy to a practical road vehicle. Finally, a new strategy for beneficially employing the latent heat of vaporization of the fuel in engines employing cooled EGR by injecting a proportion of the fuel charge directly into the EGR gas is proposed. This novel approach arose from the findings of the research into pre-supercharger fuel introduction and cooled EGR...|$|E
