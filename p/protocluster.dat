40|$|The {{study of}} galaxy <b>protoclusters</b> is {{beginning}} to fill in unknown details of the important phase of the assembly of clusters and cluster galaxies. This review describes {{the current status of}} this field and highlights promising recent findings related to galaxy formation in the densest regions of the early universe. We discuss the main search techniques and the characteristic properties of <b>protoclusters</b> in observations and simulations, and show that <b>protoclusters</b> will have present-day masses similar to galaxy clusters when fully collapsed. We discuss the physical properties of galaxies in <b>protoclusters,</b> including (proto-) brightest cluster galaxies, and the forming red sequence. We highlight the fact that the most massive halos at high redshift are found in <b>protoclusters,</b> making these objects uniquely suited for testing important recent models of galaxy formation. We show that galaxies in <b>protoclusters</b> should be among the first galaxies at high redshift making the transition from a gas cooling regime dominated by cold streams to a regime dominated by hot intracluster gas, which could be tested observationally. We also discuss the possible connections between <b>protoclusters</b> and radio galaxies, quasars, and Ly-alpha blobs. Because of their early formation, large spatial sizes and high total star formation rates, <b>protoclusters</b> have also likely played a crucial role during the epoch of reionization, which can be tested with future experiments that will map the neutral and ionized cosmic web. Last, we review a number of promising observational projects that are expected to make significant impact in this growing, exciting field.

50|$|The Serpens cloud is {{a massive}} star-forming {{molecular}} cloud situated {{in the southern part}} of Serpens Cauda. Only two million years old and 420 parecs distant, the cloud is known to contain many protostars such as Serpens FIRS 1 and Serpens SVS 20. The Serpens South <b>protocluster</b> was uncovered by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in the southern portion of the cloud, and it appears that star formation is still continuing in the region. Another site of star formation is the Westerhout 40 complex, consisting of a prominent HII region adjacent to a molecular cloud. Located around 500 parsecs distant, it is one of the nearest massive regions of star formation, but as the molecular cloud obscures the HII region, rendering it and its embedded cluster tough to see visibly, it is not as well-studied as others. The embedded cluster likely contains over 600 stars above 0.1 solar masses, with several massive stars, including at least one O-type star, being responsible for lighting the HII region and the production of a bubble.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, a multifilamentary {{structure}} measuring 200 {{million light-years}} in width was announced, {{coinciding with the}} <b>protocluster.</b> Discovered in 2005 by Ryosuke Yamauchi from Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, and his colleagues, the structure {{was found in a}} region of the universe known to contain large concentrations of gas. The structure is a very distant object; the astronomers that discovered it were actually looking at something from 12 billion years ago. This object is made up of lyman-break galaxies and large gas bubbles, such as lyman-alpha blobs, lyman-alpha emitters, gaseous filaments. Some of the gas bubbles that make up this colossal structure are up to 400,000 light-years across, close to twice the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy. Some scientists believe that these giant bubbles formed after massive stars born in the early universe exploded as supernovas and ejected their surrounding gases. The galaxies and gas bubbles that are part of this structure line up along three curved filaments, or arms, that formed approximately 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These filaments were observed {{with the help of the}} Subaru and Keck telescopes located on the [...] Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{picture of the}} Cl 0218. 3 - 0510 <b>protocluster</b> at z = 1. 623 across 10 co-moving Mpc. Using filters that tightly bracket the Balmer and 4000 Å breaks of the <b>protocluster</b> galaxies we obtain precise photometric redshifts resulting in a <b>protocluster</b> galaxy sample that is 89 ± 5 % complete and has a contamination of only 12 ± 5 %. Both star forming and quiescent <b>protocluster</b> galaxies are located allowing us to map {{the structure of the}} forming cluster for the first time. The <b>protocluster</b> contains 6 galaxy groups, the largest of which is the nascent cluster. Only a small minority of the <b>protocluster</b> galaxies are in the nascent cluster (11 %) or in the other galaxy groups (22 %), as most <b>protocluster</b> galaxies reside between the groups. Unobscured star forming galaxies predominantly reside between the protocluster's groups, whereas red galaxies make up a large fraction of the groups' galactic content, so observing the <b>protocluster</b> through only one of these types of galaxies results in a biased view of the protocluster's structure. The structure of the <b>protocluster</b> reveals how much mass is available for the future growth of the cluster and we use the Millennium Simulation, scaled to a Planck cosmology, to predict that Cl 0218. 3 - 0510 will evolve into a 2. 7 ^{+ 3. 9 }_{- 1. 7 }× 10 ^{ 14 } M_{⊙} cluster by the present day.

40|$|I will {{describe}} the cosmic star formation history of cluster galaxies using observations of clusters and <b>protoclusters</b> from z = 0 to 4. I {{will show that}} the star formation history of clusters differs from the global cosmic star formation history: cluster galaxies typically form their stars earlier and over a shorter period of time. I will use semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to explain why their star formation histories differ. I will show that the star formation density in <b>protoclusters</b> is extremely high due their high matter densities, but the simulations suggest there is no reversal in the star formation - density relation at high redshift. The differences in the star formation histories of field and cluster galaxies are caused by the gradual suppression of star formation, starting at z = 3, and getting stronger with time. The main mechanisms responsible for this suppression are tidal stripping and AGN feedback. Looking ahead, I {{will describe}} several testable predictions of the different evolutionary paths of cluster and field galaxies.

40|$|Present-day {{clusters}} are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies, while distant <b>protoclusters</b> are extended structures containing numerous star-forming galaxies. We {{investigate the}} implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto) clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z= 0 to z= 7. We show that (proto) cluster galaxies are an important, and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density rises (from 1 % at z= 0) to 20 % at z= 2 and 50 % at z= 10. <b>Protoclusters</b> thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z~ 10 - 5, galaxy growth in <b>protoclusters</b> proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z~ 5 - 1. 5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10 - 20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z<~ 1. 5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant <b>protoclusters</b> {{in order to understand the}} rapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection to reionization during Cosmic Dawn.

40|$|The {{environment}} of the high-z radio galaxy PKS 1138 - 262 at z~ 2. 2 {{is a prime example}} of a forming galaxy cluster. We use deep SINFONI data to perform a detailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radio core and we link this to the kinematics of the <b>protocluster</b> on the megaparsec scale. Identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are at the redshift of the <b>protocluster.</b> The density of line emitters is more than an order of magnitude higher in the core of the <b>protocluster</b> than the larger scale environment. This implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~ 70 which is similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. The velocity distribution of the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocity structure with sigma= 1360 +/- 206 km/s. A similar broad, double-peaked distribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scale <b>protocluster</b> structure, indicating that a common process is acting on both small and large scales. Including all spectroscopically confirmed <b>protocluster</b> galaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013 +/- 87 km/s is found. We show that the <b>protocluster</b> has likely decoupled from the Hubble flow and is a dynamically evolved structure. Comparison to the Millenium simulation indicates that the <b>protocluster</b> velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massive haloes at z~ 2, but we rule out that the <b>protocluster</b> is a fully virialized structure based on dynamical arguments and its X-ray luminosity. Comparison to merging haloes in the Millennium simulation shows that the structure as observed in and around the Spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being the result of a merger between two massive haloes. We propose that this merger can result in an increase in star formation and AGN activity in the <b>protocluster</b> core and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cD galaxies.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} search for galaxy protoclusters at z∼ 3. 8 {{based on the}} latest internal data release (S 16 A) of the Hyper SuprimeCam Subaru strategic program (HSC-SSP). In the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP, we investigate the large-scale projected sky distribution of g-dropout galaxies over an area of 121 deg^ 2, and identify 216 large-scale overdense regions (> 4 σ overdensity significance) that are good <b>protocluster</b> candidates. Of these, 37 are located within 8 arcmin (3. 4 physicalMpc) from other <b>protocluster</b> candidates of higher overdensity, {{and are expected to}} merge into a single massive structure by z= 0. Therefore, we find 179 unique <b>protocluster</b> candidates in our survey. A cosmological simulation that includes projection effects predicts that more than 76 % of these candidates will evolve into galaxy clusters with halo masses of at least 10 ^ 14 M_ by z= 0. The unprecedented size of our <b>protocluster</b> candidate catalog allowed us to perform, for the first time, an angular clustering analysis of the systematic sample of <b>protocluster</b> candidates. We find a correlation length of 35. 0 h^- 1 Mpc. The relation between correlation length and number density of z∼ 3. 8 <b>protocluster</b> candidates is consistent with the prediction of the ΛCDM model, and the correlation length {{is similar to that of}} rich clusters in the local universe. This result suggests that our <b>protocluster</b> candidates are tracing similar spatial structures as those expected of the progenitors of rich clusters and enhances the confidence that our method to identify protoclusters at high redshifts is robust. In the coming years, our <b>protocluster</b> search will be extended to the entire HSC-SSP Wide sky coverage of ∼ 1400 deg^ 2 to probe cluster formation over a wide redshift range of z∼ 2 - 6.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{structures}} of protoclusters and their relationship with high redshift clusters using the Millennium Simulation combined with a semi-analytic model. We find that protoclusters are very extended, with 90 per cent of their mass spread across ∼ 35 h^- 1 Mpc comoving at z= 2 (∼ 30 arcmin). The `main halo', which can manifest as a high redshift cluster or group, is only a minor feature of the <b>protocluster,</b> containing less than 20 per cent of all <b>protocluster</b> galaxies at z= 2. Furthermore, many protoclusters do not contain a main halo that is massive enough {{to be identified as}} a high redshift cluster. Protoclusters exist in a range of evolutionary states at high redshift, independent of the mass they will evolve to at z= 0. We show that the evolutionary state of a <b>protocluster</b> can be approximated by the mass ratio of the first and second most massive haloes within the <b>protocluster,</b> and the z= 0 mass of a <b>protocluster</b> can be estimated to within 0. 2 dex accuracy if both the mass of the main halo and the evolutionary state is known. We also investigate the biases introduced by only observing star-forming <b>protocluster</b> members within small fields. The star formation rate required for line-emitting galaxies to be detected is typically high, which leads to the artificial loss of low mass galaxies from the <b>protocluster</b> sample. This effect is stronger for observations of the centre of the <b>protocluster,</b> where the quenched galaxy fraction is higher. This loss of low mass galaxies, relative to the field, distorts the size of the galaxy overdensity, which in turn can contribute to errors in predicting the z= 0 evolved mass.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years the number of high {{redshift}} <b>protoclusters</b> has rapidly increased by utilizing radio-loud AGN (RLAGN) as beacons for overdense regions at z> 1. 3. However, there has been some debate over whether these structures are representative of <b>protoclusters</b> as a whole or whether they preferentially select young structures. I will present our recent discovery of a z= 1. 58 mature cluster from the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN survey. Over half of the cluster galaxies lie on a red sequence with a colour that suggests an average formation redshift of z= 3. I will show that 82 % of the red galaxies in the core are passive and demonstrate that the cluster has an enhanced passive galaxy fraction that is three times that of the control field. Interestingly, this enhancement is mass dependent: the higher passive fraction is only observable for high mass galaxies, whereas the fraction of passive galaxies at lower masses is similar in the cluster and field. The presence of a dense core and a passive red sequence suggest that radio galaxies do not solely reside in young, uncollapsed <b>protoclusters,</b> rather they can be used as beacons for clusters {{in a wide range of}} evolutionary states...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the removal of}} interstellar material by stellar feedback limits the efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds and how this determines {{the shape of the}} mass function of young star clusters. In particular, we derive relations between the power-law exponents of the mass functions of the clouds and clusters in the limiting regimes in which the feedback is energy-driven and momentum-driven, corresponding to minimum and maximum radiative losses and likely to bracket all realistic cases. We find good agreement between the predicted and observed exponents, especially for momentum-driven feedback, provided the <b>protoclusters</b> have roughly constant mean surface density, as indicated by observations of the star-forming clumps within molecular clouds. We also consider a variety of specific feedback mechanisms, concluding that HII regions inflated by radiation pressure predominate in massive <b>protoclusters,</b> a momentum-limited process when photons can escape after only a few interactions with dust grains. We then present a first estimate of the star formation efficiency in this case, finding that it depends on the masses and sizes of the <b>protoclusters</b> only through their mean surface density, thus ensuring consistency between the observed power-law exponents of the mass functions of the clouds and clusters. The numerical value of this efficiency is also consistent with observations. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, emulateapj format, version accepted to ApJ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} dense environments on galaxy evolution by examining how the properties of galaxies in the z = 1. 6 <b>protocluster</b> Cl 0218. 3 - 0510 depend on their location. We determine galaxy properties using spectral energy distribution fitting to 14 -band photometry, including data at three wavelengths that tightly bracket the Balmer and 4000 A breaks of the <b>protocluster</b> galaxies. We find {{that two-thirds of the}} <b>protocluster</b> galaxies, which lie between several compact groups, are indistinguishable from field galaxies. The other third, which reside within the groups, differ significantly from the intergroup galaxies in both colour and specific star formation rate. We find that the fraction of red galaxies within the massive <b>protocluster</b> groups is twice that of the intergroup region. These excess red galaxies are due to enhanced fractions of both passive galaxies (1. 7 times that of the intergroup region) and dusty star-forming galaxies (3 times that of the intergroup region).

40|$|We {{present results}} from a new ultra-deep ≈ 400 ks Chandra {{observation}} of the SSA 22 <b>protocluster</b> at z = 3. 09. We have studied the X-ray properties of 234 z ~ 3 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs; <b>protocluster</b> and field) and 158 z = 3. 09 Lyα Emitters (LAEs) in SSA 22 to measure {{the influence of the}} high-density <b>protocluster</b> environment on the accretion activity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these UV-selected star-forming populations. We detect individually X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in six LBGs and five LAEs; due to small overlap between the LBG and LAE source population, ten of these sources are unique. At least six and potentially eight of these sources are members of the <b>protocluster.</b> These sources have rest-frame 8 - 32 keV luminosities in the range of L 8 - 32 keV = (3 - 50) × 1043 ergs s- 1 and an average observed-frame 2 - 8 keV to 0. 5 - 2 keV band ratio (BR) of ≈ 0. 8 (mean effective photon index of Γeff≈ 1. 1), suggesting significant absorption columns of N H gsim 1022 - 1024 cm- 2. We find that the fraction of LBGs and LAEs in the z = 3. 09 <b>protocluster</b> harboring an AGN with L 8 - 32 keV gsim 3 × 1043 ergs s- 1 is 9. 5 + 12. 7 - 6. 1 % and 5. 1 + 6. 8 - 3. 3 %, respectively. These AGN fractions are somewhat larger (by a mean factor of 6. 1 + 10. 3 - 3. 6 significant at the ≈ 95 % confidence level) than z ~ 3 sources found in lower-density "field" environments. Theoretical models imply that these results {{may be due to the}} presence of more actively growing and/or massive SMBHs in LBGs and LAEs within the <b>protocluster</b> compared to the field. Such a result is expected in a scenario where enhanced merger activity in the <b>protocluster</b> drives accelerated galaxy and SMBH growth at zgsim 2 - 3. Using Spitzer IRAC imaging we found that the fraction of IRAC-detected LBGs is significantly larger in the <b>protocluster</b> than in the field (by a factor of 3. 0 + 2. 0 - 1. 3). From these data, we constrained the median rest-frame H-band luminosity in the <b>protocluster</b> to be gsim 1. 2 - 1. 8 times larger than that for the field. When combined with our X-ray data, this suggests that both galaxies and SMBHs grew more rapidly in <b>protocluster</b> environments...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a <b>protocluster</b> at z~ 6 containing at least eight cluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-field image of the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). The overdensity of the <b>protocluster</b> is significant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density of i'-dropout galaxies. The overdense region covers ~ 36 sq. arcmin, and includes 30 i'-dropout galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these are real z~ 6 galaxies (5. 7 < z < 6. 3). Eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrow redshift range centered at z= 6. 01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase in number density over the average in redshift space. We found {{no significant difference in the}} observed properties, such as Ly-alpha luminosities and UV continuum magnitudes, between the eight <b>protocluster</b> members and the seven non-members. The velocity dispersion of the eight <b>protocluster</b> members is 647 km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standard cold dark matter model. This discrepancy could be attributed to the distinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight <b>protocluster</b> members. We discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either the <b>protocluster</b> is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is still immature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster.

Using imaging from the Chandra X-ray Telescope, we find a large overdensity of AGN in the protocluster; a factor of 23 ± 9 times the field density of AGN. Only half of this AGN overdensity {{is due to the}} overdensity of massive galaxies in the <b>protocluster</b> (a factor of 11 ± 2), as we find that 17 + 6 − 5 per cent 17 − 5 + 6 per cent of massive galaxies (M* > 1010 M⊙) in the <b>protocluster</b> host an X-ray luminous AGN, compared to 8 ± 1 [*]per[*]cent in the field.

We also find that the AGN overdensity is centrally concentrated, located within 3 arcmin and most pronounced within 1 arcmin of the centre of the <b>protocluster.</b> Our results confirm that there is a reversal in the local anticorrelation between galaxy density and AGN activity, so there is an enhancement of AGN in high-redshift protoclusters. We compare the properties of AGN in the <b>protocluster</b> to the field and find no significant differences in the distributions of their stellar mass, X-ray luminosity or hardness ratio.

The presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with a population of still-forming massive stars, along with a direct measurement of the low mass loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W 51 IRS 2, together imply that feedback is ineffective at halting star formation in massive <b>protoclusters.</b> Instead, feedback may shut off the large-scale accretion of diffuse gas onto the W 51 <b>protoclusters,</b> implying that they are evolving towards a state of gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion.

40|$|A {{commonly}} adopted {{approach to}} detect <b>protoclusters</b> is {{to search for}} overdensities of galaxies around massive galaxies at high-redshift such as quasars (QSOs) and submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). However, the detection of overdensities in those environments has been elusive, against of theoretical predictions. Here, I present the first measurement of the QSO-LBG and QSO-LAE cross-correlation function at z~ 4, based {{in the study of}} 23 QSO fields. My results indicate that LBG are strongly clustered around QSOs but LAE show similar clustering properties and number density as that observed in blank fields. One possible explanation for the lack of overdensities is that galaxies are highly obscured by dust and thus invisible at optical wavelengths. Additionally, I will present the clustering of SMGs based on spectroscopic redshift information of 52 SMGs recently identified by ALMA. This is critical to test if SMGs trace particularly massive structures. Finally, I will discuss the implications and interpretation of my results, in particular, I give the reasons of why I strongly suggest that the study of high-redshift <b>protoclusters</b> should be done from a combined optical+radio perspective...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from a new ultra-deep ≈ 400 ks Chandra {{observation}} of the SSA 22 <b>protocluster</b> at z = 3. 09. We have studied the X-ray properties of 234 z ∼ 3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs; <b>protocluster</b> and field) and 158 z = 3. 09 Lyα emitters (LAEs) in SSA 22 to measure {{the influence of the}} high-density <b>protocluster</b> environment on the accretion activity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these UV-selected star forming populations. We detect individually X-ray–emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in six LBGs and five LAEs; due to small overlap between the LBG and LAE source population, ten of these sources are unique. At least six and potentially eight of these sources are members of the <b>protocluster.</b> These sources have restframe 8 – 32 keV luminosities in the range of L 8 − 32 keV = (3 – 50) × 1043 ergs s− 1 and an average observed-frame 2 – 8 keV to 0. 5 – 2 keV band-ratio of ≈ 0. 8 (mean effective photon index of Γeff ≈ 1. 1), suggesting significant absorption columns of NH> ∼ 1022 – 1024 cm− 2. We find that the fraction of LBGs and LAEs in the z = 3. 09 <b>protocluster</b> harboring an AGN with L 8 − 32 keV> ∼ 3 × 1043 ergs s− 1 is 9. 5 + 12. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature and}} evolution of large-scale structure within the SSA 22 <b>protocluster</b> region at z= 3. 09 using cosmological simulations. A redshift histogram constructed from current spectroscopic observations of the SSA 22 <b>protocluster</b> reveals two separate peaks at z = 3. 065 (blue) and z = 3. 095 (red). Based on these data, we report updated overdensity and mass calculations for the SSA 22 <b>protocluster.</b> We find δ_b,gal= 4. 8 ± 1. 8, δ_r,gal= 9. 5 ± 2. 0 for the blue and red peaks, respectively, and δ_t,gal= 7. 6 ± 1. 4 for the entire region. These overdensities correspond to masses of M_b = (0. 76 ± 0. 17) × 10 ^ 15 h^- 1 M_, M_r = (2. 15 ± 0. 32) × 10 ^ 15 h^- 1 M_, and M_t=(3. 19 ± 0. 40) × 10 ^ 15 h^- 1 M_ for the red, blue, and total peaks, respectively. We use the Small MultiDark Planck (SMDPL) simulation to identify comparably massive z∼ 3 protoclusters, and uncover the underlying structure and ultimate fate of the SSA 22 <b>protocluster.</b> For this analysis, we construct mock redshift histograms for each simulated z∼ 3 <b>protocluster,</b> quantitatively comparing them with the observed SSA 22 data. We find that the observed double-peaked structure in the SSA 22 redshift histogram corresponds not to a single coalescing cluster, but rather the proximity of a ∼ 10 ^ 15 h^- 1 M_ <b>protocluster</b> {{and at least one}} > 10 ^ 14 h^- 1 M_ cluster progenitor. Such associations in the SMDPL simulation are easily understood within the framework of hierarchical clustering of dark matter halos. We finally find that the opportunity to observe such a phenomenon is incredibly rare, with an occurrence rate of 7. 4 h^ 3 Gpc^- 3. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, Accepted to Ap...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{population}} study of {{several types of}} galaxies within the <b>protocluster</b> surrounding the radio galaxy MRC 0316 - 257 at z 3. 1. In addition to the known population of Ly_alpha emitters (LAEs) and [OIII] emitters, we use colour selection techniques to identify <b>protocluster</b> candidates that are Lyman break galaxies (LBG) and Balmer break galaxies (BBGs). The radio galaxy field contains an excess of LBG candidates, with a surface density 1. 6 ± 0. 3 times larger than found for comparable blank fields. This surface overdensity corresponds to an LBG volume overdensity of 8 ± 4. The BBG photometric redshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect no significant surface overdensity of BBG. This is not surprising because a volume overdensity similar to the LBGs {{would have resulted in}} a surface density of 1. 2 that found in the blank field. This could not have been detected in our sample. Masses and star formation rates of the candidate <b>protocluster</b> galaxies are determined using SED fitting. These properties are not significantly different from those of field galaxies. The galaxies with the highest masses and star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that the <b>protocluster</b> environment influences galaxy evolution at z 3. We conclude that the <b>protocluster</b> around MRC 0316 - 257 is still {{in the early stages of}} formation. Comment: 19 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

ESO, 2016 We present new JVLA {{observations of the}} high-mass cluster-forming region W 51 A from 2 to 16 GHz with resolution ??fwhm ??? 0. 3 ??? 0. 5 ???. The data reveal a wealth of observational results: (1) Currently forming, very massive (proto-O) stars are traced by o - H 2 CO 21, 1 ??? 21, 2 emission, suggesting that this line can be used efficiently as a massive protostar tracer; (2) there is a spatially distributed population of ???mJy continuum sources, including hypercompact H???ii regions and candidate colliding wind binaries, {{in and around the}} W 51 proto-clusters; and (3) there are two clearly detected <b>protoclusters,</b> W 51 e and W 51 IRS 2, that are gas-rich but may have most of their mass in stars within their inner ??? 0. 05 pc. The majority of the bolometric luminosity in W 51 most likely comes from a third population of OB stars between these clusters. The presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with a population of still-forming massive stars, together with a direct measurement of the low mass loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W 51 IRS 2, implies that feedback is ineffective at halting star formation in massive <b>protoclusters.</b> Instead, feedback may shut off the large-scale accretion of diffuse gas onto the W 51 <b>protoclusters,</b> implying that they are evolving toward a state of {{gas exhaustion}} rather than gas expulsion.

40|$|I {{suggest that}} stellar {{coalescence}} in mid-size <b>protoclusters</b> (M ~ 10 ^{ 3. 5 } - 10 ^{ 4. 5 } M_sun) {{is a possible}} scenario {{for the formation of}} ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). More massive super-star-clusters are not needed, since the most likely ULX mass range is only ~ 30 [...] 200 M_sun; in fact, they are very rarely found at or very near ULX positions. Protostellar envelopes and gas accretion favour captures and mergers in dense cores of embedded clusters. Moreover, <b>protoclusters</b> with masses ~ 10 ^{ 3. 5 } - 10 ^{ 4. 5 } M_sun are likely to disperse quickly into loose OB associations, where most ULXs are found. Sufficiently high protostellar density may be achieved when clustered star formation is triggered by galaxy collisions and mergers. Low metallicity may then be necessary to ensure that a large fraction of the stellar mass ends up in a black hole. In this scenario, most ULXs are naturally explained as the extreme end of the high-mass X-ray binary population.
