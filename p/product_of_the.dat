Defilement also had a stringency that cutting of hair did not, as defilement rendered void <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding period and entails <b>the</b> offering <b>of</b> a sacrifice, while cutting of hair renders voided only 30 days and did not entail a sacrifice.|$|R

5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4.

Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only {{in combination with other}} elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E

5|$|Both commanders were a <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally {{took place in}} open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227.
