40|$|The fading and colour {{changes in}} glass-filled {{polyamide}} formulations during ageing in water at 80 �C are reported. Formulations were stabilized with CuI and a UVA system and contained cobalt blue and phthalocyanine blue pigments. The {{results suggest that}} CuI causes an ‘‘aubergine’’ colour development {{in the absence of}} pigments whose origin is attributed to oxides and complexes of copper that are produced during thermal processing and degradation processes. Ageing in water causes dramatic fading along with a colour shift towards the green. This effect is attributed to leaching and/or hydrolysis of copper-containing species. It was found that an increase in CuI stabilizer produces an increased level of fading in unpigmented samples. However, as the <b>pigment</b> <b>loading</b> is increased there is a concomitant reduction in the extent of fading and the extent of the green shift suggesting that pigments may mask ageing-induced colour changes in these systems. The susceptibility of phthalocyanine-pigmented polyamines to colour change is not adversely affected by CuI...|$|E
40|$|Porphyrias are a {{heterogenous}} {{group of}} diseases {{that may result}} in disabling or life threatening neurovisceral symptoms and/or cutaneous photosensitivity. In acute intermittent porphyria, the clinical features, particularly neurological symptoms, may be life-threatening and disabling. Conventional treatment with human hemin, though effective in reducing symptoms, does not reverse neuropathy when structural nerve damage has occurred and may cause intense phlebitis. Liver transplantation (LT) may be considered as treatment for those with repeated life-threatening acute attacks resulting in poor quality of life, requirement of ventilatory support, and progressive loss of venous access due to hemin infusion. Patients with variegate porphyria (VP) present after puberty with neurovisceral symptoms and skin manifestations. LT resolved VP in the 1 patient reported in the literature. Aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder and a child who presented with failure to thrive and required transfusions and parenteral nutrition did not improve with LT. In erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), there is excessive production of protoporphyrin in the bone marrow. Protoporphyrin is hepatotoxic and <b>pigment</b> <b>loading</b> of hepatocytes and bile canalicular sludging may result in progressive cholestasis and cirrhosis. LT is beneficial for such patients with end-stage liver disease. Perioperative management includes use of filters on operative lights to prevent skin burns and intestinal perforation. Other concerns include development of neuropathy, biliary complications, and recurrent liver disease. This review addresses the rationale, patient selection, evaluation, management issues, and technique of performing LT in various types of porphyria...|$|E

5000|$|Oil paint has {{a higher}} <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> than acrylic paint. As linseed oil {{contains}} a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment.

Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics.|$|R
5000|$|With {{water-based}} media such as inks, acrylic paints, tempera paints or watercolor paints, a wet brush {{should be}} dipped {{into a pool}} of very wet and diluted paint. This paint pool should be evenly mixed and dispersed to prevent uneven <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> on the brush. The loaded brush should then be applied to a dry or wet support.

50|$|Tempera paint dries rapidly. It is {{normally}} applied in thin, semi-opaque or transparent layers. Tempera painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques {{that require the}} application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross-hatching technique. When dry, it produces a smooth matte finish. Because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can, tempera paintings rarely have the deep color saturation that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less <b>pigment</b> (lower <b>pigment</b> <b>load).</b> In this respect the colors of an unvarnished tempera painting resemble a pastel, although the color deepens if a varnish is applied. On the other hand, tempera colors do not change over time, whereas oil paints darken, yellow, and become transparent with age.|$|R

A review of 20 reports comprising 98 patients shows 86. 7 % had acute acalculus cholelithiasis, and 61. 1 % had necrosis, gangrene, and/or perforation of the gallbladder. The overall mortality was 33. 3 % and only 16. 1 % of patients treated by cholecystectomy died. The etiology of acute cholecystitis complicating trauma is multifactorial. Gallstones are present infrequently whereas shock, increased bile <b>pigment</b> <b>load,</b> drugs, surgery, and (other) trauma are common precursors. Diagnosis is difficult and depends upon clinical suspicion and the physical examination. Immediate surgical intervention is required. Cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice.

50|$|The {{species is}} best known as the richest source of bladderpod oil. Most Physaria species contain the hydroxy acid lesquerolic acid in their oil with a seed oil content of ~24%. This oil is useful as a {{replacement}} for castor oil in some applications. If the plant becomes more widely cultivated and breeding and refinement techniques are improved, the oil could be used in a number of industries, including cosmetics, coatings, plastics, and lubricants. One obstacle to use is the oil's reddish-brown color, which makes it less valuable for certain applications than the colorless or pale yellow castor oil. Breeding may reduce the <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> of the plant's oils over time. Breeding may also favor other characteristics in this species, such as its capacity for cultivation in other climates, male sterility to allow better control of pollination, and tolerance for a wider array of soil types.|$|R
40|$|In laser {{transmission}} welding of polymers, additives and colorants {{could influence}} the welding result. In this work, polypropylene and polycarbonate probes colored with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) pigments of various concentrations are investigated. The probes are produced using an extrusion process {{to obtain a}} homogeneous distribution of colorants. The TiO 2 pigments change the optical properties of the polymers considerably. The measured reflectance increases with increasing <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> while the transmittance decreases. From the measured data of transmittance, reflectance, and collimated transmittance, the scattering, the absorption coefficient, and the anisotropy factors are calculated. It is shown that the scattering coefficient at 1530 nm (laser) wavelength is smaller than for 968 nm, while the absorption coefficient is negligible for both wavelengths. Scattering coefficient and anisotropy factor are used to simulate the propagation of the laser radiation in the polymers. The influence of the scattering process on the beam propagation {{is represented by the}} change of the power density distribution. It is shown that the maximum intensity of the distribution is reduced more than the transmittance with increasing pigment concentration. The effect is higher for 968 than for 1530 nm wavelength making the larger wavelength more favorable for transmission welding...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, unconjugated {{bilirubin}} is rapidly cleared from the circulation and almost quanti-tatively excreted as a conjugate in the bile (2 - 4). The efficiency and rapidity {{of this process}} indicate that conjugation and subsequent biliary excretion represent the principal pathway of bilirubin dis-position. If alternate pathways of bilirubin me-tabolism exist under physiologic conditions, their level of functional efficiency must be so low as to render detection difficult. When hepatic dysfunc-tion causes interference with the efficiency of conjugation and excretion of bilirubin, however, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia, such alternate metabolic pathways {{may be expected to}} play a more important role in disposing of the accumu-lated <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> (5). Moreover, when forma-tion and hence biliary excretion of conjugated pig-ment is virtually abolished owing to an enzymatic defect in the hepatic conjugating apparatus, al-ternate pathways of bilirubin metabolism must as-sume the principal role in disposing of the bile pigment formed from the continuous breakdown of hemoglobin (6). Such metabolic anomalies associated with severe unconjugated hyperbili-rubinemia exist as a rare congenital syndrome in man (Crigler-Najjar syndrome) (7, 8) and as a recessively inherited enzymatic defect in a mutant strain of Wistar rats (Gunn rats) (8, 9). In both instances, the level of unconjugated hyper-bilirubinemia remains remarkably constant over months and years (8), indicating that a "steady state " has been established between pigment pro-duction and disposition. In the present investigation, a patient with con-genital unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a group of hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats were in...|$|R

40|$|The {{pattern of}} serum bilirubins was {{determined}} in serum {{of humans and}} rats with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to increased <b>pigment</b> <b>load</b> or defective hepatic conjugation. Bilirubin ester conjugates were present in all serum samples tested and were identified as bilirubin 1 -O-acyl glucuronides. In Gilbert's syndrome, the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in healthy control subjects. Because the concentration of unconjugated pigment was increased, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins was markedly decreased. Sera from patients with Crigler-Najjar disease differed from those with Gilbert's syndrome by the higher unconjugated bilirubin levels and the undetectability of diconjugated bilirubins. A striking finding was that in hemolytic disease, the concentration of both monoconjugates and diconjugates was enhanced in parallel {{with the increase of}} unconjugated pigment. Therefore, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins remained within the normal range. As in Gilbert's syndrome, heterozygote R/APfd-j/+ rats with impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation exhibit an increased unconjugated bilirubin level in serum, whereas the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in normal rats. In serum of normal rats loaded intraperitoneally with unconjugated bilirubin, both unconjugated and mono- and diconjugated bilirubins were increased in parallel so that the ratio of unconjugated to esterified pigment remained unaffected. Decreased hepatic conjugation or increased bilirubin load was associated with a lower percentage of diconjugates relative to total conjugates both in human and rat serum. The present results are consistent with a compartmental model in which there is bidirectional transfer across the sinusoidal membrane for unconjugated bilirubin {{as well as for the}} bilirubin glucuronides. Because typical patterns of serum bilirubins are found in Gilbert's syndrome and patients with hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia, determination of esterified bilirubins in serum is of value to study the pathophysiology and the differential diagnosis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{high shear}} rate {{environment}} of gravure requires very low viscosity, fluid inks. The {{problems associated with}} low viscosity such as spilling, crawling, scumming and crazing, have hindered the development of UV-curable gravure inks. This led the researcher to study UV-curable gravure ink formulation. The effects of oligomer-to-monomer ratio and <b>pigment</b> dispersion <b>loading</b> on white ultraviolet (UV) -curable gravure ink film properties (surface cure efficiency, abrasion resistance, substrate adhesion, and ink film flexibility) were investigated. In this study, molecules normally used as monomers, in UV-curable systems, were selected as oligomers relative to the selected monomer, Glycerol Propoxylate Triacrylate (GPTA). The selected oligomers were, Trimethylolpropane Triacrylate (TMPTA), Trimethylolpropane Ethoxylate Triacrylate (ETMPTA), and a commercially available oligomer, Commerical Product A, used in flexographic ink applications. The outcome of this research created {{a starting point for}} white UV-curable gravure ink formulation, which will be used in the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s family printing business.

40|$|Submarine canyons are dynamic {{sedimentary}} environments {{influenced by}} sediment transport, erosion and deposition. Gravity flows can scour and erode the canyon floor, thus redistributing sediment to distal locations. In addition, submarine canyons {{can act as}} sedimentary traps where sediment transported laterally across the continental shelf and slope is advected into. Hence, elevated sedimentation rates and high organic carbon content are often found in submarine canyons {{in comparison with the}} adjacent open slope. Such dynamic processes must affect the ecosystems inhabiting these exceptional environments. To investigate and quantify this relationship, living benthic foraminifera were sampled from Nazaré and Lisbon-Setbal submarine canyons located on the Portuguese continental margin. The foraminiferal abundances and species distribution were correlated with a host of geochemical (e. g. organic carbon, phytopigment content, redox chemistry) and physical/sedimentological parameters (e. g. current speed, sedimentation rate, frequency of gravity flows). Eventually this information was used to reconstruct temporal variations in sedimentation processes and associated changes in foraminiferal community structure in two piston cores derived from the lower canyon. The results of these studies highlight the importance of habitat instability and food abundance in structuring the foraminiferal communities in canyons. Food, quantified in terms of the sedimentary phytopigment content, was readily available in the studied canyons, declining in abundance with increasing water depth. Food abundance was also reflected in the pore water chemistry (nitrate penetration depth used as a redox indicator), higher pigment content coinciding with shallower nitrate penetration depth in sediment. The standing stocks of foraminifera and community structure changed with these parameters, and a positive correlation was observed between foraminiferal numbers and the sedimentary pigment content and a negative with the nitrate penetration depth. Stations recording the highest <b>pigment</b> <b>loads</b> (> 15 g/cm 3) and the shallowest redox zones (nitrate penetration depth < 1 cm) were inhabited by infaunal taxa e. g. Chilostomella oolina, Melonis barleeanum, Bigenerina cylindrica and Globobulimina spp. At the deepest sites, where the pigment concentrations were very low (? 2 g/ cm 3) and the redox zonation deep (nitrate penetration depth exceeding 5 cm depth in sediment) communities were dominated by agglutinated taxa and only few calcareous species were present, including Nuttallides umbonifera. Despite the high pigment concentrations however, foraminiferal numbers were low in the upper and middle Nazaré Canyon axis. At these sites the development of stable ecosystems appeared to be hindered by sedimentary disturbance. Distinct agglutinated foraminifera, Technitella spp., were found to inhabit the unstable environment. This species can be regarded as a highly opportunistic recoloniser of newly exposed habitats, and/or may be able to tolerate high sedimentation rates and frequent sedimentary disturbance (i. e. gravity flows). In the paleostudy, a postglacial increase in the sediment transport was clearly reflected in the foraminiferal record as an increase in the relative abundance of shallow water taxa. Further, a shift in faunal composition was observed as a response to changing sedimentary regime; higher sediment and organic carbon supply from the canyon leading to a development of an infaunal Pullenia spp. assemblage and decreasing activity to the hemipelagic Nutallides umbonifera assemblage...|$|R
40|$|HPLC {{analysis}} of phytoplankton pigments from natural samples usually requires the filtration of relatively {{large volumes of}} water (1 - 12 L) through filters of 25 - 47 mm diameter. Pigment extraction from filters of this size is performed with minimum volumes of 2 - 5 mL extraction solvent, routinely 90 % acetone. The difference in polarity between the solvent for extraction and the initial eluent for HPLC {{analysis of}} phytoplankton <b>pigments</b> limits the <b>load</b> to c. a. 150 μL sample into the chromatographic system. This implies that less than 10 % of the sample is analyzed, with the consequent decrease of pigment detectability. Here, a procedure allowing injections of up to 1440 μL of 90 % acetone without pigment loss is presented. The method can be easily implemented in current HPLC systems. The response of the peak area measured against volume injected was linear (r 2 > 0. 998 for any pigment). The precision for injections between 120 and 1440 μL varied between 0. 08 and 4. 9 % (coefficient of variation, n= 4). This system increases the signal response one order of magnitude, {{reducing the amount of}} volume filtered and/or enhancing the detectability and identification of minor pigments.

40|$|The {{effects of}} climate change are likely to be {{dependent}} on local settings. Nonetheless, the compounded effects of global and regional stressors remain poorly understood. Here, we used CO 2 vents to assess how the effects of ocean acidification on the seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, and the associated epiphytic community can be modified by enhanced nutrient loading. P. oceanica at ambient and low pH sites was exposed to three nutrient levels for 16 months. The response of P. oceanica to experimental conditions was assessed by combining analyses of gene expression, plant growth, photosynthetic <b>pigments</b> and epiphyte <b>loading.</b> At low pH, nutrient addition fostered plant growth and the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. Overexpression of nitrogen transporter genes following nutrient additions at low pH suggests enhanced nutrient uptake by the plant. In addition, enhanced nutrient levels reduced the expression of selected antioxidant genes in plants exposed to low pH and increased epiphyte cover at both ambient and low pH. Our results show that the effects of ocean acidification on P. oceanica depend upon local nutrient concentration. More generally, our findings suggest that taking into account local environmental settings will be crucial to advance our understanding of the effects of global stressors on marine systems...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to autonomous pattern formation, the QS-based communication mechanism {{can also be}} applied to detect complex spatial signals. Tabor et al. recently developed a multi-module gene circuit system for edge detection, a signal processing algorithm common in artificial intelligence and image recognition [99]. As illustrated in Figure  4 B, the biological edge detection algorithm is composed of three modules: a dark sensor (NOT light), cell-cell communication cassette, and an X AND (NOT Y) genetic logic. The darker sensor was engineered based on the light-sensitive protein Cph 8, a chimeric sensor kinase. With the covalent association of chromophore phycocyanobilin produced from heme via ho 1 and pcyA [100],[101], Cph 8 is able to activate the ompC promoter (PompC) by transferring a phosphoryl group to the response regulator OmpR. However, {{in the presence of}} red light, the kinase activity of Cph 8 is inhibited, which precludes the transcription from PompC and causes a NOT light transcriptional logic gate. The cell-cell communication was implemented through the Lux QS system and was used to convert light information into spatial distribution of AHL. With the incorporation of the converter cI and the hybrid promoter Plux-lambda, the state of PompC is converted via an X AND (NOT Y) logical operation into the state of the promoter Plux-lambda, which is displayed via the production of LacZ that produces black <b>pigment.</b> Upon the <b>loading</b> of the programs, a lawn of isogenic E. coli populations was able to sense an image of light, communicate to identify the light-dark edges, and visually present the result of the computation.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the possible ways of using the intrinsic properties of cellulosic pulp fibres and inorganic pigments, by combining these elements using non-standard procedures, {{as a means to}} engineer a new composite material – a novel uncoated woodfree paper with improved physical properties. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) was used as the inorganic pigment in this study. To accomplish this objective, we conducted a preliminary study on web addition followed by detailed studies on in-situ precipitation in fibrillated pulp suspensions and blending of novel furnish materials. We evaluated the different technological approaches by analysing the production process and product quality. In the first approach, chemical precipitation and spraying of filler dispersion onto a fibrous web, and mechanically pressing to assist penetration into the network, were compared against conventional filler dosage before web forming. The results showed that web addition approach results in higher tensile strength and lower light scattering of paper. Filler agglomeration and optical crowding, in chemical precipitation and web application respectively, resulted in significantly deteriorating the light scattering of the handsheets. The experimental conditions were not sufficient to obtain an even distribution of filler along the thickness direction of paper and the filler characteristics were not optimised in this study. In the second technique, precipitation onto fibrillated pulp suspensions was investigated by varying the pulp substrate, PCC crystal structure, and pre-refining a mixture of pulp and milk of lime. According to the research findings, PCCs formed by precipitation of calcium carbonate onto cellulosic fibrils and fibres do not necessarily have the same characteristics as reference PCCs formed by carbonizing milk of lime. Precipitation of calcium carbonate onto fibrillated fibres and microfines increases the retention of filler but impairs the dewatering of handsheets during pressing. Higher amount of fibrillated cellulosic substrates in combination with appropriate filler morphology, scalenohedral or rhombohedral, contribute to increased bond strength and light scattering of traditional fine paper. Pre-refining a mixture of pulp and calcium hydroxide results in grinding of lime, and hence, the composites have a greater surface area than the reference filler. Composite filled handsheets, from this study, exhibited high light scattering. In the third method, the microfines-filler composite was envisioned as the backbone structure for a new composite material – uncoated fine paper. In the new composite paper, strength properties arise from the microfibrillated cellulose, bulk and pores originate from the filler surrounded by fibrils, whereas tear strength is imparted by a minimal proportion of pulp fibres in the composite. Compared to conventional fibre based fine paper, even at high filler loading the new composite material showed higher bending stiffness, tensile and tear indices, internal bond strength, light scattering and brightness properties. The new concept of fines-pigment-based furnish enables us to <b>load</b> <b>pigments</b> in uncoated wood free paper up to 50 %- 60 %. However, dewatering time is considerably longer. This method needs to be optimised, with further research on dewatering, and printability, before scaling it to an industrial process. This study shows the potential of different approaches, novel furnish components and addition of pigment onto a formed web, in the creation of new composite fine paper. Novel composite structure for fine paper can be achieved by employing the smallest component of pulp fibres, cellulosic microfines, in combination with pigments. The characteristics of microfines and crystal structure of pigments are important control variables in the formation and properties of the new composite paper. On the other hand, cellulosic microfines are highly swollen and retard dewatering. Therefore, further optimisation of process methodology and product quality can be expected to lead to some useful advances in commercialisation of this technology...|$|R
