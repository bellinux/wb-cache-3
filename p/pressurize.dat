5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to <b>pressurize</b> the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

25|$|The crew enjoyed, for {{the first}} time in a bomber, full-pressurization comfort. This first-ever cabin {{pressure}} system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch. The nose and the cockpit were <b>pressurized,</b> but the designers were faced with deciding whether to have bomb bays that were not <b>pressurized,</b> between fore and aft <b>pressurized</b> sections, or a fully <b>pressurized</b> fuselage with the need to de-pressurize to drop their loads. The solution was a long tunnel over the two bomb bays so as not to interrupt pressurization during bombing.

25|$|When {{it turned}} out that the {{prosecutors}} were slow to continue the Klongchan lawsuit with regard to Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI and several other police departments started to press charges on other people related to the temple. To further <b>pressurize</b> Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI also expanded its focus to branch centers of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Branch centers in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiangmai, Kanchanaburi, Loei, and Tak were investigated and charged with encroaching on nature reserves. On 21 November, this finally led to another two arrest warrants, totaling three, and plans were made by the Thai police, and the DSI to take Luang Por Dhammajayo into custody, through force if required.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to <b>pressurize</b> and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During {{filling process}} of vacuum counter-pressure casting, the <b>pressurizing</b> {{velocity}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters, and it affects whole filling process of molten metal and the quality of castings, the <b>pressurizing</b> velocity must be reasonably controlled and chosen. Through analyzing the <b>pressurizing</b> velocity of vacuum counter-pressure casting filling process, the results show that <b>pressurizing</b> velocity is related with absolute temperature of down kettle gas, radius of rising tube, initial volume of down kettle, height from original position of molten metal to top of rising tube and gas flux. When other conditions are same during filling process of vacuum counter-pressure casting, <b>pressurizing</b> velocity is proportional to gas flux, and it is linear. Meanwhile, through experimental verification for relationship of <b>pressurizing</b> velocity with gas flux, their actual relationships and mathematical models are obtained, and correction coefficient is determined at the range from 0. 95 to 0. 98...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pressurized</b> {{ventilation}} acts {{to increase}} the oxygen supply to roots and rhizomes in some species of emergent plants. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated how <b>pressurized</b> ventilation affected growth, biomass allocation and mineral content of Phragmites australis in two water depths (15 cm or 75 cm) and two substrates (organic sediment or sand). Through perforating each stem above the water surface, <b>pressurized</b> ventilation was inhibited without affecting oxygen diffusion. In controls, 10 - 20 % of the stems were perforated {{to make certain that}} lack of efflux sites would not limit <b>pressurized</b> ventilation. Plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation had lower oxygen concentrations in their stem bases than control plants. Growth was lower in plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation compared to controls except when plants grew in a combination of sand and shallow water. In plants grown in an organic sediment, but not in those grown in sand, inhibition of <b>pressurized</b> ventilation resulted in decreased biomass allocation to soil roots but increased allocation to aquatic roots. Stem perforation affected the tissue concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and aluminium but not of calcium or iron. We suggest that the lower growth in plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation was caused by decreased mineral uptake, which may have resulted from the decreased proportional allocation to soil root weight, from decreased mineral availability or from impaired root function. In plants grown in sand in shallow water, diffusion seemed to cover the oxygen demand, as <b>pressurized</b> ventilation did not affect growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChinese fire {{prevention}} codes provided that <b>pressurized</b> ventilation {{system should be}} used in the staircase which can not exhaust fire smoke naturally. However, the codes only specified the specific parts of <b>pressurized</b> ventilation and ventilation volume, while they did not specify how to make the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation effective in particular cases. As a result, in engineering application, some staircase <b>pressurized</b> ventilation systems can not effectively prevent smoke entering the staircase. For instance, in a staircase where the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system must be used according to the codes, opened windows were set in the wall of the staircase so as to facilitate lighting and ventilation. Although that conforms to the codes, the effect of preventing smoke invasion is still unknown. This simulation study focused on the influence of opened windows on the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system. It was found that if there were no open windows in the staircase, the system worked. At the same time, smoke would flow into the staircase in a short time and the high temperature was fatal to the evacuees if there were opened windows on the wall of this space. These results indicated that opened windows in the staircase would lead to uselessness of the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system. In conclusion, it was suggested there are no windows in the staircase in which a <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system should be used. And if windows are necessary in the <b>pressurized</b> staircase for light, the windows should be fixed casement windows...|$|R

Flush toilets can be plumbed to use greywater (previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) rather than potable water (drinking water). Some modern toilets <b>pressurize</b> the water in the tank, which initiates flushing action with less water usage.|$|E
