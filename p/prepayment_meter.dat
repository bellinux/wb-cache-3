The connection between fuel poverty, and electricity disconnection or 'self-disconnection' is analysed for four cities using <b>prepayment</b> <b>metering</b> to pay for electricity. A price comparison analysis on a government-sponsored website showed that <b>prepayment</b> <b>metering</b> was more expensive than other payment options. This website analysis was supplemented by qualitative data from older people with chronic respiratory disease expressing their views about electricity disconnection and <b>prepayment</b> <b>metering.</b> We show that <b>prepayment</b> <b>metering</b> for electricity is more expensive than other payment methods in New Zealand and that older people's insights provide valuable context to these issues. Under the present payment schedule, the use of <b>prepayment</b> <b>metering</b> to pay for electricity is not a suitable policy instrument to address fuel poverty, which remains problematic.

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{authentication}} protocols designed for ease of human use, which rely on users copying a short string of digits. Historical examples include telex test keys and early nuclear firing codes; familiar modern examples include <b>prepayment</b> <b>meter</b> codes and the 3 -digit card verification values used in online shopping. In this paper, we show how security protocols that are designed for human readability and interaction can fail to provide adequate protection against simple attacks. To illustrate the problem, we discuss an offline payment protocol and explain various problems. We work through multiple iterations, or 'evolutions', of the protocol in order to get better tradeoffs between security and usability. We discuss the limitation of verifying such protocols using BAN logic. Our aim is to develop usable human-friendly protocols {{that can be used in}} constrained offline environments. We conclude that protocol designers need to be good curators of security state, and also pay attention to the interaction between online and offline functions. In fact, we suggest that delay-tolerant networking might be a future direction of evolution for protocol research...|$|E

It present a set of mobile prepayment solution in which the <b>prepayment</b> <b>meter</b> (PM) system is implemented without smart card and user need not go to agency by oneself for prepayment. For the purpose of solving the difficult problem of utility meter prepayment at the specific location in person, mobile payment client (MPC) with graph user interface (GUI) located on mobile device which is responded for business initiation. PM is connected to PS via Zigbee network or WLAN in short range access network and via the 3 rd generation wireless communication infrastructure (3 G) in long range access network, and utility meter may connect Zigbee node via RS 485 bus. By means of identification and mutual authentication which generating different session key with time stamps every time, the cross validation mechanism among PM, MPC and PS improve the security of mobile prepayment system. The security mechanism is given in the end including user identification, mutual authentication, and data integrity and data confidentiality. In the end, ZigBee node hardware design and meter interface design is introduced and a practical application is given. The result of the present work implied that mobile phone is gradually becoming a data access and exchange platform of mobile payment, and WiMax is another competitive technology which will be used in the utility wireless prepayment solution...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{research}} conducted in Kitwe, Zambia {{on the effects of}} the introduction of <b>prepayment</b> <b>meters</b> on the energy usage behaviour of domestic consumers in the Low, Medium and High Income categories. The research was motivated by {{the fact that there is}} very little information that exists on the subject not just in Zambia but world-wide. The paper has identified some key issue vis-a-viz: behavioral change as a result of the introduction of the <b>prepayment</b> <b>meters,</b> debt recovery and reduction of pilferage, disconnection of consumers and alternative energy sources and feedback. The data was collected in Kwacha (Low Income), Ndeke (Medium Income) and Parklands (High Income). This was both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data was collected through structured questionnaires of which 151 were collected in total as follows: 59 (Kwacha); 50 (Ndeke) and 42 (Parklands). The qualitative data was collected through detailed interviews conducted with four households in each of the three household categories. The major findings are that there is general satisfaction from the households on the introduction of the <b>prepayment</b> <b>meters</b> citing control over expenditure and no disputes on bills as the main reasons. Many of the households also reported an improvement in their budgeting for electricity and there seems to have been a drop in the numbers of households with historical debt. Many households in Ndeke and Kwacha reported spending less on electricity after the introduction of the <b>prepayment</b> <b>meters</b> which has been attributed to the fact that they are no longer on flat tariffs and also they are now able to conserve electricity as they are more conscious about expenditure on the same. Many households in Ndeke and Kwacha also reported being disconnected because they run out of credit due to lack of money. Rationing was also reported to be actively being used by households in Ndeke and Kwacha as a way of extending their credit in times when they do not have money to buy credit. Disconnections and rationing were not widely reported in Parklands as households there are not stressed with expenditure on electricity. This is because the people in Ndeke spend twice as much on electricity (as a proportion of their income) as do those in Parklands. The expenditure by households in Kwacha is even more so. Finally, the study has found that 21 % of all the households have moved from using electricity for cooking to charcoal. This is likely to have some negative consequences for the environment as it might lead to deforestation. It is strongly recommended that a study be done on this subject to establish the true impact of this switch from electricity to charcoal by households...|$|R

40|$|The United Kingdom began deregulating its {{electric}} market {{years before}} the U. S. Thus, the UK provides {{the best example of}} what can be expected in the deregulated residential retail electric market in the United States.. An extensive review of the evidence found: Questionable price savings: Large drops in wholesale market prices were not fully passed on to residential consumers in the deregulated marketplace. Increase in complaints: The volume of complaints about energy companies jumped after deregulation, and new types of complaints such as unauthorized switching of service (âslammingâ) arose. Failure of Competition to Develop: Rather than compete for new customers, companies are relying on customer inertia to keep their existing customer base. Higher prices for low- income consumers: Since deregulation begain in 1990, there has been a marked increase in the use of <b>prepayment</b> <b>meters,</b> resulting in low-income customers paying more for their electricity.

40|$|Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO), {{state owned}} {{monopoly}} that generates, transmits, and distributes and sales electric power nationwide, has been undergoing various continued utility management practices. One {{of the major}} improvements, {{as part of the}} transformation, was the introduction of <b>Prepayment</b> (<b>Metering)</b> System, over that of the conventional metering service, which had been forcing the Corporation to follow lengthy service processes, in order to support the realization of its long term strategic vision of providing quality electric service and being competitive in an energy export. However, despite the introduction of this new type of service-prepayment customer service, the Corporation {{has not been able to}} attract more than only about five percent out of the two million total customers. Therefore, this study tried to assess and analyze the existing practice (quality) of prepayment customer service both from the employee and the Corporationâs perspectives, and thereby propose possible marketing strategies that are capable of improving the customer service quality for the subsequent adoption of prepayment service. SERVQUAL, as a methodological approach to service quality measures, was employed to measure the prepayment service quality by comparing customersâ perception of the received service against their expectations. Accordingly, the study revealed, despite its limitations, that there has been a substantial gap between customersâ expectations and perception of the service rendered, for which different possible marketing strategies were suggested for improvement...|$|R

Over the last decade, however, these traditional systems have been overtaken, in both value and extent, by commercial applications whose goal is to prevent fraud by making payment tokens and transaction records difficult to copy or alter. Automatic teller machines were the first major instance of this and have been followed by satellite TV decoders, road toll tags, cellular telephone identity modules, building, safe and car burglar alarms, and remote replenishment of devices such as postal f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Much of {{the debate}} on {{cryptography}} has assumed that the real tension is between the stateâs desire for effective policing and {{the privacy of the}} individual. We argue that this is misguided. Very few fielded cryptosystems are concerned with secrecy: systems such as automatic teller machines, <b>prepayment</b> electricity <b>meters</b> and satellite TV decoders use crypto to prevent fraud, and the operators of these systems have enough clout to make restrictions on crypto a problem for governments. Last year, for example, the Dutch government had to back down from proposals to restrict civilian cryptography, and John Major has recently said that no further restrictions are envisaged in the UK. The really serious problem for developers of commercial cryptosystems is quite different: it is that cryptography is very difficult to use in evidence. There are simple legal tactics which can undermine any claim to the effect that âour system is secureâ, and their use has led to a series of cases in which prosecutions for fraud have been defeated by defence challenges to the integrity of evidence from bank computers. This may open new opportunities for researchers in security and reliability. ...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{security}} devices are becoming ubiquitous, from pay-TV through mobile phones, PDA, <b>prepayment</b> gas <b>meters</b> to smart cards. There are many ongoing research {{efforts to keep}} these devices secure from opponents who try to retrieve key information by observation or manipulation of the chipâs components. In common industrial practise, it is after the chip has been manufactured that security evaluation is performed. Due to design time oversights, however, weaknesses are often revealed in fabricated chips. Furthermore, post manufacture security evaluation is time consuming, error prone and very expensive. This evokes the need of design time security evaluation techniques {{in order to identify}} avoidable mistakes in design. This thesis proposes a set of design time security evaluation methodologies covering the well-known non-invasive side-channel analysis attacks, such as power analysis and electromagnetic analysis attacks. The thesis also covers the recently published semi-invasive optical fault injection attacks. These security evaluation technologies examine the system under test by reproducing attacks through simulation and observing its subsequent response. The proposed design time security evaluation methodologies can be easily implemented into the standard integrated circuit design flow, requiring only commonly used EDA tools. So it adds little non-recurrent engineering (NRE) cost to the chip design but helps identify the security weaknesses at an early stage, avoids costly silicon re-spins, and helps succeed in industrial evaluation for faster time-to-market. ...|$|R

Under the brand name CASHPOWER 2000, EML produces single and polyphase <b>prepayment</b> utility <b>meters.</b> Currently, these meters currently utilise a separate module for the measuring of electrical energy. In order to reduce component costs, EML proposed the energy measurement be conducted by the onboard Microcontroller Unit (MCU), a term known as On-Chip-Metering (OCM). It is envisioned that this would quickly translate {{in an increase in}} revenue. However, a major concern regarding this has been the increase in the required processor overhead. The CASHPOWER 2000 embedded MCU would be required to conduct all the present metering functionality in addition to the energy measurement.
