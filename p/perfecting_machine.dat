40|$|Photographic {{works on}} the subject of still life and the animal. For Aristotle, the anima, the soul is {{predicated}} upon life and movement. What is the soul of a still life may we ask, and how can photography make us think about the relation between the animate and the inanimate? For Descartes, the animal, deprived of language, has no soul. Yet it is a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine.</b> Is the camera also a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> with no language or thought...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} linear machine {{imperfections}} are discussed under the following main headings: field errors, gradient errors, coupling. The {{starting point of}} all the calculations is a <b>perfect</b> linear <b>machine.</b> The equilibrium orbit, the Twiss parameters and the dispersion are all assumed to be known. The equilibrium orbit is the periodic solution of the equations of motion for the <b>perfect</b> <b>machine.</b> (9 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{transverse}} {{motion of the}} barycentres of bunches in two beams that circulate in opposite direction in a storage ring, and are coupled by the beam-beam effect. The motion is described by a linear system of oscillators, and represented by a matrix. We distinguish between <b>perfect</b> <b>machines</b> in which the bunch parameters and the arc and interaction point parameters are all equal, and machines with errors in which {{at least one of}} these conditions is not satisfied. We determine the regions in tune space where the motion is unstable, analytically for <b>perfect</b> <b>machines,</b> and numerically for machines with errors. We identify these regions as resonances related to the tunes of one of the two beams or to their sum. We establish which resonances are excited under given conditions. We find that more resonances occur in machines with errors than in <b>perfect</b> <b>machines.</b> By multi-particle tracking, we study the instability at finite amplitudes...|$|R
60|$|I guess we've got a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> at last. We never break a type, now, and the {{new device}} for {{enabling}} the operator to touch the last letters and justify the line simultaneously works, to a charm.|$|R
50|$|Engineer '06 in 2006 {{included}} paper presentation competitions, project presentations, Shrishti, where {{participants are}} required to apply engineering {{for the greater good}} of society, robotics events (<b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine,</b> Automata), hacking contests, programming contests, design problems, and workshops and seminars.|$|R
50|$|In {{the history}} of science, the {{clockwork}} universe compares the universe to a mechanical clock. It continues ticking along, as a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine,</b> with its gears governed {{by the laws of}} physics, making every aspect of the machine predictable.|$|R
5000|$|This {{theory was}} also used to {{determine}} horse power (hp), which {{was defined as the}} amount of work a horse could do with a given load over time. The wheel that the horse turned in Watt's original experiment put a certain load on the horse's muscles, and the horse could do a certain amount of work with this load in a minute. Provided the horse was a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine,</b> it would be capable of a constant maximum workload, so increasing the load by a given percentage would result in the possible work done decreasing by the same percentage, so that it would still equal [...] "1 hp". Horses are, obviously, not <b>perfect</b> <b>machines</b> and over short time periods are capable of as much as 14 hp, and over long periods of exertion output an average of less than 1 hp.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine</b> is a 2005 album by Vision Divine. It is {{a concept}} album dealing with a {{scientist}} {{who is able to}} put an end to death and disease for all mankind, and thus make the human race immortal. The story considers the social and religious aspects of what such a discovery could bring.|$|R
60|$|He {{celebrated his}} sixteenth {{birthday}} by {{going into the}} loom room and taking a loom. Here was an incentive again, for it was piece-work. And he excelled, because the clay of him had been moulded by the mills into the <b>perfect</b> <b>machine.</b> At the end of three months he was running two looms, and, later, three and four.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{studies of}} a linac {{that follows the}} earth {{curvature}} are presented for the CLIC main linac. The curvature of the tunnel is modeled in a realistic way by use of geometry changing elements. The emittance preservation is studied for a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> as well as taking into account imperfections. Results for a curved linac are compared with those for a laser-straight machine...|$|R
50|$|The last of {{the three}} Rockit band albums, <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine</b> was also Hancock's final album for Columbia Records and is {{considered}} the least popular of the three Rockit band albums. The album was released in 1988 following Sound-System which won Hancock's second Grammy award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance in 1985 and Round Midnight which won the Academy Award for Best Music, Original Score in 1986.|$|R

50|$|August 2003 - {{he became}} a member of metal band Vision Divine with whom he {{released}} three albums: Stream of Consciousness (2004), the Stage Of Consciousness DVD (2005), The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine</b> (2005) and The 25th Hour (2007). He performed world tours with Vision Divine and other opening acts for artists as Dream Theater, Nightwish, Helloween, Children Of Bodom and many others until his departure from the band in 2008.|$|R
50|$|In 1870 {{he founded}} a business, {{manufacturing}} specialties {{of his own}} invention. In the centennial year of 1876, he began his major life work, the invention of an automatic process to produce horse nails. After years of frustration, failure, {{and the loss of}} thousands of dollars, a <b>perfected</b> <b>machine</b> was exhibited to investors in Hartford, Connecticut in the fall of 1880. In 1881, George J. Capewell formed the Capewell Horsenail Company in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|In {{this tale}} Lem puts forth {{the idea that}} what is {{perceived}} a human weakness is in fact an advantage over a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine.</b> Pirx defeats the robot, because a human can hesitate, make wrong decisions, have doubts, but a robot cannot. A similar idea is present in Isaac Asimov's Robot series, where putting a robot {{in a position where}} it cannot chose between the Three laws of robotics fries its positronic brain.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a nearly}} five-year hiatus, {{he had a}} {{comeback}} in 1988 (with some help from producer Bill Laswell). What's Bootsy Doin'? flaunted a new sound that foreshadowed the 1990s, such as the dance floor smash [...] "Party on Plastic". Laswell introduced Collins to Herbie Hancock, resulting in <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine.</b> The techno-funk they recorded featured turnables for scratch appeal, and the smoothly-stylized vocals of Leroy [...] "Sugarfoot" [...] Bonner of chart-topping Ohio Players.|$|R
50|$|Motifs of {{the story}} include the natural versus the artificial, with the real Nightingale {{juxtaposed}} with its mechanical replacement. It {{is interesting to note}} that this was not the first (or last) piece by Stravinsky centered on the character of a bird, nor was it his first fascination with a seemingly <b>perfect</b> <b>machine,</b> as records tell us Stravinsky often preferred the sound of a mechanical pianola, to the human (and inevitably imperfect) performance on a real piano.|$|R

40|$|We outline {{four types}} of machine that {{informed}} Turing's investigations: the subversion machine, the improving <b>machine,</b> the <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> and the dysfunctional machine. We show how each deals {{with the issue of}} dysfunction, and argue that in design the ways that machines do not work can be just as illuminating as how they do. In this investigation we call on the reflections of the surrealists who sought the incongruity of object and context as the means to understanding the anarchical play of design...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart is}} a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> whose mass is mainly {{composed}} of cardiomy-ocytes, but also fibroblasts, endothelial, smooth muscle, nervous, and immune cells are represented. One thousand mil-lion cardiomyocytes {{are estimated to be}} lost after myocardial infarction, their loss being responsible for the impairment in heart contractile function (Laflamme and Murry, 2005). The potential success of cardiac cell therapy relies almost completely on the ability of the implanted cells to differenti-ate toward mature cardiomyocytes. These cells must be able to reinforce the pumpin...|$|R
5000|$|A chance {{meeting between}} Laswell and Herbie Hancock at Elektra Records, {{in which the}} latter {{expressed}} interest in making music in the vein of Malcolm McLaren's [...] "Buffalo Gals" [...] lead to a collaboration that brought forth the Future Shock album and the hit single [...] "Rockit". They would collaborate with Hancock on two further albums released under his name, 1984's Sound-System and 1988's <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine.</b> Hancock himself {{would go on to}} contribute to many of Material and Laswell's projects.|$|R
6000|$|The {{momentary}} {{charge at}} Balaclava, in obedience to a blundering command, proving what a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> the soldier is, has, properly enough, been celebrated by a poet laureate; but the steady, {{and for the}} most part successful, charge of this man, for some years, against the legions of Slavery, in obedience to an infinitely higher command, is as much more memorable than that, as an intelligent and conscientious man is superior to a machine. Do you think that that will go unsung? ...|$|R

The muscle is able to decide to where it can already develop but work that with the lactacid acid irrigation of announces a fatigue as it is an indicator to stop some maximum force...|$|R
5000|$|In a way, Pirx is as an {{ordinary}} [...] "working man" [...] who unlike traditional heroic space pilots has little if anything heroic about him. He sometimes {{finds himself in}} extreme situations, which he overcomes mostly through ordinary common sense and average luck. In particular, in the story The Inquest, Lem puts forth the idea that what is perceived a human weakness is in fact an advantage over a <b>perfect</b> <b>machine.</b> In this tale Pirx defeats the robot, because a human can hesitate, make wrong decisions, have doubts, but a robot cannot.|$|R
6000|$|These {{were the}} days when the {{typewriter}} was new. Clemens and [...] Twichell, during their stay in Boston, had seen the marvel in [...] operation, and Clemens had been unable to resist owning one. It was [...] far from being the <b>perfect</b> <b>machine</b> of to-day; the letters were all [...] capitals, and one was never quite certain, even of those. Mark [...] Twain, however, began with enthusiasm and practised faithfully. On [...] the day of its arrival he wrote two letters that have survived, the [...] first to his brother, the other to Howells.|$|R
50|$|Betaville is {{the setting}} for all the stories of Welcome to Paradox. Set in an {{unspecified}} time in the future, Betaville {{is a city of}} Utopian ideals. There is no crime, violence, disease, or any other problems of modern society. However, there is a dark undercurrent in Betaville that impacts some citizens directly. Technology has invaded daily life to the point that simulated reality is preferred to actual reality, <b>perfect</b> <b>machines</b> are wresting control from their wealthy and pampered owners, and humanity is challenged by genetic engineering and social engineering programs that push the limits of arrogance and sanity.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986 Hancock {{performed}} and acted {{in the film}} 'Round Midnight. He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. His film work was prolific during the 1980s, and included the scores to A Soldier's Story (1984), Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986), Action Jackson (1988, with Michael Kamen), Colors (1988), and the Eddie Murphy comedy Harlem Nights (1989). Often he would also write music for TV commercials. [...] "Maiden Voyage", in fact, {{started out as a}} cologne advertisement. At the end of the <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine</b> tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.|$|R
50|$|Future 2 Future is the forty-third album by Herbie Hancock. Hancock {{reunited with}} bass player Bill Laswell (who {{worked on the}} {{influential}} early 1980s albumsFuture Shock, Sound-System and <b>Perfect</b> <b>Machine)</b> {{and the two of}} them tried to recapture the success of the three previous albums that fuse jazz with cutting-edge electronic music.In yet another innovative stylistic move, Herbie reunited with Bill Laswell in the creation of a 21st Century collaboration with some of the young hip-hop and techno artists who have drawn on his massive influence to create their own music of the future. The album was released in spring, 2001, and is entitled FUTURE2FUTURE.|$|R
