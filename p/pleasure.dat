30|$|Simple <b>pleasures.</b> Simple <b>pleasures</b> in {{life are}} common sights or sensations that are often taken for granted, such as {{sunlight}} or the sight of leaves in autumn.

Hence, if simple <b>pleasures</b> are attended to, they can present frequent opportunities for gratefulness independently of other circumstances.|$|R

5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only <b>pleasure</b> to understanding truth as a mixture of both <b>pleasure</b> and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the <b>pleasure.</b> Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of <b>pleasure.</b> Poetry does not bring about the <b>pleasure</b> that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only <b>pleasure.</b>|$|E

30|$|Most uniquely, {{humans have}} many {{prominent}} higher order, abstract or cultural <b>pleasures,</b> including personal achievement {{as well as}} intellectual, artistic, musical, altruistic, and transcendent <b>pleasures.</b> While the neuroscience of higher <b>pleasures</b> is in relative infancy, even here there seems overlap in brain circuits with more basic hedonic <b>pleasures</b> (Frijda 2010; Harris et al. 2009; Leknes and Tracey 2010; Salimpoor et al. 2011; Skov 2010; Vuust and Kringelbach 2010).

5000|$|Mill’s thesis {{distinguishes between}} higher and lower <b>pleasures.</b> He {{frequently}} discusses {{the importance of}} acknowledgement of higher <b>pleasures.</b> [...] "To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit they designate as utterly mean and groveling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine," [...] (Mill). When he says higher <b>pleasures,</b> he means the <b>pleasures</b> that access higher abilities and capacities in humans such as intellectual prosperity, whereas lower <b>pleasures</b> would mean bodily or temporary <b>pleasures.</b> [...] "But it must be admitted that when utilitarian writers have said that mental <b>pleasures</b> are better than bodily ones they have mainly based this on mental <b>pleasures</b> being more permanent, safer, less costly and so on - i.e. from their circumstantial advantages rather than from their intrinsic nature," [...] (Mill, 6). All of this factors into John Mill’s own definition of utilitarianism, and shows why it differs from other definitions.|$|R

2500|$|He {{also notes}} that, {{contrary}} to what its critics might say, there is [...] "no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the <b>pleasures</b> of the intellect… a much higher value as <b>pleasures</b> than to those of mere sensation." [...] However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual <b>pleasures</b> {{are thought to have}} circumstantial advantages, i.e. [...] "greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, [...] " [...] Instead, Mill will argue that some <b>pleasures</b> are intrinsically better than others.|$|R

30|$|Notable {{progress}} has been made in understanding brain bases of hedonic processing, producing insights into that brain systems that cause and/or code sensory <b>pleasures.</b> Progress has been facilitated by the recognition that hedonic brain mechanisms are largely shared between humans and other mammals, allowing application of conclusions from animal studies to a better understanding of human <b>pleasures.</b> In the past few years, evidence has also grown to indicate that for humans, brain mechanisms of higher abstract <b>pleasures</b> strongly overlap with more basic sensory <b>pleasures.</b> This overlap may provide a window into underlying brain circuitry that generates all <b>pleasures,</b> including even the hedonic quality of pervasive well-being that detaches from any particular sensation to apply to daily life in a more sustained or frequent fashion.|$|R

40|$|Two recent {{critics of}} Mill’s {{qualitative}} hedonism, Michael Hauskeller and Kristin Schaupp, argue that Mill’s distinction between higher and lower <b>pleasures</b> was largely unsuccessful. They allege that Mill failed {{to demonstrate that}} some <b>pleasures</b> are lexically preferred to others, and indeed {{that this can be}} shown false by the fact that most people would not renounce supposedly lower <b>pleasures,</b> such as chocolate or sex, even for greater amounts of higher <b>pleasures,</b> such as reading or opera. I respond that many of these criticisms rest on uncharitable assumptions or interpretations of Mill’s position. We need not suppose that Mill was even trying to do the things he supposedly failed to do. However, considering these objections may lead us to a more plausible interpretation of Mill’s views, according to which the quality of <b>pleasures,</b> along with their quantity, contributes towards happiness. There is no need to suppose that ‘higher pleasures’ must be lexically preferred to lower ones, or even to be dogmatic about which <b>pleasures</b> are higher...|$|R
