Benjamin Priestley recognized in 1751 marks of material removal as “footprints”, when electrical discharges take place between two electrodes.

Meritens started in 1881 the use of electrical discharges with material transfer for arc-welding purposes, but it took until years around World War 2, before electrical discharges were used for controlled metal removal operations. This application is today nearly 75 years going on and developed to an important industry-branch.

Component suppliers in Bursa have gained design and <b>product-development</b> competences, {{one result of}} which is that European and global firms have turned to the creation of modular value chains for the sourcing of components from these suppliers. This paper considers the implications of the insertion of Turkish suppliers into modular value chains on suppliers' upgrading, and reveals that, despite the diffusion of design and <b>product-development</b> competences to suppliers in Bursa, cutting-edge innovation activities such as marketing and branding continue to remain the domain of the lead firms. It is argued that although Turkish suppliers seem to be successful in upgrading to take on design and <b>product-development</b> tasks, this has been more due to the willingness of global lead firms to relinquish these functions than to the success of Turkish suppliers in encroaching upon these once core competences of their customers.

40|$|The {{diagnostics}} {{industry is}} constantly under pres-sure to bring innovation quicker to market {{and so the}} impetus to speed up <b>product-development</b> cycle times becomes greater. There {{are a number of}} steps in the <b>product-development</b> cycle where the application of high-throughput screening can help. In the case of lateral-flow immuno-diagnostics the selection of antibody reagents is paramount. In particular, rapid identification of antibody pairs that are able to 'sandwich ' around the target antigen is required. One screen that has been applied successfully is the use of surface plasmon resonance biosensors like Biacore". Using such a system one can evaluate over 400 antibody pairings in under 5 days. Conventional approaches to screen this number of antibody pairs would take many months. Other automated screening systems like DELFIAm can be used in processing the vast amount of tests required for clinical trials. In addition, the use of robotics to automate routine product testing can be used to shorten the <b>product-development</b> cycle. Consumer diagnostics and the need for speed When the consumer-diagnostic market took off in the mid- 1980 s one of the first tests on the market was the pregnancy test. The introduction of the lateral-flow pregnancy test by Unipath in 1988 demonstrated that the introduction of radical technology that met the consumer need could quickly establish a leading market position. Since that time {{there have been a number}} of lateral-flow rapid assay tests introduced into a number of markets by a number of companies. Lateral assay flow technology typically relies on the migration of particles along a porous medium such as nitrocellulose (see Figure la).

Therefore, in the presence of analyte the moving particle is arrested at the antibody line on the nitrocellulose as it is th...|$|E

40|$|Background and problem: The {{problem of}} this thesis {{concerns}} {{the existence of}} project failures in companies caused by poor knowledge and poor use of project management and project risk management. There is {{a gap between the}} recommendations in the literature on how projects and the risks connected to projects should be managed and how it is actually done in practice. We have analysed how well a high-technological company, conducting work in project form, uses project management and project risk management theory in order to avoid project failures. Semcon develops products featuring the latest technology in projects for external customers and is one of Scandinavia's leading design and competence companies. The business is conducted through external consulting activities and through taking full responsibility for <b>product-development</b> projects. Semcon’s objective is to grow by taking on more commercial <b>product-development</b> projects. The high complexity of the projects places Semcon in a situation where it is important to manage the risks facing the projects. Semcon has had problems with losses and even failure in some of their <b>product-development</b> projects. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is, therefore, to analyse how Semcon works with project management and project risk management. An identification of risks was done and Semcon’s risk management process was analysed. Limitations: The empirical study will only be done on Semcon’s project management and project risk management. Method: A qualitative case-study strategy is applied since qualitative research obtains a deeper knowledge of the studied phenomenon in its context. The qualitative method is flexible to the extent that new information that appears in the initial phase of the analysis can lead to improvements in the wording of questions. We studied literature in the field of project management and project risk management and made several interviews with employees at Semcon. Conclusion: The most relevant conclusion is that Semcon needs to develop and implement a more standardized method for project management and project risk management if they are to create growth by taking on more projects...|$|E
40|$|Models and {{scientific}} evidence suggest that firms are more successful at new-product development {{if there is}} greater communication among marketing, engineering, and manufacturing. This paper examines communication patterns for two matched <b>product-development</b> teams where the key difference between the groups is that one used a phase-review development process and the other used Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a <b>product-development</b> process adopted recently at over 100 United States and Japanese firms. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} head-to-head comparison of traditional U. S. product development processes with QFD. Our data suggest that QFD enhances communication levels within the core team (marketing, engineering, manufacturing). QFD changes communication patterns from "up-over-down" flows through management to more horizontal routes where core team members communicate directly with one another. On the other hand, the QFD team communicates less on planning information and less with members of the firm external to the team. If this paucity of external communication means that the team has the information it needs for product development, and the QFD process has provided an effective means for moving the information through the team, it is a positive impact of QFD. If the result means that QFD induces team insularity, even when the team needs to reach out to external information sources, it is a cause for concern. communication, product development, marketing...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of consumer preferences reduces development costs {{and leads to}} successful products. Some <b>product-development</b> teams use quantitative methods such as conjoint analysis or structured methods such as Casemap. Other <b>product-development</b> teams rely on unstructured methods such as direct conversations with consumers, focus groups, or qualitative interviews. All methods assume that measured consumer preferences endure and are relevant for consumers' marketplace decisions. This article suggests that if consumers are not first given tasks to encourage preference self-reflection, unstructured methods may not measure accurate and enduring preferences. This paper provides evidence that consumers learn their preferences as they make realistic decisions. Sufficiently challenging decision tasks encourage preference self-reflection which, in turn, leads to more accurate and enduring measures. Evidence suggests further that if consumers are asked to articulate preferences before self-reflection, then that articulation interferes with consumers' abilities to articulate preferences even after {{they have a chance}} to self-reflect. The evidence that self-reflection enhances accuracy is based on experiments in the automotive and mobile phone markets. Consumers completed three rotated incentive-aligned preference measurement methods (revealed-preference measures [as in conjoint analysis], a structured method [Casemap], and an unstructured preference-articulation method). The stimuli were designed to be managerially relevant and realistic (53 aspects in automobiles, 22 aspects for mobile phones) so that consumers' decisions approximated in vivo decisions. One to three weeks later, consumers were asked which automobiles (or mobile phones) they would consider. Qualitative comments and response times are consistent with the implications of the measures of predictive ability...|$|E
