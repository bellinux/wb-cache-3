5000|$|In sound recording, {{talkback}} {{refers to}} the intercom system used in recording studios and <b>production</b> <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> (PCR) in television studios to enable personnel to communicate {{with people in the}} recording area or booth. While the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> can hear the person in the booth over the studio microphones, the person in the booth hears the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> over a PA, monitor speaker, in their headphones or Interruptible feedback (IFB) earpiece.

[...] Equalization may {{also be used to}} eliminate or reduce unwanted sounds (e.g., low hum coming from a guitar amplifier), make certain instruments or voices more (or less) prominent, enhance particular aspects of an instrument's tone, or combat feedback (howling) in a public address system. Equalizers are also used in music production to adjust the timbre of individual instruments and voices by adjusting their frequency content and to fit individual instruments within the overall frequency spectrum of the mix.|$|R

50|$|On April 10, 2006, WTAP {{launched}} a third digital subchannel {{to serve as}} the area's first locally based UPN affiliate. This could be seen on UHF channel 47.3 (or virtual channel 15.3 via PSIP). To make the service possible, WTAP underwent a technical transformation. It carved out a new digital <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> from space previously used for storage. The station also installed entirely digital <b>production</b> and master <b>control</b> <b>rooms.</b> After UPN merged with The WB to form The CW in September 2006, WTAP-DT3 transitioned from UPN to Fox's new sister network, MyNetworkTV. On September 3, 2012, the station moved to a new second subchannel of WIYE.|$|R
5000|$|Master {{control is}} the {{technical}} hub of a broadcast operation common among most over-the-air television stations and television networks. It {{is distinct from}} a <b>production</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> (PCR) in television studios where the activities such as switching from camera to camera are coordinated. It is also vastly different from the studio where the talent are located. A transmission control room (TCR) is usually smaller in size and is a scaled down version of centralcasting.|$|E
5000|$|On October 4, 2007, Global's then-parent company Canwest {{announced}} it would be centralizing news <b>production</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> functions for all O&Os (except CHBC Kelowna) at four broadcast centres - CHAN Vancouver, CITV Edmonton, CICT Calgary, and CIII Toronto. The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.|$|E
50|$|Until January 2013, this station's weeknight news at 6 {{was usually}} {{recorded}} during the mid-afternoon.

Sister station WICU-TV airs a midday show weekdays at 12:30 following WSEE-TV's long-running noon newscast. On weekends, the two television stations jointly produce local news at 6 and 11 p.m. These shows are known as Weekends Now. The WSEE-TV news department also produces the weekly public affairs program The Insider, which airs weekends Sunday morning on WSEE-TV.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} how the material {{design of the}} television studio influenced the resulting fictional mise en scene of different narrative formats broadcast on UK television. Through this spatial analysis the article considers how a bias was formed within the industry between high end single plays and popular series. Using archival production documents that detail the design and resourcing of studio space, it explores the different working studio practices that existed for the single play and series from 1955 - 63. Drawing on studio floor-plans, internal memos and institutional records of policy discussions that detail the creation, modification and resourcing of studio production facilities, including <b>production</b> <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> lighting systems, and camerawork, this article compares the different production practices for the popular BBC police series, Dixon of Dock Green (BBC 1955 - 1976) and the anthology series of single plays Armchair Theatre (ABC 1956 - 74). Although each text was produced for the rival channels of BBC 1 and ITV, my intention is not to provide a direct institutional comparison of the production practices of the BBC and ABC but rather to demonstrate how the design and technological resources of a studio can impact upon the aesthetics of different televisual narrative formats. Hence my primary aim {{is to examine the}} relationship between the physical attributes of studios and resultant styles of the cheaper, popular series and the more prestigious single play, offering an original approach to considering television space...|$|R
50|$|After Benedek {{declared}} bankruptcy and sold {{most of its}} stations in 2002, WTAP was bought by Gray Television. In 2004, {{it was the first}} NBC affiliate in West Virginia to offer programming from the network in high definition. In late 2005, Gray purchased NBC affiliate WSAZ-TV in Huntington making that station and WTAP sisters. On April 10, 2006, the station launched new second and third digital subchannel to serve as the area's Fox and UPN affiliates, respectively. To make these services possible, WTAP underwent a technical transformation. It carved out two new digital high definition-ready <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> from space previously used for storage.

The technical director ensures that all equipment in the PCR operates correctly. They also match the quality and the output of all the cameras on the studio floor through the camera control units (CCU) (Vision Engineering). The TD supervises the other crew members in the PCR. The technical director also coordinates the working of the whole crew, and handles technical problem before, during, or after the shooting of a project.|$|E

Included in the area is a TV <b>production</b> studio and <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> The WDSO transmitter remains at the old high school building (now Chesterton Middle School).

50|$|The Proud {{class was}} {{assigned}} to refurbished motor torpedo boat vessels originally manufactured by the British Power Boat Company during the Second World War. The Winola had been upgraded with gas turbine engines by the Marine Turbo Craft company, who had owned the craft before it was bought by Southern Television. In adapting the Southerner, forward bulkheads were removed to accommodate a 350 kg video recorder and other equipment, all {{of which could be}} installed and removed by crane for relatively easy turnaround. Two 4.5 inch image orthicon cameras were installed at the sides of the front deck while a third was mounted on top of the cabin for an all-round view.

50|$|On June 5, 2006, Michael Jackson made a {{surprise}} guest appearance. During the taping {{of the programs}} musical segment, S-Live, Jackson appeared on the set and visited SMAP. Chairs were brought in and the six of them made a brief conversation, along with a translator. The episode also aired footage of Jackson watching the bands performance in the <b>production</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> backstage, before he made his appearance on the set. Jackson promised SMAP {{that he would make}} an official guest appearance on the program the next time he was in Japan, though that did not come true, due to his death in 2009.

50|$|In June 2012, NBCUniversal {{announced}} plans to construct a new 75,000 sq ft facility in Fort Worth (located at the CentrePort Business Park on the former site of Amon Carter Field) to house KXAS, KXTX and NBCUniversal's other Dallas-based operations (including the Dallas news bureau operated by NBC News). Construction of the facility began that month, and was completed in September 2013, with the building formally opening on September 30. The facility incorporates four <b>production</b> studios; three <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> that relay high definition content; a combined media asset management center and newsroom production suite for managing and editing content; the station's traffic and sales departments, which were previously in separate areas of the Broadcast Hill studios, were also placed adjacent to the newsroom. The sales and marketing departments of the television stations, and NBC's ArtWorks graphics firm began migrating their operations to the facility in early October of that year; all other operations—including the news departments of KXAS and KXTX—moved to the Carter Boulevard studio by November 1, ending KXAS's 65-year tenure at Broadcast Hill.|$|R
