50|$|<b>Pigfish</b> {{are found}} along the Atlantic {{coast of the}} United States from New York to the {{northern}} Bahamas and Bermuda and in the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to the Yucatan Peninsula. Juveniles commonly occur in shallow waters near shore, often near vegetation. Adults are more frequently found in deeper areas over soft bottoms. <b>Pigfish</b> inhabit waters that range in temperature from 56.7 to 96.8 °F (13.7 to 36.0 °C) but are most commonly found at temperatures of 75.0 to 80.0 °F (23.9 to 26.7 °C). They can live in salinities of 0 to 44 ppt, but prefer salinities above 15 ppt.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pigfish</b> (Orthopristis chrysoptera) is {{a member}} of the Haemulidae family, members of which are {{commonly}} called grunts. This name derives from the grunting or chattering noise these fish make by rubbing their pharyngeal teeth together.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pigfish</b> is {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} the grunt family by its dorsal fin, which has 12 to 13 spines followed by 15 to 16 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines with 12 to 13 short rays. A scaly sheet covers the dorsal and anal fin spines, while the soft rays lack scales. On the body of the <b>pigfish,</b> above the lateral line there are 53 to 58 pored, lateral scales in ten longitudinal rows, and 15 to 19 rows below. The body color is generally light blue-grey, which fades to silver along the ventral region. Scales are bluish with bronze spots on the edge, which form stripes that are horizontal below the lateral line and curve slightly upward above the line. Fins are mostly yellow-bronze with dusky edges. Adults average 9.1 inches (23 cm), but have been recorded at lengths of up to 14.9 inches.|$|E

50|$|The {{brown pelican}} is a piscivore, {{primarily}} feeding on fish. It occasionally feeds on amphibians, and eggs and nestlings of birds (egrets, common murres {{and its own}} species). Menhaden may locally account for 90% of its diet. The anchovy supply is particularly important to the brown pelican's nesting success. However, its preferred prey is usually commercially fished species. Other fish preyed on with some regularity includes <b>pigfish,</b> pinfish, herring, sheepshead, silversides, mullets, sardines, and minnows, and it sometimes also eats crustaceans, usually prawns.|$|E

50|$|The Calusa diet at {{settlements}} {{along the}} coast and estuaries consisted primarily of fish, in particular pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), <b>pigfish</b> (redmouth grunt), (Orthopristis chrysoptera) and hardhead catfish (Ariopsis Felis). These small fish were supplemented by larger bony fish, sharks and rays, mollusks, crustaceans, ducks, sea and land turtles, and land animals. When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited in 1566, the Calusa served only fish and oysters to the Spanish. An analysis of faunal remains at one coastal habitation site, the Wightman site (on Sanibel Island), showed that more than 93 percent of the energy (kilocalories) from animals in the diet came from fish and shellfish, less than 6 percent of the energy came from mammals, and less than 1 percent came from birds and reptiles. By contrast, at an inland site, Platt Island, mammals (primarily deer) {{accounted for more than}} 60 percent of the energy from animal meat, while fish provided just under 20 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Around 3000 B.C., {{the sands}} of Captiva started to erode, {{resulting}} in the eventual formation of Sanibel Island. The Gulf of Mexico waters were eight feet lower than they are today. It is said that the first inhabitants of Captiva were The Calusa Indians. The population of the Calusa {{is believed to have}} reached as many as 50,000 people. [...] "Calusa" [...] means [...] "fierce people", and they were described as a war-like people. The Calusa Indians were resistant to colonization and attacked any explorers who came into their territory. Calusa Indians built their houses on stilts without walls. They wove palmetto leaves together to build roves (twisted strands of fibers). The Calusa Indians fished for food on the coast, bays, rivers, and waterways. They did not farm. “The men and boys of the tribe made nets from palm tree webbing to catch mullet, pinfish, <b>pigfish,</b> and catfish. They used spears to catch eels and turtles. They made fish bone arrowheads to hunt for animals such as deer. The women and children learned to catch shellfish like conchs, crabs, clams, lobsters, and oysters.” [...] The Calusa Indians used the shells on the island for utensils, jewelry, tools, weapons, and ornaments.|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} common {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) {{have been identified}} within St. George Sound, Florida, USA: high site-fidelity individuals (HSF) which are individuals sighted multiple times in the region (i. e., ≥ 2 months, ≥ 2 seasons, and ≥ 2 years), and low site-fidelity individuals (LSF), which are individuals sighted fewer than 2 months, in 2 different seasons among 2 different years. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} differences in foraging behaviors were correlated with differences in sighting frequency and overall usage of St. George Sound by the two groups. We used carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes and niche hypervolume metrics to model the foodweb of St. George Sound. Mixing model results indicated that croaker, mojarra, <b>pigfish,</b> pinfish, and silverperch were the most important prey items for dolphins. The hypervolume metrics demonstrate niche partitioning between HSFs and LSFs, with the HSFs relying more heavily on pinfish, <b>pigfish,</b> and mojarra, while the LSFs relied more on silverperch. Plankton, benthic diatoms, seagrass, and epiphytes all contributed to secondary production within St. George Sound. This diversity of source utilization by seagrass-associated consumers supported by a high rate of total production likely sustains high secondary productivity despite the potential for competition in this system. Zooplankton was the most important basal source to the system, followed by seagrass and benthic primary production (as indicated by a sanddollar proxy). The reliance of dolphins on seagrass-dependent prey indicates that alteration of seagrass habitat would significantly impact the dolphin community foraging in St. George Sound and suggests that preservation of seagrass habitat is an important component of an effective management strategy for dolphin populations in the region...|$|E
40|$|The {{perennial}} {{analysis of}} {{the production of the}} main industrial objects by private entrepreneurs in the Sivash bay is presented. The prohibition of the plaice-Glossa’s catch is saved. There is the reduction in net catches of haarder due to the decrease of the livestock herd, the poaching fishing, the water pollution of spawning places and graziery, and the lack of control by the fish inspection. The introduction of the serious control of mullet’s catch and good graziery conditions for this spe-cies facilitates to the restoration of their natural population. The <b>pigfish</b> are the additional objects of the catch with a slight annual increase in their number in catches, but they don’t have the significant influence on the formation of the overall productivity of fish in the Sivash bay. The larvae of hironomus takes the first place of the production on the territory of the East Sivash. There is a gradual advance of the whole productivity of fish in the east part of the Sivash bay, at the expense catching mullet, haarder and hironomus larvae...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that nursery areas provide an abundant food source as well as protection from predation for young sharks, and that these benefits are the reasons they use these areas. This study examined the abundance of prey species within a known nursery area, Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, and compared those data {{with the amount of}} time blacktip sharks spent within various geographic zones within the nursery. The most abundant prey species within the study site were pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides, <b>pigfish,</b> Orthopristis chrysoptera, spotfin mojarra, Eucinostomus argenteus, and silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura. Prey species were found to be most abundant in the mid to southern portion of the nursery area, whereas sharks spent the majority of their time within the northern portion of the study site. There was no correlation between the amount of time sharks (as a whole and by individual) spent within a geographic zone and the abundance of prey species within that area. These results suggest that prey abundance is not the main factor directing the movement patterns and habitat choice of juvenile Carcharhinus limbatus within Terra Ceia Bay. Predator avoidance may be more important {{in the use of the}} nursery grounds by these young animals than prey abundance...|$|E
40|$|Red drum is one ofthe {{most popular}} species sought by anglers in Florida Bay, yet juveniles are rarely encountered. We {{evaluated}} Florida Bay as a nursery area for red drum by sampling for recently-settled late larvae in basin areas within the bay with an epi-benthic sled at six stations in November 2000, and at seven stations during December 2000 through February 2001. In November 2000 we surveyed potential sampling sites in quiet backwaters adjacent to mangroves for juvenile red drum. A total of 202 sites were sampled mainly in northern Florida Bay and adjacent waters with a cast net. We collected only one recently-settled red drum larvae and no juveniles. Obviously the sites that we sampled in Florida Bay and adjacent waters are not nursery habitat for this valuable species. Sled collections {{were dominated by}} bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli, but densities were biased by one collection. Five small resident species were among the dominant species: rainwater killifish, Lucania parva; dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae; dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae; and clown goby, Microgobius gulosus. Three species that spawn outside Florida Bay in the GulfofMexico were common: pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides; <b>pigfish,</b> Orthopristis chrysoptera; and silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura. Twenty-seven species were collected with the cast net. Hardhead silversides (Atherinomorus stipes), bay anchovy, tidewater mojarra (Eucinostomus harengulus), silver jenny (Eucinostomus gula), and goldspotted killifish (Floridichthys carpio) were the most common in cast net collections. Although only one red drum was collected, we were able to: (1) identify mesohaline waters from our cast net sites to test our preliminary assessment that mesohaline habitat might be limited in Florida Bay, (2) document the distribution and abundance of fishes collected by cast net that should enhance our understanding of ichthyofauna in the Northern Subdivision ofFlorida Bay and adjacent waters, and (3) from epibenthic sled collections, describe the habitats, abundance and distribution of recently settled larvae/small juveniles/small resident fishes during late fall and winter. This information should be useful to managers and future research. (PDF contains 34 pages...|$|E
