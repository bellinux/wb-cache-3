At California State University, Northridge, I received an opportunity to design and model an image data acquisition for 32 x 32 array <b>photo</b> <b>detectors.</b> The main focus of this project is to reduce the cost of implementation compared to the cost of previous architectures. In this system, the data flow from <b>photo</b> <b>detectors</b> to the computer is explained in four stages. The design has two levels of FPGAs: two in the first level (also called the ???third stage of the design???) and one in the second level (also called the ???fourth stage???).

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, in many {{different}} fields of chemical agents several experimental researches is being done on volatile organic compounds using gas chromatography, which is time consuming and expensive methods. <b>Photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> as an alternative method is used by researchers in this field. This feasibility {{study was conducted to}} replace the <b>photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> with gas chromatography.. Material and Method: In this study, after making pre-determined concentrations of Xylene, the results of measurements using <b>photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> and reference method were compared. This comparison was done in 4 humidity levels and 3 concentration ranges.. Result: The results showed significant differences in <b>photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> readout and the reference method.

Conclusion: Although the results obtained by the <b>photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> are different from those extracted from the reference method in the current study, due to linear response of the method correlation coefficient was at good level. Consequently, in case of studying concentration changes in a research, this alternative method would be applicable, otherwise calibration of the <b>photo</b> ionization <b>detector</b> with the target material is recommended...|$|R

5000|$|Prism {{couplers}} are instruments used {{to measure}} the refractive index/birefringence and thickness of dielectric and polymer films.
