Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally.

5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' <b>purchases</b> <b>and</b> trades {{eventually}} altered the American diet.

Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the <b>purchases</b> <b>and</b> leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
