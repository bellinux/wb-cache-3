25|$|KCC2b, on {{the other}} hand, is {{scarcely}} present during prenatal development and is strongly upregulated during <b>postnatal</b> <b>development.</b> The upregulation of KCC2b expression {{is thought to be}} responsible for the “developmental shift” observed in mammals from depolarizing postsynaptic effects of inhibitory synapses in early neural networks to hyperpolarizing effects in mature neural networks.|$|E
25|$|During <b>postnatal</b> <b>development,</b> KCC2 {{levels are}} {{strongly}} upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} chloride ion concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride ion concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) {{than it would be}} at rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.|$|E

25|$|The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a {{biological}} system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility, pregnancy, during pre- and <b>postnatal</b> <b>development,</b> appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of cannabis. The ECS is also involved in mediating some of the physiological and cognitive effects of voluntary physical exercise in humans and other animals, such as contributing to exercise-induced euphoria as well as modulating locomotor activity and motivational salience for rewards. In humans, the plasma concentration of certain endocannabinoids (i.e., anandamide) {{have been found to}} rise during physical activity; since endocannabinoids can effectively penetrate the blood–brain barrier, {{it has been suggested that}} anandamide, along with other euphoriant neurochemicals, contributes to the development of exercise-induced euphoria in humans, a state colloquially referred to as a runner's high.|$|E
25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of <b>postnatal</b> <b>development,</b> there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E

To gain an integrated view of the dynamic changes in gene expression during <b>postnatal</b> heart <b>development</b> at the organ level, time-series transcriptome analyses of the postnatal hearts of neonatal through adult mice (P 1, P 7, P 14, P 30, and P 60) were performed using a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline. We identified functional gene clusters by principal component analysis with self-organizing map clustering which revealed organized, discrete gene expression patterns corresponding to biological functions associated with the neonatal, juvenile and adult stages of <b>postnatal</b> heart <b>development.</b> Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis with bootstrap inference {{for each of these}} functional gene clusters, highly robust hub genes were identified which likely play key roles in regulating expression of co-expressed, functionally linked genes. Additionally, motivated by the role of the transcription factor Sox 6 in the functional maturation of skeletal muscle, the role of Sox 6 in the postnatal maturation of cardiac muscle was investigated. Differentially expressed transcriptome analyses between Sox 6 knockout (KO) and control hearts uncovered significant upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation at postnatal day 7 (P 7) in the Sox 6 KO heart.

The HO- 1 isoform is both inducible and cyto-protective during oxidative stress, inflammation and lung injury. However, {{little is known}} about its precise role and function in lung development. We hypothesized that HO- 1 is required for mouse <b>postnatal</b> lung alveolar <b>development</b> and that vascular expression of HO- 1 is essential and protective during <b>postnatal</b> alveolar <b>development.</b> Methods Neonatal lung development in wildtype and HO- 1 mutant mice was evaluated by histological and molecular methods. Furthermore, these newborn mice were treated with postnatal dexamethasone (Dex) till postnatal 14 days, and evaluated for lung development. Results Compared to wildtype littermates, HO- 1 mutant mice exhibited disrupted lung alveolar structure including simplification, disorganization and reduced secondary crest formation. These defects in alveolar development were more pronounced when these mice were challenged with Dex treatment. Expression levels of both vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial markers were also further decreased in HO- 1 mutants after Dex treatment. Conclusions These experiments demonstrate that HO- 1 is required in normal lung development and that HO- 1 disruption and dexamethasone exposure are additive in the disruption of postnatal lung growth.

Integrins {{are known to be}} critical to embryonic brain development, and recent studies have indicated their essential role in adult brain function, although their role in <b>postnatal</b> brain <b>development</b> and function has not been examined. Here, we used the organotypic slice culture system to investigate the role of integrins in <b>postnatal</b> hippocampal <b>development</b> by exposing the tissue to either an integrin competitive antagonist, the peptide GRGDSP containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) attachment site, or to function-blocking beta(1) -integrin antibodies to disrupt integrin interactions. These experiments revealed that beta(1) -integrin antibodies interfered with spreading of the culture, resulting in a rapid and marked diminution of slice area. beta(1) -integrin antibodies and RGD peptide disrupted cell adhesion, causing cell detachment and migration of glial cells from the explant. The majority of the detached cells were of macroglial origin and switched to expression of the intermediate filament proteins vimentin and nestin, suggesting a developmental regression.

Here, we evaluated {{the function of the}} atypical repressor genes E 2 f 7 and E 2 f 8 in adult liver physiology. Using several loss-of-function alleles in mice, we determined that combined deletion of E 2 f 7 and E 2 f 8 in hepatocytes leads to HCC. Temporal-specific ablation strategies revealed that E 2 f 8 ’s tumor suppressor role is critical during the first 2 weeks of life, which correspond to a highly proliferative stage of <b>postnatal</b> liver <b>development.</b> Disruption of E 2 F 8 ’s DNA binding activity phenocopied the effects of an E 2 f 8 null allele and led to HCC.
