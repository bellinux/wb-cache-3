5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise is not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E
5|$|Six of the {{reductions}} were listed as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1990. The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón have been reconstructed from scratch {{and are not}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site. In San Juan Bautista only ruins remain. UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local environment and the unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and banisters. Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional architectural ensemble that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At {{the time of the}} nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the Pro Santa Cruz committee, Cordecruz, Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz, and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.|$|E

5|$|As in ski jumping, team {{competitions}} {{are often}} included at ski flying events.

5|$|Drivers from a {{total of}} 40 {{different}} countries have entered a World Championship race. The United Kingdom is the most heavily represented with 161 drivers.

Third is Italy with 99. Nine of these countries were represented {{in the very first}} race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, and the most recent newly represented country is Indonesia, with Rio Haryanto making his debut at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix. Statistics are accurate as of the 2017 Mexican Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years in this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their {{followers}} being an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> They {{do not have a}} passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.|$|E

5|$|Ten more {{missions}} {{were founded}} in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699). San Juan Bautista is not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site, and only {{the ruins of a}} stone tower survive near the present village of (San Juan de) Taperas.|$|E

Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E
5|$|The {{pervasive}} and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response {{the system of}} national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves, four of which are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{that of his}} contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of Hymnus amoris that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of Masquerade.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Football-themed {{stories were}} {{a staple of}} British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either {{competing}} for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed {{the structure of the}} actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} fourth Grand Prix {{weekend of the}} season, Nico Rosberg and his team Mercedes were leading the Drivers' and Constructors' championships respectively. Rosberg was 36 points ahead of his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton, having taken 75 out of 75 available points from the first three races of the season. Daniel Ricciardo followed in third place, three points behind Hamilton. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes headed the field with 114 points, 53 points ahead of Ferrari and 57 points clear of Red Bull. This was the third time since the Russian Grand Prix debuted in Formula One in 2014 that the race was held as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Championship. Two early editions of the race were held in 1913 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the Ski Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in ski flying also count towards the Ski Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the Ski Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely ski flying competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to the Ski Flying World Championships, the Ski Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the Ski Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup standings.|$|E
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the California condor and the other six species of New World vultures remains unclear.

More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.|$|E
