Its value must be interpreted along with the PCV, {{to take into account the}} hydration status. When laboratory tests are not available, hydration can be crudely assessed by tenting the skin of the neck or eyelid, looking for sunken eyes, depression, high heart rate, and feeling for tackiness of the gums.

5000|$|Hematocrit is also {{sometimes}} called <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> (PCV), volume of {{packed red cells}} (VPRC), or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF). The term hematocrit comes from the Ancient Greek words haima (αἷμα, [...] "blood") and kritēs (κριτής, [...] "judge"). Together, hematocrit means [...] "to separate blood". It was coined by Magnus Blix at Uppsala in 1891 as haematokrit, modeled after lactokrit, which was used in dairy farming.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that there is a {{correlation}} between mothers' haemoglobin concentration or <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> and infants' birth weight, and that iron supplementation increases mothers' haemoglobin concentration. The purpose of this study, using the data of a large randomised trial on iron prophylaxis during pregnancy, was to find out whether iron supplementation causes fetal growth to deteriorate. At their first antenatal visit, 2912 pregnant women were randomised into non-routine iron and routine iron supplementation. The mean length of gestation was shorter in the non-routine group. Birth weight did not differ between the groups, but due to longer gestations boys in the group receiving routine iron were taller than in the non-routine group. In both groups, whether studied by various values of <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> or correlation coefficients, the lower the <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> the heavier and taller the infant and heavier the placenta. These negative correlations could be seen even with a <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> measured early in pregnancy. Standardising for blood pressure did not influence the correlation coefficients. The correlation between a high ratio for <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> and poor fetal growth thus may not be caused by iron supplementation, nor mediated by blood pressure, but by some other mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary protein supplementation on the {{pathophysiology}} {{of a single}} Haemonchus contortus infection in 2 -year-old Boer dry does under confined conditions was examined. Twenty-four does were randomly confined in individual pens and allocated into three groups balanced by their liveweight. The goats in the Control group were offered a basal diet whereas goats in Treatments 1 and 2 were fed the basal diet plus 25 % and 50 % dietary protein increments, respectively. Each animal was orally administrated 100 H. contortus L 3 larvae/kg liveweight on Day 0 of the experiment. The goat liveweights and FAMACHA scores were recorded at weekly intervals. <b>Packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volumes,</b> eosinophil percentage, haemoglobin concentration, total serum protein, globulin, and albumin concentrations were recorded on Days 0 and 14, and then at weekly intervals during the experiments. Faecal egg counts were measured on Days 0, 21, and then at weekly intervals thereafter. Antigen-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM titres were determined from Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays tests on Days 0, 28, and at the termination of the experiment. The {{results of this study}} showed that a single H. contortus L 3 infection did not cause pathogenic effects in 2 -year-old Boer dry does. Dietary protein supplementation significantly lowered faecal egg count and significantly enhanced IgG titres (P < 0. 05). However, the higher protein diets did not have any significant effects on liveweight, <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volumes,</b> haemoglobin concentration, biological parameters (total serum protein, albumin, and globulin concentrations), and peripheral antibodies (IgA and IgM titres) between the treatments.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that CD 4 + T lymphocytes are important in acquired immunity to gastrointestinal nematode infection. Whether these lymphocytes are also involved in the immune response of naturally resistant Gulf Coast Native (GCN) sheep to Haemonchus contortus infection remains to be defined. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the role of CD 4 + T lymphocytes in this resistance. Ten GCN lambs were randomly assigned to a control (n = 5) or a treatment (n = 5) group. The treatment consisted of a series of IV injections with mouse anti-ovine CD 4 + T lymphocyte monoclonal antibodies for a period of 3 weeks. After the second treatment, all lambs were experimentally infected with 10, 000 H. contortus infective larvae by oral inoculation. All lambs were monitored for fecal egg counts, blood <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volumes,</b> white blood <b>cell</b> differential counts and serum antibody responses on a weekly basis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was done biweekly to enumerate CD 4 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Necropsies were performed at the end of the study and 10 % of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract were preserved for nematode enumeration and identification. Also at necropsy, mesenteric lymph nodes were extracted and FACS analysis was run on lymphoid cells. Mean fecal egg counts on day 21 and 28 post-infection and nematode counts at necropsy of the treated group were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than that of the control group. Percent CD 4 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was significantly (p < 0. 05) lower in the treatment group than in the control group from day 9 to the end of the study.
