40|$|This study {{comprises}} a {{close reading}} {{and textual analysis}} of The Sentients of Orion, a space opera series by Australian author Marianne de Pierres, {{with a view to}} investigating the representations of gender in modern, popular science fiction by women authors. I hypothesise that de Pierres will pose a fictional enquiry into gender, based on the richness of science fiction by women, but that a closer examination of physical and emotional intimacy (both positive and negative) in these ‘less literary works’ will prove de Pierres’ gender enquiry to be superficial and inconsistent in nature. My main approach is a qualitative exploration of selected incidents through the theoretical lenses of feminist literary criticism, gender theory and, where applicable, queer theory. While I draw eclectically on these interpretive paradigms, my approach is most closely aligned with poststructuralist feminism. Proving the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> my findings show that de Pierres does pose an enquiry into gender through her portrayal of plot and character. The particular focus on the intimacies involving the heroine, women, men, and alien characters, proves the second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis</b> incorrect as it reveals how de Pierres not only deeply and consistently challenges the heteronormative status quo, questioning dynamics in relationships, gender roles, ageism, sexism and societal stereotypes, but also provides possible alternatives.

40|$|My own {{explanation}} {{and the first}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that the Catholic Church, as an institution that is involved in {{so much more than}} merely professing the Christian faith, has a double agenda. That is to say, as the largest single institution propagating the Christian faith, it is a spiritual 'world power', however, as an institution, this is supplemented with worldly, economic and political motivations that are prone to obstruct the execution of its role as moral arbitrator. Besides religion, the Catholic Church as an institution has many other interests. It strives to obtain as many followers as possible, (implicitly) aspiring to expand its authority; and tries to further the interests of the institution in a society. Therefore, the Catholic Church {{is more than just a}} spiritual institution. In a society where it exercises, or has the ability to exercise substantial power, it is nevertheless bound to other interests. Moreover, I would argue that the Catholic Church's moral obligation often succumbs to these institutional interests...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{has found}} great {{traction}} in monitoring {{the effects of}} Caloric Restriction (CR) on the brain, specifically gray matter. However, there are no streamlined, simple pipelines in existence to analyze data generated from these kinds of MRI studies. Therefore, my hypothesis is two-fold: the first part being {{the development of a}} dynamic and straightforward image processing pipeline, which I have tailored to fit the unique needs of the CR data involved in this study. This data brings me to the second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> which is to use that pipeline to highlight the decreased attenuation in grey matter induced by long-term CR. In order to test the second portion of my hypothesis, T 1 /MPRAGE scans were collected from 17 male Rhesus Macaques, half of which were maintained on a 30 % reduced calorie diet for an average of 22 years, starting around age 3. Using this basis, the inherent properties of the MR images were exploited by the novel pipeline, and used to analyze whether or not CR reduces the attenuation of grey matter atrophy, with regards to agin...|$|E

Given that one out of two international migrants live in countries that have been omitted by immigration policy theories so far, I believe it is paramount to analyze and bring to the fore the immigration histories and policy processes in other countries in the world to achieve a more genuine and global understanding of the role of states and their policies in international migration.|$|R
40|$|Foster {{care is a}} form {{of social}} care in the Czech Republic. A fostered {{children}} and foster parents receive from state a foster care benefits. Up until 2012 these benefits were set by Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll., on State Social Support. In 2012, Amendment No. 401 / 2012 Coll., transferred foster care benefits to Act No. 359 / 1999 Coll., for Social-Legal Protection of Children. With this change in law, there was also a change in the conditions of entitlement to claim foster care benefits and the establishment of efforts to professionalize foster care. The aim <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work is to analyse and compare the legislation of changes to foster care benefits {{from the perspective of the}} State Social Support Law and the Law of Social-Legal Protection of Children. I have tried to confirm or invalidate the hypotheses using quantitative research, this forms the empirical <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work. <b>Hypotheses</b> were focusing on comparing the situation before and after the changes of Law for Social-Legal Protection of Children. As a technique I chose to study documents and using these documents I have provided secondary analysis. I have worked with the statistics of the Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic, the Labor Offices and the Regional Offices. The results <b>of</b> <b>my</b> findings have shown that more foster parents should be able to claim foster care benefits. Passing the bill on professional foster care has increased the interest in providing foster care, this must be seen as positive outcome. My research could be used as study material for other students of social science or for people who work in the area of social-legal protection of children. It could also be used as feedback for ministerial officials to sea the real situation since the changes in foster care law...|$|R
40|$|Revenue {{imbalance}} {{has been}} linked to competitive imbalance in athletics by many researchers over the years. However, much of the previous research has centered around professional sports leagues, leaving the financial aspects of college sports somewhat unexplored. I tested my hypothesis, that revenue imbalance leads to competitive imbalance in both college football and basketball and that high revenue teams will be more successful in terms of winning percentage, by conducting a statistical analysis of the financial records and performance of 68 schools. Using Lorenz curves and the gini coefficient to calculate revenue imbalance, I was able to correlate my results with a measure of competitive imbalance: the standard deviation ratio of winning percentage. Results showed a significant positive relationship between the two, supporting the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> However, regressions used to determine the relationship between revenue and winning percentage returned no significant results. Although revenue imbalance is creating competitive imbalance, there are no particular revenue-based groups that are benefiting from this imbalance. There is still a need for future research in this area. While this study was hampered by a small sample size, a broader and more lengthy examination of revenue and competitive imbalance could produce more significant results...|$|E

40|$|SCANDINAVIAN YULE Rulership ideology, {{belief and}} cult {{in light of}} the old Viking Age winter feast I have done {{research}} on how the Scandinavian Yule feast was in the Viking age in my master thesis. In order to approach this problem have I worked out a hypothesis containing two parts. The first part of the hypothesis concerns which divinities that was worshipped or celebrated during the winter feast and which role the feast played for the rulers. I have set up {{the first part of the}} hypothesis like this: (hypothesis 1. a) The Scandinavian Yule feast was connected to both sun worship and Odin worship. The Scandinavians worshipped Odin as the opposite of the forces of chaos who was seen as threatening during the winter, and they celebrated that the sun was returning to give a new year with fertility. The sun worship is based on older traditions while the Odin worship is connected to the development of a new type of rulership ideology where the Yule feast played an important role in the struggle for power. The Vikings used the name Jólnir for Odin. The name is derived from Jól (Yule) and indicates that Odin played an important role in the pre-Christian Yule feast. Odin had probably many functions that were connected to the winter feast. He was seen as a cult leader leading the ritual drinking and eating in the hall. He was probably also seen as the leader of the dead warriors (the oskorei) that fought against the forces of chaos that was imagined to be active on the Eve of Yule. There is also a source that tells of sun worship among the Scandinavians during the midwinter. I have analysed the source and showed that the people of Thule who celebrated the return of the sun probably was Germanic Scandinavians holding a Yule feast. It is likely that the tradition of worshipping the sun on the Yule feast in the sixth century has had continuity into the Viking age. But Odin may have become a more central divinity during the age of the Vikings because of his importance in the rulership ideology and because of how the kings used the winter feast in their struggle for power. The second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis</b> concerns how the Yule feast can be compared to other pre-Christian winter feasts and how they may have influenced each other. The second part I set up like this: (hypothesis 1. b) The Scandinavian Yule has many similarities and analogies in common with other pre-Christian winter feasts regarding functions and beliefs. That is particularly true compared to the Celts celebration of Samhain and the Romans and the Mithras cult’s celebration of natalis invicti the 25 th December. The connection between the winter and the forces of chaos in the pre-Christian beliefs and the agricultural societies need to secure fertility is sentral aspects in each of the three winter feasts in addition to that rulership ideology has played an important role. I have used comparative methods in the research on the last <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> They have shown that the similarities I have mentioned between the winter feasts probably was the case, but it is important to also point out the differences between them and be careful not to generalise to much. The similarities and analogies that I have pointed at between the winter celebrations are likely to be of a phenomenological type, but there may also have been some influences between the different cultures...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) has recently {{been described as a}} novel therapeutic target, given the potent suppression of multiple immune-mediated diseases following activation by the prototypic ligand, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In the parent-into-F 1 graft-versus-host (GVH) model, suppression of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response is associated with the presence of CD 25 ⁺CTLA- 4 ⁺IL- 10 ⁺Foxp 3 [superscript neg] regulatory donor CD 4 ⁺ T-cells (AhR-Tregs). These AhR-Treg have a suppressive capacity greater than thymus-derived natural Treg. Therefore it is hypothesized that suppression of the CTL response is mediated by the AhR-Treg. The purpose of these studies was two-fold: 1) to identify mechanisms by which TCDD-activated AhR induces AhR-Tregs and 2) to determine the mechanism by which AhR-Tregs suppress the CTL response. To address the first aim, we hypothesized that the AhR, a transcription factor, may directly influence gene expression during CD 4 ⁺ T-cell activation and differentiation, thereby driving their differentiation into AhR-Treg. T-cell differentiation is dependent upon expression of certain transcription factors and lineage-specific genes for proteins and cytokines. Therefore, gene expression associated with CD 4 ⁺ T-cell activation and/or differentiation was evaluated in CD 4 ⁺ T-cells cultured under different polarizing conditions. Unexpectedly, treatment with TCDD did not alter lineage-specific genes that drive CD 4 ⁺ T-cell differentiation. Apart from the known AhR-regulated genes Cyp 1 a 1, Cyp 1 b 1 and Ahrr, only expression of Il 22 was inappropriately up- regulated across all conditions tested. The increase in Il 22 expression translated to increased IL- 22 protein n. Of the 49 genes evaluated there were no other changes in gene expression consistent across polarizing conditions. This suggests that the role of AhR is superimposed upon the cytokine milieu, and therefore may have been obscured by the use of strongly polarizing cytokines. Ultimately, the results cast doubt on the use of in vitro conditions to recapitulate in vivo events, although the role of IL- 22 in AhR biology remains of interest. To address the second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hypotheses,</b> the suppressive mechanism(s) of the AhR-Treg were examined, focusing primarily on the increased expression of CTLA- 4, CD 25 and IL- 10 seen on day 2 of the GVH response in previous studies. Expression of CTLA- 4 induces the IFNγ - IDO tolerogenic pathway. Expression of CD 25, the high-affinity subunit for the IL- 2 R is associated with regulatory function, through induction of tolerogenic cytokines and sequestration of IL- 2. The immunosuppressive cytokine IL- 10 is known to inhibit T-cell activation and expansion. Independent blockade of CTLA- 4 and IDO function revealed that the AhR-Treg do not appear to use the IDO tolerogenic pathway to mediate suppression. Furthermore, antibody-mediated blockade of neither CD 25 nor IL- 10 were able to alleviate TCDD-mediated immunosuppression. During these studies we discovered that treatment with TCDD induced Foxp 3, the transcription factor for Treg, in donor CD 4 ⁺ and CD 8 ⁺ T-cells 15 days after adoptive transfer. Interestingly, the up-regulation of Foxp 3 was also seen in un-activated host cells, indicating non-specific regulation of Foxp 3 by TCDD-activated AhR. Furthermore, concurrent blockade of CD 25 and Foxp 3 had no effect on TCDD's ability to suppress the GVH response. In sum, these studies suggest that the AhR-Treg is a novel regulatory cell, with characteristics of a Treg and increased IL- 22 production. Regulatory T-cells have a wide repertoire of suppressive mechanisms, including production of TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 3, sequestration of IL- 2 and granzyme B. Understanding the mechanism of suppression utilized by the AhR-Treg is crucial to develop the AhR as a novel therapeutic target. Future studies will continue to evaluate the potential for the AhR-Treg to use alternative mechanisms to suppress T-dependent immune diseases...|$|R

This thesis investigates the {{relationship between}} mbira dzavadzimu modes and different levels of Zezuru spirit possession. The research adopted an ethnographic paradigm. Fieldwork, participant observation, face-to-face interviews and video recordings were employed during data collection. The theoretical underpinnings of the research were grounded in Neher’s 1960 theory of auditory driving 1, Seeger’s 1987 theory of metamorphosis, Wiredu’s 2007 theory of interpretation and Tempels’ 1959 theory of cosmology.

40|$|What {{explains}} {{the timing of}} when states abandon a delaying strategy to change the status quo of one territorial dispute? And when this does happen, why do states ultimately use military force rather than concessions, or vice versa? This dissertation answers these questions by examining four major Chinese territorial disputes – Chinese-Russian and Chinese-Indian frontier disputes and Chinese-Vietnamese and Chinese-Japanese offshore island disputes. I propose a new theory which focuses on the changeability of territorial values {{and its effects on}} territorial policies. I argue that territories have particular meaning and value for particular state in particular historical and international settings. The value of a territory may look very different to different state actors at one point in time, or to the same state actor at different points in time. This difference in perspectives may largely help explain not only why, but when state actors choose to suddenly abandon the status quo. Particularly, I hypothesize that a cooperative territorial policy is more likely when the economic value of the territory increases (contingent on low symbolic and military value), while an escalation policy is more likely when the symbolic or military value increases, independent of economic factors. As a result, disputes over territories with high economic salience are, all else equal, more likely to be resolved peacefully, while disputes over territories with high symbolic or military salience are more likely to either fester {{for long periods of time}} or escalate into armed conflict. ^ Through historical process tracing and across-case comparison, this study found that (a) Chinese policies toward the frontier disputes conform well to large <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> original <b>hypothesis,</b> which explains territorial policies in terms of changing territorial values; but that (b) Chinese policies towards offshore island disputes conform more clearly to state-centered theories based on opportunism, realpolitik, and changes in relative power. I suggest that as China 2 ̆ 7 s naval power becomes stronger, and it feels less vulnerable in the region, China will be less likely to escalate and more likely to cooperate over the disputed islands, particularly if such cooperation can draw allies closer to China rather than the United States. ...|$|R

It will review the theory as put forward by the acknowledged experts in the field and will review how the theory has been implemented over time and compare it with the organisation I am studying with particular emphasis on resolving the objectives I have set out in this chapter. It will look at the development of HRM within a large manufacturing organisation, the role devolution has played in that development and what benefits it can bring to the organisation. 1. 1 My objectives 1. To determine what has been the driving force behind HRM change. 2. To investigate the effect HRM change has had on the organisation [HR department, management of employees and on the employees]. Chapter 2 will explore the theories put forward by the acknowledged experts in the field. There is an abundance of theory on this subject and I propose to show how this theory has developed over time. I will talk about the strength of competition in the organisation’s industry. This will allow a sense of the unique competitive pressures that are present in the environment it operates in. Chapter 3 will outline the methodology I followed in completing my research. I will give an outline and explanation of the research methods I used including Qualitive and Quantitive sampling and explain why I chose them. I will provide a profile of the respondents to my surveys and the reasons why I chose them. Chapter 4 analyses the results <b>of</b> <b>my</b> research.

40|$|In this essay, I {{research}} and discuss new spirituality (or what is {{commonly known as}} New Age) within some congregations in the Church of Sweden, Gothenburg. I question how and why this new spirituality has come to be accepted in <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the Church. <b>My</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that the church is a part, and a reflection, of a larger change throughout society, and I claim that this change depends much on the individualization and globalization during the last decades. The research is conducted through interviews with representatives from the Church of Sweden who are in charge of new religious activities. During these interviews we discuss their views on the change that has already taken place and is going on today. The interviews are then analyzed by applying rational choice theory on them. I discuss whether the Church {{can be seen as a}} producer of goods and services and if the churchgoers can be seen as consumers of these goods and services. I also investigate however these new religious movements within the church can be seen as a tactical move to lure in new customers. During my research I have found that the Church indeed seems to want new products in its’ lineup, however, it is not as predictable as I first thought. A lot <b>of</b> the time <b>my</b> informants express themselves in ways that can only be described as vague, and the impression is that they perhaps do not have a clear plan.

40|$|Among {{with many}} changes brought {{to us by}} the modern times, we may also find changes in current {{understanding}} of religions. In spite of the strong deconsecration trend the experts agreed on growing popularity of new forms of religions and divergence from the traditional religions on the other side. Many alternative religions occur. Groups are diversified by their confession, establishment, methods of finding new members, behaviour models and relationship to the traditional religions. The phenomenon of new religions establishment itself can not be overlooked anymore and to me it seems interesting to learn more about possible reasons, why individuals choose this way. The objective <b>of</b> <b>my</b> research was to identify what motivates people to join alternative religious groups. The research includes a quantitative and a qualitative section. In order to collect adequate data for the quantitative research method of e-mail inquiries was applied as well as questionnaires. The questionnaire was designed for the determined objective of the research and was intended for experts in organisations involved in religious issues both in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. Specifically responses were received from employee of the Association for Study of Sects and New Religions in Prague, the Centre for Prevention in the Area of Religious Sects (CPoNS) in Olomouc and from o. z. INTEGRA - Centre for Prevention in the Area of Religious Sects, based in Banská Bystrica. I had three hypothesis determined for this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work: the <b>Hypothesis</b> I (Phenomenon of new religions popularity is related mainly to younger population, which is more sensitive to era changes), the Hypothesis II (Decision of an individual to join a new religious group is subject to expected satisfaction of currently unsatisfied needs) and the Hypothesis III (Psychological methods misused by the alternative religious groups {{play a significant role in}} individual´s decision to joint a sect). The above hypothesis has been confirmed upon analysis of collected data. In addition I used a quantitative method as well, consisting of semi-standardized interviews with former members of some of the alternative religious groups. The research group included three individuals, who shared their experience with a specific religious group. Considering the small number of respondents it was more a complementary type of method in addition to the quantitative research. The subject bachelor work may be used for more detail research of the given subject and extension of knowledge related to the phenomenon of the alternative religions. The work may be also used for description of processes taking place in the current society and affecting distrust to the traditional religions.
