40|$|A {{total of}} 598 F 2 does from {{a cross between}} {{the high and low}} lines {{selected}} divergently for uterine capacity during 10 generations were used in a candidate gene analysis. The presence of major genes affecting the number of implanted embryos and uterine capacity has been suggested in lines divergently selected for uterine capacity. Uterine capacity is a main component of litter size. The progesterone receptor gene was tested as a candidate gene to determine whether polymorphisms explain differences in litter size and its components. Fragments of the promoter region and exons 1 – 8 were amplified and sequenced. One SNP was found in the promoter region, 2464 G>A, three SNPs in the 5 ′-UTR exon 1, and a silence SNP in exon 7. The first four SNPs were segregated in two haplotypes. The allele G found in the promoter region was found in 75 % of the high-line <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> and in 29 % of the low-line <b>parental</b> <b>animals.</b> The GG genotype had 0. 5 kits and 0. 5 implanted embryos more than the AA genotype. At 48 hr of gestation, the difference in early embryo survival and embryonic stage of development was small. However, at 72 hr of gestation, the GG genotype had 0. 36 embryos more than the AA genotype and also had a more advanced embryonic stage of development, showing a lower percentage of compacted morulae and a higher percentage of blastocysts. The difference in litter size between the GG and GA genotypes was similar to the difference found between homozygote genotypes; however, differences in implanted embryos, early embryo survival, and embryo development were not detected between the GG and GA genotypes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenotype {{imputation}} {{is commonly}} used as an initial step in genomic selection since the accuracy of genomic selection does not decline if accurately imputed genotypes are used instead of actual genotypes but for a lower cost. Performance of imputation has rarely been investigated in crossbred animals and, in particular, in pigs. The extent and pattern of linkage disequilibrium differ in crossbred versus purebred animals, which may impact the performance of imputation. In this study, first we compared different scenarios of imputation from 5  K to 8  K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genotyped Danish Landrace and Yorkshire and crossbred Landrace-Yorkshire datasets and, second, we compared imputation from 8  K to 60  K SNPs in genotyped purebred and simulated crossbred datasets. All imputations were done using software Beagle version 3. 3. 2. Then, we investigated the reasons that could explain the differences observed. ResultsGenotype imputation performs as well in crossbred animals as in purebred <b>animals</b> when both <b>parental</b> breeds {{are included in the}} reference population. When the size of the reference population is very large, {{it is not necessary to}} use a reference population that combines the two breeds to impute the genotypes of purebred animals because a within-breed reference population can provide a very high level of imputation accuracy (correct rate[*]≥[*] 0. 99, correlation[*]≥[*] 0. 95). However, to ensure that similar imputation accuracies are obtained for crossbred animals, a reference population that combines both <b>parental</b> purebred <b>animals</b> is required. Imputation accuracies are higher when a larger proportion of haplotypes are shared between the reference population and the validation (imputed) populations. ConclusionsThe results from both real data and pedigree-based simulated data demonstrate that genotype imputation from low-density panels to medium-density panels is highly accurate in both purebred and crossbred pigs. In crossbred pigs, combining the <b>parental</b> purebred <b>animals</b> in the reference population is necessary to obtain high imputation accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Tetraparental (allophenic) mice, made {{chimeric}} at the eight-cell stage {{by joining}} two embryos from histoincompatible parental strains, were examined by a microcytotoxicity test.

The destruction by tetraparental lymph node cells is indistinguishable from that mediated by lymph node cells from previously immunized allogeneic animals. It can be prevented by serum from the tetraparental mice, but not by sera from the F 1 hybrid or the <b>parental</b> strain <b>animals.</b> The results suggest that a concomitant immunity and serum blocking effect, rather than a central failure of the immune response, may mediate some aspects of normal tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Domestication {{of animals}} {{has given rise}} to a great {{phenotypic}} divergence in selected animals and rapidly generated species of animals more accustomed to human contact and social interactions within the species. Previous studies in chickens (Gallus gallus) have managed to find behavioral and adaptive differences between Red Junglefowl (RJF) and White Leghorn (WL), differences inherent to the domestication process. These phenotypic changes could spawn from a variety of different genomic factors, including an epigenetic gene expression regulatory mechanism known as CpG methylation, a DNA modification of CpG dinucleotides that in turn affect nucleosome formation. In this study we investigated the methylation differences between RJF and WL. This by selecting genes that has previously been shown to be both differentially expressed (DE) and differentially methylated (DM) between RJF and WL, and had shown the same kind of differences in both <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> and their offspring.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that corticosteroid-binding globulin gene (Cbg) {{may be the}} causal gene of a quantitative trait locus associated with cortisol levels, fat deposition, and muscle content in a pig intercross. Sequence analysis of <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> allowed us to identify four amino-acid substitutions. Here we have examined {{if any of these}} single amino acid substitutions could be responsible for the difference in CBG binding and affinity for cortisol between the parental breeds, using in vitro assays of Cbg variants after transfection of mammalian cells. Additionally, the Cbg coding region was analyzed in samples from a synthetic pig line to study association between polymorphism and CBG biochemical properties, carcass composition, and meat quality. Both in vitro transfection assays and the association studies suggest a role of the Arg 307 Gly mutation in increasing CBG capacity (by > 70 %) and decreasing CBG affinity for cortisol (by 30 %). The Ile 265 Val substitution may also have an effect on decreasing CBG affinity for cortisol by 25 %. The mutations Ser 15 Ile and Thr 257 Met do not seem to have an effect on CBG parameters. The Arg 307 Gly substitution was the only mutation associated with a parameter of meat quality and no mutation was linked to carcass composition...|$|E

DHA-algal oil is produced {{through the use of}} the marine protist, Ulkenia sp. The reproductive toxicity of DHA-algal oil was assessed in a one-generation study. Rats were provided diets containing DHA-algal oil at concentrations of 1. 5, 3. 0, or 7. 5 %, and the control group received a diet containing 7. 5 % corn oil. Males and females were treated for 10 weeks prior to mating and during mating. Females continued to receive test diets during gestation and lactation. In <b>parental</b> <b>animals,</b> clinical observations, mortality, fertility, and reproductive performance were unaffected by treatment. Differences in food consumption, body weight, and liver weight in the treated groups were not considered to be due to an adverse effect of DHA-algal oil. Spleen weight increases in treated animals were associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis. Yellow discoloration of abdominal adipose tissue was observed in rats from the high-dose group, and histological examination revealed steatitis in all treated parental groups. Exposure to DHA-algal oil did not influence the physical development of F 1 animals. These results demonstrate that DHA-algal oil at dietary concentrations of up to 7. 5 % in rats does not affect reproductive capacity or pup development. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The copepod Calanus finmarchicus {{is a key}} {{component}} of northern Atlantic food webs, linking energy-transfer from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels. We examined the effect of different ocean acidification (OA) scenarios (i. e., ambient, 1080, 2080, and 3080 μatm CO 2) over two subsequent generations under limited food availability. Determination of metabolic and feeding rates, and estimations of the scope for growth, suggests that negative effects observed on vital rates (ontogenetic development, somatic growth, fecundity) may be a consequence of energy budget constraints due to higher maintenance costs under high pCO 2 -environments. A significant delay in development rate among the <b>parental</b> generation <b>animals</b> exposed to 2080 μatm CO 2, but not in the following F 1 generation under the same conditions, suggests that C. finmarchicus may have adaptive potential to withstand the direct long-term effects of even the more pessimistic future OA scenarios but underlines the importance of transgenerational experiments. The results also indicate that in a more acidic ocean, increased energy expenditure through rising respiration could lower the energy transfer to higher trophic levels and thus hamper the productivity of the northern Atlantic ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{antibody}} produced {{in response to}} calf skin collagen in mice is influenced by genes which are {{closely linked to the}} I region of the H- 2 major histocompatibility complex. This influence is shown to be expressed during lymphoid maturation by testing the antibody responsiveness to collagen in two types of chimeric mice. First, high responder and low responder parental strain mice were lethally irradiated and restored with fetal liver cells from (high X low responder) F 1 mice. These F 1 leads to parent chimeras exhibited an immune response phenotype characteristic of the irradiated <b>parental</b> strain <b>animals,</b> establishing that H- 2 determinants of the host affect antigen responsiveness. Second, (high X low responder) F 1 congenitally athymic (nude) mice were restored with fetal thymus transplants from either high or low responder parental strain mice. After a period of maturation these mice were shown to be competent for a T-dependent IgG response to SRBC. The responsiveness to collagen in these mice was characteristic of the parental strain thymus donors, indicating that the expression of H- 2 determinants in thymic tissue during lymphoid maturation influences the antibody response phenotype expressed by mice...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{case reports}} {{published}} in the 20 th century {{over the course of}} several decades show that resorcinol caused reversible adverse effects on the human thyroid gland (TG) manifested as hy-pothyroidism. Affected patients had ulcerating leg varicosities and underwent prolonged treatment with ointments containing high concentrations of resorcinol. In animal studies resorcinol failed to induce TG toxicity, unless pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PK/TK) conditions were manipulated (e. g., injection of resorcinol in oil or application in a slow release formulation). A recently com-pleted two-generation reproductive toxicity study in rats did not detect any adverse effects on either reproductive or TG end points (Welsch, Nemec, and Lawrence, 2008, Int. J. Toxicol. 37, this issue). Resorcinol intake via drinking water up to the palatability limit had resulted in average daily intakes (mg/kg) of 233 in F 0 and F 1 males and 304 (premating/gestation) or 660 (lactation) in females. Free resorcinol in blood plasma was barely detectable in a few <b>parental</b> <b>animals,</b> indicating rapid metabolism. This short review commu-nication offers a perspective on compromised human skin barrier function as a likely cause of drastic increases in resorcinol absorp-tion.

DS is classified as a neural tube defect in humans. Thus, the dog is proven to be an excellent comparative model regarding neural tube defects. It was shown that the hair ridge is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation that predisposes for DS. Collection of material from DS-affected Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies, their <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> and littermates was performed.

Given concentrations of dioxin-like contaminants, and assuming a relatively high sensitivity it can be expected that larvae from eggs produced by eel from highly contaminated locations in Europe will experience increased mortality due to maternally transferred dioxin-like contaminants. As historical POP concentrations in eel tissue were higher this impact must have been stronger in the past.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature survey}} revealed that rafting on objects floating {{at the sea}} surface is a common dispersal mechanism in marine crustaceans. A great variety of objects including detached macroalgae, plastic items and wood {{have been found to}} serve as substrata for rafting organisms. A total of 365 crustacean species from all major taxonomic groups have been reported from floating objects. Amphipods (104 species) represent the most diverse group followed by brachyuran decapods (60 species). 296 species are facultative rafters. These animals usually have a benthic or pelagic life-style and inhabit floating items as a secondary habitat. However, 23 species, mainly represented by barnacles, have been identified as obligate rafters living exclusively on floating substrata. Most rafting crustaceans reproduce sexually, primarily featuring a gonochoric sexual system with few hermaphroditic species. Fertilization mode is internal in all species. Direct development of juveniles without pelagic larvae is the major developmental mode, facilitating the retention of juveniles close to the <b>parental</b> <b>animals.</b> Mobile species able to walk or crawl dominate on natural substrata that are exposed to biological degradation. Persistent substrata, however, are often colonized by sessile animals. Feeding mode of the animals also appears to depend on substratum characteristics. Many grazing species are found on floating macroalgae while suspension feeders and predators dominate on abiotic objects and wood. The high degree of functional and morphological diversity within the Crustacea allows these animals to colonize a great variety of floating substrata making rafting an efficient dispersal mechanism for this group...|$|E
40|$|Boid {{inclusion}} body disease (BIBD) is an often fatal disease affecting mainly constrictor snakes. BIBD {{has been associated}} with infection, and more recently with coinfection, by various reptarenavirus species (family Arenaviridae). Thus far BIBD has only been reported in captive snakes, and neither the incubation period nor the route of transmission are known. Herein we provide strong evidence that co-infecting reptarenavirus species can be vertically transmitted in Boa constrictor. In total we examined five B. constrictor clutches with offspring ranging in age from embryos over perinatal abortions to juveniles. The mother and/or father of each clutch were initially diagnosed with BIBD and/or reptarenavirus infection by detection of the pathognomonic inclusion bodies (IB) and/or reptarenaviral RNA. By applying next-generation sequencing and de novo sequence assembly we determined the "reptarenavirome" of each clutch, yielding several nearly complete L and S segments of multiple reptarenaviruses. We further confirmed vertical transmission of the co-infecting reptarenaviruses by species-specific RT-PCR from samples of <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> and offspring. Curiously, not all offspring obtained the full parental "reptarenavirome". We extended our findings by an in vitro approach; cell cultures derived from embryonal samples rapidly developed IB and promoted replication of some or all parental viruses. In the tissues of embryos and perinatal abortions, viral antigen was sometimes detected, but IB were consistently seen only in the juvenile snakes from the age of 2 mo onwards. In addition to demonstrating vertical transmission of multiple species, our results also indicate that reptarenavirus infection induces BIBD over time in the offspring...|$|E

The Extension locus encodes the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) whose permanent activation, caused by functional mutations, results in black coat colour, whereas other inactivating mutations cause red coat colour in different mammals. Results The whole coding region of the MC 1 R gene was sequenced in goats of six different breeds showing different coat colours (Girgentana, white cream with usually small red spots in the face; Maltese, white with black cheeks and ears; Derivata di Siria, solid red; Murciano-Granadina, solid black or solid brown; Camosciata delle Alpi, brown with black stripes; Saanen, white; F 1 goats and the <b>parental</b> <b>animals).</b> Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified: one nonsense mutation (p.

The stop codon at position 225 should cause {{the production of a}} shorter MC 1 R protein whose functionality may be altered. These SNPs were investigated in a larger sample of animals belonging to the six breeds. The Girgentana breed was almost fixed for the p. 225 X allele.

An ORF 29 -repaired virus, in which ORF 29 was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, grew to peak titers similar to those seen with the parental virus. The level of ORF 29 protein in cells infected with the repaired virus was greater than that seen with parental virus. Infection of cells with either the ORF 29 deletion or repaired virus resulted in similar levels of VZV immediate-early proteins but reduced levels of glycoprotein E compared to those observed with parental virus. Cotton rats infected with the ORF 29 deletion mutant had a markedly reduced frequency of latent infection in dorsal root ganglia compared with those infected with parental virus (P < 0. 00001). In contrast, infection of animals with the ORF 29 deletion mutant resulted in a frequency of ganglionic infection at 3 days similar to that seen with the <b>parental</b> virus. <b>Animals</b> infected with the ORF 29 -repaired virus, which overexpresses ORF 29, also had a reduced frequency of latent infection compared with those infected with parental virus (P = 0. 0044).

A series of animal challenge studies was conducted to ensure that these strains were fully attenuated. Whereas the parental strains 1026 b and K 96243 and the complemented mutants Bp 410 and Bp 454 were virulent in BALB/c mice following intranasal inoculation, the ΔpurM mutants Bp 82 and Bp 190 were avirulent {{even when they were}} administered at doses 4 logs higher than the doses used for the <b>parental</b> strains. <b>Animals</b> challenged with high doses of the ΔpurM mutants rapidly cleared the bacterium from tissues (lung, liver, and spleen) and remained free of culturable bacteria {{for the duration of the}} experiments (up to 60 days postinfection).

40|$|The {{number of}} {{vertebrae}} is an economically important trait that affects carcass length and meat production in pigs. A major {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) for thoracic vertebral number has been repeatedly identified on pig chromosome (SSC) 7. To dissect the genetic basis of the major locus, we herein genotyped a large sample of animals from 3 experimental populations of Chinese and Western origins using 60 K DNA chips. Genome-wide association studies consistently identified the locus across the 3 populations and mapped the locus to a 947 -Kb region on SSC 7. An identical-by-descent sharing assay refined the locus to a 100 -Kb segment that harbors only two genes including VRTN and SYNDIG 1 L. Of them, VRNT has been proposed as a strong candidate of the major locus in Western modern breeds. Further, we resequenced the VRTN gene using DNA samples of 35 <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> with known QTL genotypes by progeny testing. Concordance tests revealed 4 candidate causal variants as their genotypes showed the perfect segregation with QTL genotypes of the tested animals. An integrative analysis of evolutional constraints and functional elements supported two VRTN variants in a complete linkage disequilibrium phase as the most likely causal mutations. The promising variants significantly affect the number of thoracic vertebrae (one vertebra) in large scale outbred animals, and are segregating at rather high frequencies in Western pigs and at relatively low frequencies {{in a number of}} Chinese breeds.

Quantitative trait analyses were performed using the R/qtl software. ResultsElevated weight, serum COMP levels and osteoarthritic changes of the knee joints in the F 2 generation compared to C 57 BL/ 6 <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> confirm Mendelian inheritance. Quantitative trait analyses revealed three weight-, one serum COMP- and one OA-locus. ConclusionsThe weight-QTL coincide with previously described genes and QTL involved in fatty acid metabolism and offer a plausible explanation for the observed phenotype in STR/ort mice. The exact match of the COMP-QTL and the COMP gene itself suggests a regulatory polymorphism to account for elevated serum levels in STR/ort mice and questions the robustness of serum COMP as a prognostic marker in human knee OA. The newly identified QTL associated with degenerative changes of the knee joints support the concept of OA resulting from a defective chondrocyte metabolism and/or altered apoptosis rate. However, we also discuss the unlikelihood of one QTL being responsible for OA in STR/ort mice and the inherent limitations of microsatellite analyses for complex genetic diseases...|$|E
40|$|In {{most parts}} of central Europe the hybridogenetic water frog Rana esculenta lives (and mates) in mixed populations with its parental species Rana lessonae. Ratios of <b>parental</b> and hybrid <b>animals</b> vary from 1 : 9 to 9 : 1 among ponds, {{depending}} on various biotic and abiotic factors. These factors may directly cause the ratio differences through species-specific effects on larval performance, but previous experimental studies under laboratory and seminatural conditions produced conflicting results as to how parental and hybrid tadpoles respond to these factors. We investigated larval development and relative recruitment of juveniles in a natural population at three sites that differed ecologically. Species ratios at the different stages (eggs, tadpoles, metamorphs) and body size of tadpoles and metamorphs were compared. Differences in timing of reproduction and larval development were more pronounced within species between ponds than between species within ponds. During the egg and tadpole stages, hybrids outnumbered parental larvae by 60 : 40, but this ratio reversed during metamorphosis. Higher mortality rates of hybrid froglets during metamorphosis as well as lower dispersal rates after metamorphosis may explain our findings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile it {{is clearly}} {{admitted}} that normal behavioural development {{is determined by the}} interplay of genetic and environmental influences, this is much less the case for psychiatric disorders for which more emphasis has been given in the past decades on biological determinism. Thus, previous studies have shown that Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) were not affected by <b>parental</b> style. However, <b>animal</b> research suggests that different behavioural traits can be differentially affected by genetic/environmental factors. In the present study we hypothesized that amongst the ASD, language disorders may be more sensitive to social factors as language is a social act that develops under social influences. Using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, we compared the early characteristics of sensori-motor and language development in a large sample of children with ASD (n = 162) with parents belonging to different levels of education. The results showed that children raised by parents {{with a high level of}} education displayed earlier language development. Moreover, they showed earlier first words and phrases if their mother was at a high level of education, which reveals an additional gender effect. To our knowledge this study may trigger important new lines of thought and research, help equilibrate social and purely biological perspectives regarding ASD and bring new hopes for environmentally based therapies...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase (HP) is {{the target}} for a novel class of {{antiviral}} compounds, the helicase-primase inhibitors (HPIs), e. g. BAY 57 - 1293. Although mutations in herpesviruses conferring resistance to nucleoside analogues are commonly associated with attenuation in vivo, to date, {{this is not necessarily}} true for HPIs. HPI-resistant HSV mutants selected in tissue culture are reported to be equally pathogenic compared to <b>parental</b> virus in <b>animal</b> models. Here we demonstrate that a slow-growing HSV- 1 mutant, with the BAY 57 - 1293 -resistance mutation Gly 352 Arg in UL 5 helicase, is clearly less virulent than its wild-type parent in a murine zosteriform infection model. This contrasts with published results obtained for a mutant containing a different HPI-resistance substitution (Gly 352 Val) at the same location, since this mutant was reported to be fully pathogenic. We believe our report {{to be the first to}} describe an HPI-resistant HSV- 1 mutant, that is markedly less virulent in vivo and slowly growing in tissue culture compared to the parental strain. Another BAY 57 - 1293 -resistant UL 5 mutant (Lys 356 Gln), which showed faster growth characteristics in cell culture, however, was at least equally virulent compared to the parent strain...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Nine microsatellite markers were isolated from a horse genomic library in lambda bacteriophage. The markers were typed by PCR in 72 horses representing 14 breeds and in 36 <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> of two Arabian half-sib families. Number of alleles, observed heterozygosity and PIC value were used to determine the informativeness of each marker. Informative markers were subsequently typed in the offspring of the Arabian families to confirm inheritance. The markers, along with 14 previously published microsatellites, were also typed in DNAs from a panel of zebra somatic cell hybrid lines. All of the markers were analyzed for synteny in the zebra somatic cell hybrids. Additionally, each marker was tested for amplification of DNA from other species. Six of the markers were informative both in the Arabian families and in the breed survey. Two markers demonstrated one or more null alleles each. There was evidence of a possible de novo mutation in one marker among the Arabian offspring. Two syntenic groups and three associated pairs of markers were identified in the zebra somatic cell hybrids. Of three previously reported synteny groups in the horse, only one was conserved in the zebra. Five of the markers amplified DNA in at least one other species. However, no attempt was made to verify whether the amplified products truly represented homologous loci...|$|E
40|$|This study {{indicates}} that eggs containing calcium carbonate crystals occur in at least 36 of the 65 known families of the land snails (class Gastropoda: order Stylommatophora). Eggs from 22 of these families were available for examination. The x-ray diffraction data, available {{for the first time}} for 21 of these families, shows that these egg shells are all made of calcite only, or of a combination of calcite with smaller amounts of aragonite. All of the snail (body) shells examined were made of aragonite only. This is the first ultrastructural investigation of these egg shells, and it indicates that the eggs exhibit enough structural diversity to allow identification of <b>parental</b> <b>animals</b> to genus, and often to species level {{solely on the basis of}} egg shell ultrastructure. All of the calcified eggs may be divided into two groups: (1) partly calcified, with discrete crystals of CaCo 3 dispersed in the jelly layer, and (2) heavily calcified, with a hard, brittle egg shell made of fused crystals of CaCO 3 much like an avian egg. Both types of calcified eggs occur in oviparous as well as in ovoviviparous snails. Because of the wide distribution of calcified eggs in the Stylommatophora, and because of the occurrence of heavily calcified eggs in ancient families such as Partulidae, Endodontidae, and Zonitidae, the calcified egg is viewed as a primitive land snail trait associated with terrestrial adaptation. The function of the calcified egg shell, in addition to mechanical support of egg contents, is to supply the developing embryo with enough calcium to form the embryonic shell by the time of hatching...|$|E
40|$|In many species, {{males and}} females mate with {{multiple}} partners, which gives rise to sperm competition and multiple paternity. The experiments on water frogs presented here demonstrate that such sperm competition can affect the structure and dynamics of mixed species communities. The hybrid frog Rana esculenta (LR) mates with one of its parental species, usually Rana lessonae (LL) although in some areas R. ridibunda (RR), to regain the premeiotically eliminated parental genome ("hybridogenesis"). Mixed LL/LR-populations are stable although hybrid numbers should continuously increase {{at the expense of}} <b>parental</b> <b>animals,</b> because of differences in female fecundity and other factors. This would finally lead to the extinction of the sexual host, followed by that of the sexual parasite, unless the reproductive superiority of R. esculenta is reduced by other factors, such as lower hybrid male fertility. Eggs from LL- and LR-females were fertilised in vitro by single- and multi-male sperm suspensions of LL-, LR- and RR-males. In all experiments, the proportion of offspring sired by R. esculenta sperm was significantly lower than that sired by R. lessonae or R. ridibunda sperm. Gonad mass, sperm morphology, sperm swimming velocity, and sperm survival did not explain these differences in fertilisation success, nor did gamete recognition and compatibility. Sperm density was the only trait that paralleled fertilisation success; but it offers no explanation either, because densities were equalised for the in vitro fertilisations. In natural LL/LR populations, the significantly smaller amount, poorer competitive ability and lower long-term survival of R. esculenta compared to R. lessonae sperm will reduce the initial reproductive superiority of hybrids and contribute to the stabilisation of mixed water frog populations. Differences in fertilisation ability are also likely to be relevant for the structure and dynamics of several other systems with encounters between eggs and sperm from different genotypes, ecotypes, ploidy levels and/or species...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{dendritic}} or veiled cells (VC) from {{lymph nodes}} or spleens of {{rats and mice}} in initiating immune responses in vivo has been investigated. Host-versus-graft responses were induced by injection of VC from spleens of (C 57 BL/ 10 X CBA) F 1 mice into the footpads of <b>parental</b> strain (CBA) <b>animals</b> and measured by {{the increase in the}} weight of the draining popliteal lymph nodes. The potency of VC to induce the responses was 100 -fold greater than that of unseparated spleen cells. The in vivo effect of VC was not limited to this direct allogeneic stimulation because autologous VC could also be used in the induction of an experimental autoimmune disease. In these studies, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was produced in Lewis rats by injection of guinea pig brain and spinal cord material emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Small numbers of VC from spleens or lymph nodes of rats showing clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced a mild form of the disease when injected intravenously into normal Lewis rats. Thus, VC carrying antigen, either {{as an integral part of}} their surface membrane or acquired during exposure to antigenic substances, appeared to be very potent agents for the induction of immune responses...|$|R
40|$|When {{competing}} over <b>parental</b> resources, young <b>animals</b> may be typically selfish to {{the point}} of siblicide. This suggests that limited parental resources promote the evolution of sibling competition rather than altruistic or cooperative behaviours. In striking contrast, we show here that in 71 % of experimental three-chick broods, nestling barn owls, Tyto alba, gave food to their siblings on average twice per night. This behaviour prevailed in the first-born dominant nestlings rather than the last-born subordinate nestlings. It was also more prevalent in individuals displaying a heritable dark phaeomelanin-based coloration, a typical female-specific plumage trait (owls vary from dark reddish to white, females being on average darker reddish than males). Stealing food items from siblings, which occurred in 81 % of the nests, was more frequent in light than dark phaeomelanic dominant nestlings. We suggest that food sharing has evolved in the barn owl because parents store prey items in their nest that can be used by the offspring to feed their nestmates to derive indirect (kin selection) or direct benefits (pseudoreciprocity or by-product mutualism). The cost of feeding siblings may be relatively low for dominant individuals while the indirect genetic benefits could be high given that extrapair paternity is infrequent in this species. Thus, in situations in which young animals have access to more food resources than they currently need, they can altruistically share them with their siblings...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of the three Southern African Territories (SAT) types of foot-and-mouth diseasevirus (FMDV) reflects high antigenic variation, and indications are that vaccines targeting each SAT-specific topotype may be needed. This has serious implications for control of FMD using vaccines as wellas the choice of strains to include in regional antigen banks. Here, we investigated an intra-serotypechimeric virus, vSAT 2 ZIM 14 -SAT 2, which was engineered by replacing the surface-exposed capsid-codingregion (1 B- 1 D/ 2 A) of a SAT 2 genome-length clone, pSAT 2, {{with that of the}} field isolate, SAT 2 /ZIM/ 14 / 90. The chimeric FMDV produced by this technique was viable, grew to high titres and stably maintained the 1 B- 1 D/ 2 A sequence upon passage. Chemically inactivated, oil adjuvanted vaccines of both the chimericand parental immunogens were used to vaccinate cattle. The serological response to vaccination showedthe production of strong neutralizing antibody titres that correlated with protection against homolo-gous FMDV challenge. We also predicted a good likelihood that cattle vaccinated with an intra-serotypechimeric vaccine would be protected against challenge with viruses that caused recent outbreaks insouthern Africa. These results provide support that chimeric vaccines containing the external capsid offield isolates induce protective immune responses in FMD host species similar to the <b>parental</b> vaccine.
