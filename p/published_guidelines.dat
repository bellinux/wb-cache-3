5|$|The US FDA has {{approved}} two Chagas tests, including one approved in April 2010, and has <b>published</b> <b>guidelines</b> that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products. While these tests {{are not required}} in US, an estimated 75–90% of the blood supply is currently tested for Chagas, including all units collected by the American Red Cross, which accounts for 40% of the U.S. blood supply. The Chagas Biovigilance Network reports current incidents of Chagas-positive blood products in the United States, as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the FDA in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has <b>published</b> <b>guidelines</b> for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E

25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{have used}} mobile phone {{evidence in a}} number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area.

25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's <b>published</b> <b>Guidelines.</b> In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E

500|$|Psilocybin {{has been}} a subject of medical {{research}} since the early 1960s, when Leary and Alpert ran the Harvard Psilocybin Project, in which they carried {{out a number of}} experiments to evaluate the therapeutic value of psilocybin in the treatment of personality disorders, or to augment psychological counseling. In the 2000s (decade), there was a renewal of research concerning the use of psychedelic drugs for potential clinical applications, such as to address anxiety disorders, major depression, and various addictions. In 2008, the Johns Hopkins research team <b>published</b> <b>guidelines</b> for responsibly conducting medical research trials with psilocybin and other hallucinogens in humans. These included recommendations on how to screen potential study volunteers to exclude those with personal or family psychiatric histories that suggest a risk of adverse reactions to hallucinogens. A 2010 study on the short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin administration in clinical settings concluded that despite a small risk of acute reactions such as dysphoria, anxiety, or panic, [...] "the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects {{in the context of a}} carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk"; the authors note, however, that the safety of the drug [...] "cannot be generalized to situations in which psilocybin is used recreationally or administered under less controlled conditions." ...|$|E
