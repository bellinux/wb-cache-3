5|$|It was {{reported}} in mid-May that construction work was in <b>progress</b> <b>on</b> the last two piers of the bridge, though low river levels meant that staging could not be installed to allow further work on the bridge framework.

5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, a Congressional {{committee}} recommended {{a different type}} of monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol.

5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} <b>progress</b> <b>on</b> his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to <b>progress.</b> <b>On</b> April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E

5|$|At the Paris Air Show in June 2011, Hong Kong Airlines had {{announced}} a signed contract for 10 Airbus A380's however due to China's anger with the European Union over plans to force all airlines {{to take part}} in its carbon-trading scheme, the Chinese government has blocked <b>progress</b> <b>on</b> Airbus’s sale of 10 A380s to Hong Kong Airlines. Normally, airlines in Hong Kong are not required to seek approval from the Chinese government to proceed with aircraft orders. The A380 cancellation became an issue as Hong Kong Airlines' parent, Hainan Airlines, is registered in mainland China, not Hong Kong SAR. In early January 2012, HKA's corporate governance head Kenneth Thong stated in a TV interview that the order was going ahead.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from Detroit to the defense plants at Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled <b>progress</b> <b>on</b> any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational <b>progress</b> <b>on</b> graph statistics.|$|E
