It is desirable to increase available peak pressure from ∼ 1  MPa to ∼ 5  MPa to simulate closer blast sources and facilitate development and testing of personal and vehicle armors.

The application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect the fault, identify it’s section, and classify the fault on transmission lines with improved zone reach setting is presented in this article. The fundamental voltage and current magnitudes obtained through Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are specified as the inputs to the ANN. The relay is placed at section- 2 which is the <b>prime</b> <b>section</b> to be protected. The ANN was trained and tested using diverse fault datasets; obtained from the simulation of different fault scenarios like different types of fault at varying fault inception angles, fault locations and fault resistances in a 400  kV, 216  km power transmission network of CSEB between Korba-Bhilai of Chhattisgarh state using MATLAB. The simulation outcomes illustrated that the entire shunt faults including forward and reverse fault, it’s section and phase can be accurately identified within a half cycle time. The advantage of this scheme is to provide a major protection up to 99.5 % of total line length using single end data and furthermore backup protection to the forward and reverse line sections. This routine protection system is properly discriminatory, rapid, robust, enormously reliable and incredibly responsive to isolate targeted fault.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sums over inverse s-th {{powers of}} semiprimes and k-almost primes are {{transformed}} into sums over products of powers of ordinary prime zeta functions. Multinomial coefficients {{known from the}} cycle decomposition of permutation groups {{play the role of}} expansion coefficients. Founded on a known convergence acceleration for the ordinary prime zeta functions, the sums and first derivatives are tabulated with high precision for indices k = 2, [...] ., 6 and integer powers s = 2, [...] ., 8. 1. Overview Series over rational polynomials evaluated at integer arguments contain subseries summing over integers classified by the count of their prime factors. The core example is the Riemann zeta function ζ which accumulates the prime zeta function P 1 plus what we shall define the almost-prime zeta functions Pk (Section 2). The central observation of this manuscript is that the almost-prime zeta functions are combinatorial sums over the <b>prime</b> zeta function (<b>Section</b> 3). Since earlier work by Cohen, Sebah and Gourdon has pointed at efficient numerical algorithms to compute P 1, series over reciprocal almost-primes—which may suffer from slow convergence in their defining format—may be computed efficiently by reference to the P 1. In consequence, any converging series over the positive integers which has a Taylor expansion in reciprocal powers of these integers splits into k-almost <b>prime</b> components. <b>Section</b> 4 illustrates this for the most basic formats. Number theory as such will not be advanced. The meromorphic landscape of the prime zeta functions as a function of their main variable appears to be more complicated than what is known for their host, the Riemann zeta function; so only some remarks on the calculation of first derivatives are dropped. 2.

The land, situated on a bluff overlooking the Río de la Plata, was awarded to Rodrigo de Ibarola, a lieutenant of Garay's. A <b>prime</b> <b>section</b> of the property was purchased in 1774 by Manuel de Basavilbaso, the Postmaster General of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. His daughter, Justa Rufina, married Miguel de Azcuénaga, a military officer who would later take part in the May Revolution of 1810 (prologue to the Argentine War of Independence). He also established one of the area's first apiaries on the grounds.Azcuénaga inherited the land on the death of his wife in 1829, and their son, Miguel José, in turn inherited it in 1833. He converted the property into an equestrian estate, though the rise of Buenos Aires Province Governor and strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas led to his exile in Chile for a number of years. Azcuénaga ultimately returned and, in 1851, commissioned a graduate of the École Polytechnique, Prilidiano Pueyrredón, to design a manor house. Pueyrredón created an eclectic design centered on Neogothic and Baroque architecture, and upon its completion in 1854, Azcuénaga came to refer to the mansion as his [...] "birdcage"; Pueyrredón was also a renowned painter, and created a portrait of his friend and client shortly after the mansion's completion. Azcuénaga landscaped the sprawling property with a selection of palm trees, among them Butia, Phoenix canariensis, and Chamaerops humilis. He also had vast extensions planted with Araucaria bidwillii, cedars, cryptomerias, cypresses, tipas and pines planted, as well as a row of plantains (which graced his favorite path). Azcuénaga, who had no legitimate offspring, bequeathed the property to his nephew, Antonio Justo Olaguer Feliú. The blind Olaguer, who had no use for the view of the waterfront, sold the easternmost portion of the land before his death in 1903 and bequeathed it to his nephew, Carlos Villate Olaguer. Villate stipulated on his receiving the property that, upon his death, it should be deeded to the Argentine Government for the purpose of its use as the Official Summer Residence of the President of Argentina.|$|R
