50|$|<b>Proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (also {{known as}} PN or Pro-Nav) is a {{guidance}} law (analogous to proportional control) {{used in some}} form or another by most homing air target missiles. It is {{based on the fact that}} two objects are on a collision course when the direction of their direct Line-of-Sight does not change. PN dictates that the missile velocity vector should rotate at a rate proportional to the rotation rate of the line of sight (Line-Of-Sight rate or LOS-rate), and in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|After {{considering}} {{a number of}} possibilities to solve this, including a <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> system, they settled on an extremely simple solution. Small wind vanes on {{the nose of the}} missile were used to rotate the camera so it was always pointed {{in the direction of the}} flight path, not the missile body. Now when the operator maneuvered the missile he saw where it was ultimately headed, not where it was pointed at just that instant. This also helped reduce the motion of the image with sharp control inputs.|$|E
50|$|To {{fire the}} missile, a BCU (Battery Coolant Unit) is {{inserted}} into the handguard. This shoots a stream of argon gas into the system, {{as well as a}} chemical energy charge that enables the acquisition indicators and missile to get power. The batteries are somewhat sensitive to abuse, with a limited amount of gas. Over time, and without proper maintenance, they can become unserviceable. The IFF system receives power from a rechargeable battery. Guidance to the target is initially through <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation,</b> then switches to another mode that directs the missile towards the target airframe instead of its exhaust plume.|$|E

50|$|Guidance is by <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> and a {{semi-active}} radar {{homing system}} using the nose intake cone and four aerials around the intake as an interferometer aerial, with targets being identified by a Type 1022 surveillance radar (originally radar Type 965) and illuminated {{by one of}} a pair of radar Type 909. This allows two targets to be engaged simultaneously in initial versions, with later variants (see below) able to engage more. Firing is from a twin-arm trainable launcher that is loaded automatically from below decks. The original launcher seen on the Bristol was significantly larger than that which appeared on the Type 42 and Invincible classes. Initial difficulties with launcher reliability have been resolved.|$|E

50|$|The basic Mistral missile is {{used with}} a man-portable launch unit. There are also launch units that allow the missile to be fired from {{armoured}} vehicles, ships or helicopters (such as the Aérospatiale Gazelle, Denel Rooivalk, or Eurocopter Tiger). To reject the flares ejected {{from the rear of}} the targeted aircraft, <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> using a gyro as a reference is adopted for Mistral, instead of the pursuit method in earlier IR-guided MANPADS. To further enhance the ECCM capability, the seeker of Mistral has a very narrow field of view to reject decoys and interference, but the seeker can tilt in the range of +/- 38 degrees. On the launcher, the missile runs up the gyro in 2 seconds, and total reaction time is 5 seconds. The all-aspect two-color (2-4 and 3-5 µm) cooled IR-seeker of Mistral is developed by SAT, and the missile adopts both laser proximity and impact fuzes.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> was first {{discovered}} at sea, {{and was used}} by navigators on ships to avoid collisions. Commonly referred to as Constant Bearing Decreasing Range (CBDR), the concept continues to prove very useful for conning officers (the person in control of navigating the vessel {{at any point in}} time) because CBDR will result in a collision or near miss if action is not taken by one of the two vessels involved. Simply altering course until a change in bearing (obtained by compass sighting) occurs, will provide some assurance of avoidance of collision. Obviously not foolproof, the conning officer of the vessel having made the course change, must continually monitor bearing lest the other vessel does the same. Significant course change, rather than a modest alteration, is prudent. International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea dictate which vessel must give way but they, of course, provide no guarantee that action will be taken by that vessel.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{suitable}} target image has been selected, the seeker enters tracking mode. In this mode the output {{from the camera}} is ignored except when it is scanning close to the original pickled location. In those locations the circuit triggers as normal, sending the output to {{a second set of}} capacitors. By comparing the voltages in the two sets of capacitors, the difference in location between the original selected spot and the current spot is output as an error signal. This is sent into the seeker's gimbal mounting to turn the camera so it re-aligns with the original location. The guidance system then compares the angle of the camera to the angle of the missile body, and sends commands to the aerodynamic controls to bring it back onto a collision course. To address the need to track moving targets, a <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> system is normally used, which naturally produces the required lead.|$|E
50|$|Israel Aerospace Industries {{announced}} in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented exoatmospheric interception method includes a two-stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology. Unlike most kill vehicles, which use liquid or gas propulsion, the new Israeli kill vehicle will be propelled by an ordinary rocket motor {{equipped with a}} thrust-vectoring nozzle. It will also be fitted with a gimbaled seeker for hemispheric coverage. By measuring the seeker's line-of-sight propagation relative to the vehicle's motion, the kill vehicle will use <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> to divert its course and line up exactly with the target's flight path. Joseph Hasson, chief missile designer at IAI, who patented the new kill vehicle with his colleague Galya Goldner, says that the concept is relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive, {{and is based on}} mature technologies. Furthermore, the kill vehicle's divert capability and agility reduce the need for detection and tracking systems, which usually accompany remote sensor-assisted exoatmospheric kills. IAI displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 missile and its kill vehicle at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{variation}} of the pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance law, called augmented pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation,</b> to account for target maneuvers, in a realistic nonlinear engagement geometry, and presents its capturability analysis. These results are in contrast to most work in the literature on augmented <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> laws that consider a linearized geometry imposed upon the true <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance law. Because pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance law is closer to a realistic implementation of <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> than true <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> law, and any engagement process is predominantly nonlinear, the results obtained in this paper are more realistic than any available in the literature. Sufficient conditions on speed ratio, navigation gain, and augmentation parameter for capturability, and boundedness of lateral acceleration, against targets executing piecewise continuous maneuvers with time, are obtained. Further, based on a priori knowledge of the maximum maneuver capability of the target, a significant simplification of the guidance law is proposed in this paper. The proposed guidance law is also shown to require a shorter time of interception than standard pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> and augmented <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation.</b> To remove chattering in the interceptor maneuver at the end phase of the engagement, a hybrid guidance law using augmented pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> and pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> is also proposed. Finally, the guaranteed capture zones of standard and augmented pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance laws against maneuvering targets are analyzed and compared in the normalized relative velocity space. It is shown that the guaranteed capture zone expands significantly when augmented pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> is used instead of pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation.</b> Simulation results are given to support the theoretical findings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe evasive {{boundaries}} of {{two types of}} fighters which have different g performances, against a <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance missile and an augmented <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance missile are studied.

Studies are made for the combination of above fighters and missiles in several altitudes. The {{results show that the}} fighter evasive region is more restricted against an augmented <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> missile than a <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> missile particularly in high altitudes, and the high-g barrel roll is quite effective for both types of fighters. The interesting features are that the fighter can achieve a larger miss distance against an augmented <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> missile if it takes an optimal evasive maneuver...|$|E

40|$|In the literature, {{the impact}} angle control {{problem has been}} {{addressed}} mostly against lower speed or stationary targets. However, in the current defense scenario, targets of much higher speeds than interceptors are a reality.

An analysis of the set of achievable impact angles by the composite <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance law is presented. It is shown that there exists an impulse bias that, when added to the composite <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> guidance command, expands this set further by reversing the direction of the line-of-sight angular rotation vector. A bound on the magnitude of the bias is also derived. Finally, an implementation of this impulse bias, {{in the form of a}} series of pulses, is proposed and analyzed.

40|$|A new {{generalized}} {{guidance law}} for collision courses is presented. When the missile and target axial accelerations or decelerations are constant, {{there exists a}} rectilinear collision course. The guidance law pre-sented, which is called the true guidance law, gives theoretical lateral acceleration commands to guide the missile on a collision course. However, since {{it is very difficult}} to realize the true guidance law on most existing tactical missiles, this paper shows a method for simply implementing the guidance law, which is called the simplified guidance law. The small perturbation equation of the true guidance law shows that the definition of an effective navigation constant is the same expression as that in the case of conventional <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation.</b> The performance of the two guidance laws presented is compared with that of <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> using simulation studies of a simple model of a short range air-to-air missile.

40|$|AbstractIdeal <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (IPN) is {{a natural}} choice for {{exoatmospheric}} interception for its mighty capture capability and ease of implementation. The closed-form solution of two-dimensional ideal <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> was conducted in previous public literature, whereas the practical interception happens in the three-dimensional space. A novel set of relative dynamic equations is adopted in this paper, which is with the advantage of decoupling relative motion in the instantaneous rotation plane {{of the line of}} sight from the rotation of this plane. The dimension-reduced IPN is constructed in this instantaneous plane, which functions as a three-dimensional guidance law. The trajectory features of dimension-reduced IPN are explored, and the capture regions of dimension-reduced IPN with limited acceleration against nonmaneuvering and maneuvering targets are analyzed by using phase plane method. It is proved that the capture capability of IPN is much stronger than true <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (TPN), no matter the target maneuvers or not.

40|$|Two generic {{classes of}} <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (PN) laws are {{compared}} in detail. One class consists of pursuer-velocity-referenced systems, which include pure <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (PPN) and its variants; {{the second category}} consists of line-of-sight- (LOS-) referenced systems such as true <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (TPN), generalized true <b>proportional</b> <b>navigation</b> (GTPN), and generalized guidance laws. The existing closed-form solutions are discussed in detail, and the classical linear and quasilinear analytical solutions are summarized. A critical comparison is then made {{with regard to the}} definition, implementation, and analytical aspects of the guidance laws, including the method, the nature of solution, and an appraisal of the behavior of the pursuer motion resulting from the laws. It is established that, in spite of some restricted advantages in the solvability of the equations of motion, the LOS-referenced PN schemes suffer from serious limitations in terms of implementation and trajectory behavior. Among the major drawbacks are forward velocity variation requirement, relatively large control effort requirement, restrictions on initial engagement conditions to ensure intercept, lack of robustness, and possibility of unbounded acceleration. It is concluded that PPN is a better guidance law in a practical sense than TPN and its generalizations. Thus, although most of the analytical effort hitherto appears to have been concentrated on TPN and its generalizations, more serious effort needs to be made to understand, model, and solve the PPN guidance scheme...|$|E
