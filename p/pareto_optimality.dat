40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} concept named Comprehensive Pareto Efficiency is {{introduced in the}} context of robust counterpart optimization, which consists of three sub-concepts: <b>Pareto</b> Robust <b>Optimality</b> (PRO), Global <b>Pareto</b> Robust <b>Optimality</b> (GPRO) and Elite <b>Pareto</b> Robust <b>Optimality</b> (EPRO). Different algorithms are developed for computing robust solutions with respect to these three sub-concepts. As all sub-concepts are based on the Probability of Constraint Violation (PCV), formulations of PCV under different probability distributions are derived and an alternative way to calculate PCV is also presented. Numerical studies are drawn from two applications (production planning problem and orienteering problem), to demonstrate the Comprehensive Pareto Efficiency. The numerical results show that the Comprehensive Pareto Efficiency has important significance for practical applications in terms of the evaluation of the quality of robust solutions and the analysis of the difference between different robust counterparts, which provides a new perspective for robust counterpart optimization.

Vehicle routing {{problem with}} time windows (VRPTW) {{involves}} the routing {{of a set}} of vehicles with limited capacity from a central depot to a set of customers with known demands and predefined time windows. Routes for the vehicles must meet all given constraints as well as minimize the objectives of travel distance and vehicles numbers. We proposed hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (HMOEA) incorporates simple heuristics for local exploitation and the concept of <b>Pareto's</b> <b>optimality</b> for solving multiobjective optimization in VRPTW. It is featured with specialized evolutionary operators and variable-length chromosome representation to accommodate the sequence oriented optimization in VRPTW. The HMOEA improves the routing solutions in many aspects, such as lower routing cost, better population distribution, wider scattering area and good convergence trace. ...|$|R
40|$|The bin packing {{problem is}} widely found in {{applications}} such as loading of tractor trailer trucks, cargo airplanes and ships, where a balanced load provides better fuel efficiency and safer ride. In these applications, there are often conflicting criteria to be satisfied, i. e., to minimize the bins used and to balance the load of each bin, subject {{to a number of}} practical constraints. Unlike existing studies that only consider the issue of minimum bins, a multiobjective two-dimensional mathematical model for bin packing problems with multiple constraints (MOBPP- 2 D) is formulated in this paper. To solve MOBPP- 2 D problems, a multiobjective evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOEPSO) is proposed. Without the need of combining both objectives into a composite scalar weighting function, MOEPSO incorporates the concept of <b>Pareto's</b> <b>optimality</b> to evolve a family of solutions along the trade-off surface. Extensive numerical investigations are performed on various test instances, and their performances are compared both quantitatively and statistically with other optimization methods to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MOEPSO in solving multiobjective bin packing problems. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Kaldor {{criterion}} is that {{an activity}} moves the economy closer to <b>Pareto</b> <b>optimality</b> if the maximum amount the gainers are prepared to pay to the losers {{to agree to the}} change is greater than the minimum amount losers are prepared to accept; the Hicks criterion {{is that an}} activity moves the economy toward <b>Pareto</b> <b>optimality</b> if the maximum amount the losers would pay the gainers to forgo the change is less than the minimum amount the gainers would accept to so agree. Thus, the Kaldor test supposes that losers could prevent the arrangement and asks whether gainers value their gain so much they would and could pay losers to accept the arrangement, whereas the Hicks test supposes that gainers are able to proceed with the change and asks whether losers consider their loss to be worth less than what it would cost them to pay gainers to agree not to proceed with the change. After several technical problems with each separate criterion were discovered, they were combined into the Scitovsky criterion, more commonly known as the [...] "Kaldor–Hicks criterion", which does not share the same flaws.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{constrained}} and unconstrained nonlinear multiobjective optimization problems {{that is based on}} an SQP-type approach. The proposed algorithm maintains a list of nondominated points that is improved both for spread along the <b>Pareto</b> front and <b>optimality</b> by solving single-objective constrained optimization problems. These single-objective problems are derived as SQP problems based on the given nondominated points. Under appropriate differentiability assumptions we discuss convergence to local optimal Pareto points. We provide numerical results for a set of unconstrained and constrained multiobjective optimization problems in the form of performance and data profiles, where several performance metrics are used. The numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a state-of-the-art multiobjective solver and a classical scalarization approach, both in the quality of the approximated Pareto front and in the computational effort necessary to compute the approximation. <br/...|$|R
2500|$|As there usually exist {{multiple}} Pareto optimal {{solutions for}} multi-objective optimization problems, {{what it means}} to solve such a problem is not as straightforward as it is for a conventional single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, different researchers have defined the term [...] "solving a multi-objective optimization problem" [...] in various ways. This section summarizes some of them and the contexts in which they are used. Many methods convert the original problem with multiple objectives into a single-objective optimization problem. This is called a scalarized problem. If scalarization is done neatly, <b>Pareto</b> <b>optimality</b> of the solutions obtained can be guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} {{are popular}} approaches to generating Pareto optimal solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. Currently, most evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms apply Pareto-based ranking schemes. Evolutionary algorithms {{such as the}} Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [...] and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA-2) have become standard approaches, although some schemes based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing are significant. The main advantage of evolutionary algorithms, when applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, {{is the fact that}} they typically generate sets of solutions, allowing computation of an approximation of the entire Pareto front. The main disadvantage of evolutionary algorithms is their lower speed and the <b>Pareto</b> <b>optimality</b> of the solutions cannot be guaranteed. It is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others.|$|E

To this end, a more realistic and systematic modeling, evaluation, and design framework with environmental sustainability is particularly urged. In this paper, a bi-level transportation network design problem with multiple environmental considerations is investigated. To explicitly reflect various requirements of environmental sustainability from planners, total emissions costs and total excessive cost are minimized along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. To leave space for additional information on decision-making for planners and provide more generalized description of solution <b>optimality,</b> <b>Pareto</b> optimization approach is adopted. The study proposed a multi-objective variant of a new meta-heuristic named Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) as the optimization tool to solve the formulated network design problem. Well-constructed Pareto sets have been successfully acquired for each scenario tested using Sioux Falls network. The result shows that there are different conflicting relations between pairwise objectives under different demand situations and the newly proposed multi-objective metaheuristic succeeds to produce approximations of Pareto front with comparable quality to NSGA-II with less runtime for the considered road network...|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the problem of optimal design of {{selected}} I-type shapes under bending moment. The strength and stability conditions were formulated and analytically solved in form of mathematical equations. For thin-walled beams both global as well as selected types of local stability forms were taken into account. The optimization problem was given as the bicriteria one. The cross section area of the beam is the first objective function, while the deflection of the beam is the second one. The geometric parameters of cross section were selected as the design variables. The set of constraints includes global and local stability conditions, the strength condition, and technological and constructional requirements in the form of geometric relations. The optimization problem was formulated and solved with the help of <b>Pareto</b> concept of <b>optimality.</b> During the numerical calculations a set of optimal compromise solutions is generated and the best optimal solution is chosen with the help of preference functions. The numerical procedures include discrete, continuous and discrete-continuous sets of the design variables.
