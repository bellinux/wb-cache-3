500|$|In 1904, American {{paleontologist}} Henry Fairfield Osborn described aetosaurs as carnivorous {{aquatic animals}} {{of the order}} Parasuchia, mentioning that [...] " [...] constitutes an independent order, probably freshwater, littoral, carnivorous, short snouted (Aëtosaurus) or long snouted (Phytosaurus, Mystriosuchus) forms, analogous in their habits to the modern Crocodilia". Early aetosaur remains were often found in clays beside skeletons of aquatic animals such as phytosaurs and terrestrial animals such as dinosaurs and trilophosaurs. This may have led some paleontologists {{to believe that the}} animals had died in swampy environments. Because there were a large number of skeletons of animals that would not normally have inhabited swamps in these clays, some paleontologists even suggested that aetosaurs scavenged off the carcasses of animals that became trapped in the swamps and died. Doubts were later raised over this lifestyle, since aetosaur teeth show little indication of carnivory and the weight of the armor suggests that aetosaurs had [...] "a <b>passive</b> <b>mode</b> of life." [...] However, aetosaurs were still regarded as partly aquatic into the mid-20th century.|$|E

Improving our associative learning results in higher cognitive capabilities. We experimentally and computationally studied the learning performance of healthy subjects in a visual-auditory sensory associative learning task across active learning, attention cueing learning, and <b>passive</b> learning <b>modes.</b> According to our results, the learning mode had no {{significant effect on}} learning association of congruent pairs. In addition, subjects' performance in learning congruent samples was not correlated with their vigilance score. Nevertheless, vigilance score was significantly correlated with the learning performance of the non-congruent pairs. Moreover, in the last block of the <b>passive</b> learning <b>mode,</b> subjects significantly made more mistakes in taking non-congruent pairs as associated and consciously reported lower confidence. These results indicate that attention and activity equally enhanced visual-auditory associative learning for non-congruent pairs, while false alarm rate in the <b>passive</b> learning <b>mode</b> did not decrease after the second block. We investigated the cause of higher false alarm rate in the <b>passive</b> learning <b>mode</b> by using a computational model, composed of a reinforcement learning module and a memory-decay module.

2500|$|In neurophysiology, a {{dendritic}} spike {{refers to}} an action potential generated in the dendrite of a neuron. Dendrites are branched extensions of a neuron. They receive electrical signals emitted from projecting neurons and transfer these signals to the cell body, or soma. Dendritic signaling has traditionally been viewed as a <b>passive</b> <b>mode</b> of electrical signaling. Unlike its axon counterpart which can generate signals through action potentials, dendrites were believed to only {{have the ability to}} propagate electrical signals by physical means: changes in conductance, length, cross sectional area, etc. However, a large body of evidence now makes it clear that dendrites are active neuronal structures. [...] Dendrites contain voltage-gated ion channels giving them the ability to generate action potentials. Dendritic spikes have been recorded in numerous types of neurons in the brain and are thought to have great implications in neuronal communication, memory, and learning. [...] They are one of the major factors in long-term potentiation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive, {{unobtrusive}} {{devices that}} can be surface-mounted on existing structures or inserted between the layers of new composite structures.

This paper will present two embedded NDE concepts based on the PWAS technology and Lamb waves approach. The first concept utilizes traveling Lamb waves and could be described as embedded ultrasonics.
