40|$|A {{mild and}} {{efficient}} methodology for single <b>pot</b> <b>ring</b> opening of 3 -aryl- 4 H- 1, 2 -oxazines to gamma-hydroxy ketones was developed using zinc and aqueous chelating ethers. The ether acts as ligand and co-solvent for the reaction. The ability of zinc ions to form stable complexes with chelating ethers activates the zinc towards reduction. Water is the proton source...|$|E
40|$|Strained heterocycles {{are useful}} {{scaffolds}} in oerganic synthesis. One class of such heterocycles is 2 -alkylidene oxetanes, which contain an oxetane ring, an α-enol ether and an alkyl substituent on the exocyclic double bond. This combination of functionalities makes 2 -alkylidene oxetanes potential scaffolds {{for a variety}} of organic targets. Some strategies {{have been reported in the}} literature for the preparation of 2 -alkylidene oxetanes. However, only a limited range of 2 -alkylidene oxetanes can be accessed by these approaches with generally low yields and poor stereo- and regioselectivities. In order to study the 2 -alkylidene oxetanes, it is important to develop a general strategy to a wide range of 2 -alkylidene oxetanes. Several strategies, including alkene isomerization, benzelidenation and mesylate elimination were explored for preparing 2 -alkylidene oxetanes, E- and Z- 2 -alkylidene oxetanes have now been successfully prepared in a stereoselective fashion by β-elimination of mesylates using t-BuOK. A new reaction was discovered in the course of preparing intermediates for accessing 2 -alkylidene oxetanes by β-elimination. The transformation involved one <b>pot</b> <b>ring</b> expansion and silyl migration of α-silyloxy epoxides by treatment with trimethylsulfonium methylide to give substituted 3 -silyloxy tetrahydrofurans. This ring expansion-silyl migration protocol has been successfully applied to some substituted epoxides to give 1, 3 - and 2, 3 -disubstituted tetrahydrofurans. ...|$|E

Since then, they have introduced over 100 unique drinks to their menu, ranging from juices to teas, and coffees to milk teas, and their trademark items, the Snow Bubble and Yogurt Frost.

A space {{will remain in the}} middle of them, and through this the fire must be fed.|$|R

Yod Chai invited the villagers to build the house for monks. Form the event the monks and villagers united. They asked for a permit to build with the name “Sum nak shong <b>pot</b> ti reum <b>rang</b> si”. The temple was established in 1977 on land received from King Rama Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1994. On 28 February 1989 they changed the name to Wat Tha Mai by order of the ministry of education.|$|R
25|$|Acoma pottery {{dates back}} to more than 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is {{essential}} to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened {{by the addition of}} pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side of the pot, and hold it to their ear. If the <b>pot</b> does not <b>ring,</b> then the <b>pot</b> will crack during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use.|$|R
40|$|Wild-caught wrasse {{is used as}} {{cleaner fish}} to reduce sea lice infestations in salmonid {{aquaculture}} in Norway. Wrasses are protected during the spawning period (May-July), but salmon farmers and fishermen have requested to conduct a fishery for ballan wrasse before the general opening date for all wrasse species. In this project we investigated whether selection grids covering {{the short end of}} <b>pots</b> and last <b>ring</b> in fyke nets could effectively catch ballan wrasse with low by-catch of corkwing and goldsinny wrasse. Fourteen fishermen participated in an experimental fishery in June 2016. Pots with 25 mm gaps achieved an average catch consisting of 81 % ballan wrasse of the total catch of target wrasse species. Fyke nets were on average less effective and showed larger variation among fishermen. Surveys of the ballan wrasse spawning period should be conducted before such a fishery is being allowed to avoid disturbing the spawning...|$|R
5000|$|Hathimera {{is an old}} {{village of}} approx 5000 population, with not more than 50% {{literacy}} rate, having one primary school (Captan Zareen Shaheed School). Historically, Hathimera was a pathway of King Akbar to the subcontinent, here his wife's elephant died {{and the name of}} place was taken as Hathimra (in English, [...] "elephant died"). As time passed, the name was changed to Hathimera (elephant place). Recently during a construction dig, after digging 7-10 ft workers found old things like <b>pots,</b> gold <b>rings</b> and human skeletons wearing clothes or sitting, not in graves. This means that there was civilization thousand of years earlier, and that they were drowned or swept away by some natural disaster.There are many tribes live in Hathi mera village. Initially swati's (the school name was on their name) were owner of this village.afterward the malik family migrated here from mangal.and then awan came here. after this swati's took workers here and they were arbab (saith) family and raja's. Malik's took gujar for there work in farming. and there are no tanoli owners at the place initially. afterward tanoli purchased the agriculture land from turks at hathibala place situated adjucent to hathimera.There is also a noble sufi(peer) family in that village and Hazrat Pir Mian Jamal UD Din was their Grand father Belongs to Awan tribe. Mr Zaheer udin khan was the grandfather of swati's family. his grave is behind the main mosque of village. Malik Gulam Muhammad was grandfather of Malik's Family and his grave is in main chock near primary school of the village. Moreover the school and the main road of the village is owned by swati's man Major Zareen khan shaheed (khankhel swati).|$|R
40|$|South Carolina Electric & Gas (SCE&G) submits {{this letter}} in {{accordance}} with the requirements of 10 CFR 21. 21 (a) (2) as a final report of an identified defect which was potentially associated with a substantial safety hazard. During the monthly surveillance test STP 0125. 002 A on 12 / 21 / 00, the "A " diesel generator experienced load swings during unloading. Replacement of the Woodward Governor EGA unit eliminated the load swing problem. Following removal of the EGA unit, an on-site bench test and inspection was performed. Although the EGA successfully passed the bench test, the inspection identified some questionable solder joints on the stability potentiometer (pot). This <b>pot</b> has three <b>ring</b> terminal connections through which wire leads are looped and then soldered. One of the connections had the wire lead looped through it, but did not appear to have any solder on it. It was suspected that if contact between the lead and terminal were intermittent on the stability pot, then the output signal from the EGA would be erratic and cause load swings and instability, as was experienced on 12 / 21 / 00. Since all of the pots in an EGA were replaced during refurbishment by Power Control Services (PCS) of Engine Systems, Inc. (a Woodward governor nuclear supplier), adequate soldering of the pot terminals during a previous refurbishment was questioned. The EGA was sent to PCS for inspection, testing and refurbishment to determine if it caused the problems experienced during the surveillance testing. ~j 3 ~gj/c 7...|$|R
