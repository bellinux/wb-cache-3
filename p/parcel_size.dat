30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} parcelization of land through easement {{as a result}} of the construction of pipelines in rural areas in Turkey has any negative effects on productive land use. The current legislation in Turkey does not allow the division of land in most rural areas into parcels smaller than 5000  m 2. Therefore, the smallest parcel that can be productively used was considered as 5000  m 2. On the basis of the analysis of the data pertaining to the easement rights having two different widths and collected from three different regions having different <b>parcel</b> <b>sizes,</b> the research aims to find out the number of parcels with an area less than 5000  m 2 (excluding the easement) that were created by the construction of pipelines and to investigate whether a significant number of areas less than 5000  m 2 remain. This study also demonstrates a method that can be used in studies on this subject according to the various <b>parcel</b> <b>sizes</b> that were created by the allotment of parcels due to the easement of the construction of pipelines.|$|R

A suitably capable and equipped woodlot owner may enjoy doing the work himself (simple forestry, road-building, selective logging, firewood processing, etc.).

Otherwise, hiring professionals to reap small quantities of firewood may be too expensive to be cost-effective.|$|E
