S. antidumping investigations during the 2000 - 2006 period. Our difference-in-differences analysis uncovers {{a number of}} findings: (1) the substantial trade-dampening effect at the product level operates mostly at the extensive margin (i. e., {{a decrease in the}} number of exporters) rather than the intensive margin (i. e., a decrease in the export volume per exporter); (2) direct exporters are more likely to exit the U. S. market than trade intermediaries upon both the <b>affirmative</b> <b>preliminary</b> and final ITC determinations; (3) multi-product direct exporters are more likely to exit the U. S. market than single-product direct exporters upon the <b>affirmative</b> <b>preliminary</b> ITC <b>determination,</b> but the opposite holds upon the affirmative final ITC determination; and (4) little price adjustment to antidumping investigations are found at either the product level or firm-product level. We then provide a coherent explanation to the aforementioned findings based on recent developments in trade theories. ...|$|R

Feeding toxicology studies designed to estimate the amount of a chemical additive that can be eaten safely provide the most relevant information. We analyze how many chemical additives allowed in human food have feeding toxicology studies in three toxicological information sources including the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) database. Less than 38 % of FDA-regulated additives have a published feeding study. For chemicals directly added to food, 21. 6 % have feeding studies necessary to estimate a safe level of exposure and 6. 7 % have reproductive or developmental toxicity data in FDA's database.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the Canadian-U. S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on U. S. antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case frequency and determinations against Canada and Mexico, respectively. These free trade agreements (FTAs) may have affected U. S. AD/CVD activity both through increased trade volumes and through the establishment of new Chapter 19 dispute settlement procedures to review national AD/CVD decisions when requested. Using a panel database of U. S. AD/CVD activity from 1980 through 2000, the paper generally finds no evidence that either increased import volumes or Chapter 19 dispute settlement activity affected the frequency of U. S. AD/CVD cases or <b>affirmative</b> <b>determinations</b> against Canada and Mexico. An exception is evidence that cumulative remands by Chapter 19 dispute panels to review U. S. decisions against Canada have led to fewer new affirmative AD/CVD decisions against Canada. These results have implications for future negotiations of PTAs and WTO rounds...|$|R

50|$|Ridership {{increased}} during 1979 and 1980, {{aided by}} the gasoline crisis and fare subsidies; the Peninsula Commute was so sensitive to gasoline prices that ridership jumped by 40% in May and June 1979. SP's ICC petition received a <b>preliminary</b> <b>affirmative</b> ruling from the administrative law judge in July 1979. To preserve the commuter service, Caltrans took over financial responsibility on , and contracted with SP to operate the service. In the first fiscal year, covering 1980-81, operating costs were $19.33 million and fare revenue was $7.81 million, resulting in a farebox recovery ratio of 43%. The deficit was covered by a mix of Urban Mass Transportation Act funds ($2 million), contributions from SP ($400,000), and the state and three counties served ($4.56 million each). During the Caltrans administration, Caltrans purchased new locomotives and cars that replaced the SP equipment in 1985 and provided push-pull service (removing the need to turn locomotives around at terminals), upgraded stations, introduced shuttle buses to nearby employers, and renamed the operation Caltrain. During state administration, ridership continued to decline and the farebox recovery ratio fell to 34.3% in the 1983-84 fiscal year, which violated the minimum of 40% set by AB 1010 in 1982.|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{four months}} after President Ford signed into law the Trade Act of 1974, 1 the first {{petition}} for import relief was filed invoking the 2 ̆ 2 liberalized 2 ̆ 2 provisions of Title II. 2 In the three years since the effective date of the 1974 Act, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has instituted investigations concerning {{a wide variety of}} commodities. 3 Nonetheless, even though Congress by enacting the 1974 Act intended to minimize the President 2 ̆ 7 s control over trade policy and to make import relief more accessible to both industry and labor, the lTC 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations have rarely been followed. This article will analyze the ineffectiveness of the 1974 Act by outlining the background of this new statute, discussing the resolution of specific cases faced by the ITC since 1974, and considering reasons why the Act has not lived up to original expectations. Changes will be suggested which are necessary to achieve a viable international trade policy.

40|$|In the “Logic of Being-there”, Chapter 2, Hegel {{discusses}} Finitude, {{beginning with}} a preamble wherein he advances the moments of the whole logical path. In a brief methodological recapitulation, he reaffirms that {{the first part of}} being-there (being there in general, quality and something) has a structure in which <b>affirmative</b> <b>determination</b> is dominant; whereas the second part of finitude (something and other, being-in-itself, being-for-other, determination, constitution and limit and something as finite) has a negative structure, that is, the negation of something is within itself, introducing the theme of otherness from the category of the other. What is the logical structure of something as finite? Something and other at the moment of limit show themselves as finite, since they both negate each other as the negation of negation. Then, the limit of something and other manifests itself as negation of negation, becoming contradictory and precarious. Hegel, in writing this dialectics of something and other, explains the objects in the world elaborating a new concept of substrate through the relationship between substrates and the idea of processuality, which dissolves the substrates and provides them with a new identity, substrates in movement of relationship and otherness. Whereas conventional thinking depicts the world as static substrates, dialectic thinking reveals the dimension of processuality in the world with meanin...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{focus on}} the {{evaluation}} of the antidumping regime from 1988 through 2003. During these years the Brazilian economy had to cope with several periods of macroeconomic instability and overvaluation of the domestic currency, particularly from 1990 - 92 and 1994 - 98. As a result, from 1992 through 1998, import volumes increased significantly. Although during these years, the demand for antidumping protection was growing, the number of investigations concluded with an <b>affirmative</b> <b>determination</b> was only 52 percent. The authors explain that the institutional framework in charge of administering the antidumping regime was subject to several reforms. Along this process, the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Trade saw its role strengthened. This ministry has a more protectionist bias than the Ministry of Finance that, during the initial years of the liberalization program, played a prominent role in decisions regarding antidumping investigations and measures. The authors conclude that in comparison with other countries that are important users of the antidumping mechanism, the Brazilian experience reveals two interesting features: 1) A relatively small rate of final positive determinations. 2) A tradition of applying antidumping duties in amounts that on average have been quite lower than the full dumping margins.

40|$|The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) {{states that}} no {{contract}} award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an <b>affirmative</b> <b>determination</b> of the contractor's responsibility. Two aspects of determining responsibility include the contractor's financial resources and record of integrity and business ethics.

Recent GAO reports on contractor compliance issues were researched along with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations to identify requirements for contractor responsibility determinations and contractor tax compliance. Many federal contractors are failing to pay their taxes and are continuing to win government contracts. These contractors may have an unfair competitive advantage over contractors that are complying with the tax law, and {{they should not be}} considered as maintaining a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.

40|$|On January 15, 2009, the Contracting and Accountability Act of 2009 was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives (H. R. 572) and the Senate (S. 265). The purpose of this bill is to prohibit the awarding of a contract or grant in excess of the simplfied acquisition threshold unless the prospective contractor or grantee certifies in writing to the agency awarding the contract or grant that the contractor or grantee has no seriously delinquent tax debts, and for other purposes. The introduction of this act reflects the federal government's new focus on contractor accountability, as well as a much needed collaboration effort between the U. S.

40|$|United States {{manufacturers}} have sometimes found themselves unable {{to identify which}} unfair import competitors have injured their industries when sources of unfair competition exist {{in more than one}} country. These {{manufacturers have}} had some redress from unfair trade available to them through various federal trade laws, including, inter alia, the antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Until recently, however, these laws have largely addressed unfair trade competition coming from a single foreign country source at a time; they have not, however, addressed the 2 ̆ 2 hammering effect 2 ̆ 2 of unfair competition from many sources operating in the market at once or sequentially. The International Trade Commission (2 ̆ 2 Commission 2 ̆ 2) is the federal agency responsible for determining injury to domestic industries under these trade laws.
