25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics made today were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width <b>pattern</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since ancient times, simple manual devices {{like the}} abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some {{mechanical}} devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding <b>patterns</b> for <b>looms.</b> More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations {{in the early}} 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The speed, power, and versatility of computers has increased continuously and dramatically since then.|$|R
50|$|Hattersley Dobby LoomIn 1867 George Hattersley and Sons {{created a}} loom with a dobby head. A dobby a {{mechanical}} heald lifting device which allowed weaving of much more intricate <b>patterns</b> on any <b>looms</b> {{to which it}} was fitted.|$|R
50|$|Square stitch is an off-loom bead weaving stitch that {{mimics the}} {{appearance}} of beadwork created on a <b>loom.</b> <b>Loom</b> <b>patterns</b> {{may be used for}} square stitch pieces. Because each bead in a square stitch piece is connected by thread to each of the four beads surrounding it, this stitch is very strong.|$|R
40|$|When John Becker’s <b>Pattern</b> and <b>Loom</b> was posthumously {{published}} in 1987, {{the work was}} hailed as an important work that revealed much new knowledge {{on the development of}} weaving techniques across the centuries from China through to Europe. The key to the book’s almost forensic investigation of its subject was the author himself, a Danish damask weaver with a lifetime’s practical experience in his craft and an intimate knowledge of weaving techniques that allowed him to decipher, experiment and interpret original techniques from small remnants of surviving material. Long out of print, the work has been tidied and reset by Becker’s collaborator on the original work, the sinologist Don Wagner. ...|$|R
50|$|Jhane Barnes is an American {{designer}} of clothing, textiles, eyeglasses, carpets and furniture, {{and the owner}} of the Jhane Barnes fashion design company. Barnes is known for incorporating complex patterns into her clothing designs. She uses computer software to design textile patterns, which then translates the <b>patterns</b> into jacquard <b>loom</b> instructions, which are sent to mills to be woven into fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{position}} in the card corresponds to a [...] "Bolus" [...] hook, which can either be raised or stopped dependent on whether the hole is punched out of the card or the card is solid. The hook raises or lowers the harness, which carries and guides the warp thread so that the weft will either lie above or below it. The sequence of raised and lowered threads is what creates the pattern. Each hook can be connected {{to a number of}} threads, allowing more than one repeat of a <b>pattern.</b> A <b>loom</b> with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 warp ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{design process}} {{began with the}} {{creation}} of a three-dimensional computer model created using custom software. Those forms were then translated into CAD software in order to define the geometry and surfaces of the sculpture. These digital structures were then exported to a gravity and wind simulator {{in order to determine the}} necessary twine tenacity to withstand strong winds. From this information, construction drawings are created which include specific <b>looming</b> <b>patterns,</b> color information, and lengths of meshes.|$|R
50|$|We do {{not know}} exactly when jamdani came to be adorned with floral <b>patterns</b> of the <b>loom.</b> It is, however, certain that in the Mughal period, most likely {{during the reign of}} either Emperor Akbar (1556-1605) or Emperor Jahangir (1605-1627), the figured or flowered muslin {{came to be known as}} the jamdani. Forbes Watson in his most {{valuable}} work titled Textile Manufactures and Costumes of the people of India holds that the figured muslins, because of their complicated designs, were always considered the most expensive productions of the Dhaka looms.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "loom" [...] {{he refers}} to was {{undoubtedly}} {{meant to be a}} Jacquard loom, used for weaving fabric into complex <b>patterns.</b> The Jacquard <b>loom,</b> invented in 1801, was the most complex mechanical device of the early 19th century. It was controlled by a punch card system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s. With as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles, a Jacquard loom in operation must have appeared very impressive. If Sherrington had written a decade later, however, he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead.|$|R
5000|$|The Jacquard head used {{replaceable}} {{punched cards}} {{to control a}} sequence of operations. It is considered {{an important step in}} the history of computing hardware. [...] The ability to change the <b>pattern</b> of the <b>loom's</b> weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming and data entry. Charles Babbage knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his Analytical engine. In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the 1890 U.S. Census. A large, punched-card-based data processing industry developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, dominated by the International Business Machine corporation (IBM), with its line of unit record equipment. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by plugboards.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} part of human interactions occur with other human beings and not only with inanimate objects. It is important in everyday tasks to estimate {{the time it takes}} other people to reach (time to contact) or pass us (time to passage). Surprisingly, little is known about judging time to contact or time to passage of biological or other complex motions. In two experiments, rigid and non-rigid (biological, inverted, scrambled, and complex non-biological) motion conditions were compared in a time-to-passage judgment task. Subjects could judge time to passage of point-light-walker displays. However, due to relative and opponent movements of body parts, all articulated patterns conveyed a noisier <b>looming</b> <b>pattern.</b> Non-rigid stimuli were judged as passing sooner than rigid stimuli but reflected more uncertainty in the judgments as revealed by precision judgments and required longer reaction times. Our findings suggested that perceptual judgments for complex motion, including biological patterns, are built on top of the same processing channels that are involved on rigid motion perception. The complexity of the motion pattern (rigid vs. non-rigid) plays a more determinant role than the "biologicity" of the stimulus (biological vs. non-biological), at least concerning time-to-passage judgments...|$|R
