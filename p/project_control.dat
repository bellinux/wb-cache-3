5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a <b>Project</b> <b>Control</b> group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E

Lack of financial and <b>project</b> <b>control</b> were believed to be the difference between the trust and these other projects.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the ongoing}} {{renewals}} {{are part of}} a wider urban revitalisation project of the larger Circular Quay area, involving a range of developments from the CBD and South East Light Rail project to new walkways and public domains along Sydney's various waterfronts. Coordinated by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, these projects, including the OPT's upgrade program are managed and planned by the Circular Quay Inter-Agency <b>Project</b> <b>Control</b> Group.|$|E

Among them are a mix of private firms as well as government departments and quasi-autonomous government entities which permeates through local, state and federal levels of governance in Australia. With these many affiliations, interests and governance and management authorities affecting the OPT and its surrounding public space, an Inter-agency <b>Project</b> <b>Control</b> (IPC) Group for Circular Quay has been established by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority to oversee and manage the operations and upgrade works.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, as project-scheduling models were being developed, {{technology}} for project cost estimating, cost management and engineering economics was evolving, with pioneering work by Hans Lang and others. In 1956, the American Association of Cost Engineers (now AACE International; the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering) {{was formed by}} early practitioners of project management and the associated specialties of planning and scheduling, cost estimating, and cost/schedule control (<b>project</b> <b>control).</b> AACE continued its pioneering work and in 2006 released the first integrated process for portfolio, program and project management (total cost management framework).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Project</b> <b>control</b> is {{that element}} of a project that keeps it on track, on-time and within budget. [...] <b>Project</b> <b>control</b> begins early in the project with {{planning}} and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process. [...] Projects may be audited or reviewed while the project is in progress. Formal audits are generally risk or compliance-based and management will direct {{the objectives of the}} audit. An examination may include a comparison of approved project management processes with how the project is actually being managed. Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time consuming, too little control is very risky.
