However, Charles Boner added in two more <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E

People eat pancakes (blynai) and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday), and is {{generally}} celebrated by eating a type of pastry called fastlagsbulle or semla. In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla. Children also typically go sledding on this day.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the concentrations of}} β-phenylethylamine (<b>PEA)</b> <b>in</b> CSF in patients with Parkinson's disease, and to evaluate the relation between concentration of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> CSF and severity of Parkinson's disease.  METHODS—Using gas chromatography-chemical ionisation mass spectrometry, CSF concentrations of <b>PEA</b> were measured <b>in</b> 23 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age, 64. 0 (SD 8. 2) years), of whom three were at Hoehn and Yahr stage II, 11 were at stage III, and nine were at stage IV. Comparison was made with eight patients with neuropathy (mean age, 57. 0 (SD 19. 2) years) and 12 controls without neurological disease (mean age, 57. 6 (SD 4. 8) years).  RESULTS—Concentrations of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> CSF in Parkinson's disease were significantly lower (mean 205 (SD 131) pg/ml) than in patients with peripheral neuropathy (433 (SD 254) pg/ml) and controls (387 (SD 194) pg/ml). The concentrations of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> CSF correlated negatively with Hoehn and Yahr stage (P< 0. 01).  CONCLUSIONS—There are decreased CSF concentrations of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> patients with Parkinson's disease. ...|$|R

500|$|Charles Boner was {{the first}} to {{translate}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey. [...] Boner's translation was published as [...] "The Princess on the Peas" [...] in A Danish Story-Book in 1846. [...] Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, [...] "Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?" [...] rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum. Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, [...] "continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal".|$|E

Off the victory, Nixon campaigned in Nebraska where he criticized the three leading Democratic candidates as [...] "three <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a pod, prisoners of the policies of the past." [...] He then proposed a plan to tackle crime that included wiretapping, legislation to reverse previous Supreme Court decisions, and the formation of a congressional committee targeting crime and reforms to the criminal justice system. He did not connect crime to racial rioting, drawing praise from Civil Rights leaders. Nixon won the primary in Nebraska, defeating the undeclared Reagan 71% to 22%. At the following primary in Oregon, Reagan seemed more willing to compete with Nixon, and Rockefeller sat out. But Nixon won with 72%, fifty points ahead of Reagan.|$|E

Many factors, including the solvent used to dilute the odorant, {{can influence the}} measurement of detection thresholds. Differences {{have been reported in}} detection thresholds for phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) when different solvents are used. In this study we used gas chromatography (GC) to investigate further the effect of solvent on odor detection thresholds. We used a single ascending method and serial dilutions of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> four different solvents—liquid paraffin (LP), mineral oil (MO), propylene glycol (PG) and dipropylene glycol (DPG) —to determine the PEA thresholds for 31 adult subjects. For each solvent, we prepared eight serial log base 10 step dilutions (1 – 8), with corresponding liquid PEA concentrations of 6. 3 × 101 – 6. 3 × 10 – 6 (% v/v). We found that the threshold concentrations for <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> LP (step 6. 5) and <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> MO (step 5. 5) were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than for <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> PG (step 4. 0) and DPG (step 4. 0).

Although there were large threshold differences in the liquid concentrations of <b>PEA</b> <b>in</b> LP and PG, the headspace gas concentrations of PEA were the same.

2500|$|Annette Weiner {{argued that}} the [...] "norm of reciprocity" [...] is deeply implicated in the {{development}} of Western economic theory. Both John Locke and Adam Smith used the idea of reciprocity to justify a free market without state intervention. Reciprocity was used, on the one hand, to legitimize the idea of a self-regulating market; and to argue how individual vice was transformed into social good on the other. Western economic theorists starting with the eighteenth century Scots economists Sir James Steuart and Smith differentiated pre-modern natural (or self-subsistent) economies from civilized economies marked by a division of labour that necessitated exchange. Like early sociologist Émile Durkheim, they viewed natural economies as characterized by mechanical solidarity (like so many <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a pod) whereas the civilized division of labour made producers mutually dependent upon one another resulting in organic solidarity. These oppositions solidified by the late nineteenth century in the evolutionary idea of primitive communism marked by mechanical solidarity as the antithesis and alter ego of Western [...] "Homo economicus". It is this armchair anthropology opposition that originally informed modern anthropological debate when Malinowski sought to overturn the opposition and argue that archaic societies are equally regulated by the norm of reciprocity and maximizing behaviour.|$|E

[...] The other members decided to work, but after one member flicked a pea at another, the job quickly turned into a foliage-destroying free-for-all. [...] The destructive attitude in the garden quickly infected the rest of the prison, and inmates rushed from the cellblocks {{to take part in the}} destruction. [...] The guards on duty were quickly overrun and locked into cells. [...] A standoff between the prisoners and government officials, including Attorney General Forrest Anderson and about 200 National Guardsmen, lasted about 24 hours. [...] The warden, Faye O. Burrell, was out of town, taking delivery of an inmate from Indiana who had escaped years earlier. [...] The prisoners clamored for better conditions, better food, better mail service, and the firing of Benjamin W. Wright, the man in charge of Montana's relatively new parole system. [...] Anderson offered an eight-point program which sated the prisoners, and they retreated to their cells without bloodshed. [...] Upon Burrell's return, however, he revoked the program drawn up by Anderson, claiming that he had not, and would not, negotiate with convicts.|$|E
