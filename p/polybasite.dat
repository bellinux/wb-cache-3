40|$|The Baturappe {{prospect}} {{located at}} {{southern part of}} Sulawesi island, Indonesia, is a hydrothermal mineralization district which is characterized by occurrence of epithermal silver-base metal deposits. The mineralization is hosted in basaltic-andesitic volcanic rocks of the late Middle-Miocene Baturappe Volcanics. More than 20 units of quartz - base metal veins are distributed in the area, {{and one of the}} most significant is the Bincanai vein. This study is aimed to characterize the mineral paragenesis and to elucidate the physicochemical conditions of the formation of the deposit on the basis of mineral assemblage and fluid inclusion mictrothermometry. Sulphide assemblages in the vein indicate an intermediate sulfidation state epithermal; beside galena and sphalerite as the early stage minerals, chalcopyrite, tennantite, and tetrahedrite are also identified as the later stage. Microthermometric study of fluid inclusions in quartz indicates formation temperature of the vein ranges from about 230 to 280 oC. Histogram of homogenization temperature suggests that there are two generations of hydrothermal fluid responsible for the ore mineralization in the vein; the higher temperature range represents formation temperature of the base metal (galena, sphalerite), while the lower temperature range is correlate with the precipitation of the rest relatively lower temperature sulphides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, tetrahedrite, tennantite, <b>polybasite,</b> and Bi-Ag-Cu-Fe-bearing sulfide).

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of native gold and electrum from auriferous vein and gold-silver vein de-posits in Japan has been analyzed and summarized. The Ag/Au ratios of native gold and electrum {{from these two}} types of deposits are distinct, i. e., 10 - 20 Ag at % (auri-ferous vein) and 30 - 70 Ag at % (gold-silver vein). Thermo-chemical calculations uggest hat the Ag/Au ratio of native gold and electrum should decrease with increasing chloride concentration and temperature. This is consistent with analytical results of native gold and electrum and fluid inclusion studies. Based on the Ag content of native gold and electrum, the Fe content of sphalerite, and the estimated temperatures, it is deduced that the sulfur activity for auriferous vein-type systems was lower than that of gold-silver vein-type systems. The two types of gold vein deposits occurring in Japan are "auriferous veins in sedimentary terrain " and "gold-silver veins in volcanic terrain " according to the classification by Boyle (1979, 1984). In this paper these deposits are called auriferous vein and gold-silver vein deposits, respectively. There are distinct differences in the characteristics of these two deposit ypes. For instance, the gold-silver vein de-posits occur mainly in Tertiary/Quaternary volcanic re-gions while the auriferous vein deposits occur in sedimen-tary terrain associated with Cretaceous felsic plutonic activity or in regionally metamorphosed rocks (Fig. 1). Common opaque minerals from the gold-silver veins are electrum, argenitite, Ag sulfosalts (pyrargyrite, <b>polybasite),</b> sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena. Native gold...|$|E
40|$|The Mugeuk {{mine was}} {{historically}} the largest gold-silver producer in South Korea, and yielded {{more than ten}} metric tons of gold from ores with an average grade of about 8 g/ton Au and Au/Ag ratios near 1 : 5. Ore deposits consist of> 10 subparallel quartz-calcite veins (typically 0. 6 to 1. 0 m wide) that fill faults and fractures in Jurassic granodiorite and Cretaceous quartz porphyry. Veins formed during six successive hydrothermal events of Late Cretaceous age. Ore miner-alogy of the veins is complex, consisting mainly of pyrite and base-metal sulfides with electrum (23 – 51 atom. % Au), native silver, argentite and silver sulfosalts (<b>polybasite,</b> pyrargyrite). Stage I veins contain no gold and silver (e. g., bar-ren). During stages II to V, economic quantities of gold and silver were precipitated. Stages III and IV represent the culmination of gold precipitation in distinct sulfide bands, whereas stage V represents a shift to dominantly silver deposi-tion. Stage VI veins are barren post-ore quartz-calcite-fluorite. A variety of types of geochemical data indicate that deposition of gold and silver resulted mainly from cooling of ore fluids, accompanying successive incursions of meteoric water into the hydrothermal system. Fluid inclusion data show general decreases of temperature and salinity within each stage. Ore mineral assemblages indicate decreases in the fugac-ity of sulfur with decreasing temperatures during the deposition of gold and silver. Measured and calculated δ 18 O values of hydrothermal fluids decrease generally from + 3. 0 to – 7. 4 ‰ from stages II through VI, and δD values range from – 66 to – 84 ‰...|$|E
40|$|The giant Imiter epithermal Ag–Hg {{vein deposit}} in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of {{southern}} Morocco formed during a major episode of mineralization linked with Ediacaran volcanism at ca. 550 Ma. Silver was deposited during two main epithermal mineralizing events {{referred to as}} epithermal-quartz (ESE-Qz) and epithermal-dolomite (ESE-Dol) stages under distinct stress fields (i. e., WNW-ESE and N-S shortening directions), and is confined to the late Neoproterozoic, N 60 - 90 ° E-trending, transcrustal Imiter fault zone. Economic orebodies are aligned mainly along the interface between sedimentary and volcanic units of lower and upper Cryogenian age. The ore mineralogy consists principally of Ag–Hg amalgam, argentite, <b>polybasite,</b> pearceite, tetrahedritetennantite, proustite-pyrargyrite, imiterite, acanthite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Gangue constituents are dominated by quartz (ESE-Qz stage) and dolomite (ESE-Dol stage). Wall-rock alteration is well developed and includes silicification and dolomitization, and minor propylitization and kaolinitization. Fluid inclusion data indicate that the mineralizing fluids evolved through time, from a mean temperature of * 180 °C and salinity of * 10 wt% NaCl during ESE-Qz stage I, to a mean temperature of * 165 °C and salinity of * 24 wt% NaCl equiv during ESE-Dol stage II. Calculated trapping pressures, {{in the range of}} 1. 1 – 0. 9 kbar, exclude fluid unmixing “effervescence” as a viable ore depositional mechanism. Conversely, halogen compositions suggest the involvement of magmatic brines and evolved seawater. Stable (C, O, S) and radiogenic (Pb, Re/Os) isotope data, together with noble gas isotope compositions, are consistent with various degrees of mixing between mantle and crustal sources along the fluid flow path. Collectively, these data suggest that degassing of CO 2 and SO 2 during epithermal mineralization and related fluid/rock interactions led to local redox-potential decreases and pH increases that resulted in preferential deposition of massive amounts of native Hg-rich silver instead of Ag and Hg sulphide minerals...|$|E
40|$|The Grouse Creek deposit {{is located}} within a {{northwest}} trending third order basin, {{which in turn}} is located within a northeast trending second order basin, that occurs within the Custer graben, a northeast trending first order basin. The deposit is hosted by pyroclastics, carbonaceous and tuffaceous lacustrine sediments, and rhyolites belonging to the Tertiary Challis volcanics. The oldest rock unit observed in the Grouse Creek deposit is a propylitically altered quartz latite pyroclastic, unit Tpp, which is correlative with the tuff of Eightmile Creek. This unit was erupted approximately 48 m. y. ago with initial subsidence of the Custer Graben. The deposition of unit Tpp was followed by a period of erosion and an eruption of a rhyolitic massive pyroclastic, unit Tp. This massive pyroclastic may consist of several relatively indistinct units possibly identifiable only by horizontal silicified zones contained within. Near the end of or soon after the massive pyroclastic eruption and deposition, second and third order basins were formed. Second order basins trend northeast while third order basins trend northwest. Rhyolite flow domes, Trh and Tr, intruded the third order basin margins approximately 45. 8 ± 2. 3 m. y. ago. Shortly after the intrusion of rhyolite Trh, a vent breccia or hydrothermal explosion breccia, Tp(l), was erupted at or near the surface. Portions of unit Tp (1) was then epiclastically reworked within the third order basin 2 ̆ 2 followed by the progressive in-filling of the third order basin with a coarsening upward sequence of carbonaceous black shales, Ts(b), volcaniclastic siltstones and sandstones, Ts, and finally a coarse-grained pyroclastic, Tp(u). During and after the deposition of the upper pyroclastic unit, Tp(u), recurrent movement along the N 50 - 85 E trending set of faults occurred with fine-grained rhyolite dike emplacement. The youngest rock unit in the study area is a rhyolite quartz porphyry dike, and represents the last episode of intrusive activity in the Grouse Creek deposit area. The Grouse Creek deposit contains proven plus probable mineable reserves of 5, 420, 000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0. 042 opt gold and 1. 97 opt silver for a total of 227, 658 ounces of gold and 10, 689, 108 ounces of silver. Ore horizons are relatively flat-lying tabular zones which occur in favorable stratigraphic horizons, with thicker and/or higher grade zones occurring in and near the dominant N 50 - 85 E striking feeding structures. Gold in the Grouse Creek deposit {{is in the form of}} electrum, which is very young in the paragenetic sequence, and as inclusions within pyrite. Silver minerals in the Grouse Creek deposit from oldest to youngest include <b>polybasite,</b> galena, tetrahedrite, freibergite, acanthite, stephanite, miargyrite, pyargyrite, native silver, and electrum. Other silver minerals include aguilarite, owyheeite, and naumannite, but are unknown as to their paragenetic position. Other sulfides present in the deposit include pyrite (occurred throughout mineralization), arsenopyrite (occurred through tetrahedrite depostion), cerussite (unknown paragenetic position), boulangerite (unknown paragenetic position), geocronite (unknown paragenetic position), bornite (early in paragenetic sequence), and chalcopyrite (paragenetic position between bornite and <b>polybasite).</b> The origin of the Grouse Creek ore deposit is interpreted to be epigenetic with a syngenetic phase. The epigenetic origin is supported by the strong structurally controlled feeder zones, veining, and open space filling textures. The syngenetic phase is supported by the strong stratigraphic controls away from the feeder structures, massive pyrite lenses up to 2. 5 cm thick in the lower portion of the carbonaceous black shales, and the presence of framboidal pyrite in portions of the carbonaceous black shales. Structural controls for the Grouse Creek deposit are dominated by the youngest set, therefore the more open or permeable set, of faults striking N 50 - 85 E. The older set of faults striking N 30 - 45 W also controls the Grouse Creek deposit, but to a lesser extent. The intersections of these two sets of structures were major zones of permeability allowing the upward migration of the mineralizing fluids. The stratigraphic contact between the massive pyroclastics, Tp, and the carbonaceous black shales, Ts(b), is a major zone of mineralization due to the impermeable nature of the shales which stopped the upward migration of fluids, forcing lateral migration along this contact. Analysis of four primary fluid inclusions indicates the ore-forming fluids were relatively low in salinity, 1. 81 - 2. 06 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} North China craton hosts numerous world-class porphyry Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag vein deposits. Whether {{or not the}} Pb-Zn-Ag veins {{are genetically}} associated with the porphyry Mo system remains contentious. Here {{we focus on the}} genetic relationships between the Sanyuangou Pb-Zn-Ag vein deposit and the world-class Donggou porphyry Mo deposit, and discuss the potential implications from the spatial and temporal relationships between porphyry and vein systems in the southern North China craton. At Sanyuangou, vein-hosted sulfide mineralization mainly comprises pyrite, sphalerite, and galena, with minor chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, bornite, tetrahedrite, covellite, <b>polybasite</b> and argentite. The mineralization is hosted by a quartz diorite stock, which has a zircon U-Pb age of 1756 ± 9 Ma. However, sericite from alteration selvages of Pb-Zn-Ag sulfide mineralization yields a well-defined 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau age of 115. 9 ± 0. 9 Ma. Although nominally younger, the sericite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age is similar to the age of the nearby Donggou porphyry Mo deposit (zircon U-Pb age of 117. 8 ± 0. 9; molybdenite Re-Os ages of 117. 5 ± 0. 8 Ma and 116. 4 ± 0. 6 Ma). Pyrite from Donggou has elevated contents of Mo and Bi, whereas pyrite from Sanyuangou is enriched in Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Au, and As. This trace element pattern is consistent with metal zonation typically observed in porphyry related metallogenic systems. Pyrite grains from Sanyuangou have lead isotopes overlapping those from Donggou (17. 273 – 17. 495 vs. 17. 328 – 17. 517 for 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 15. 431 – 15. 566 vs. 15. 408 – 15. 551 for 207 Pb/ 204 Pb, and 37. 991 – 38. 337 vs. 38. 080 – 38. 436 for 208 Pb/ 204 Pb). Collectively, the geological, geochronological, and geochemical data support a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the Sanyuangou Pb-Zn-Ag deposit and confirm that the Pb-Zn-Ag veins and the Donggou Mo deposit form a porphyry-related magmatic-hydrothermal system. Given the widespread Pb-Zn-Ag veins and Mo mineralized porphyries in many districts of the southern North China craton, the model derived from this study has broad implications for further exploration of Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag resources in the area...|$|E
40|$|The Quebrada Marquesa Quadrangle in Chile {{exhibits}} {{a series of}} mineralizations comprising manto-type manganese and copper deposits of Lower Creta-ceous age, and copper and silver veins of Tertiary age. The deposits are hosted by volcanic and volcaniclastic units of the Arqueros (Hauterivian-Barremian) and Quebrada Marquesa (Barremian-Albian) Formations. Three episodes of manganese mineralization (Mn 1 - 3) are recognized within the study area. Hydrothermal activity leading to episodes 1 and 3 was of minor importance, while the second one (Mn 2) gave rise to major manto-type deposits of both manganese and copper in the Talcuna mining district. Extensional faulting during Tertiary time resulted in block faulting and the unroofing of the oldest andesitic volcanics and marine sediments (Arqueros Formation). This episode was accompanied by magmatic and hydrothermal activity leading to vein formation in the Arqueros (Ag) and Talcuna (Cu) districts. The latter veins cross-cut the previous manto-type copper deposits. Ore mineralogy is similar in both styles of mineralization (manto- and vein-type) and consists mainly of chalcopyrite and bor-nite, with variable amounts of galena, tetrahedrite (vein-related), chalcocite, sphalerite, pyrite, hematite, digenite and covellite. Alteration processes at Talcuna {{can be divided into}} two categories, those related to the Lower Cretaceous manto-type episode (LK alteration: chlorite-epidote-calcite-albite, prehnite, zeolite), and those associated with the locally mineralized normal faults of Tertiary age (Tt alteration: chlorite-calcite, sericite). The Arqueros silver veins display an ore mineralogy consisting of arquerite, argentite, native silver, <b>polybasite,</b> cerargyrite and pyrargyrite-proustite; associated altera-tion includes strong chloritization of the country rock. The manto-type deposits formed from fluids of salinity between 11 and 19 wt. % NaCl equivalent and temperatures between 120 and 205 °C. Mineralizing fluids during the vein-type stage circulated at lower temperatures, between 70 and 170 °C, with salinity values in a wide range from 3 to 27 wt. % NaCl equivalent. This distribution of salinities is interpreted {{as the result of the}} complex interplay of two diferent processes: boiling and fluid mixing; the former is considered to control the major mineralogical, textural and fluid inclusion features of the vein-type deposits. We suggest that the Lower Cretaceous mineralization (manto-type stage) developed in response to widespread hydrothermal activity (geothermal field-type) involving basinal brines...|$|E

It lies proximal to the well-known Nansatsu-type mineralisation province dominated by high-sulfidation type epithermal deposits. The deposit was heavily mined in the 18  th Century, largely for its relatively higher gold compared to that of surrounding and regional deposits. The Kago deposit is a typical low-sulfidation deposit, characterised by adularia-quartz veins, composed of electrum, Ag-tetrahedrite, <b>polybasite,</b> chalcopyrite and pyrite. Based on mine records, the grade ranged from 4. 1 to 13. 3  g/t Au and 2. 6 – 6. 6  g/t Ag. Alteration grades from low to high temperature argillic into a propylitic zone at the extremes of the vein exposures. Carbonate is absent. Fluid inclusion microthermometry reveals a typical temperature range of 220 – 240  °C with salinity of 0. 7 – 2. 6 NaCl eq. wt%. Electrum from high-grade ore ranges from 66 to 69  wt% Au. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age dating of adularia bearing colloform/crustiform and brecciated veins, suggests a mineralisation event from 4. 23 to 4. 0  Ma. δ 18 O of veined and silicified quartz ranges from + 4. 0 to + 18. 4 ‰. δ 18 OH 2 O of fluids in equilibrium with quartz, in the dominant range of measured fluid inclusion temperatures, ranges from − 6. 5 ‰ to − 0. 2 ‰. δ 34 S of pyrite has a narrow range from − 1. 8 to 2. 7 ‰. The deposit lies at the northern extent of the classic Nansatsu high-sulfidation epithermal area, in which a number of silicified bodies punctuate the region in a roughly semi-circular shape. The Kago deposit lies within the principle mineralisation age range of the high-sulfidation deposits, which range from 5. 5 to 3. 7  Ma. The structural displacement of the Kago deposit from the Nansatsu mineralisation and the differing host rocks has greatly influenced alteration, ore and rock-water interaction of the ore depositing fluids.

The plugs are subalkaline tholeiitic basaltic-andesite to calc-alkaline andesite in composition. Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 dating of a quartz-adularia vein at the Dalangturu prospect yielded an age of 16. 29 +/- 0. 56 Ma (2 sigma), and a crystal tuff of a limestone-pyroclastic rock sequence at the southwest of the Dalangturu prospect was determined as 15. 6 +/- 0. 5 Ma (2 sigma). Statistic overlap of ages suggests that the gold mineralization in the northern prospects {{took place in a}} shallow marine to subaerial transitional environment. Hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks is characterized by the replacement of quartz, illite and adularia. Quartz veins in surface outcrops are up to 50 cm wide in the northern prospects and up to 3 m wide in the southern prospects, showing a banded or brecciated texture, and are composed of quartz, adularia, carbonates with pyrite, electrum, sphalerite, galena, and <b>polybasite.</b> Gold contents of quartz veins are positively correlated with Ag, Zn, Pb, and Cu contents in both the northern and southern prospects.

The quartz veins at the Dalangturu prospect are relatively rich in base metal sulfides. Ag/(Au+Ag) ratios of electrum in the Dalangturu prospect range from 45. 2 to 65. 0 at%, and FeS contents of sphalerite range from 1. 2 to 6. 4 mol%.

The Keban metamorphic massif consists of calc-schists, dolomite marble, phyllite and marble. It forms part of the eastern Taurid belt, a prolongation of the Alpine orogenic belt. The principal structural feature of the area is the northern extension of the Malatya-Keban anticline, a major recumbent fold with a NE-SW axis. Later movements acting in different directions gave rise to N-S, E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW directed folding and faulting over the previous anticline. Small bodies of quartz-syenite porphyry, of paleocene age, intrude the metasediments. Detailed study by chemistry, petrography and x-ray techniques on sanidine accounts for a composition range between Or 65 Ab 35 and Or 99 Ab 1. The ratio of Or to Ab tends to increase outwards from the central parts of the igneous body. Skarn zones have developed in association with the intrusion of quartz-syenite porphyry. These are located mainly within the metasediments. The magnatite deposit of Zereyandere, the scheelite deposit of Kebandere and the main sulphide deposit were formed as part of the process of skarn formation. Minor amounts of some manganese minerals and the minerals vanadinite and descloizite derived from the main sulphide deposit, are also found in the district. The main sulphide deposit of economic importance chiefly incudes sphalerite, galena, iron and copper sulphides and several sulfo-salts in subordinate amounts. Of the by-products, silver comes from galena, <b>polybasite</b> and tennantite. Arsenopyrite in addition to chalcopyrite contains trace concentrations of gold. All the evidence suggests that the quartz- syenite porphyry is the source of mineralization. The location of ore minerals is controlled by certain rock types and by major and minor structural elements. Variation of vapour fugacity and temperature during mineralization are indicated by more than one stage of formation for certain ore minerals. The presence of different gangue minerals marks the fluctuating nature of the ore forming fluids whose last stage is believed to be alkaline rather than acidic. The main sulphide deposit is accepted as a semi-metasomatic contact deposit, while the magnetite and scheelite deposits are classified as being metamorphic. Using various methods, a temperature range of formation between 620 ° and 78 °C is estimated for the ore minerals of the main sulphide deposit. For the ore minerals of the magnetite and scheelite deposits the range is from 743 °C down to 225 °C...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Patricia {{ore deposit}} {{represents}} an unusual example of economic Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization at the northernmost {{end of the}} Late Eocene-Oligocene metallogenic belt in Chile. It is hosted by volcano-sedimentary units, which are typically tuffaceous and andesitic breccias. The ore body consists {{of a set of}} subvertical E-W vein systems developed under a sinistral strike-slip regime that included transtensive domains with generalized extensional structures where the ores were deposited. The deposit is divided into two blocks by a set of NNW-ESE-trending reverse faults, which uplifted the eastern block and exhumed thicker and deeper parts of the deposit. At least 200 m of volcano-sedimentary pile hosting the mineralization has been eroded in this block. By contrast, the western block exposes a shallower part of the system where cherts, amorphous silica and jasperoids occur. Three main stages of mineralization have been defined: (1) pre-ore stage is characterized by early quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite, (2) base-metal and silver stage; characterized by sphalerite (6 to 15 mol% FeS), galena, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and Ag-bearing minerals (freibergite, <b>polybasite,</b> stephanite, pyrargyrite, freieslebenite and acanthite) and (3) post-ore stage; characterized by late quartz, kutnohorite and minor sulfides (arsenopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, galena, Ag-bearing minerals and Pb-sulfosalts). Whole-ore geochemistry shows two groups of elements that are positively correlated; 1) Ag-Cd-Cu-Pb-Zn related to the base metal sulfides and 2) Au-As-Ge-Sb-W related to arsenopyrite and pyrite. Hydrothermal alteration is pervasive in the outcropping mineralized areas, including silicification and locally, vuggy silica textures. At depth, chloritic and sericitic alteration is developed along vein selvages and is superimposed to the regional propylitic alteration. Fluid inclusions indicate that the base-metal ores were deposited from 250 to 150 degrees C moderate salinity fluids (1 - 9 wt. % NaCl). The pre-ore stage is characterized by a saline fluid (6 - 22 wt. % NaCl) and between 210 and 250 degrees C whereas the post-ore stage has salinity of 4 - 8 wt. % and temperature from 175 to 215 degrees C. Cooling was the mechanism of ore mineral precipitation in the Patricia deposit, although mixing of fluids could have occurred in the pre-ore stage. Mineralogical, geochemical and fluid inclusion evidence is consistent with an intermediate sulfidation (IS) epithermal deposit type. This study highlights the high potential for hidden economic mineralization at depth in the western block and for extension of the ore body both to the south and to deeper levels in the eastern block of the Patricia ore deposit. To a larger extent, the implications of finding such polymetallic epithermal style of mineralization in the northern Chile Precordillera is relevant both to the regional metallogenic perspective and to the exploration potential of the region, where the late Eocene-early Oligocene metallogenic belt apparently disappears.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Moonlight deposit {{is a recent}} discovery peripheral to the Pajingo mine, located in the Drummond basin, North Queensland. The study has addressed ores and host rock in four drillcores from {{the upper part of}} the epithermal mineralization at Moonlight to determine the mineralogical and geochemical character of the mineralisation and associated alteration. Sampling was focussed on high-grade and sulfide-rich intervals. The chosen approach gave particular focus to the speciation, textures and distribution of precious metals at Pajingo and the implications of the different pyrite textures and mineral chemistry, with respect to both conditions of ore formation and the role of pyrite as a gold carrier. Moonlight ore is largely located within altered andesites and brecciated epiclastic rocks. Veins, marked by coarse chalcedony crosscut the epiclastics. There is evidence for a sinter above the ores, indicating formation within a sub-basin and for propylitic and argillic alteration alongside the dominant silicification. Pyrite from both high- and low-grade sulfide-bearing intersections was analysed by laser-ablation inductively-coupled mass spectroscopy. It was found to contain an average of 69. 8 ppm Au, suggesting that ‘invisible gold’ in pyrite contributes significantly to the overall gold balance, even if it is subordinate to visible gold. Au:Ag ratios in analysed electrum varied from 60 : 40 to 40 : 60, suggesting that there is some considerable risk of slow-floating Ag-rich electrum. Silver is present as native silver, acanthite (Ag 2 S), naumannite (Ag 2 Se), <b>polybasite</b> [(Ag,Cu) 6 (Sb,As) 2 S 7][Ag 9 CuS 4], pyragarite (Ag 3 SbS 3) and minor hessite (Ag 2 Te), as well as in solid solution and/or inclusions in pyrite. Pyrite textures observed in the study are diverse and indicate that the epithermal system that generated the Moonlight deposit was complex and possibly multi-phase. Variation in assemblages and mineral chemistry implies substantial evolution in the physicochemical parameters of the ore -forming fluid during the life of the hydrothermal system. LA-ICPMS element mapping of a complex, zoned pyrite grain showed a core enriched in Co, Ni and Sb; onto this is superposed As, Au. Resorption and overgrowths indicate that the pyrite has been reworked. A characteristic ‘dirty’, feathery pyrite is of replacement origin and may have pseudomorphed chlorite that resulted from an earlier propylitic alteration. No direct evidence was found to substantiate the working mine model in which high-grade ‘bonanza’ veins are predicted at depth, however observations of lithologies from the level investigated in this study are consistent with the model. The high Ag content of the Moonlight ores, together with a distinct base metal presence (sphalerite, tetrahedrite) could mean that the Moonlight system is more distal to the fluid source than Vera-Nancy and was possibly formed at somewhat cooler temperatures on the flank of the main volcanic system.
