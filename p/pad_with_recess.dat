40|$|The {{reliability}} of fine pitch Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu flip chip solder joints <b>with</b> three different <b>pads,</b> i. e., bare <b>pads,</b> <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> solder masks, and <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia, on {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) was studied through thermal cycling. After assembly, (Au,Ni) Sn 4 intermetallics (IMCs) formed both in the bulk solder and at the interfaces due to the immersion-Au finish on the PCB side. The (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs formed in the solder joints on the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia were more abundant than those formed in the solder joints on the pads without microvia. The {{results showed that the}} solder joints on the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> a microvia had poor reliability due to the insufficient solder volume and the formation of large amounts of (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs. The main crack initiation position was the corner of solder joint at the chip side. For the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia, the main location of failure was at the (Au,Ni) Sn 4 /solder interface on the chip side, and for the solder joints on bare <b>pads</b> and <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> solder mask, the possible failure location was in the bulk solder...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a finite}} element sub-modelling method {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the stress distribution and the crack propagation lifetime in Aluminium alloy, Al 7075 -T 6 specimens. Different contact geometries, i. e. cylinder-on-flat and flat-on-flat, and different contact span width's <b>with</b> different <b>pad's</b> compression forces are analysed. It is found that fretting fatigue life for two based cylindrical pads is shorter than that for two based flat pads and in two based flat pads is shorter than that for perfectly flat pads. In the case of two based flat pads, stress distribution in the <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> width of 3. 1 mm is about 14 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> the width of 6. 2 mm and about 21 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> the width of 9. 3 mm. Similarly, stress in cylindrical <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> width of 3. 1 mm is 36 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> width of 6. 2 mm and 130 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> width of 9. 3 mm. Stresses increased by 21 % for pad force of 1800 N and around 40 % for pad force 2400 N compared <b>with</b> 1200 N <b>pad</b> force. Also {{it is observed that}} by increasing pad width for both flat and cylindrical pads, crack propagation lifetime increased. Furthermore, fretting fatigue crack growth rate raises when pads compression force increases...|$|R

3000|$|The second {{modification}} {{that also}} {{will reduce the}} amount of zero padding is to zero <b>pad</b> <b>with</b> the maximum shift in the designed matrix, not with the maximum degree of the determinant. At the encoder side, each packet will be <b>padded</b> <b>with</b> the maximum shift in the matrix. Then at the receiver side, before starting decoding, the received packets are extra <b>padded</b> <b>with</b> zeros to make the total number of zero padding equal to the maximum degree determinant. This reduces the amount of overhead in the transmitted packets. This modification applies for any design (Vandermonde or nonVandermonde), and the advantages benefit equally both modifications.
