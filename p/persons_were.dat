5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all <b>persons</b> <b>were</b> {{to be tried}} in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws.

Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process.

5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 <b>persons</b> <b>were</b> arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E
5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v.

Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable <b>persons</b> <b>were</b> not granted licences to run gaming establishments.
