Subsequently, Falcon was able to continue to produce housings and develop its own very similar core line to compete with Best Universal Lock.|$|E

5000|$|His fever powder, {{which he}} {{patented}} in 1747, {{was one of}} the most successful of 18th-century patent medicines,though he is said to have [...] "tarnished his image by patenting his powders, and falsifying their specification". (It was considered unbecomingly mercenary to patent a medicine, and his falsification of the ingredients in the <b>patent</b> <b>documentation</b> would have been designed to prevent others from replicating his formulation.) The use of this preparation, a compound of antimony and phosphate of lime, has been cited as a contributing factor in the death of Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
5000|$|Phillip C. Clark {{filed for}} a United States patent on November 23, 1987 {{described}} as [...] "Method for converting {{one or more}} steel shipping containers into a habitable building at a building site and the product thereof". This patent was granted August 8, 1989 as patent 4854094. The <b>patent</b> <b>documentation</b> shows what are possibly the earliest recorded plans for constructing shipping container housing and shelters by laying out some very basic architectural concepts. Regardless, the patent may not have represented novel invention at its time of filing. Paul Sawyers previously described extensive shipping container buildings used {{on the set of}} the 1985 film Space Rage Breakout on Prison Planet.|$|E

5000|$|Each record {{within the}} {{database}} defines a patent family, the grouping of <b>patent</b> <b>documentation</b> recorded {{at the various}} patent offices as protection of an invention is sought around the world. Each patent family is grouped around a Basic patent, which is usually the first published example of the invention. All subsequent filings are referred back to the Basic patent, and {{are referred to as}} Equivalent patents. On this basis, the database has some 20 million [...] "inventions", corresponding to tens of millions of patents, with almost a million new inventions added each year. From 2008, the number format of the Basic patent identifier (the Accession number) changed, to allow up to 3.6 million records per year to be added, as the previous format only allowed a maximum of 1 million new records a year. This is due to the steady increase in unique patents filed each year.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} {{was established in}} 1976 to enable utilization of the available scientific potential in dealing with practical tasks in Karelia. The high level of practical (applied) developments required that they were legally protected. The first head of the {{department was}} G. B. Lavrenenko. The Patent Department coordinates the patent- and license-related activities of KarRC RAS institutes, provides legal, information and advisory/training support to scientific research activities. The Patent Department provides patenting information of relevance for scientific research and developments, takes part in patent search related to KarRC RAS research areas, including retrieval, selection, systematization of <b>patent</b> <b>documentation,</b> evaluation of the technical level of the research object, analysis of the results of patent search. The database of inventions that have been applied in industry, agriculture, forestry and in basic research has been created.

40|$|The DNA target {{sequence}} {{is the key}} element in designing detection methods for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately this information is frequently lacking, especially for unauthorised GMOs. In addition, patent sequences are generally poorly annotated, buried in complex and extensive documentation and hardly associable to the corresponding GM event. Here we present the JRC GMO-Amplicons, a database of amplicons collected by screening public nucleotide sequence databanks by in silico determination of PCR amplification with reference methods of GMO analysis. The European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed of the European Commission (EU-RL GMFF) provides these methods in the GMOMETHODS database for supporting enforcement of EU legislation and GM food/feed control. The JRC GMO-Amplicons database is composed of more than 240, 000 amplicons, which can be easily accessed and screened through a web-interface. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} attempt of pooling and collecting publicly available sequences related to GMOs in food and feed. The JRC GMO-Amplicons supports control laboratories in the design and assessment of GMO methods, providing inter-alia in silico prediction of primers specificity and GM targets coverage. The new tool may assist the laboratories in the analysis of complex issues, such as detection and identification of unauthorised GMOs. Notably, the JRC GMO-Amplicons database may allow the retrieval and characterisation of GMO-related sequences also included in <b>patents</b> <b>documentation.</b> Finally, it could help annotating poorly described GM sequences and identifying new relevant GMO-related sequences in public databases. The JRC GMO-Amplicons is freely accessible through a web-based portal that is hosted on the EURL-GMFF web-site. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|R
