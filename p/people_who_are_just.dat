On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> part of that community who are doing this because we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E

Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> starting their bands who happen {{to live in the}} canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E

[...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think that we both have <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E

I think the people who are protesting in Wall Street break into two groups: one is left-wing agitators who would be happy to show up next week on any other topic, and the other is sincere middle-class people who frankly are very close to the Tea Party people who care. And actually... you can tell which are which. The people who are decent, responsible citizens pick up after themselves. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> out there as activists trash the place and walk off and are proud of having trashed it, so let’s draw that distinction."

All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would say the most insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E

'That Miss Hawtrey {{would do}} {{anything}} absolutely wrong is to {{me out of the}} question; though she might, from thoughtlessness, when a girl, as you put it to her, have got into some silly entanglement, for such things happen continually; but after the line you took up with her I can but dismiss this from my mind as altogether out of the question, and we must look at the matter entirely {{from the point of view}} that it is either an attempt to extort money, or is simply the outcome of sheer malice, an attempt to give pain, and to cause extreme annoyance. Miss Hawtrey is, you say, wholly unaware of having at any time given such offence to anyone as to convert him or her into an enemy. Of course, there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as bitter over an imaginary injury as over a real one, but I am more inclined to think that this letter is the result of malice than an attempt to extort money.' ...|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{educational}} importance of the nature trails {{in the southern part of}} the Protected Landscape Area Beskydy. The first part is devoted to the theoretical overview of rural tourism and, especially, I wrote about the situation of tourism in the area. Then I described PLA Beskydy and also village Zděchov, where the nature trail is located. In the practical part I evaluated a questionnaire, which was focused on finding out how much of knowledge had visitors about the area before they visited the natural trail and after I tried to compare it with knowledge of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> about to visit this nature trail and also with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> outside of this trail...|$|R
40|$|Both {{in antiquity}} and today Vergil is {{sometimes}} {{accused of being}} ignorant of astronomy. In this talk I argue that, on the contrary, Vergil's treatment of astronomical topics in Georgics 1. 231 - 258 shows that he was quite familiar with them, and was able (when he wished to) to combine information from different sources (Aratus, Eratosthenes and other, unidentified ones) into a sensible and harmonious whole. On the other hand, the omission of essential steps between the various parts of his account, and the deliberate (as it seems to me) confusion with mythological allusions show us that his ultimate aim was not to inform ignorant peasants but to amuse and surprise <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as familiar with Vergil's sources and the theories he presents...|$|R
5000|$|The content-giving part of Rawls' thesis {{belongs to}} Ideal Theory, {{it is an}} attempt to define how {{different}} <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just,</b> or at least decent, should behave with respect to one another. Rawls refers to this ideal conception as a [...] "realistic utopia": realistic because it could and may exist; utopian because it [...] "joins reasonableness and justice with conditions enabling citizens to realize their fundamental interests" [...] (L.P. p. 7). This is a continuation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s idea that any attempt to discover sure principles of government must take [...] "men as they are and laws as they might be" [...] (The Social Contract; opening passage). Thus, the Law of Peoples is realistically utopian: it {{is an attempt to}} show [...] "how reasonable citizens and peoples might live peacefully in a just world" [...] (L.P., Preface, p.vi).|$|R

Her junior year, she decided she wanted to try an exchange program with Oberlin, a hearing school. She received a lot of criticism from her peers, who did not understand why she would want to attend a hearing school. Her response was that she grew up in a deaf world, and wanted to see what things were like for the hearing. Once she got there, she interacted with hearing <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> learning to sign, which changed her view on hearing people. When she returned for senior year, she realized {{she did not want to}} be a Psychologist any longer, as it was too emotionally draining for her.|$|R
