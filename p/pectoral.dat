5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the <b>pectoral</b> girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The <b>pectoral</b> girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the <b>pectoral</b> girdle.The <b>pectoral</b> girdle is attached to the skull. The <b>pectoral</b> girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired <b>pectoral</b> and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the lateral}} <b>pectoral</b> nerve innervates the axillary arch, although instances {{have been found}} where the intercostobrachial nerve, the medial <b>pectoral</b> nerve and the thoracodorsal nerve provide the nervous supply.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pectoral</b> fins are as long {{or longer}} than the head, with a nearly {{straight}} front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the <b>pectoral</b> fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins are dark except for a white rear margin on the anal fin; the <b>pectoral</b> and pelvic fins are dark above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the <b>pectoral</b> fins have dusky mottling.|$|E

5000|$|Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion {{combines}} an isolation {{exercise with}} a compound exercise {{for the same}} muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the <b>pectorals</b> perform their function. But in the [...] "bench press" [...] the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits {{the impact on the}} <b>pectorals.</b> By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the <b>pectorals</b> can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.|$|R
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} <b>pectoral</b> fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the <b>pectoral</b> fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the <b>pectoral</b> fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the <b>pectoral</b> fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The <b>pectoral</b> fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, <b>pectoral</b> fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
5|$|The large <b>pectoral</b> fins measure around one-fifth {{as long as}} the body, {{and have}} a falcate (sickle-like) shape {{tapering}} to a point. The first dorsal fin is of moderate size and somewhat falcate, with a pointed apex and a strongly concave rear margin; its origin lies over the <b>pectoral</b> fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and is positioned about opposite the anal fin. A low dorsal ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is large and high, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped and closely set, each bearing five horizontal ridges leading to teeth on the posterior margin. This species is bronzy to bluish gray above and white below, which extends onto the flanks as a faint lighter stripe. The fins, particularly the underside of the <b>pectoral</b> fins and the lower caudal fin lobe) darken towards the tips; this is more obvious in juveniles.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{birds have}} {{approximately}} 175 different muscles, mainly controlling the wings, skin, and legs. The largest {{muscles in the}} bird are the <b>pectorals,</b> or the breast muscles, which control the wings and make up about 15 - 25% of a flighted bird's body weight. [...] They provide the powerful wing stroke essential for flight. The muscle medial to (underneath) the <b>pectorals</b> is the supracoracoideus. It raises the wing between wingbeats. Both muscle groups attach to the keel of the sternum. This is remarkable, because other vertebrates have the muscles to raise the upper limbs generally attached to areas {{on the back of}} the spine. The supracoracoideus and the <b>pectorals</b> together make up about 25 – 35% of the bird's full body weight.|$|R
5|$|A {{week and}} a half after Dumervil won the Nagurski Trophy, senior {{defensive}} tackle Montavious Stanley, who was a leader on defense for Louisville, underwent surgery to repair a torn <b>pectoral</b> muscle. Stanley was the Cardinals' best run-stopper on defense, amassing 48tackles and 5.5sacks during the season.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust <b>pectoral</b> girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other {{flapping}} theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver <b>pectoral</b> disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated <b>pectoral</b> disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the <b>pectoral</b> fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The <b>pectoral</b> fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, <b>pectoral,</b> and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the <b>pectoral</b> and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like <b>pectoral</b> and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger {{than most other}} shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes.|$|E

5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, <b>pectoral</b> fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated <b>pectoral</b> fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E
5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the <b>pectoral</b> fins are broad and roughly triangular. The {{moderately}} tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} <b>pectoral</b> and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E

50|$|Golemon: Appears in episode 17. Powers {{include three}} axes in each shoulder, flight, an {{extendable}} pendulum tail, knee spinning sais, reformation, and energy beams from the <b>pectorals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the <b>pectoral</b> fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is {{positioned}} just behind the <b>pectoral</b> fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Since Patagosaurus {{is known}} from many specimens, {{including}} at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, small head, a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, <b>pectoral</b> girdle, pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the <b>pectoral</b> girdle, tibia and pubis, are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. The material of Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the pelvic fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular <b>pectoral</b> fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the <b>pectoral</b> fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{longbill}} spearfish is a blueish black color from above, and silvery-white and brown on the sides. The <b>pectorals</b> are blackish-brown and the dorsal fins are dark blue.|$|R
