50|$|Symphytum asperum is a {{flowering}} plant {{of the genus}} Symphytum in the family Boraginaceae. Common names include rough comfrey and <b>prickly</b> <b>comfrey.</b> It is native to Asia and it is known in Europe and North America as an introduced species and sometimes a weed.|$|E
40|$|Annual and interannual {{phenomena}} and canopy behavior of <b>prickly</b> <b>comfrey</b> (Symphytum asperum Lep.) were studied in a 10 -year experiment with 25 measurement sessions {{during the growing}} season. The results confirm the importance of long-term experiments in studying plant phenomena, biometrics and behavior. Prickly com-frey produced a green canopy each year and growth started very early in spring. Maximum plant height was less than 160 cm. Annual phenomena (growth initiation, seedling phase, flower phase, seed phase, senescent phase), interannual phenomena (initiation and youth, reproduction, new generation formation, plant death) and two population cycles (colonization and expansion) were measured. The duration of annual development up to canopy death can be expressed as x+ 2 x+ 3 x+ 2 x, where x is initial growth. The genetic structure and activity of <b>prickly</b> <b>comfrey</b> promotes generative development of the species. Its age can be measured over a single and sev-eral vegetation generations. The ability to change the angle of vertical stem growth after 9 weeks can be consid-ered a functional behavior of <b>prickly</b> <b>comfrey</b> and part of its life strategy. The differences between the organs in {{the upper and lower}} parts are very considerable and should be taken into account in morphological descriptions of this species. The upper and lower stems and leaves showed differential growth. Both stem and leaves were densely setose. Old leaves were 3. 8 times longer, 4 times broader and 2. 4 times thicker than young leaves. Hairs were on average 3 times longer on old than on young leaves. Flowers had contact with pollinators making rela-tively long visits to them...|$|E
40|$|The monthly evening {{meeting of}} the Society was held on Monday, the 7 th May. His Excellency the Governor in the chair. In {{reference}} to the monthly returns from the Gardens of "the time of leafing, flowering, and fruiting of a few standard plants," His Excellency remarked {{it would be interesting}} to notice if change of climate, or soil, or other circumstances modified the habits of certain English trees. From his own observation at the grounds about Government House he could state that some trees which, in England, came into leaf before others, here acted in an exactly reverse manner. Discussion ensued, in which the Rev. W. W. Spicer, Sir Francis Smith, Mr. Justice Dobson, Mr. Swan, Mr. Allport, and Mr. Abbott took part; and on the whole, it appeared probable that varieties in exposure or position might influence different trees variously as to their leafing, etc. Mr. Abbott, however, engaged to obtain further and more precise information on the subject, and bring it before a future meeting. The Rev. W. W. Spicer read a paper on "Aliens," or plants which have been introduced into the colony and naturalised. Illustrative of the paper a collection of plants was laid on the table, embracing all those referred to in the text. These, amounting to 140 specimens, were collected, mounted and named by Mr. Spicer, and very liberally presented by him to the Museum. His Excellency informed the meeting he had written to England for a supply of cuttings of the new fodder plant, the <b>Prickly</b> <b>Comfrey.</b> It was probable this climate would suit it exactly, but that of England appeared to be too cold, as it did not seed there, and therefore cuttings were sent for. Its cultivation would be tried on the grounds at Government House, and, if successful, seeds or cuttings would be distributed throughout the colony. Colonel Crawford saw the plant in cultivation at the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester in England many years ago, but it did not seem at that time to be much thought of. His Excellency thought that any discrepancies of this kind might be explained by the fact that there were two species of the Comfrey...|$|E
