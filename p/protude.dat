6000|$|In {{all these}} Examples it is evident, {{that there is}} an {{extraordinary}} and adventitious force, by which the globular Figure of the contained heterogeneous fluid is altered; neither can it be imagined, how it should otherwise be of any other Figure then Globular: For being by the heterogeneous fluid equally protruded every way, whatsoever part is protuberant, will be thereby deprest. From this cause it is, that in its effects it does very much resemble a round Spring (such as a Hoop.) For as in a round Spring there is required an additional pressure against two opposite sides, to reduce it into an Oval Form, or to force it in between the sides of a Hole, whose Diameter is less then that of the Spring, there must be a considerable force or protusion against the concave or inner side of the Spring; So to alter this spherical constitution of an included fluid body, there is required more pressure against opposite sides to reduce it into an Oval; and, to press it into an Hole less in Diameter then it self, it requires a greater protrusion against all the other sides, What degrees of force are requisite to reduce them into longer and longer Ovals, or to press them into less and less holes, I have not yet experimentally calculated; but thus much by experiment I find in general, that there is alwayes required a greater pressure to close them into longer Ovals, or <b>protude</b> them into smaller holes. The necessity and reason of this, were it requisite, I could easily explain: but being not so necessary, and requiring more room and time then I have for it at present, I shall here omit it; and proceed to shew, that this may be presently found true, if Experiment be made with a round Spring (the way of making which trials is obvious enough.)

In order to determine whether the presumably polar groups covering this surface protruding into the aqueous phase possessed net electric charge, we collected X-ray diffraction data from the photopigment molecules in wet pellets of oriented disk membranes {{as a function of the}} pH and ionic strength of the sedimentation medium. The Fourier analysis applied to this data provided average nearest neighbor separations for the photopigment molecules for their planar arrangement in the disk membranes. Changes in the average separation of photopigment molecule nearest neighbors as a function of pH, ionic strength, and photopigment bleaching indicated that photopigment molecules possess negative net electric charge, that this net electric charge occurs in the aqueous surface layer of the disk membrane, and that this net charge is reduced on photopigment bleaching. This polar portion of the photopigment molecule may thereby determine the location of the photopigment molecules relative to the lipid core and other photopigment molecules in the disk membrane. In addition, the orientation (dichroism) of the photopigment relative to an axis normal to the plane of the disk membrane and the bleaching-dependent “sinking” of the photopigment molecule into the lipid core of the disk membrane may be accounted for...|$|E
