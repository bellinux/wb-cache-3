5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> {{for human}} occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
25|$|The coolant water must {{be highly}} {{pressurized}} to remain liquid at high temperatures. This requires high strength piping {{and a heavy}} <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> and hence increases construction costs. The higher pressure can increase {{the consequences of a}} loss-of-coolant accident. The reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> is manufactured from ductile steel but, as the plant is operated, neutron flux from the reactor causes this steel to become less ductile. Eventually the ductility of the steel will reach limits determined by the applicable boiler and <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> standards, and the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> must be repaired or replaced. This might not be practical or economic, and so determines the life of the plant.|$|E

25|$|In February 2017, TEPCO {{released}} {{images taken}} inside Reactor 2 by a remote-controlled camera, that show {{there is a}} 2-meter hole in the metal grating under the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> in the reactor's primary containment vessel, {{which could have been}} caused by fuel escaping the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel.</b> Radiation levels of about 210 Sv per hour were subsequently detected inside the Unit 2 containment vessel.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day {{following}} the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in {{the dome of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel,</b> and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel,</b> but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel,</b> a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a catalytic recombiner and, controversially, by venting straight to the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{composite}} <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> {{are the most}} mature mode for storing hydrogen at very high pressure. Regardless of the many advantages of {{the composite}} <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels,</b> storage under high pressure leads {{to the use of}} thick layers of composite, and the behaviour of this type of structure is poorly mastered due to the higher impact of the process on the material-structure behaviour, and especially at the dome area. In order to model the behaviour of composite <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels,</b> in this paper a structuring model of composite <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> is proposed. The structuring model takes into account the variability and specificity of the geometry of the dome area that is considered as the most problematic part of the composite <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels.</b> We integrate in our sizing model properties such as end of helical layers, thickness evolution, winding angle evolution, voids and fibre content...|$|R

25|$|These {{reactors}} use a <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> {{to contain}} the nuclear fuel, control rods, moderator, and coolant. They are cooled and moderated by high-pressure liquid water. The hot radioactive water that leaves the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (non-radioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They are the majority of current reactors. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the VVER-1200, Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor and the European Pressurized Reactor. United States Naval reactors are of this type.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} light-water reactor (LWR) designs, {{the entire}} fissile core {{is placed in}} a large <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel.</b> The amount of heat that can be removed by a unit of a coolant {{is a function of}} the temperature; by pressurizing the core the water can be heated to much greater temperatures before boiling, thereby removing more heat and allowing the core to be smaller and more efficient. Building a <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> of the required size is a challenge.

25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel.</b> A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> to the turbine.|$|E
40|$|Graphite/epoxy {{composite}} overwrapped <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> {{are being}} considered for use on Space Station Freedom because of their light weight and high efficiency. These composite <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> weigh roughly one-third of comparable all-metal aluminum <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels,</b> and {{could result in a}} 15, 000 -lb weight saving for the propulsion and fluid management and distribution systems. These vessels must resist failures under sustained pressure loads for crew safety considerations and adequate protection of the space structure during their 30 -yr life. Weibull statistical analysis techniques have been applied, and a model developed, for predicting long-term stress-rupture behavior based on published short-term test data on composite strands and <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels.</b> Graphite/epoxy materials are calculated to have a 99. 99 -percent probability of surviving stress rupture for 30 yr under a sustained load of 50 percent ultimate failure strength. Stress-rupture lifetimes are predicted to increase as the size of the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> increases in support of the viscoelastic load-transfer mechanism proposed for stress rupture of fiber/epoxy composite materials...|$|R
