Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
25|$|For moving objects, the {{quantity}} of work/time (power) is calculated. Thus, at any instant, {{the rate of the}} work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or watts) is the scalar product of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> This scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E
500|$|The wind {{direction}} {{is a critical}} factor in VTOL manoeuvres. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The thrust vector is set to 90° and the throttle is brought up to maximum, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is trimmed until a hover state is achieved at the desired altitude. [...] The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with normal takeoff and then applying a thrust vector (less than 90°) at a runway speed below normal takeoff speed; usually the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is around [...] For lower takeoff speeds the thrust vector is greater. The reaction control system involves a thrusters at key points in the aircraft's fuselage and nose, also the wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control and correct the aircraft's pitch and roll during vertical flight.|$|E
