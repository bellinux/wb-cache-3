5000|$|Hands-on {{work began}} on the {{sculpture}} in February 2001. After documenting the statue’s initial condition, the paint was stripped away {{using a combination of}} pressure washers, propane torching, and solvent application. Once the brass surface had been cleaned, Wharton assessed the various stress cracks and gouges in the metal and determined that the damage was all relatively old, probably dating back to the shipwreck and its recovery from the sea. (Ref: Wharton 148-152.) In addition, much of the bronze disease once visible {{on the surface of the}} sculpture had been blasted away during the <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process. After it was determined that the statue was in stable condition, any holes or gaps in the metal were filled in using a pH-neutral epoxy putty, and the brass surface was misted with a benzoltriazole solution in order to prevent future corrosion. To repaint the sculpture, Wharton selected a hearty paint system that could withstand the harsh Hawaiian sun and rain, which consisted of an automotive epoxy primer (See primer (paint)), a polyurethane paint, and a polyurethane clear top coat. Special care was taken to choose the proper colors for Kamehameha’s skin tone and red and yellow feathered garments. [...] Once the treatment was complete, Wharton helped train a group of local volunteers to carry out annual maintenance on the sculpture, and to watch for and record any condition changes or damage.|$|E

40|$|Rural {{highways}} {{are typically}} undivided, have high operating speeds, carry high traffic volumes {{and are often}} designed to minimum geometric standards. Head-on and cross-over-the-centreline crashes are of the most severe crash types that occur on rural highways. They are disproportionally represented in crashes resulting in fatalities, yet undivided rural highways provide no separation between opposing traffic lanes. One possible countermeasure to these crash types is a continuous narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip.</b> Narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strips</b> are a relatively new and innovative road safety treatment aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of head-on and crossover-the-centreline crashes on undivided roads. This is achieved by increasing the separation between vehicles travelling in opposite directions and warning drivers that have strayed from their lane with noise and vibration inside the vehicle. Previous research suggests audio-tactile centreline-marking {{to be an effective}} countermeasure to these crash types however, the added benefit of combining audio-tactile line-marking with a narrow painted median has notbeen thoroughly evaluated. This research quantifies the safety benefit following installation of a 1. 0 m wide continuous <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> utilising audio-tactile line-marking on the Bruce Highway in Queensland, Australia. Data was analysed for a 56 km section of the highway before and after installation of the painted median. An Empirical Bayes statistical analysis procedure was used for evaluation due to the short period of before and after data available. This method accounts for the regression to the mean bias that is prevalent when short data collection periods are available or when sites with a higher than normal crash history are being analysed. Findings indicate significant reductions for all crash types that were analysed in this study. Head-on crashes were reduced by 75 % (SD = 7. 0 %), Run-off-road-left crashes were reduced by 59 % (SD = 14. 5 %) and Total crashes were reduced by 59 % (SD = 8. 8 %). The results of this study add to the limited body of knowledge that is published on narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strips</b> as a road safety treatment. The narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> provides significant safety benefits, by means of crash reduction, and has relatively low installation costs. These preliminary yet encouraging results give justification to the future consideration or implementation of a continuous narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> as a road safety countermeasure. ...|$|R
40|$|Paint removal is {{required}} {{in a series of}} aeronautical procedures such as maintenance and repair. Today's <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes which are based on application of chemicals and abrasion are inadequate for modem aircraft structures in addition to environmental contamination, Several alternative techniques are in progress. However, the aspect of material property degradation when developing novel, alternative <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> techniques has not been properly faced up to present. The influence of two novel <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes on the mechanical properties of the substrate 2024 T 351 aluminium alloy has been investigated. The <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes included laser radiation with excimer, CO 2, TEA-CO 2 and YAG laser sources as well as plasma etching. These processes have been applied for the removal of polyurethane coating which is a typical aeronautical paint system. The results indicated no significant degradation in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. However a significant degradation in tensile ductility and toughness is observed with the application of all <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes, the highest degradation being associated with the ultraviolet excimer laser and plasma etching. On the other hand there is a considerable extension in fatigue life, which depends on the <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process and the applied stress amplitude.

40|$|<b>Paint</b> <b>stripping</b> {{from large}} steel ships and other {{metallic}} surfa ces {{is a major}} environmental safety, cost, and operational challenge in effectively and efficiently maintaining and refurbishing large structures. Environmental concerns are greatly limiting the possible options. As a result, a hybrid system composed of a waterjet with water recycling and robotic mobile manipulators with scanning bridges has become the leading form of <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> and was constructed by various manufacturers to address this need. The application of such scanning bridges is slow and their access is constrained by the complex shape of the ship hull and various features on the surface. To overcome these limitations, a robotic system that is called UltraStrip (UltraStrip Systems, Inc., Stuart, FL) is developed. This system uses magnetic wheels to attach the stripper to the structure and travel on it while performing <b>paint</b> <b>stripping.</b> To assure efficient <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> feedback data is required to control the travel speed by monitoring the paint thickness {{before and during the}} stripping process. Efforts at JPL are currently underway to develop the required feedback capability to assure effective <b>paint</b> <b>stripping.</b> Various possible sensors were considered and issues that can affect the sensitivity, reliability and applicability of the sensors are being investigated with emphasis on measuring the initial conditions of the paint.
