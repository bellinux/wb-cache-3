5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. <b>Public</b> <b>benefits</b> were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E

Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled.

Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> for children with AIDS.

40|$|The Delaware {{legislature}} recently {{shocked the}} sustainable business and social enterprise sector. On August 1, 2013, {{amendments to the}} Delaware General Corporation Law became effective, allowing entities to incorporate as a <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation, a new hybrid corporate form that requires managers to balance shareholders’ financial interests with the besat interests of stakeholders materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and produce a <b>public</b> <b>benefit.</b> For {{a state that has}} long ruled U. S. corporate law and whose judiciary has frequently invoked shareholder primacy, the adoption of the <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation form has been hailed as a victory by sustainable business and social enterprise proponents. And yet, the significance of this victory in Delaware is premature. Information about the number and types of companies opting into the <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation form has been preliminary and speculative. This article fills that gap. In this article, I present original descriptive research on the 53 <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations that incorporated or converted in Delaware within {{the first three months of}} the amended corporate statute’s effectiveness. Based on publicly available documents and information, I analyze these first <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations with respect to the following characteristics: (1) year of incorporation as a proxy for corporate age, (2) industry, (3) charitable activities, (4) identified specific <b>public</b> <b>benefit,</b> and (5) adoption of model legislation options not required by the Delaware statute. My analysis returns the following results: 75 % of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations are likely new corporations in their early stages of operation; 32 % of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations provide professional services (e. g., consulting, legal, financial, architectural design), the technology, healthcare, and education sectors each represent 11 % of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations, 10 % of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations produce consumer retail products; approximately 40 % of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations could have alternatively incorporated as a charitable nonprofit exempt from federal income taxes.

40|$|Nonprofits {{dominate}} the charitable sector. Until recently, this statement was tautological. Charity is increasingly being conducted through for-profit entities, raising {{concerns about the}} marketization of the charitable sector. This article examines for-profit charity conducted through the <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation, a new corporate form that allows its owners to blend mission and profit in a single entity. Proponents of <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations intended it {{as an alternative to}} a for-profit corporation and largely ignored its impact on the charitable sector. While <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations are ripe for conducting charity because they can pursue dual missions, they lack the transparency and accountability mechanisms of charitable organizations. This article chronicles the supply and demand for <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations that conduct charity (i. e., “charitable <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations”) and hypothesizes the micro and macro level harms caused by them. At the micro level, the harm is fraud or “greenwashing”, i. e., deceiving unwitting stockholders, customers, or other stakeholders into investing or spending their time and money in the negligent or fraudulent enterprise. At the macro level, the more pernicious harm is that “market-based charity” injects individualistic and autocratic business values and methods into charitable work. To mitigate these harms, this article proposes that charitable <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations be required to grant or sell shares to a group of stakeholders sufficient to give such stakeholder-stockholders standing to bring a derivative suit against the <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation should it fail to pursue its charitable <b>public</b> <b>benefit.</b> These stakeholder-stockholders are akin to impact investors, or investors who value charitable returns above, or concomitantly with, financial returns. The derivative suit offers the rare stick to guard against greenwashing. More importantly, stakeholder-stockholders can (i) guide the founders and boards of a charitable <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation in pursuing charity as an ordinary business decision, and (ii) import the participatory and democratic values of the charitable sector to <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations...|$|R

Although the Supreme Court later reaffirmed United Public Workers v. Mitchell in 1973 in United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), it did so narrowly on the grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity was dangerous.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} feminization of poverty, and these factors place women {{at high risk}} of poverty. Multiple factors {{contribute}} to women’s economic insecurity, including the gender wage gap, women’s prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing <b>public</b> <b>benefits.</b> Though low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. It then lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens the cycle of poverty. As the number of women in poverty increases, the diverse causes affecting their poverty must be examined. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain <b>public</b> <b>benefits,</b> and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
