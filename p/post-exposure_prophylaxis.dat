40|$|Antibody phage display {{technology}} {{was used to}} identify human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize rabies virus (RV). A phage repertoire was constructed using antibody genes harvested from the blood of vaccinated donors. Selections using this repertoire and three different antigen formats of the RV glycoprotein (gp) resulted {{in the identification of}} 147 unique antibody fragments specific for the RV gp. Analysis of the DNA sequences of these antibodies demonstrated a large variation in the heavy- and light-chain germ-line gene usage, suggesting that a broad antibody repertoire was selected. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies were tested in vitro for RV neutralization, resulting in 39 specificities that neutralize the virus.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies of serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing and post-exposure varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) prophylaxis for the prevention of maternal varicella pneumonia during pregnancy in patients with negative or uncertain histories of varicella infection. Methods: A decision tree was constructed to compare the following strategies: 1) routine serologic testing for varicella immunity followed by targeted <b>post-exposure</b> VZIG <b>prophylaxis,</b> 2) <b>post-exposure</b> serologic testing followed by targeted VZIG prophylaxis, and 3) untargeted post-exposure VZIG administration. The probabilities for the model were obtained from the medical literature and supplemented by expert opinion. The costs were obtained by a review of inpatient hospitalizations for varicella pneumonia. All costs were converted to 1995 dollars. Results: Routine serologic testing followed by targeted <b>post-exposure</b> VZIG <b>prophylaxis</b> was the most costly strategy ($ 37. 22 /person), with no demonstrable increase in benefit compared with the other 2 strategies. The disutility of this strategy compared with the others was stable across a wide range of values for the probabilities and costs utilized in the sensitivity analysis. We were unable to differentiate between the cost-effectiveness of the other 2 strategies. Conclusions: Routine serologic testing for varicella immunity in patients with negative or uncertain histories of varicella infection should not be performed. The remaining options of screening and prophylaxis appear to be reasonable alternatives for dealing with varicella exposures. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Results: The main causes of infant morbidity were gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. Morbidity was higher with infant HIV infection (HR: 2. 61; 95 % CI: 1. 40 – 4. 85; p[*]=[*] 0. 002) and maternal plasma viral load (PVL) > 100 [*] 000 [*]copies[*]ml− 1 (HR: 1. 87; 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 3. 48; p[*]=[*] 0. 048), and lower with maternal age 100 [*] 000 [*]copies[*]ml− 1 (HR: 6. 93; 95 % CI: 1. 64 – 29. 26; p[*]=[*] 0. 008).

Reporting of GI disturbances in the single-dose group differed significantly between males and females, but this gender difference was not seen for the split-dose group. In those volunteers who experienced GI disturbances, the mean plasma tafenoquine concentrations 12 h after the last dose of tafenoquine were approximately 1. 3 -fold higher in females than in males (means ± SD: 737 ± 118 ng/ml vs. 581 ± 113 ng/ml).

40|$|Introduction: Fractures {{have been}} {{described}} mainly following falling accidents in horse-related injuries. Horse bites are uncommon accidents. We present a case of open fracture of the forearm due to horse bite. Case Report: A 35 -year-old male farm-worker presented {{to the emergency room}} with alleged history of horse bite to the right forearm about 2 hours prior to presentation while feeding the horse. There was deformity of the forearm with multiple puncture wounds, deep abrasions and small lacerations on the distal-third of the forearm. Copious irrigation with normal saline was done and he was administered anti-tetanus and <b>post-exposure</b> rabies <b>prophylaxis.</b> Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was commenced. Radiographs revealed fracture of radius and ulna in the mid-shaft region. He underwent emergency wound debridement, and the ulna was stabilised with an intra-medullary square nail. Seventy-two hours later, he underwent re-debridement and conversion osteosynthesis. He had an uneventful recovery and at three-month follow-up, the fractures had healed radiographically in anatomic alignment. At two-year follow-up, he is doing well, is pain free and has a normal range of motion compared to the contralateral side. Conclusion: Horse bites behave as compound fractures however rabies prophylaxis will be needed and careful observation is needed. Early radical debridement, preliminary skeletal stabilisation, re-debridement and conversion osteosynthesis to plate, and antibiotic prophylaxis were the key to the successful management of our patient.

DesignEpidemiological investigation identified 201 workers exposed to poultry during AI outbreaks. They were interviewed by a public health nurse regarding adherence with recommended OP, symptoms, and possible side effects. Data were collected on type of exposure, age, sex, rate of adherence with OP, and reasons for non-adherence. For eight workers, paired sera were drawn for the determination of antibodies to H 5. Data were collected on the efficiency of the distribution of oseltamivir tablets to workers in the community. ResultsHigh adherence with OP (87. 6 %) was found among poultry workers during outbreaks of AI, with no difference by type of exposure, age, or sex. There was a low rate of side effects of OP (1. 5 %). No exposed workers developed AI and none of the eight who had paired sera drawn showed seroconversion. The distribution of OP in the community was inefficient, with 27. 7 % of the tablets ‘lost’ or returned unusable. ConclusionsThese data emphasize the importance of developing efficient targeted distribution systems in the community for OP, in order to prevent human infection during AI outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Harmful gender {{norms and}} inequalities, {{including}} gender-based violence, are important structural barriers to effective HIV programming. We assess current evidence on what forms of gender-responsive intervention may enhance {{the effectiveness of}} basic HIV programmes and be cost-effective. Methods: Effective intervention models were identified from an existing evidence review (“what works for women”). Based on this, we conducted a systematic review of published and grey literature on the costs and cost-effectiveness of each intervention identified. Where possible, we compared incremental costs and effects. Results: Our effectiveness search identified 36 publications, reporting {{on the effectiveness of}} 22 HIV interventions with a gender focus. Of these, 11 types of interventions had a corresponding/comparable costing or cost-effectiveness study. The findings suggest that couple counselling for the prevention of vertical transmission; gender empowerment, community mobilization, and female condom promotion for female sex workers; expanded female condom distribution for the general population; and <b>post-exposure</b> HIV <b>prophylaxis</b> for rape survivors are cost-effective HIV interventions. Cash transfers for schoolgirls and school support for orphan girls may also be cost-effective in generalized epidemic settings. Conclusions: There has been limited research to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions that seek to address women's needs and transform harmful gender norms. Our review identified several promising, cost-effective interventions that merit consideration as critical enablers in HIV investment approaches, as well as highlight that broader gender and development interventions can have positive HIV impacts.

40|$|Abstract Background Since 1998, the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo {{has been}} torn by a {{military}} conflict. A particular atrocity of the war is widespread sexual violence. Methods In this combined retrospective analysis and prospective survey, we sought to identify hospital facilities and resources available to treat victims of sexual violence in Goma, {{the capital city of}} the North Kivu province. Results Of twenty-three acute care hospitals registered in the area of Goma, four (17 %) regularly cared for victims of sexual violence. One hospital had all resources always available to appropriately care for victims of sexual violence. From Jan 2009 until Oct 2010, 7, 048 females sought medical care because of physical or psychological sequelae from sexual violence in the four hospitals of Goma. Only half of the hospitals had physicians specialized in gynaecology or gynaecological surgery available. Similarly, anaesthetists and psychiatrists/psychologists were available in two (50 %) and one (25 %) hospital, respectively. Post-discharge care facilities, material resources, such as surgical and anaesthesiological equipment and drugs, were inconsistently available in the hospitals caring for sexually abused females. At one selected hospital, acyclovir and/or antibiotics were administered to 1, 202 sexually abused females (89. 5 %), whereas <b>post-exposure</b> HIV <b>prophylaxis</b> and surgery because of vesico-vaginal fistula was provided to only 75 (5. 6 %) and 121 (9 %) patients, respectively. Conclusions This study provides data that only few hospitals in Goma care for victims of sexual violence. In addition, these hospitals suffer from a relevant shortage of human and material resources to provide adequate care for sexually abused females. Aside from establishment of adequate protection strategies, steps must be taken to increase the availability of trained health care professionals and resources to provide adequate care for victims of sexual violence in Goma and the North Kivu province. </p...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{workers are}} at risk of sharps {{injuries}} and subsequent infection from more than 40 bloodborne pathogens or species. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) together account {{for the vast majority of}} cases. The Directive 2010 / 32 /EU “Prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector”, issued to protect workers from these risks, requires an integrated approach to prevention including awareness-raising, education, training, elimination of unnecessary needles, safe procedures for sharps use and disposal, banning of recapping, vaccination, use of personal protective equipment, provision of safety-engineered devices, and appropriate surveillance, mo-nitoring, response and follow-up. As laboratories represent a high-risk setting both in the preanalytical and analytical phase, we reviewed accidents and prevention in this setting in the light of the new legislation. Phlebotomy is the procedure carrying the highest risk of exposure and infection, involved in 30 - 50 % of HIV and HCV cases detected in nationwide systems following accidental blood exposures implemented since the 1990 s in Italy and France. In laboratories, problems in the management of sharps containers, recapping, needle disassembly by hand and blood transfer from syringes into tubes were observed and accounted for two-thirds of injuries. These accidents could be reduced through education and monitoring of behaviours, and introduction of medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms with appropriate training.
