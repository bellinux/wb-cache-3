50|$|The {{first level}} of Kohlberg’s moral {{reasoning}} is called <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality.</b> In this stage, children obey rules more externally. This means {{the children will}} conform to rules authority sets for them, to avoid punishment or to receive personal rewards. There are two stages within <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality.</b> The first is punishment and obedience orientation. In this stage, the child determines how wrong his action was according to the punishment he receives. If he does not get scolded for his bad act, he will believe he did nothing wrong. The second stage of <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality</b> is called instrumental hedonism. The main principle for this stage is “You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” A person in the second stage conforms to rules for personal gain. There is a hint of understanding the ruler’s perspective, although, the main objective is to gain the benefit in return.|$|E

The Heinz Dilemma {{involves}} Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. <b>Preconventional</b> <b>morality,</b> conventional morality, and postconventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence Kohlberg has led most of {{the studies}} based on moral {{development}} in adults. In Kohlberg’s studies, the subjects are ranked accordingly at one of the six stages. Stage 1 is called the Obedience and Punishment Orientation. Stage 1 is <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality</b> because the subject sees morality in an egocentric way. Stage 2 is also considered to be <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality</b> and is labeled as Individualism and Exchange. At this stage, the individual is still concentrated on the self and his surrounding environment. Stages 3 and 4 are at level 2, Conventional Morality. Stage 3 is called Interpersonal Relationships and is the point where the individual realizes that people should behave in good ways not only for the benefit of themselves but the family and community as well. Stage 4, Maintaining the Social Order, the individual is more concentrated on society as a whole. Stage 5 and 6 are both at level 3, post-conventional Morality. Stage 5 is the social contract and Individual Rights. At this stage people are contemplating what makes a good society rather than just what makes a society run smoothly. Stage 6, Universal Principles is the last stage which interprets the foundation of justice [...] Kohlberg completed a 20-year study and found that most 30-year-old adults were at stage 3 and 4, the conventional level. According to this study there is still room for moral development in adulthood.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence Kohlberg is a {{psychologist}} who has {{made significant contributions to}} the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development. His theory is a [...] "widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior."In Lawrence Kohlberg's view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate.According to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality,</b> conventional morality, and postconventional morality. Each of these is subdivided into two levels.|$|E
40|$|Business ethicists often {{assume that}} {{unethical}} behavior arises when individuals deviate from the norms and responsibilities that are institutionalized to frame economic activities. People's greed motivates them {{to violate the}} rules of the game. In Kohlberg’s terms, it is assumed that such actors make decisions in a preconventional way and act opportunistically. In this article, we propose an alternative interpretation of deviant behavior, arguing that such behavior does not result from a lack of conventional moral guidance but rather from the fact that characteristics attributed to <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality</b> by Kohlberg – the purely incentive and punishment driven opportunistic morality – have become the conventionalized morality. The prevailing norms that economic actors have internalized as their yardstick are those of the preconventional Homo economicus. Not the deviation from, but the compliance with {{the rules of the}} game explains many forms of harmful and illegal decisions made in corporations...|$|E
40|$|If English {{language}} teaching is to flourish and {{be successful in}} Thailand across {{a wide range of}} contexts, government support for valuable initiatives and innovations is needed. Although there have been a large number of educational innovations in the last few years, most have had little effect on the English learning of Thai students. To understand why certain innovations are promoted and why most innovations have little impact, we need to understand the thinking of the policy makers, especially at the Ministry of Education. This paper presents a critical analysis of quotations from Ministers of Education, senior education officials and others influential in Thai education from the last few years to attempt to uncover their concerns and their conceptions of education. The analysis reveals that the policy makers subscribe to the ideology of social and economic efficiency as the philosophy driving Thai education, that they promote <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality,</b> that they view ‘traditional ’ methods as necessarily detrimental, and that they believe there is a single best way of teaching. The implications of these views for the development of English language education in Thailand ar...|$|E
40|$|In {{cross-cultural}} {{research the}} validity and universality of stages of pre-conventional reasoning in Kohlberg's theory of moral development has often been taken for granted, while in developmental research a growing bulk of evidence yields indications that the theoretical assumptions under-lying <b>preconventional</b> <b>morality</b> may not be adequate to the data. In order to further clarify the problems raised by this research, data collected from Icelandic and German subjects about a Kohlberg dilemma were analysed. In order to probe the structure of stage 2 in particular, only those interview protocols were taken into account which were given stage 2 global scores in Kohlberg's Joe/Judy dilemma. Qualitative analyses of subjects ' reasoning showed {{a substantial amount of}} arguments which could not be matched to criterion judgements in the standard scoring manual. Structurally these arguments could be interpreted in terms of stage 2 reasoning. With regard to content, however, they showed genuine normative and relationship con-cerns which do not fit the individualistic and instrumental exchange notion of stage 2. The findings evidence that there may be more variety in early moral reasoning than demonstrated by published research. An action-theoretical framework is proposed in order to achieve a reformulation of preconventional moral reasoning...|$|E
