40|$|This review {{summarizes}} recent {{progress in}} water-transporting mechanisms across cell membranes. Modern biophysical concepts of water transport and new measurement strategies are evaluated. A family of water-transporting proteins (<b>water</b> <b>channels,</b> aquaporins) has been identified, consisting of small hydrophobic proteins expressed widely in epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. The functional properties, genetics, and cellular distributions of these proteins are summarized. The majority of molecular-level information about water-transporting mechanisms comes from studies on CHIP 28, a 28 -kDa glycoprotein that forms tetramers in membranes; each monomer contains six putative helical domains surrounding a central aqueous pathway and functions independently as a water-selective channel. Only mutations in the vasopressin-sensitive <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> {{have been shown}} to cause human disease (non-X-linked congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus); the physiological significance of other <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> remains unproven. One mercurial-insensitive <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> has been identified, which has the unique feature of multiple overlapping transcriptional units. Systems for expression of <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> proteins are described, including Xenopus oocytes, mammalian and insect cells, and bacteria. Further work should be directed at elucidation of the role of <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in normal physiology and disease, molecular analysis of regulatory mechanisms, and <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> structure determination at atomic resolution...|$|R

40|$|The Montauk {{peninsula}} {{is considered}} to be a recessional moraine extending from Amagansat to Montauk Point (Sirkin, 1982). The peninsula is intersected by a series of glacial melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> that have completely sealed off along the Atlantic coast and partially along the Gardiner’s Bay coastline. These former melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are marked by areas of low relief and linear coastal dunes on both the north and south coasts of the Montauk Peninsula (Black and Welch 1997). Although these former melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> have identical geological origins, they differ significantly in their present morphology. Location and Site Description Figure 1, shows the location of the melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> on the Montauk Peninsula. The westernmost melt <b>water</b> <b>channel,</b> immediately to the east of Napeague Harbor is the site of a migrating dune system. Two additional melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are present further to the east, these, however, show no evidence of a migrating dune and are characterized by linear coastal dunes fronting on both Gardiner’s bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are also present in the vicinity of Fort Pond and Lake Montauk. Fig. 1 The Migrating Dune System at Napeague is characterized by three bilobate, parabolic dunes, migrating in a southeasterly direction under the influence of the prevailing winds from the northwest. The specific geomorphology of this area has been discussed by Black (1993, 1997). The dune system at Fort Pond has been, for the most part obliterated by development in the immediate area, while the former melt <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> immediately to the east of Lake Montauk has an identical geologic setting as that at Napeague, yet consists only of linear dunes. Discussion In order to explain the presence of a migrating dune system at Napeague, and the absence of such systems elsewhere along the Montauk Peninsula, it is necessary to consider the land forms to the north of th...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) model has been constructed to predict the thermo-fluidic and optical properties of a microstructure optical fiber (MOF) accounting for changes in external temperature, input water velocity and optical fiber geometry. Modeling a water laminar flow within a <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> {{has shown that the}} steady-state temperature is dependent on the <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> radius while independent of the input velocity. There is a critical channel radius below which the steady-state temperature of the <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> is constant, while above, the temperature decreases. However, the distance required to reach steady state within the <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> is dependent on both the input velocity and the channel radius. The MOF has been found capable of supporting multiple modes. Despite the large thermo-optic coefficient of water, the bound modes’ response to temperature was dominated by the thermo-optic coefficient of glass. This is attributed to the majority of the light being confined within the glass, which increased with increasing external temperature due to a larger difference in the refractive index between the glass core and the <b>water</b> <b>channel...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT TO {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that renal tissue contains multiple distinct <b>water</b> <b>channels,</b> mRNA prepared from either cortex, medulla, or papilla of rat kidney was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The osmotic water permeability (Pf) of oocytes injected with either 50 nl of water or 50 nl of renal mRNA (1 ~,g/~l) was measured 4 d after the injection. Pf was calculated from the rate of volume increase on exposure to hyposmotic medium. Injection of each renal mRNA preparation increased the oocyte Pf. This expressed water permeability was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and had a low energy of activation, consistent with the expression of <b>water</b> <b>channels.</b> The coinjection of an antisense oligonucleotide for CHIP 28 protein, at an assumed> 100 -fold molar excess, with either cortex, medulla, or papilla mRNA reduced {{the expression of the}} water permeability by ~ 70, 100, and 30 %, respectively. Exposure of the oocyte to cAMP for 1 h resulted in a further increase in Pf only in oocytes injected with medulla mRNA. This cAMP activation was not altered by the CHIP 28 antisense oligonucleotide. These results suggest that multiple distinct <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> were expressed in oocytes injected with mRNA obtained from sections of rat kidney: (a) CHIP 28 <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in cortex and medulla, (b) cAMP-activated <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in medulla, and (c) cAMP-insensitive <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in papilla...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{of water}} across the plasma {{membrane}} {{is a fundamental}} process occurring in all living organisms. In bacteria, osmotic movement of water across the cytoplasmic membrane is needed to maintain cellular turgor; however, the molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly defined. Involvement of aquaporin <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in bacterial <b>water</b> permeability was suggested by the recent discovery of the aquaporin gene, aqpZ, in Escherichia coli. By employing cryoelectron microscopy to compare E. coli cells containing (AqpZ 1) and lacking (AqpZ 2) aquaporin, we show that the AqpZ <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> rapidly mediates large water fluxes in response to sudden changes in extracellular osmolarity.

40|$|We {{visualize}} {{the formation of}} fingered flow in dry model sandy soils under different rain conditions using a quasi- 2 D experimental setup and systematically determine {{the impact of the}} soil grain diameter and surface wetting properties on the water channeling phenomenon. The model sandy soils we use are random closely packed glass beads with varied diameters and surface treatments. For hydrophilic sandy soils, our experiments show that rain water infiltrates a shallow top layer of soil and creates a horizontal water wetting front that grows downward homogeneously until instabilities occur to form fingered flows. For hydrophobic sandy soils, in contrast, we observe that rain water ponds {{on the top of the}} soil surface until the hydraulic pressure is strong enough to overcome the capillary repellency of soil and create narrow <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> that penetrate the soil packing. Varying the raindrop impinging speed has little influence on <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> formation. However, varying the rain rate causes significant changes in the water infiltration depth, <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> width, and <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> separation. At a fixed rain condition, we combine the effects of the grain diameter and surface hydrophobicity into a single parameter and determine its influence on the water infiltration depth, <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> width, and <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> separation. We also demonstrate the efficiency of several soil water improvement methods that relate to the rain water channeling phenomenon, including prewetting sandy soils at different levels before rainfall, modifying soil surface flatness, and applying superabsorbent hydrogel particles as soil modifiers...|$|R
40|$|The <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> protein PvTIP 3; 1 (α-TIP) is {{a member}} of the major {{intrinsic}} protein (MIP) membrane channel family. We overexpressed this eukaryotic aquaporin in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and immunogold labeling of cellular cryosections showed that the protein accumulated in the plasma membrane, as well as vacuolar and other intracellular membranes. We then developed an in vivo functional assay for <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> activity that measures the change in optical absorbance of spheroplasts following an osmotic shock. Spheroplasts of wild-type P. pastoris displayed a linear relationship between absorbance and osmotic shock level. However, spheroplasts of P. pastoris expressing PvTIP 3; 1 showed a break in this linear relationship corresponding to hypo-osmotically induced lysis. It is the difference between control and transformed spheroplasts under conditions of hypo-osmotic shock that forms the basis of our aquaporin activity assay. The aquaporin inhibitor mercury chloride blocked <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> activity but had no effect on wild-type yeast. Osmotically shocked yeast cells were affected only slightly by expression of the Escherichia coli glycerol channel GlpF, which belongs to the MIP family but is a weak <b>water</b> <b>channel.</b> The important role that aquaporins play in human physiology has led to a growing interest in their potential as drug targets for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, as well as other fluid overload states.
