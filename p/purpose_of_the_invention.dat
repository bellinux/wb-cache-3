40|$|<b>The</b> present <b>invention</b> {{belongs in}} <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> {{nanotechnologies}} {{and more specifically}} regards production of new nanostructured and graphene-based materials, presenting controlled electrical, electromagnetic, and electromechanical properties. In particular, <b>the</b> present <b>invention</b> regards formulation and production of a water-based polymeric paint, which has controlled electrical or else piezoresitive or else electromagnetic properties, starting from a commercial water-based polymeric paint or else from a water-based polymeric liquid solution filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), obtained by means of exfoliation of expanded graphite. Said paint {{can be used in}} electromagnetic-shielding applications (for example, for producing radar-absorbent materials – RAMs) or else for producing antistatic devices or piezoresistive coatings for distributed monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> strain of a structure. In addition to the aforesaid electrical, piezoresistive, and electromagnetic characteristics, the coats thus obtained are light, easy to process, and suitable for being laid on any substrate. All <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> have been achieved through the process according to Claims 1 to 13. The process developed for producing said paint is simple, inexpensive, fast, and suitable for low-cost mass production. Moreover, it makes use of alcohol-water mixtures as solvent. It envisages the following steps: a) 	subjecting commercial graphite intercalation compound (GIC) to thermal expansion to obtain known structures such as TEGO, WEG, or expanded graphite (EG), or else using EG of a commercial type; b) 	dispersing and shredding said TEGO, WEG, or EG structures in water-based paint/ polymer possibly diluted with alcohol-water mixture, in variable concentrations according to the desired final properties; and c) 	subjecting the suspension to ultrasonication, wherein <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sonication cycle such as <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspension, the energy released and the duration are defined on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material that is to be obtained. The paint can be laid with multiple techniques, such as, by way of non-limiting example, spraying, dip-coating, and ink-jet. Advantageously, according to <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> it is possible to control the electrical, piezoresistive, and electromagnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating obtained with said paint through: 1. 	<b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> GNPs dispersed within the matrix; 2. 	appropriate definition and concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alcohol-water mixture used as solvent; and 3. 	control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GNPs within the paint, wherein said control is obtained through <b>the</b> sequential action <b>of</b> a mechanical rod stirrer, which has <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> shredding <b>the</b> expanded graphite in suspension, and of a sonicator with ultrasound tip, which has <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> exfoliating and dispersing the expanded graphite previously shredded...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> present <b>invention</b> {{refers to}} an {{actuator}} device and a wing-flap assembly. As it is known, the increase in lift required for the take-off and landing phases of an aircraft is mainly obtained through <b>the</b> deflection <b>of</b> a wing-flap around a hinging axis. Such a solution implies <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> robust control lines and complex actuation devices which significantly contribute to <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole wing structure. From an aerodynamic point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> local modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing profile induced by a conventional flap is limited by <b>the</b> excursion range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flap itself; for this reason only the profile curvatures compatible with <b>the</b> finite number <b>of</b> deflection angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile surface {{can be used in}} operating conditions. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present <b>invention</b> is that of providing a wing-flap assembly which allows the weights as well as the operating and maintenance costs to be reduced with respect to conventional wing-flap technology, as well as allowing an optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aerodynamic performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lift devices to be obtained. According to <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> <b>the</b> wing-flap is able to dynamically modify its own curvature (morphing flap) according to specific design requirements.
