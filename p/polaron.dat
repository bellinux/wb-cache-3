25|$|While <b>polaron</b> {{theory was}} {{originally}} developed for electrons as dressed charges in a crystal field, {{there is no}} fundamental reason held against any other charged particle which might interact with phonons. Therefore, also other charged particles such as (electron) holes and ions should generally follow the <b>polaron</b> theory.|$|E

40|$|Electronic charge {{carriers}} in ionic {{materials can}} self-trap to form large <b>polarons.</b> Interference between the ionic displacements associated with oppositely charged large <b>polarons</b> increases {{as they approach}} one another. Initially this interference produces an attractive potential that fosters their merger. However, for small enough separations this interference generates a repulsive interaction between oppositely charged large <b>polarons.</b> In suitable circumstances this repulsion can overwhelm their direct Coulomb attraction. Then the resulting net repulsion between oppositely charged large <b>polarons</b> constitutes a potential barrier which impedes their recombination. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

The energy spectra of such polaronic systems as shallow donors ("bound polarons"), e. g., the D0 and D− centres, constitute the most complete and detailed <b>polaron</b> spectroscopy realised in the literature.|$|E
25|$|A <b>polaron</b> is a {{quasiparticle}} used in {{condensed matter physics}} {{to understand}} the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The <b>polaron</b> concept was first proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.|$|E

40|$|Small-polaron {{behaviour}} in {{a two-dimensional}} honeycomb net is studied {{by applying the}} strong-coupling perturbative method to the Holstein molecular crystal model. We find that small optical <b>polarons</b> can be mobile also if the electrons are strongly coupled to the lattice. Before the <b>polarons</b> localize and become very heavy, there {{is in fact a}} window of electron-phonon couplings in which the <b>polarons</b> are small and have masses of order simeq 5 - 50 times the bare band mass according to the value of the adiabaticity parameter.

25|$|In {{biophysics}} Davydov soliton is a propagating {{along the}} protein α-helix self-trapped amide I excitation {{that is a}} solution of the Davydov Hamiltonian. The mathematical techniques {{that are used to}} analyze Davydov's soliton are similar to some that have been developed in <b>polaron</b> theory. In this context the Davydov soliton corresponds to a <b>polaron</b> that is (i) large so the continuum limit approximation in justified, (ii) acoustic because the self-localization arises from interactions with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) weakly coupled because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that the system of an {{impurity}} in a Bose–Einstein condensate {{is also a member of}} the <b>polaron</b> family.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the two- and three-dimensional ferromagnetic Kondo lattice model by unbiased Monte Carlo simulations. A phase diagram for the two-dimensional model is presented, {{in which the}} stability of magnetic order and ferromagnetic <b>polarons</b> is examined {{with respect to the}} antiferromagnetic superexchange J' and temperature. The Monte Carlo simulations reveal that J' > 0. 02 strengthens individual <b>polarons</b> while small J' 0. 01, while phase separation is only favored for very small J' < 0. 01. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that low temperatures can lead to diagonal or vertical stripes depending on J'. Simulations for three-dimensional systems yield ferromagnetic <b>polarons,</b> which form a `polaron lattice' at higher doping levels 0. 2 < x < 0. 23, when independent <b>polarons</b> do no longer fit into the system.

25|$|A new {{aspect of}} the <b>polaron</b> concept has been {{investigated}} for semiconductor nanostructures: the exciton-phonon states are not factorizable into an adiabatic product Ansatz, so that a non-adiabatic treatment is needed. The non-adiabaticity of the exciton-phonon systems leads to a strong enhancement of the phonon-assisted transition probabilities (as compared to those treated adiabatically) and to multiphonon optical spectra that are considerably different from the Franck-Condon progression even for small values of the electron-phonon coupling constant {{as is the case}} for typical semiconductor nanostructures.|$|E
25|$|From the {{perspective}} of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave {{and one of the}} three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves. The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonon, <b>polaron,</b> magnon) or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those quasiparticle types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a Brillouin shift in frequency, is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed quasiparticle. Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types ('quasiparticles'). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term <b>polaron.</b>|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{results for}} a three [...] dimensional, semi [...] classical, tight [...] binding model for DNA {{show that there}} are two types of <b>polarons,</b> named radial and twist <b>polarons,</b> that can {{transport}} charge along the DNA molecule. However, the existence of two types of base pairs in real DNA, makes it crucial to find out if charge transport also exist in DNA chains with different base pairs. In this paper we address this problem in its simple case, an homogeneous chain except for a single different base pair, what we call a base-pair inhomogeneity, and its effect on charge transport. Radial <b>polarons</b> experience either reflection or trapping. However, twist <b>polarons</b> are good candidates for charge transport along real DNA.
