30|$|The {{spread of}} the SM to new areas is {{possible}} by transportation of eggs or larvae in forest products and timber or nursery stock (EPPO [2005]). The moths are also strong flyers and may fly up to 100  km per year (Rozhkov [1963]). To prevent {{the introduction of the}} moth, it is recommended that plants and branches should be free from soil, originate from a <b>pest-free</b> <b>area</b> or be fumigated or be imported during winter. Wood should be debarked, heat-treated, originate from <b>pest-free</b> <b>area</b> or be imported during winter (EPPO [2005]).|$|E
40|$|Pest-free status {{certification}} {{is desirable}} if the demand-side impacts (increased export revenue) and supply-side impacts (lower pest damage and decreased ongoing control costs) exceed the compliance monitoring and eradication costs. Thus, eradication may be optimal without certification. Certification {{is more likely}} for regions facing costly treatment requirements (bans) or possessing geographic traits that lower monitoring costs and infestation probabilities than for those exporting higher-valued products. Certification benefits producers but hurts consumers. Thus, political feasibility may be greater if domestic consumption is a small {{share of the market}} and if the additional tax burden of certification programs is light. exotic pests, invasive species, <b>pest-free</b> <b>area,</b> eradication, sanitary/phytosanitary regulations, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{pressure}} {{to reduce the}} use of pre and post-harvest treatment chemicals to control insect pests has led to calls for alternative control methods. As a result, the implementation of area-wide management of pests could be developed as either an alternative to chemicals or {{as a means of}} reducing pesticide use. However, maintaining an area-wide management programme can be expensive as it requires the execution of surveillance activities, exclusion measures and contingency plans for a rapid eradication response {{in the case of a}} pest outbreak. A sound benefit-cost analysis is an essential starting point to measure gains from research and development into improved methods of surveillance and exclusion. This paper presents a study of the costs of surveillance measures. We applied our model to the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ) in South Eastern Australia.

30|$|However, {{all stages}} {{of the life cycle}} of SM can be transported in {{seedlings}} and other planting stock, branches, and Christmas trees (Orlinski [2000]). According to the regulations recommended by OEPP/EPPO ([1994]), such materials should be free from soil, come from <b>pest-free</b> <b>areas,</b> be produced in protected buildings or fumigated, or be imported during winter. However, import of plants for planting or cut branches from Siberia to Europe is probably rare.|$|R
40|$|New Zealand- and Chilean-grown kiwifruit are {{economically}} important export {{crops to}} Asia, Europe and the USA. As kiwifruit may harbour quarantine pests (e. g. armoured scale insects, mealybugs and thrips), internationally accepted procedures must {{be applied to}} prevent their spread into <b>pest-free</b> <b>areas.</b> Treatment with methyl bromide is a common quarantine treatment. In recent years, pure phosphine has been suggested as a methyl bromide replacement for perishable fruit products (Horn and Horn 2004, Klementz et al. 2005, Brash et al. 2009). In a research collaboration between New Zealand and Germany, ZESPRI® GREEN and ZESPRI ® GOLD Kiwifruit were fumigated with phosphine and residues were measured during subsequent storage. ZESPRI ® GREEN and ZESPRI ® GOLD Kiwifruit were shipped from New Zealand to Germany and fumigated with phosphine (3. 5 mg/L = 2500 ppm vol.) in a 0. 5 m 3 chamber in the Berlin Laboratory for 4 days at 15 °C. Residues were determined by the head space method following the principles of Nowicki (1978). ZESPRI ® GREEN Kiwifruit built up higher residues (about twice those of ZESPRI ® GOLD Kiwifruit) and released them more slowly. In both cases, the residues of phosphine did not exceed the European Minimum Residue Limit for fruits of 50 µg phosphine/kg after a waiting period of less than 12 h (Figure 1). The gas chromatographic analytical method (GC/MS) for detecting the residue was validated by alternatively determining the unforced spontaneous desorption of phosphine from fumigated fruit in closed vessels (Noack et al. 1983). Results suggest that phosphine could be a suitable replacement for methyl bromide for quarantine treatment of kiwifruit. Acknowledgement...|$|R
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Strawberry crinkle virus (SCV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. This virus is widely distributed {{both within and outside}} Europe and the same applies to its main vector, the strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. At-risk hosts (Fragaria spp.) occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely with high uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated as very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is moderately likely, with high uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely, with medium uncertainty. The potential consequences are rated as minimal to minor with medium uncertainty. Prohibition and restricting import or intra-EU trade to certified materials or to materials originating from <b>pest-free</b> <b>areas</b> or <b>pest-free</b> places of production are the options with highest effectiveness against the risks of introduction or against the risks of further spread. Prohibition and certification are also among the options of high or very high feasibility. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} the combination of options (cultural practices, certification, exclusion conditions, tolerant varieties) has an overall high to very high level of effectiveness and feasibility. The current legislation has few weaknesses: the reliance on visual inspection, as well as the exceptions or derogations offered to some countries in which SCV is present. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its widely adopted certification activity, which seems unlikely given the potential consequence...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{informed}} by more-than-human and biosecurity literatures, I attend a neglected nonhuman considered a serious agricultural pest: the fruit fly. In addressing {{what it takes}} to live without fruit flies, biosecurity is theorised as ongoing, enacted achievement sustained (or not) by everyday and eventful interactions of heterogeneous spaces, strategies, and participants-human and nonhuman. Relations of fruits, flies, and people are explored through one vital attempt to biosecure life: Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ), a tristate <b>pest-free</b> <b>area</b> established to protect commercial horticulture from the fruit fly. Fruit flies become problematised as their appetites and mobilities confound fruit production and marketing, and affiliated biosecurity controls. Making fruit safe enrolls policy and agricultural sectors, but also more dispersed agents (travellers, residents, trees) and management sites (primarily off-farm). Since its introduction, the FFEZ 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing biosecuring normalised, with only occasional outbreak events. However, recent unprecedented outbreaks evoke questions about the FFEZ 2 ̆ 7 s future status. In such eventful times, it is worth reflecting on what kinds of living are possible in biosecurity zones-for flies, for resident human communities, and for agrifood networks...|$|E
30|$|Most of {{the timber}} {{imported}} from Russia to Europe originates from {{west of the}} Urals, where the SM is not yet present. Coniferous timber from Siberia is mostly larch and Siberian pine, which are imported without bark or as sawn wood. The adult moths fly in July and live for about three weeks, and it is theoretically possible {{that they could be}} carried in timber to Europe (EPPO [2005]). The egg stage lasts usually for two to three weeks in July-August, and eggs may be laid on bark during the outbreaks. However, it is unlikely that SM eggs are found in sawn timber. The larvae need foliage for food to survive during the transportation. The pupal stage lasts for about three weeks at the end of next June, and the cocoons are usually placed on branches. In addition, majority of the timber is harvested in winter when the SM is overwintering at the larval stage in forest litter. According to the phytosanitary regulations recommended by OEPP/EPPO ([1994]), imported wood should be debarked or heat-treated, or it should originate from a <b>pest-free</b> <b>area</b> or be imported during winter. Since the entrance of the SM to Europe in timber and wood products is easy to control, it is unlikely that SM could spread to Europe as a result of timber trade.|$|E
40|$|Increasing volumes {{and speed}} of {{agricultural}} trade {{and the opening of}} new markets for agricultural products create greater challenges to systems established to protect countries from invasive organisms that can be harmful to human and animal health, crops and natural environments. In reaction to the threat of exotic pests and diseases, the World Trade Organization recognises the right of country members to protect themselves from the risks posed by exotic pests and diseases through the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures. One possible response from exporting countries facing SPS trade barriers is to obtain <b>pest-free</b> <b>area</b> (PFA) certification. While large benefits can potentially be achieved from greater access to world markets through the establishment and maintenance of a PFA, certification can be expensive. This paper aims to identify a theoretical framework on which to base the cost benefit analysis and the costs and benefits to be measured, from which a methodology for measuring costs and benefits may be developed. The literature relevant to analysing PFAs reveals that cost benefit analysis of the establishment of PFAs incorporate complex links between the economic aspects of this type of pest management and the biological characteristics of the pest or disease targeted and its environment.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV), Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) and Tomato black ring virus (TBRV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. These viruses are largely restricted to Europe and their vector nematodes and at-risk hosts occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely for ArMV and as very unlikely to unlikely for RpRSV, SLRSV and TBRV. These ratings have moderate uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is likely, with low to medium uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely to moderately likely, with high uncertainty. Potential impact is rated minimal to minor in all hosts, {{with the exception of}} ArMV in grapevine, for which it is minor to moderate. These ratings have medium or high uncertainty. The current legislation addresses only two of the many host species of these viruses, but other weaknesses were also identified. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its voluntary certification activity. Prohibition and the use of phytosanitary certificates, if covering the complete host ranges of the viruses and relying on appropriate tests, are the options with highest effectiveness against the risk of introduction whereas certification schemes and <b>pest-free</b> <b>areas</b> or production sites are those with the highest effectiveness against the spread and impact risks. All options have limitations in feasibility, with uncertainty ratings from moderate to high. The combination of partially effective options may be highly effective in some crop...|$|R
40|$|Tomato {{plants have}} their leaves, {{petioles}} and stems covered with glandular trichomes that protect the plant against two-spotted spider mites {{and many other}} herbivorous arthropods, but also hinder searching by phytoseiid mites and other natural enemies of these herbivores. This trichome cover creates competitor-free and enemy-free space for the tomato russet mite (TRM) Aculops lycopersici (Acari: Eriophyidae), being so minute that it can seek refuge and feed inbetween the glandular trichomes on tomato cultivars currently used in practice. Indeed, several species of predatory mites tested for biological control of TRM {{have been reported to}} feed and reproduce when offered TRM as prey in laboratory experiments, yet in practice these predator species appeared to be unable to prevent TRM outbreaks. Using the phytoseiid mite, Amblydromalus limonicus, we found exactly the same, but also obtained evidence for successful establishment of a population of this predatory mite on whole plants that had been previously infested with TRM. This successful establishment may be explained by our observation that the defensive barrier of glandular plant trichomes is literally dropped some time after TRM infestation of the tomato plants: the glandular trichome heads first rapidly develop a brownish discoloration after which they dry out and fall over onto the plant surface. Wherever TRM triggered this response, predatory mites were able to successfully establish a population. Nevertheless, biological control was still unsuccessful because trichome deterioration in TRM-infested areas takes a couple of days to take effect and because it is not a systemic response in the plant, thereby enabling TRM to seek temporary refuge from predation in <b>pest-free</b> trichome-dense <b>areas</b> which continue to be formed while the plant grows. We formulate a hypothesis unifying these observations into one framework with an explicit set of assumptions and predictions to be tested in future experiments...|$|R
40|$|Potato brown rot, {{caused by}} Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 (Phylovar II, sequevar 1), {{is a serious}} endemic disease in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It is a {{quarantine}} disease in the EU, and export of potatoes from Egypt is restricted to <b>pest-free</b> <b>areas</b> in the desert. This thesis is directed at survival and eradication of the pathogen in areas that may become contaminated and at brown rot control in infested areas. R. solanacearum survival and disease suppression were studied for soils differing in origin (Dutch versus Egyptian soils), type (san d versus clay), and management (organic versus conventional). Effects of amendment of conventional soils with NPK and organic soils with compost or cow manure were compared with non-amended controls. The pathogen survived longer in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, and in clay than in san dy soils from both countries. Survival was never longer than 180 days {{and in many cases}} much shorter, especially in Egyptian san dy soil. Organic management reduced pathogen survival in Egyptian soils, especially in the san dy soil, but not in Dutch soils. Pathogen survival was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, negatively with organic matter (OM) content at similar DOC content, and negatively with bacterial diversity estimated from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of eubacterial 16 S rDNA extracted from soil. NPK ferti li zation and cow manure amendment reduced pathogen survival in most soils while compost was not effective. There was a clear shift in microbial community after manure amendment, a weak shift by compost amendment, and no shift after NPK ferti li zation. Disease development was highest in Dutch san dy soils and similar in all other soil types. It was positively correlated with DOC (substrate availabi li ty), and negatively with K and Ca contents in soil, which may increase plant resistance. The disease was s li ghtly suppressed in organic compared to conventional san dy soils from Egypt while organic management increased disease incidence in all Dutch soils. This was related to a high DOC content in organic Dutch soils. There were no differences in bacterial diversity and composition in different rhizosphere soils, and no correlations between disease development and bacterial diversity. Manure ferti li zation suppressed brown rot in most soils with a clear shift in rhizospere bacterial community. Stenotrophomonas maltophi li a, isolated from the rhizosphere of eggplant in the Egyptian Delta, was antagonistic to R. solanacearum in vitro; its antagonistic activity was not Fe-siderophore dependent. A selected S. maltophi li a strain survived longer and reduced R. solanacearum survival more in Egyptian than in Dutch clay soils, and suppressed potato brown rot in Egyptian soil (by at least 36 %) but not in Dutch soil. Survival and suppressive activity of S. maltophi li a were positively correlated with OM, which was highest in Egyptian organic clay soil. The effect of biological soil disinfestation (BSD) was tested in glass vessels, microplots, and in an accidentally infested commercial field. BSD is based on production of toxic organic acids through anaerobic digestion of fresh organic matter. BSD was accomp li shed by incorporating grass or potato haulms in soil and covering the soil with airtight plastic. Survival of R. solanacearum in soil and potato tubers was significantly reduced in the BSD treatment (> 93 %), and not in separate g rass amendment -or plastic cover treatments. This thesis may contribute to regulatory decisions in the EU concerning the time required for keeping accidentally infested fields out of potato production and to recommendations for management of potato brown rot in areas where the disease is endemic...|$|R
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{requested}} the Panel on Plant Health (PLH Panel) to provide guidance {{for the evaluation}} of the effectiveness of the options for plants and plant products for reducing the risk of introduction and spread of harmful organisms in the European Union territory. Two operational tools are presented: a checklist for evaluating a proposed risk reduction option (RRO) and a database of references corresponding to published guidance documents or experimental assessments of RROs. The checklist can be used by the Panel or the dossier-submitting parties to verify whether all required information is provided in support of a RRO, to quickly describe information supplied to EFSA and to identify major gaps in the data. Four types of RRO assessments are distinguished in the proposed checklist according to their purposes and characteristics: experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under laboratory/controlled conditions; experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under operational conditions; analysis of the applicability of the RRO; and assessment of the effectiveness of the option {{to reduce the risk of}} pest entry from an infested area to a <b>pest-free</b> <b>area.</b> The database of references is intended to assist the Panel in (i) identifying potential RROs for a given pest and plant material, and (ii) quickly retrieving relevant experimental data and guidance documents for assessing a proposed RRO. In addition, the current document provides recommendations for assessing RROs, specifically: on experimental design; on the use of statistical methods including approaches for studying uncertainty; on the use of quantitative pathway analysis and spread models describing their advantages and limitations; and on recommendations for general surveillance and specific surveys...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment and {{an evaluation of}} risk reduction options for Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa has been detected in olive in the EU with a distribution restricted to the region of Apulia in Italy and is under official control. X. fastidiosa has a very broad host range, including many common cultivated and wild plants. All xylem fluid-feeding insects in Europe {{are considered to be}} potential vectors. Philaenus spumarius (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae), a polyphagous spittlebug widespread in the whole risk assessment area, has been identified as a vector in Apulia. The probability of entry of X. fastidiosa from countries where X. fastidiosa is reported is very high with plants for planting and moderate with infectious insect vectors carried with plant commodities or travelling as stowaways. Establishment and spread in the EU is very likely. The consequences are considered to be major because yield losses and other damage would be high and require costly control measures. The systematic use of insecticides for vector control may create environmental impacts. With regard to risk reduction options, strategies for the prevention of introduction and for the containment of outbreaks should focus on the two main pathways (plants for planting and infectious insect vectors) and combine the most effective options in an integrated approach. For plants for planting, these could be <b>pest-free</b> production <b>areas,</b> surveillance, certification, screened greenhouse production, vector control and testing for infection and, for some plant species, treatments (e. g. thermotherapy). To prevent entry of the infectious vectors, insecticide treatments and inspection of consignments and production sites are required. The Panel has also reviewed the effectiveness of risk reduction options for X. fastidiosa and its vectors listed in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and in the EU emergency measures. The Panel recommends the continuation and intensification of research on the host range, epidemiology and control of the Apulian outbreak...|$|R
