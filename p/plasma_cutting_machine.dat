50|$|In 1986, {{inverters}} {{were used}} {{for the first time as}} power sources for welding and plasma cutting, and a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> for underwater cutting was introduced. At that time, the company had 1064 employees.|$|E
50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC <b>Plasma</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>machine</b> can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost. The angular cutting capability of 3 Dimensional plasma cutting {{can also be used to}} create countersunk holes and chamfer edges of profiled holes.|$|E

40|$|Background & Objectives : Cutting {{leads to}} {{production}} of different hazardous agents such as fumes, particles, gases and vapors. In various studies, {{the effects of}} fumes, gases, and vapors on workers and environment have been proved. Meanwhile, cutting alloying plates with <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> due to containing various alloy materials produces a lot of air pollution. Therefore, using the ventilation system to remove the mentioned pollution has always been noteworthy. Method: This study was performed on <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> at Mobarakeh Steel Company. At first, according to ASTM the elements from alloy plates with optical emission spectrometry crm- 35000 -quantometery were detected, the air pollution from cutting the mentioned plates was sampled and measured using NIOSH 7300 method {{and according to the}} ACGIH:VS- 72 - 20, VS- 70 - 12, VS- 70 - 11 VS- 916 push-pull ventilation with bag filter collector was designed. Results: Results of sampling from pollution of cutting the alloy material, concentration of iron, lead and cadmium fumes were more than the standard limits. After calculation for push system, air flow volume of 195. 163 cfm, outgoing air velocity of 5937. 4 fpm and for pull system air flow volume of 12498 cfm, minimum duct velocity of 3000 fpm and velocity pressure of duct of 0. 717 inwg, for fan, total pressure of 6. 301 inwg, static pressure of 0. 587 inwg and power of 20. 65 Bhp and for collector with pulse jet cleaning system air to cloth ratio of 7 and dimensions of 6. 88 ft × 6. 56 ft × 9. 84 ft were obtained.

40|$|Abstract—Industrial surveys {{shows that}} {{manufacturing}} companies define {{the qualities of}} thermal removing process based on the dimension and physical appearance of the cutting material surface. Therefore, the roughness of the surface area of the material cut by the <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> process {{and the rate of}} the removed material by the manual <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was importantly considered. Plasma arc cutter Selco Genesis 90 was used to cut Standard AISI 1017 Steel of 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm manually based on the selected parameters setting. The material removal rate (MRR) was measured by determining the weight of the specimens before and after the cutting process. The surface roughness (SR) analysis was conducted using Mitutoyo CS- 3100 to determine the average roughness value (Ra). Taguchi method was utilized to achieve optimum condition for both outputs studied. The microstructure analysis in the region of the cutting surface is performed using SEM. The results reveal that the SR values are inversely proportional to the MRR values. The quality of the surface roughness depends on the dross peak that occurred after the cutting process.

40|$|The thesis {{was written}} during an {{internship}} at ProCom GmbH in Aachen, Germany. It {{is a project}} with the goal to upgrade their already existing three linear axis test bench with two additional rotary axes. The task is to either find an already existing solution or to design, manufacture and install a rotary head on the test bench. The test bench is used to simulate water jet, laser and <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> and is designed for internal use by ProCom. It is used to test new developed algorithms of their CNC software but also to test newly developed hardware before it is introduced to the market. The test bench has its axis driven by electrical motors and the additional two rotary axes would also be controlled the same way. The test bench is operated without any process force which means that only its own weight {{will have to be}} taken into consideration. The background to this requirement of an extra two axis is that customers are starting to demand a five axis control system for their machines and therefore it must be possible to test and verify the software in a realistic environment. This degree thesis is mostly done with design characteristics and concern from the very start with pre studies, explanation of the machine to {{the very end of the}} project with a mounted rotary head. Amoung the proposed rotary heads from the pre-studies, two rotary heads were chosen to go further with to be developed, manufactred and installed.

The objective to devise a Computer controlled Oxy-Fuel profile <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> arose from the increasing demand for metal cutting with respect to edge quality, circularity and lesser formation of redeposit material. The System has an 8 bit micro controller based embedded system, which assures stipulated time response. A new window based Application software was devised which takes a standard CAD file. DXF as input and converts it into numerical data required for the controller. It uses VB 6 as a front end whereas MS-ACCESS and AutoCAD as back end.
