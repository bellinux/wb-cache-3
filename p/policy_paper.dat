5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a <b>policy</b> <b>paper</b> that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|It is the government’s {{policy to}} fully recover costs for {{water supply and}} {{sanitation}} through user fees, and that water tariffs should be volumetric. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (until 2008 the Ministry of Construction) oversees financing for urban water and sanitation infrastructure as well as policies concerning the regulation of water and sanitation utilities. Some important policy papers it has issued are “Accelerating the Marketization of Public Utilities” (No.272 <b>Policy</b> <b>Paper</b> of the MOC, 2002), the “Measure on Public Utilities Concession Management” (No.126 <b>Policy</b> <b>Paper</b> of the MOC, 2004), and the “Opinions on Strengthening Regulation of Public Utilities” (No.154 <b>Policy</b> <b>Paper</b> of the MOC, 2005). However, there is no law concerning the regulation of public utilities or private sector participation in the sector. The Ministry of Health has attributions related to the promotion of rural {{water supply and sanitation}}.|$|E

25|$|In May 1939 the British {{government}} {{released a}} new <b>policy</b> <b>paper</b> {{which sought to}} implement a one-state solution in Palestine, significantly {{reduced the number of}} Jewish immigrants allowed to enter Palestine by establishing a quota for Jewish immigration which was set by the British government in the short-term and which would be set by the Arab leadership in the long-term. The quota also placed restrictions on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs, in an attempt to limit the socio-political damage. These restrictions remained {{until the end of the}} mandate period, a period which occurred in parallel with World War II and the Holocaust, during which many Jewish refugees tried to escape from Europe. As a result, during the 1930s and 1940s the leadership of the Yishuv arranged a couple of illegal immigration waves of Jews to the British Mandate of Palestine (see also Aliyah Bet), which caused even more tensions in the region.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Ministry of Construction {{issued a}} <b>policy</b> <b>paper</b> on {{the commercialization of}} public utilities. Subsequently, in October 2003, the central {{government}} decided that state-owned enterprises had {{to be separated from}} Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized. Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition to a market economy. In the 1990s, the first BOT contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning from the experience of past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender. In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project (Chengdu No. 6 Water Supply Plant) was awarded on the basis of transparent international competitive bidding, with support from the ADB. In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm Veolia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Health <b>policy</b> <b>papers</b> {{disseminate}} {{recommendations and}} {{guidelines for the}} development and implementation of health promotion interventions. Such documents have rarely been investigated with regard to their assumed mechanisms of action for changing behaviour. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Behaviour Change Techniques (BCT) Taxonomy have been used to code behaviour change intervention descriptions, but to our knowledge such “retrofitting” of <b>policy</b> <b>papers</b> has not previously been reported. This study aims first to identify targets, mediators, and change strategies for physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviour change in Finnish <b>policy</b> <b>papers</b> on workplace health promotion, and second to assess the suitability of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) approach for this purpose. Method We searched all national-level health <b>policy</b> <b>papers</b> effectual in Finland in August 2016 focusing on the promotion of PA and/or healthy nutrition in the workplace context (n =  6). Policy recommendations targeting employees’ nutrition and PA including sedentary behaviour (SB) were coded using BCW, TDF, and BCT Taxonomy. Results A total of 125 recommendations were coded in the six <b>policy</b> <b>papers,</b> and in two additional documents referenced by them. Psychological capability, physical opportunity, and social opportunity were frequently identified (22 %, 31 %, and 24 %, respectively), whereas physical capability was almost completely absent (1 %). Three TDF domains (knowledge, skills, and social influence) were observed in all papers. Multiple intervention functions and BCTs were identified in all papers but several recommendations were too vague to be coded reliably. Influencing individuals (46 %) and changing the physical environment (44 %) were recommended more frequently than influencing the social environment (10 %). Conclusions The BCW approach appeared to be useful for analysing the content of health <b>policy</b> <b>papers.</b> Paying more attention to underlying assumptions regarding behavioural change processes may help to identify neglected aspects in current policy, and to develop interventions based on recommendations, thus helping to increase the impact of <b>policy</b> <b>papers...</b>|$|R
