25|$|Chard {{realised}} {{that the}} north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, he pulled his men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> were grabbed at by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal William Wilson Allen and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams, Alfred Henry Hook, Robert Jones, and William Jones.|$|E
25|$|Pocahontas is {{most famously}} {{linked to the}} English colonist Captain John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with a hundred other {{settlers}} in April 1607, {{at the behest of}} the London Company. After building a fort on a marshy peninsula <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> into the James River, the Englishmen had numerous encounters over the next several months with the Natives of Tsenacommacah, some of them friendly, some hostile. Then, in December 1607, while exploring on the Chickahominy River, Smith was captured by a hunting party led by Powhatan's younger brother (or close relative) Opechancanough and brought to Powhatan's capital at Werowocomoco. In his 1608 account, Smith describes a great feast followed by a long talk with Powhatan. He does not mention Pocahontas in relation to his capture, and claims that they first met some months later.|$|E
25|$|With {{favourable}} {{weather and}} winds, Arun (who is coughing up blood) decides {{to resume the}} climb. Aakash remains at Camp 4 since there is insufficient oxygen for six climbers, and teaches Chand to use the camera. When the climbers reach the Balcony, a dangerous storm hits. Although Sameer Khanna tells the climbers to stay in one place, Arjun leaves for the south summit without telling anyone. Anjali notices that Arjun is missing; Arun tells Anjali and Tashi to go one way while he and Chand go the other. Arjun, who wanted to climb Everest without oxygen, passes out and is buried by snow. After a two-hour search, Arun and Chand tell Tashi and Anjali to stop; Arjun is probably dead. Searching a bit longer, Anjali and Tashi find Arjun's water bottle and his hand <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> of the snow. They dig him out; Arun and Chand join them, but Arjun refuses water and oxygen. Anjali calls Reena, a BNTV reporter in Everest base camp and Arjun's former lover. After Reena talks to him, Arjun accepts oxygen. When he tells mission sponsor Ramesh Roongta {{that he will not}} continue, Ramesh fears damage to his reputation and is furious. Aakash arrives from Camp 4 with three oxygen cylinders.|$|E

Pounderling was {{challenged}} again in another tournament by the Welshman, but declined - he didn't want the other eye <b>poked</b> <b>out!</b> ...|$|R

500|$|NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as NADH {{dehydrogenase}} or complex I, is the first protein in the electron transport chain. Complex I is a giant enzyme with the mammalian complex I having 46 subunits and a molecular mass of about 1,000 kilodaltons (kDa). The structure is known in detail only from a bacterium; in most organisms the complex resembles a boot with a large [...] "ball" [...] <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> from the membrane into the mitochondrion. The genes that encode the individual proteins are contained in both the cell nucleus and the mitochondrial genome, {{as is the case}} for many enzymes present in the mitochondrion.|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Orpheus's head is {{attached}} to a scarecrow body. [...] According to Matthew Chamberlain, the actor who portrayed Orpheus, he was told to jump on a horse while wearing the scarecrow costume. [...] Chamberlain said he [...] "just gave the horse a quick pat before hopping on" [...] but found himself [...] "getting tugged the other way as the horse was munching away on the straw <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> of the end of my sleeve!" [...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, because if they looked at it while it responded, they would laugh and break character.|$|E
500|$|Peter, truly {{believing the}} anti-sex {{propaganda}} Meg brings home, starts wearing a chastity belt {{and refuses to}} have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in [...] "ear sex" [...] (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex [...] "in the eyes of the Lord." [...] This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only {{as long as it is}} practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with Cleveland <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> the window and saying the line [...] "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".|$|E

2500|$|Development {{has been}} a passionate issue for Bay Ridge residents. In the 1990s and 2000s, many decades-old two-family houses were {{demolished}} and replaced by condominiums known colloquially as [...] "Fedder Homes," [...] after the branded air conditioners <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> from the buildings' facades. In 2005, local community leaders and community activists from {{across the political spectrum}} united to issue rezoning laws.|$|E
2500|$|Cathedrals are {{decorated}} {{with a wide variety}} of creatures and characters, many of which have no obvious link to Christianity. [...] Often the creature was seen to represent some particular vice or virtue or was believed to have a certain characteristic which could serve as a warning or as an example to the Christian believer. [...] "Sins of the Flesh" [...] were often represented by human figures <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> their tongues, stroking their beards, displaying their genitals or gorging on food.|$|E
2500|$|Gunston's {{personal}} appearance satirised club performers and TV interviewers {{of the time}} — for the studio segments he wore an ill-fitting blue lurex tuxedo jacket (wrongly buttoned) and the fly on his (too short) trousers was habitually left undone, with the shirt-tail <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> through the zip. Gunston also adopted a deliberately bad comb over hairstyle to partially cover his balding head. One of his visual trademarks was the small pieces of tissue paper applied to his pasty white face to cover supposed shaving cuts. This comic device led to his [...] memorable exchange with visiting American actress Sally Struthers – noting Norman's apparent shaving cuts, she kindly suggested that perhaps Gunston should use an electric razor; the nonplussed Norman replied [...] "Uh, I do", at which point Struthers collapsed {{in a fit of}} laughter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{description}} of the Panche is different in Epítome than the Muisca; the Panche are described as a much more war-like people, their rugged terrain worse for the cavalry and the style of warfare different. While the Muisca [...] "fought" [...] using screams and shouting, the Panche are described as fighting silently with slingshots, poisoned arrows and large heavy poles made of palm trees (macanas) swinging them with both hands to hit their enemies. The practice, later described from the Muisca as well, of tieing mummies on their backs is reported from the Panche. The habit is described as showing {{what will happen to}} their opponents; fighting like they fought and to instigate fear in the enemy. Of the Panche is described that when they won their battles, they celebrated their victory with festivities, took the children of their enemies to sacrifice them, captured the women and killed the men by <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> the eyes of the combat leaders. The combat of the Panche is described as fiercer as of the Muisca and the combatants walked naked. They had tubes made of animal skins where they held the lances and bow and arrows to shoot. The Panche warriors are described as eating the flesh of their enemies at the battlefield or later at home with their wives and children. The process of treaties is described as performed not by the men, but by the women, as [...] "they cannot be refused".|$|E

The Skye so slow and deliberate, looking up at you like some old gentleman in the club, as much as to say, 'You don't really mean it, do you?' and the Schipperke as quick as a knife. I liked the Skye best, I must confess. There was something pathetic about him." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had looked}} at the eggs {{at least a hundred}} and fifty times, when, to her joy, she saw a tiny crack on two of them, and {{scrambling}} back to the nest she drew the eggs closer the one to the other, and never moved for the whole of that day. Next morning she was rewarded by noticing cracks in the whole five eggs, and by midday two little yellow heads were <b>poking</b> <b>out</b> from the shells. This encouraged her so much that, after breaking the shells with her bill, so that the little creatures could get free of them, she sat steadily for a whole night upon the nest, and before the sun arose the five white eggs were empty, and ten pairs of eyes were gazing out upon the green world.|$|E
