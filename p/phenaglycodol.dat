50|$|An {{unsymmetrical}} pinacol {{coupling reaction}} between para-chloro-acetophenone and acetone {{was employed to}} give <b>phenaglycodol</b> in a 40% yield.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenaglycodol</b> (INN, BAN; {{brand names}} Acalmid, Acalo, Alterton, Atadiol, Felixyn, Neotran, Pausital, Remin, Sedapsin, Sinforil, Stesil, Ultran) {{is a drug}} {{described}} as a tranquilizer or sedative which has anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. It is related structurally and pharmacologically to meprobamate, {{though it is not}} a carbamate.|$|E
5000|$|... p-Chloroacetophenone and NaCN are reacted {{together}} {{to give the}} corresponding cyanohydrin (cf Strecker synthesis). The cyano group is then hydrated in acid to the corresponding amide, thus p-chloroatrolactamide (4) is formed. The amide group is then further hydrolyzed with a 2nd equivalent of water in concentrated lye to p-chloroatrolactic acid (5); this is then esterified to Ethyl p-chloroatrolactate (6). Finally, nucleophilic addition a couple of equivalents of MeMgI {{are added to the}} ester give <b>Phenaglycodol</b> (7) crystals.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{treated with}} phenobarbitone, <b>phenaglycodol,</b> glutethimide, nikethamide, meprobamate, chlorbutol and {{chlorpromazine}} showed an increased metabolism of pentobarbitone and, {{at the same}} time, a diminished sleeping-time after pentobarbitone. This effect developed 24 hr after treatment, the maximum increase in metabolism occurring after about 48 hr. The increased pentobarbitone metabolism was inhibited by ethionine injected shortly before treatment. Using a liver slice preparation, increased pentobarbitone metabolism was also observed in vitro. These results are {{in accord with the}} view that the capacity of compounds to increase pentobarbitone metabolism may be related to their ability to act directly on microsomal enzyme systems...|$|E
