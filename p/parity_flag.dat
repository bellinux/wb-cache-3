50|$|For example, {{assume a}} machine where a set <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> {{indicates}} even parity. If {{the result of}} the last operation were 26 (11010 in binary), the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> would be 0 since the number of set bits is odd. Similarly, if the result were 10 (1010 in binary) then the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> would be 1.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> {{is usually}} used in {{conditional}} jumps, where e.g. the JP instruction jumps to the given target when the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> is {{set and the}} JNP instruction jumps {{if it is not}} set. The flag may be also read directly with instructions such as PUSHF, which pushes the flags register on the stack.|$|E
5000|$|In x86 processors, the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> {{reflects}} the parity {{only of the}} least significant byte of the result, and is set {{if the number of}} set bits of ones is even (put another way, the parity bit is set if the sum of the bits is even). According to 80386 Intel manual, the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> is changed in the x86 processor family by the following instructions: ...|$|E
50|$|Some older {{computers}} (decimal computers), were decimal digit-addressable. For example, each {{address in}} the IBM 1620's magnetic-core memory identified a single six bit binary-coded decimal digit, consisting of a <b>parity</b> bit, <b>flag</b> bit and four numerical bits. The 1620 used 5-digit decimal addresses, so in theory the highest possible address was 99,999. In practice, the CPU supported 20,000 memory locations, and up to two optional external memory units could be added, each supporting 20,000 addresses, {{for a total of}} 60,000 (00000-59999).|$|R
50|$|One common {{reason to}} test the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> is to check an {{unrelated}} FPU flag. The FPU has four condition flags (C0 to C3), {{but they can not}} be tested directly, and must instead be first copied to the flags register. When this happens, C0 is placed in the carry flag, C2 in the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> and C3 in the zero flag. The C2 flag is set when e.g. incomparable floating point values (NaN or unsupported format) are compared with the FUCOM instructions.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} processors the <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> indicates if {{the number}} of set bits is odd or even in the binary representation of the result of the last operation. It is normally a single bit in a processor status register.|$|E
5000|$|... 8086 has a 16-bit flags register. Nine {{of these}} {{condition}} code flags are active, and indicate {{the current state}} of the processor: Carry flag (CF), <b>Parity</b> <b>flag</b> (PF), Auxiliary carry flag (AF), Zero flag (ZF), Sign flag (SF), Trap flag (TF), Interrupt flag (IF), Direction flag (DF), and Overflow flag (OF).|$|E
50|$|The TEST {{operation}} {{sets the}} flags CF and OF to zero. The SF {{is set to}} the most significant bit of {{the result of the}} AND. If the result is 0, the ZF is set to 1, otherwise set to 0. The <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> is set to the bitwise XNOR of the least significant byte of the result, 1 if the number of ones in that byte is even, 0 otherwise. The value of AF is undefined.|$|E
50|$|Up to {{the early}} 1990s, many {{programs}} and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits); for example, the ASCII standard used only 7 bits per character, avoiding an 8-bit representation {{in order to save}} on data transmission costs. On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a <b>parity,</b> <b>flag</b> bit, or meta data control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English-speaking countries with larger alphabets.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} {{has seven}} 8-bit registers {{accessible to the}} programmer, named A, B, C, D, E, H, and L, where A {{is also known as}} the accumulator. The other six registers can be used as independent byte-registers or as three 16-bit register pairs, BC, DE, and HL (or B, D, H, as referred to in Intel documents), depending on the particular instruction. Some instructions use HL as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator. As in the 8080, the contents of the memory address pointed to by HL can be accessed as pseudo register M. It also has a 16-bit program counter and a 16-bit stack pointer to memory (replacing the 8008's internal stack). Instructions such as PUSH PSW, POP PSW affect the Program Status Word (accumulator and flags). The accumulator stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations, and the flags register bits (sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags) are set or cleared according to the results of these operations. The sign flag is set if the result has a negative sign (i.e. it is set if bit 7 of the accumulator is set). The auxiliary or half carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 3 to bit 4 occurred. The <b>parity</b> <b>flag</b> is set according to the parity (odd or even) of the accumulator. The zero flag is set if the result of the operation was 0. Lastly, the carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 7 of the accumulator (the MSB) occurred.|$|E
