Criminal <b>proceedings</b> <b>against</b> legal {{entities}} Criminal <b>proceedings</b> <b>against</b> {{legal entities}} represent a significant innovation for Czech criminal procedure law.

40|$|Who is {{more likely}} to behave aggressively? Is it someone {{outperformed}} by others or is it someone who outperformed others? For safety reasons, {{it is important to know}} the answer to this question. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were told that they did worse or better than an ostensible partner on a first task. Then they aggressed against this partner on a second task using loud, painful noise blasts. Results showed that participants aggressed more <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> they outperformed (the loser) than <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> who outperformed them (the winner). However, these results do not indicate whether participants were especially aggressive <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> they outperformed, or whether they were especially nonaggressive <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> who outperformed them. Study 3 included a control group and showed it was the former. These studies suggest that one should pay particular attention to winners rather than losers, because winners tend to aggress against losers...|$|R
