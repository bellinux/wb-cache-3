25|$|Longleat House {{was built}} in the sixteenth century by Sir John Thynn on the site of a {{dissolved}} priory, and in 1949 became the first stately home in Britain to be opened to the public on a commercial basis. The house, park and attractions are open from mid-February to the start of November each year. The 9,800-acre estate, of which the park occupies 900 acres, has long been one of the top British tourist attractions, and has motivated other large landowners to generate income from their heritage in response to rising maintenance costs. Longleat leases 400 acres of land to Center <b>Parcs</b> for the operation of the Longleat Forest holiday village.|$|E

All protected areas, excluding the private reserves, comprise approximately 3% of the land surface of Madagascar and are managed by Madagascar National Parks, formerly known as l'Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires Protégées (ANGAP), as well as other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Conservation International (CI), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

40|$|CUL 7, a {{recently}} identified {{member of the}} cullin family of E 3 ubiquitin ligases, forms a unique SCF-like complex and is required for mouse embryonic development. To further investigate CUL 7 function, we sought to identify CUL 7 binding proteins. The p 53 -associated, parkin-like cytoplasmic protein (<b>PARC),</b> a homolog of CUL 7, {{was identified as a}} CUL 7 -interacting protein by mass spectrometry. The heterodimerization of <b>PARC</b> and CUL 7, as well as homodimerization of <b>PARC</b> and CUL 7, was confirmed in vivo. To determine the biological role of <b>PARC</b> by itself and in conjunction with CUL 7, a targeted deletion of <b>Parc</b> was created in the mouse. In contrast to the neonatal lethality of the Cul 7 knockout mice, <b>Parc</b> knockout mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratios and exhibited no apparent phenotype. Additionally, <b>Parc</b> deletion did not appear to affect the stability or function of p 53. These results suggest that <b>PARC</b> and CUL 7 form an endogenous complex and that <b>PARC</b> and CUL 7 functions are at least partially nonoverlapping. In addition, although <b>PARC</b> and p 53 form a complex, the absence of effect of <b>Parc</b> deletion on p 53 stability, localization, and function suggests that p 53 binding to <b>PARC</b> may serve to control <b>PARC</b> function...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE • To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} p 53 -associated Parkin-like cytoplasmic protein (<b>Parc)</b> short-interfering RNA (siRNA) on the location of p 53 {{as well as the}} biology of Peyronie's disease (PD) plaque-derived fibroblasts after <b>Parc</b> knockdown. PATIENTS AND METHODS • Plaque tissue was excised from men with stable PD undergoing penile reconstructive surgery and used to produce cultured PD plaque-derived fibroblasts. • Immunofluorescence (IF) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were then used to define the location of p 53 and <b>Parc</b> before and after siRNA. • Nuclear fractionation studies were used to assess the chronology of translocation of p 53 from cytoplasm to nucleus on <b>Parc</b> knockdown. • The terminal transferase dUTP Nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay was used to assess the apoptotic indices of the PD fibroblasts after <b>Parc</b> knockdown. RESULTS • IF and PCR showed high cytoplasmic levels of p 53 and <b>Parc</b> before siRNA. On IF, there was little or no p 53 present within the nucleus before <b>Parc</b> knockdown. • After <b>Parc</b> siRNA, IF showed translocation of p 53 to the fibroblast nucleus, while <b>Parc</b> levels dropped significantly, but what <b>Parc</b> remained was confined to the cytoplasm with none present in the nucleus. • Nuclear fractionation studies using RT-PCR confirmed this translocation phenomenon and showed the chronology of the event. All p 53 had moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus within 16 h of <b>Parc</b> siRNA. • On TUNEL assay, apoptotic indices increased dramatically after <b>Parc</b> siRNA. CONCLUSIONS • These data prove that <b>Parc</b> is a cytoplasmic anchor for p 53 in PD plaque-derived fibroblasts and may be the primary cause of the stabilization and defunctionalization of p 53 in these cells. • These findings support <b>Parc</b> as a novel target for PD pharmacotherapy, perhaps using human siRNA technologies once commercially available. © 2010 THE AUTHORS.
