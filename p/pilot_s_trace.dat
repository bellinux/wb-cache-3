40|$|We {{studied the}} {{learning}} capacities and anticipatory behaviour in a “sit-and-wait” predatory fish, the Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus. In Experiment 1 {{two groups of}} halibut received series of light flashes (conditioned stimulus, CS) that started before delivery of food (unconditioned stimulus, US) and persisted until after food delivery, i. e. delay conditioning. Control groups received unpaired CS and US presentations. The anticipatory behaviour of delay conditioned halibut consisted mainly of take-offs towards the surface shortly after onset of the CS. In Experiment 2 six groups of halibut were trained in three trace conditioning procedures: Two groups with 20 s, two groups with 60 s and two groups with 120 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> interval. Learning {{was evident in the}} 20 and 60 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> groups and in one of the 120 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> groups. In contrast to delay conditioning the anticipatory behaviour of trace conditioned halibut was characterized by subtle movements near the tank floor with orientation towards the CS. The cautious responses of halibut after trace conditioning differed markedly from what is observed in other fish species and are suggested to reflect a “sit-and-wait” foraging strategy that requires the predator to remain undetected until the prey is within lunging range...|$|R

40|$|Alpha, Golf, November, Echo, Zulu. " "Sierra, Alpha, Golf, Echo, Sierra. " "Lima, Hotel, Yankee. " It {{looks like}} some strange word game, but the {{combinations}} of words above actually communicate the first three points of a flight plan from Albany, New York to Florence, South Carolina. Spoken by air traffic controllers and pilots, the aviation industry s standard International Civil Aviation Organization phonetic alphabet uses words to represent letters. The first letter of each word in the series is combined to spell waypoints, or reference points, used in flight navigation. The first waypoint above is AGNEZ (alpha for A, golf for G, etc.). The second is SAGES, {{and the third is}} LHY. For pilots of general aviation aircraft, the traditional method of entering the letters of each waypoint into a GPS device is a time-consuming process. For each of the 16 waypoints required for the complete flight plan from Albany to Florence, the pilot uses a knob to scroll through each letter of the alphabet. It takes approximately 5 minutes of the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> focused attention to complete this particular plan. Entering such a long flight plan into a GPS can pose a safety hazard because it can take the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> attention from other critical tasks like scanning gauges or avoiding other aircraft. For more than five decades, NASA has supported research and development in aviation safety, including through its Vehicle Systems Safety Technology (VSST) program, which works to advance safer and more capable flight decks (cockpits) in aircraft. Randy Bailey, a lead aerospace engineer in the VSST program at Langley Research Center, says the technology in cockpits is directly related to flight safety. For example, "GPS navigation systems are wonderful as far as improving a <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> ability to navigate, but if you can find ways to reduce the draw of the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> attention into the cockpit while using the GPS, it could potentially improve safety," he says...|$|R
40|$|A {{mounting}} mechanism {{was designed}} and built to satisfy requirements specific to a developmental head-up display (HUD) {{to be used by}} pilots in a Boeing 757 airplane. This development was necessitated by the fact that although such mounting mechanisms were commercially available for other airplanes, there were none for the 757. The mounting mechanism supports a miniature electronic camera that provides a forward view. The mechanism was designed to be integrated with the other HUD instrumentation and to position the camera so that what is presented to the pilot is the image acquired by the camera, overlaid with alphanumeric and/or graphical symbols, from a close approximation of the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> natural forward perspective. The mounting mechanism includes an L-shaped mounting arm that can be adjusted easily to the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> perspective, without prior experience.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effect of {{dopamine}} depletion in nucleus accumbens on trace conditioning; to distinguish the role of core and shell sub-regions, as far as possible. Material/Methods: 6 -hydroxydopamine was used to lesion dopamine terminals within the core and shell accumbens. Experiment 1 assessed conditioning to a tone conditioned stimulus that had previously been paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus) at a 30 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> interval. Experiment 2 subsequently assessed contiguous conditioning (at 0 <b>s</b> <b>trace)</b> using a light conditioned stimulus directly followed by the unconditioned stimulus. Results: Both sham and shell-lesioned animals showed the normal trace effect of reduced conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus but 6 -hydroxydopamine injections targeted on the core subregion of the nucleus accumbens abolished this effect and enhanced conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus. However, the depletion produced by this lesion placement extended to the shell. In Experiment 2 (at 0 <b>s</b> <b>trace),</b> there was no effect of either lesion placement as all animals showed comparable levels of conditioning to the light conditioned stimulus. Neurochemical analysis across core, shell and comparison regions showed some effects on noradrenalin as well as dopamine. Conclusions: The pattern of changes in noradrenalin did not systematically relate to the observed behavioural changes after core injections. The pattern of changes in dopamine suggested that depletion in core mediated the increased conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus seen in the present study. However, the comparison depletion restricted to the shell subregion was less substantial, and a role for secondarily affected brain regions cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Aviation and {{cognitive}} science researchers have identified {{situations in which}} the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> expectations for {{the behavior of the}} avionics are not matched by the actual behavior of the avionics. Researchers have attributed these "automation surprises" to the complexity of the avionics mode logic, the absence of complete training, limitations in cockpit displays, and ad-hoc conceptual models of the avionics. Complete canonical rule-based descriptions of the behavior of the autopilot provide the basis for understanding the perceived complexity of the autopilots, the differences between the <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> and autopilot s conceptual models, and the limitations in training materials and cockpit displays. This paper compares the behavior of the autopilot Vertical Speed/Flight Path Angle (VS-FPA) mode as described in the Flight Crew Operators Manual (FCOM) and the actual behavior of the VS-FPA mode defined in the autopilot software. This example demonstrates the use of the Operational Procedure Model (OPM) as a method for using the requirements specification for the design of the software logic as information requirements for training...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} quantify the effects of changing dynamics on a subject s ability to track a signal in order to eventually model a pilot adapting to changing aircraft dynamics. The data {{will be used to}} identify primary aircraft dynamics variables that influence changes in <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> response and produce a simplified pilot model that incorporates this relationship. Each run incorporated a different set of second-order aircraft dynamics representing short period transfer function pitch attitude response: damping ratio, frequency, gain, zero location, and time delay. The subject s ability to conduct the tracking task was the greatest source of root mean square error tracking variability. As for the aircraft dynamics, the factors that affected the subjects ability to conduct the tracking were the time delay, frequency, and zero location. In addition to creating a simplified pilot model, the results of the experiment can be utilized in an advisory capacity. A situation awareness/prediction aid based on the pilot behavior and aircraft dynamics may help tailor <b>pilot</b> <b>s</b> inputs more quickly so that PIO or an upset condition can be avoided...|$|R

40|$|The muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) receptor is {{an important}} modulator of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) functions, such as the working memory required to bridge a trace interval in associative leaning. Aversive and appetitive trace conditioning procedures were {{used to examine the}} effects of scopolamine (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) in male rats. Follow-up experiments tested the effects of microinfusion of 0. 15 μg scopolamine (0. 075 μg in 0. 5 μL/side) in infralimbic (IL) versus prelimbic (PL) regions of rat mPFC, in appetitive trace and locomotor activity (LMA) procedures. Systemic scopolamine was without effect in an aversive trace conditioning procedure but impaired appetitive conditioning at a 2 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> interval. This effect was demonstrated as reduced responding during presentations of the conditioned stimulus (CS) as well as during the inter-stimulus-interval (ISI). There was no such effect on responding during food (unconditioned stimulus, US) responding or in the inter-trial-interval (ITI). In contrast, systemic scopolamine dose-relatedly increased LMA. Trace conditioning was similarly impaired at the 2 <b>s</b> <b>trace</b> (shown as reduced responding to the CS and during the ISI, but not during US presentations or in the ITI) after infusion in mPFC, whilst LMA was increased (after infusion in IL only).
