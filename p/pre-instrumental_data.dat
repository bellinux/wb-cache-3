40|$|Historical {{studies of}} {{earthquakes}} in Australia using information {{dating back to}} 1788 have been comprehensive, if not exhaustive. Newspapers have been {{the main source of}} historical earthquake studies. A brief review is given here with an introduction to the pre-European aboriginal dreamtime information. Some of the anecdotal information of the last two centuries has been compiled as isoseismal maps. Relationships between isoseismal radii and magnitude have been established using post-instrumental data allowing magnitudes to be assigned to the <b>pre-instrumental</b> <b>data,</b> which can then be incorporated into the national earthquake database. The studies have contributed to hazard analyses for the building codes and stimulated research into microzonation and paleo-seismology...|$|E
40|$|The {{peak flow}} dataset {{initiated}} by the Flood Studies Report (FSR) has seen significant developments in network size, data quality and technology over the last 40 years, resulting in the current service hosted by the National River Flow Archive (NRFA). Annual maxima and peaks over threshold data are now available on the NRFA website at nearly 1000 stations across the UK, and managed under a collaborative project between CEH and the Measuring Authorities. The project aims to deliver regular data updates, period of record validation and improvements in metadata and national consistency. Anticipated technological developments include software tools to improve user access to the data. Looking further ahead, the potential provision of local, historical and palaeoflood data is being explored {{with a view to}} improving their incorporation into Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) techniques. Existing systems, most notably the Chronology of British Hydrological Events, and emerging apps and websites offer the means for collation of some such datatypes. However, the distribution and often unstructured format of the data will make searches and processing time consuming and lack full integration with hydrometric records. This presentation reviews options for developing a data system which allows instrumental and <b>pre-instrumental</b> <b>data</b> to be used in a combined approach to flood estimation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we analyse the climatic {{impacts on}} the grape harvest date (GHD) in Burgundy (France) on interannual and decadal time scales. We affirm that the GHD is mainly {{influenced}} by the local April-to-August temperature (AAT) and provide the spatial expansion of this relationship. The spatial correlation pattern yields similar results for the instrumental and pre-instrumental period, indicating {{the consistency of the}} <b>pre-instrumental</b> field <b>data</b> with the instrumental GHD-spring/summer relationship. We find a previously undocumented second climate impact on the GHD. The winter temperature is significantly correlated with the GHD on decadal-to-multidecadal time scales and affects the GHD independently of the AAT. A multiple linear regression model, with AAT and decadal winter temperature as predictors, was found to be the best model to describe the GHD time series for the instrumental period. Stability tests of the correlations over time yield that both {{impacts on the}} GHD, AAT and decadal winter temperature, strengthen during the instrumental period. Using partial correlation analysis, we demonstrate that this is partly caused by a change in the winter–spring/summer temperature relationship. Summarising, the GHD is well suited to reconstruct interannual variations of the spring/summer temperature over large parts of Europe, even if the changing winter–spring/summer relation might affect the reconstruction in a second order. For decadal time scales, the December-to-August temperature shows the strongest relationship to the GHD and, therefore, proposes that the GHD can be used for European temperature reconstructions beyond the spring/summer season. Finally, we argue that our findings regarding the changed winter–spring/summer relation are relevant for physical and biological systems in several ways and should be analysed by other long-term proxy data and available model simulations. ...|$|R
