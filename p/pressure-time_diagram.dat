40|$|International audienceA {{thermodynamic}} {{methodology of}} TDC determination in IC engines {{based on a}} motoring <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagram</b> is presented. This method consists in entropy calculation and temperature- entropy diagram analysis. When the TDC position is well calibrated, compression and expansion strokes under motoring conditions are symmetrical {{with respect to the}} peak temperature in the (T,S) diagram. Moreover, in case of error on the TDC position, a loop appears which has no thermodynamic significance. Hence an easy methodology has been conceived to obtain the actual position of TDC. This methodology is applied to motoring measurements in order to present its performance, which are compared to usual methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{the use of}} piezo-quartz {{indicators}} for high-speed automobile engines, the interpretation of <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagrams</b> made by an oscillograph offers certain difficulties. On the one hand, {{the scale of the}} pressure amplitudes is not always the same under all conditions, while, on the other hand, the atmospheric zero line may be shifted from its correct position in the oscillogram. These facts make necessary to verify the readings of the quartz indicators by direct calibration before and after each series of tests and, {{on the basis of the}} results, to determine the scale for the oscillograms...|$|R
40|$|Super Plastic Forming is {{the process}} of {{undergoing}} large uniform elongation prior to necking and fracture tension. Super Plasticity is the ability of a polycrystalline material to exhibit, in a generally isotropic manner though there are some works reported on anisotropic behavior also, very large elongations without necking prior to failure. Super Plasticity in sheet metals offers advantages for forming complex shapes easily in high strength alloys, as a regular production process. The focus of the present work is to generate <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagram</b> and stress strain curve for Titanium alloys. The sheets are formed in single and double (Diffusion bonding) with different thickness. The results obtained from the FE analysis is used as input to experimental analysis. The formed shapes are in accordance with the FE results...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of various parameters characterizing the single- and double-pulse energy deposition (ED) upstream of a blunt body (distance between the deposition {{point and the}} body, amount of the energy and time delay between the pulses) on the topology of the supersonic flow at Mach 2 is studied experimentally and numerically. The obtained <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagram</b> at the upstream stagnation point of the body {{as well as some}} significant topological properties of the bow-shock / heated-bubble interaction, like shock deformation and reflection, as well as the evolution of the heated bubble into the vortex ring downstream, are analyzed as resulting from the shock-decelerated spherical light-gas inhomogeneity. The evolution and topology of the interfering heated bubbles by double-pulse ED show the significance of vorticity generation initiated by blast-waves coming from the neighboring bubbles...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} lag of a {{fuel oil}} in the combustion chamber of a high speed compression-ignition engine was measured by three different methods. The start of injection of the fuel as observed with a Stoborama was taken as {{the start of the}} period of ignition lag in all cases. The end of the period of ignition lag was determined by observation of the appearance of incandescence in the combustion chamber, by inspection of a pressure-time card for evidence of pressure rise, and by analysis of the indicator card for evidence of the combustion of a small but definite quantity of fuel. A comparison of the values for ignition lags obtained by these three methods indicates that the appearance of incandescence is later than other evidences of the start of combustion, that visual inspection of a <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagram</b> gives consistent and usable values with a minimum requirement of time and/or apparatus, and that analysis of the indicator card is not worth while for ignition lag alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of steady energy addition into the flow was investigated at Mach numbers 3 and 5 by a low-voltage DC-arc discharge located upstream of conically-nosed and spherically-blunted bodies. The flow-field structure arising {{due to the}} bow-shock/heated-wake interaction {{and the effects of}} the bow-shock intensity and of the heating power on the drag reduction of different non-slender bodies are analyzed numerically and experimentally. Results demonstrate the existence of an optimum heating rate, providing a maximum effectiveness of energy addition. The {{influence of}} various parameters characterizing the single- and double-pulse energy addition upstream of a blunt body (distance between the deposition point and the body, amount of the energy and time delay between the pulses) on the topology of the supersonic flow was studied experimentally and numerically at Mach 2. The obtained <b>pressure-time</b> <b>diagram</b> at the upstream stagnation point of the body as well as some significant topological properties of the bow-shock / heated-bubble interaction, like shock deformation and reflection, as well as the evolution of the heated bubble into vortex rings downstream, are analyzed as resulting from the shock-decelerated spherical “light-gas” inhomogeneity. The evolution and topology of the interfering heated bubbles by double-pulse ED show the significance of vorticity generation initiated by blast-waves coming from the neighboring bubbles. ...|$|E
