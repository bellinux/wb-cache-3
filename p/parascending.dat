5000|$|During {{the summer}} months, {{a large number}} of boats moor in the shallow, {{protected}} [...] "Plateau du Milieu", between the islands or on the landward side of Sainte-Marguerite where there is more room for water skiing, <b>parascending</b> and other popular water sports.|$|E
50|$|Author Walter Neumark wrote Operating Procedures for Ascending Parachutes, {{and he and}} a {{group of}} enthusiasts with a passion for tow-launching PCs and ram-air parachutes {{eventually}} broke away from the British Parachute Association to form the British Association of <b>Parascending</b> Clubs (BAPC) in 1973. Authors Patrick Gilligan (Canada) and Bertrand Dubuis (Switzerland) wrote the first flight manual, The Paragliding Manual in 1985, officially coining the word paragliding.|$|E
50|$|Parasailing, {{also known}} as <b>parascending</b> or parakiting, is a {{recreational}} kiting activity where a person is towed behind a vehicle (usually a boat) while attached to a specially designed canopy wing that reminds one of a parachute, known as a parasail wing. The manned kite's moving anchor may be a car, truck, or boat. The harness attaches the pilot to the parasail, which {{is connected to the}} boat, or land vehicle, by the tow rope. The vehicle then drives off, carrying the parascender (or wing) and person into the air. If the boat is powerful enough, two or three people can parasail behind it at the same time. The parascender has little or no control over the parachute. The activity is primarily a fun ride, {{not to be confused with}} the sport of paragliding.|$|E
5000|$|Half an hour's walk to {{the west}} of the town along the sea-front walkway, is the Playa Flamingo beach. Although it is outside of the town centre, there are still a number of shops and restaurants. This is the nearest sandy beach to the newer {{developments}} around Monta√±a Roja and the lighthouse at Pechiguera, such as Faro Park, Carlos Park and Shangrila Park. Playa Flamingo was virtually destroyed in November 2005, during Hurricane Delta. The sea wall was eventually rebuilt in early 2011. There are no lifeguards on this beach. Playa Dorada is literally translated as The Golden Beach, and is to the east of the town centre. The sea around Playa Dorada is generally very calm because it is encased within a manmade cove. It is a 10-minute walk from the centre of Playa Blanca and is well served by shops and cafes att Centro Comercial Papagayo behind it. This is the most popular beach in Playa Blanca for enjoying water based activities. Banana boats, pedalos and <b>parascending</b> are available here. There are lifeguards on this beach ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the heart}} of Vilamoura is the marina which has the {{capacity}} to berth over 1,000 vessels. The marina is surrounded by large hotels and luxury holiday homes as well as a large casino and numerous restaurants and vibrant bars. At {{the far corner of the}} marina, it is possible to charter boats for big game fishing. There are also facilities for jet skiing and <b>parascending.</b> Close by there are also a number of sports clubs, a shooting range and many night clubs.Tourism in Vilamoura is extensive and well-developed, with many different resorts with ratings from three to five stars. This is a substantially higher average than the surrounding areas, which have ratings varying from two to four. As a consequence of being mostly privately owned, the town is very opulently designed. The town and marina have an extensive variety of activities which are usually on Tuesdays, Thursdays and at weekends, including touring the local caves along the coastline (which are nearer to Albufeira than they are to Vilamoura). This cave tour is usually done on tour boats. The area also has two companies which operate trains-on-wheels for travel between resorts.|$|E
