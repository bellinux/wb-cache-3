40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between coping, optimism, psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> The effectiveness of the different coping strategies and the role of optimism were investigated by analyzing how they predicted psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Altogether 136 municipal employees participated in a questionnaire study. The results showed that the most adaptive or effective coping strategy concerning psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> was acceptance, which can be classified as engagement coping. Ineffective strategies regarding psychological well-being included disengagement coping strategies such as sub- stance use, behavioral disengagement and self-blame. An ineffective strategy regarding physiological well-being was denial, which can be classified as a disengagement strategy. Optimism correlated significantly with both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> However, when all the variables in the model were included in the regression analysis, optimism explained additional variance in <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> but not in psychological well-being...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the year-round effectiveness of need-supportive physical activity counseling on various dimensions of subjective well-being. Flemish adults {{who did not}} attain the recommended level of physical activity were assigned to an intervention (n = 92) or a control condition (n = 34). Participants of the intervention condition received a four-month physical activity coaching based on the Self-Determination Theory. The coaching was limited to five individual contact moments with a bachelor in kinesiology specializing in health-related physical activity counseling. Self-reports on various intensities of physical activity and <b>physical</b> and psychological <b>well-being</b> were completed before (i. e. pre-test), immediately after (i. e. post-test) and one year after (i. e. follow-up-test) the intervention. Repeated measurements ANOVAs showed significant time by condition interaction effects with respect to <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> More specifically, <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> increased significantly in the intervention condition from pre- to post-test and from pre- to follow-up-test, whereas no changes occurred in the control condition. Bootstrapping mediation analyses revealed that the changes in <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> were mediated by changes in strenuous intensity physical activity. The findings demonstrate the year-round effectiveness of need-supportive physical activity counseling with {{a limited number of}} contact moments on (<b>physical)</b> <b>well-being</b> and suggest its potential as a public health initiative. status: publishe...|$|R

Results show that the literacy of father and the number of dependents are associated with the largest shift in the underlying household’s <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Locale and the household assets were also significantly associated with the collective underlying latent variable.

Purpose The degree to which conscientiousness contributes to well-being in Chinese cancer survivors and the mechanisms through which conscientiousness is associated with well-being remain unclear. Based on Lent’s restorative well-being model [1], the current study tested a mediation model of the contribution of conscientiousness, positive reappraisal, and hopelessness to fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> {{in a sample of}} 238 Chinese cancer survivors. Method Participants completed self-report questionnaires. Path analysis was used to analyze the linear relationships between the variables. Results The empirical model supported the mediator roles of positive reappraisal and hopelessness. Specifically, the results indicated that conscientiousness was first associated with positive reappraisal, which in turn was associated with decreased hopelessness, resulting in decreased FCR and improved <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> In addition, the results showed that conscientiousness was associated with decreased hopelessness, which was then associated with decreased FCR and greater <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Conclusion Conscientiousness confers benefits on FCR and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> through the mechanisms of positive reappraisal and decreased hopelessness...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relation between coping strategies of inmates and their psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> General affective states such as optimism were related to both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Moreover, inmates who experienced specific negative emotions such as regret, anxiety, and sadness reported more psychological and physical complaints. The way in which inmates coped with these negative emotions was also important. Inmates who used an active emotion-focused coping strategy were in better health than inmates inclined to keep their negative feelings to themselves. Emotion-focused coping by sharing negative emotions with people in one's social network can help to increase both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Engaging in emotion management in a more cognitive way, by emphasizing positive aspects of the situation, can help to reduce the intensity of negative emotions. Possible research and policy implications of these results are discussed. © 2007 American Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{androgen}} deprivation therapy (ADT) {{becomes a}} standard of treatment for men with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer, evaluation of adverse effects associated with this treatment is needed. In this study, the authors evaluated the effect of ADT administered as monotherapy and in combination with local treatment on <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> in a longitudinal sample of men with prostate cancer. METHODS: Exposure to ADT was defined by 3 groups: local (local treatment only), combination (local treatment with adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant ADT), and primary ADT. Associations between exposure to ADT and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> measured by self-reported health-related quality of life outcomes over time were evaluated by repeated measures analysis using mixed modeling. Estimates adjusted for various clinical and demographic variables are reported. RESULTS: A total of 2922 men, who completed both pretreatment and follow-up health-related quality of life assessment, were identified from the CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) registry. During 24 months of follow-up, exposure to ADT was associated with worse <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> compared with local treatment at all time points (P <. 001). Being exposed to ADT as primary therapy was associated with more severe declines compared with combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The potential consequence of decline in <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> in patients exposed to ADT has {{to be included in}} treatment decision making. © 2011 American Cancer Society...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Childhood {{cancer and}} its {{treatment}} may affect health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in childhood cancer survivors, but population-based studies in young survivors are scarce. We aimed to: (1) compare HRQoL between young survivors and population norms and (2) find factors that influence parent-reported HRQoL in survivors. METHODS As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a questionnaire was mailed to parents of survivors aged 8 - 16  years, registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, ≥ 5  years after diagnosis. We used the KIDSCREEN- 27 instrument to compare self- and parent-reported HRQoL between survivors (N =  425) and standardized norms in the five dimensions of <b>physical</b> <b>well-being,</b> psychological well-being, autonomy, peers and school environment (mean =  50, SD =  10). We then used multivariable linear regressions to test the influence of socio-demographic and cancer-related factors on HRQoL. RESULTS Self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> was comparable to norms. Other HRQoL dimensions were higher than norms, with the highest mean =  52. 2 (p <  0. 001) for school environment. Parent-reported HRQoL in survivors was comparable to population norms; only <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> was lower (mean =  47. 1, p <  0. 001), and school environment was higher (mean =  51. 1, p =  0. 035). Parent-reported HRQoL was lower for survivors of CNS tumors (physical well-being: β = - 5. 27, p =  0. 007; psychological well-being: β = - 4. 39, p =  0. 044; peers β = - 5. 17, p =  0. 028), survivors of neuroblastoma (psychological well-being β = - 5. 20, p =  0. 047), and survivors who had had a relapse (<b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> β = - 5. 41, p =  0. 005). CONCLUSIONS Assessing HRQoL during follow-up care, {{with a focus on}} <b>physical</b> <b>well-being,</b> specific diagnoses (e. g., CNS tumor) and late complications (e. g., relapse) might help to early identify problems and offer support to survivors with reduced HRQoL...|$|R

40|$|The {{terms on}} which the {{integration}} of new generations of immigrants into Portuguese and Spanish societies happens will have a decisive influence {{in the future of}} both countries. Therefore, promoting their health, well-being, and psychosocial adaptation is a matter of strategic interest. This paper analyses psychosocial factors associated with well-being and psychological adjustment on a sample of 108 adolescents (55 males and 53 females), children of immigrants from Huelva (Spain) and Algarve (Portugal), aged between 10 and 17 years. Adolescents were assessed for demographic characteristics and perceived well-being. We used the "KIDSCREEN- 5 ", a self-report questionnaire that yields detailed profile information for children aged 8 to 18 years for the following ten dimensions: <b>Physical</b> <b>well-being,</b> Psychological well-being, Moods and emotions, Self-perception, Autonomy, Parental relationships and home life, Financial resources, Social support and peers, School environment, and Social acceptance (Bullying). Overall, {{significant differences were found between}} the Spanish and Portuguese samples on <b>physical</b> <b>well-being,</b> psychological well-being, mood, financial resources and social acceptance (bullying). Boys perceived themselves as having a better <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> than girls. Mothers' educational level was associated with psychological well-being and mood.
