The use of ethyl ether in a single extrac-tion step and the stabilization of the phenylhydrazine-sulfuric acid reagent with sodium chloride are the unique features of the method. Studies of chromogenicities of steroids, recovery, pH effect on extraction, and salt effect on the stability of Porter-Silber reagent in the presence and absence of light during storage are re-ported; chemical aspects of chromogenic development of various steroids are dis-cussed, clinical ranges compared, and interpretations evaluated.

Usually, LPD are <b>prepared</b> <b>just</b> <b>before</b> their <b>use.</b> In the present work, we have examined whether dehydration {{of a new}} type of LPD (named LPD 100) might be a storage option. LPD 100 comprises PEGylated histidylated polylysine/pDNA polyplexes and a liposomal formulation made with lipophosphoramidates containing N-methylimidazolium and histamine polar heads. LPD 100 were dehydrated by evaporation, and the physicochemical parameters and transfection efficiency (TE) of reconstituted LPD 100 were compared to that of fresh LPD 100. LPD 100 previously dehydrated in the presence of 20 % saccharose, displayed comparable size and surface charge as freshly prepared LPD 100 but gave a better TE. CryoTEM experiments showed that the reconstituted LPD 100 exhibited a shape similar to fresh ones. Moreover, when LPD 100 were prepared with dehydrated pDNA/polymer complexes and fresh liposomes, TE was as efficient as with fresh LPD 100 while a small increase of their size were observed. These results demonstrate that evaporation of LPD 100 in the presence of saccharose is a powerful method to store them {{for a long period of}} time...|$|R

Choice of Fixative We recommend the use of 4 % (w/v) formaldehyde with 0. 1 % tween- 20 and 0. 1 % triton-x- 100. Formaldehyde vapour is toxic, thus solutions should be handled in the fume hood. In addition, due to instability, solutions should be freshly <b>prepared</b> from paraformaldehyde <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>use,</b> or freeze/thawed only once.
