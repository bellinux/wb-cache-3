40|$|<b>Palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> form a {{large and}} diversified group {{distributed}} primarily in marine waters. Within the family Palaemonidae the subfamily Palaemoninae is composed of 26 genera and more than 370 species inhabiting marine and fresh waters in epigean and hypogean habitats.

40|$|An {{enduring}} {{challenge for}} community ecologists {{is to understand}} how different assemblages of species are derived from acommon pool of potential colonists. Early colonisers can affect the ability of subsequent arrivals to colonise and persist, andthereby influence the development {{and structure of the}} resulting assemblage. In two independent experiments, we tested for such historical effects of priority on the assemblages of mobile fauna colonising artificial seagrass initially occupied by epibiota (algaeand sessile invertebrates) and/or predatory <b>Palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Multivariate analyses detected strong priority effects of both epibiota and Palaemonids on the structure of faunal assemblages as early as 5 days, and up to 45 days after experimental treatments were established, even though initial conditions (i. e. abundances of epibiota and Palaemonids) had become similar among treatments. The abundances of key taxa, identified by SIMPER analyses as those taxa contributing the most to multivariate differences among treatments, were typically enhanced where epibiota were initially present. In contrast, prior colonisation by <b>Palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> produced subtle and variable effects on individual taxa. Nevertheless, these experiments provide evidence for priority effects and demonstrate how variation in the structure of contemporary assemblages can be intimately linked with key historical events that occurred during their development, but may no longer be apparent. Consequently, our ability to interpret variation among contemporary assemblages may be enhanced when contemporary patterns are viewed within an historical context...|$|R
25|$|Some copepods have {{extremely}} fast escape responses when {{a predator}} is sensed, and can jump with high speed {{over a few}} millimetres. Many species have neurons surrounded by myelin (for increased conduction speed), which is very rare among invertebrates (other examples are some annelids and malacostracan crustaceans like <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> and penaeids). Even rarer, the myelin is highly organized, resembling the well-organized wrapping found in vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Despite their fast escape response, copepods are successfully hunted by slow-swimming seahorses, which approach their prey so gradually, it senses no turbulence, then suck the copepod into their snout too suddenly for the copepod to escape.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{freshwater}} {{species are}} consumed or exploited through artisanal fisheries in the rivers {{of the islands}} of Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Autochthonous production of organic matter is limited in these flowing rivers and is mainly represented by scarce filamentous green algae and an abundant epilithic biofilm growing on wet stones in the river bed. Stable isotope {{analysis was used to}} quantify the relative importance of biofilm and other riverine allochthonous and autochthonous food sources in the diet of tropical shrimps (Palaemonidae, Atyidae and Xiphocarididae) and fishes (Gobiidae and Eleotridae) consumed by the local people. The epilithic biofilm was exploited by most species, constituted an important source of autochthonous carbon and was an important source of organic matter production at the base of freshwater food webs in Caribbean rivers. Biofilm percentages in the diet reached 32 % for molluscs, 85 % for atyid shrimps, 29 % for xiphocaridid shrimps, 14 % for <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> and 13 % for fish.

40|$|Osmoregulation was {{studied in}} the zoeal stages I and VI, the first decapodid, the first juvenile, and in adults of the <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Palaemonetes argentinus. The larvae hatch in {{freshwater}} creeks or in adjacent brackish coastal lagoons of the warm temperate southwestern coast of the Atlantic Ocean; larval development is possible in low salinities. To cope with these demanding environments, the capacity for osmoregulation is well developed at hatching, increasing only slightly throughout development. All the postembryonic developmental stages hyper-regulated at low salinity (1 to 10 parts per thousand), hyper-osmoconformed at 17 parts per thousand, and osmoconformed at higher salinities (26 parts per thousand; up to 32 parts per thousand in adults). The type of osmoregulation did not change during development from larval hatching through the adult phase. The ecological implications and the evolutionary significance of osmoregulation in early life- history stages of P, argentinus and other aquatic crustaceans are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vents and methane seeps are extreme {{environments that}} have {{a high concentration of}} hydrogen sulphide. However, abundant unique invertebrates including shrimps of the family Bresiliidae have been found in such environments. The bresiliid shrimps are believed to have radiated in the Miocene (less than 20  Myr); however, the period when and the mechanisms by which they dispersed across the hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in oceans worldwide have not been clarified. In the present study, we collected the deep-sea blind shrimp Alvinocaris longirostris from the hydrothermal vent site in the Okinawa Trough and carried out the first investigation of the 18 S rRNA gene of a bresiliid shrimp. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bresiliid shrimp is situated at an intermediate lineage within the infraorder Caridea and shows monophyly with <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> which live in shallow sea and freshwater. Furthermore, the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene sequences were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship with known bresiliid shrimps. A. longirostris of the Okinawa Trough had two haplotypes of the COI gene, one of which was identical to the Alvinocaris sp. of the cold seeps in Sagami Bay. These results indicate that a long-distance dispersal of A. longirostris occurred possibly within the last 100   000 years...|$|E
40|$|<b>Palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> {{occur in}} the {{tropical}} and temperate regions of South America and the Indo-Pacific, in brackish/freshwater habitats, and marine coastal areas. They form a clade that recently (i. e., ~ 30 mya) invaded freshwater, and one included genus, Macrobrachium Bate, 1868, is especially successful in limnic habitats. Adult Macrobrachium acanthurus (Wiegmann, 1836) dwell in coastal freshwaters, have diadromous habit, and need brackish water to develop. Thus, they are widely recognized as euryhaline. Here we test how this species responds to a short-term exposure to increased salinity. We hypothesized that abrupt exposure to high salinity would result in reduced gill ventilation/perfusion and decreased oxygen consumption. Shrimps were subjected to control (0 psu) and experimental salinities (10, 20, 30 psu), for four and eight hours (n = 8 in each group). The water in the experimental containers was saturated with oxygen {{before the beginning of}} the experiment; aeration was interrupted before placing the shrimp in the experimental container. Dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia concentration, and pH were measured from the aquaria water, at the start and end of each experiment. After exposure, the shrimp's hemolymph was sampled for lactate and osmolality assays. Muscle tissue was sampled for hydration content (Muscle Water Content, MWC). Oxygen consumption was not reduced and hemolymph lactate did not increase with increased salinity. The pH of the water decreased with time, under all conditions. Ammonia excretion decreased with increased salinity. Hemolymph osmolality and MWC remained stable at 10 and 20 psu, but osmolality increased (~ 50 %) and MWC decreased (~ 4 %) at 30 psu. The expected reduction in oxygen consumption was not observed. This shrimp is able to tolerate significant changes in water salt concentrations for a few hours by keeping its metabolism in aerobic mode, and putatively shutting down branchial salt uptake to avoid massive salt load, thus remaining strongly hyposmotic. Aerobic metabolism may be involved in the maintainance of cell volume, concomitant with reduced protein/aminoacid catabolism upon increase in salinity. More studies should be conducted to broaden our knowledge on palaemonid hyporegulation...|$|E
40|$|A {{food web}} {{based on the}} gut {{contents}} of consumers (invertebrates and fishes) in pools of Tai Po Kau Forest Stream (TPKFS), Hong Kong (southern China), indicated the importance of periphyton and fine organic particles; coarse particulate organic matter was a less important food source despite its higher relative abundance in this shaded hillstream. Stable isotope analysis of consumer tissues was undertaken to confirm this result. IsoSource software was used to model n-isotope and >n + 1 -sources, so that the relative contribution of the potential food sources could be determined. Results of an IsoSource mixed model of δ 15 N and δ 13 C stable isotope signatures of primary consumers generally supported evidence from gut content analyses {{about the importance of}} autochthonous resources. Inconsistencies between the results of gut content analysis and isotope signatures of consumer tissues occurred in a few cases but could be explained either by small sample size or the wide range of feasible solutions provided by the isotopic mixed model. Both techniques were needed to resolve the trophic position of omnivores. For instance, the gut contents of balitorid loaches indicated that they were primarily herbivorous but their stable isotope signatures revealed a significant dependence on animal food. Considerable overlap in the diets of predatory fishes and invertebrates (odonates, perlid stoneflies, <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps)</b> was confirmed by both gut contents and stable isotope analyses. This finding, along with a lack of intraguild predation, resulted in a short mean and maximum foodchain length, high links per species, and high connectance for the TPKFS food web when compared with literature reports of other stream food webs. Periods of spate-induced disturbance during the wet season and limited algal productivity in TPKFS might also have contributed to the short food chains. Inconsistent levels of resolution for different taxonomic groups within the food web may have generated artefacts of low linkage complexity, high predator-prey ratio, and a small number of basal and intermediate species, a pattern that has been confirmed for stream food webs elsewhere. Our study is the first example of a food web based on complementary analyses of gut contents and stable isotope signatures for any tropical stream. This combined approach is recommended for future studies of food webs, especially in habitats where omnivores are {{an important component of the}} community. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the abundance, distribution, and spatiotemporal variation of <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> species in relation to season and salinity in the Shark River Estuary, Everglades National Park (ENP), Florida, USA. Five palaemonid species occurred in the samples: Palaemonetes paludosus, P. pugio, P. intermedius, Palaemon floridanus, and Leander paulensis; L. paulensis was collected only during the wet season. Overall, shrimp catches in traps doubled in the dry season. Catches in the upper estuary were dominated by P. paludosus, particularly in the wet season, while catch per unit effort (CPUE) at the most downstream, highest salinity sites were dominated by Palaemon floridanus. At mid-estuary, several species co-occurred. To investigate spatiotemporal shifts in trophic position of the shrimp, stable-isotope analysis was used. δ 15 N analyses revealed most species filled similar roles in the community, {{with the exception of}} P. paludosus, which shifted from enrichment in the dry season to depletion in the wet season. Palaemonid δ 13 C values varied between sites and seasons, with shrimp in upstream sites being more depleted than downstream sites.

40|$|Palaemonetes zariquieyi, an endemic palaemonid {{species of}} shrimp {{that lives in}} {{freshwater}} and brackish coastal habitats in eastern Spain, shows an abbreviated, non-feeding larval development comprising only three zoeal stages. To identify the endogenous bioenergetic fuel that allows for food-independent development from hatching to metamorphosis, larvae were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, and ontogenetic changes in dry weight (W), elemental (CHN), and lipid composition (total lipids, principal lipid classes, and fatty acids [FA]) were quantified {{at the onset of}} each zoeal stage and in the first juvenile. Values of W, C, and H per larva and per mass unit of W decreased throughout the time of larval development, while the N content showed only a weak decline (suggesting strong lipid but only little protein degradation). Correspondingly, directly measured values of total lipids (both in ?g/larva and in % of W) decreased gradually, with neutral lipids (NL) consistently remaining the predominant and most strongly used fraction; sterol esters and waxes were not detected. In contrast to the NL, the fraction of polar lipids (PL) per larva remained stable and, as a consequence, tended to increase as a percentage of total lipids. Likewise, other important lipid fractions such as free FA and cholesterol remained stable throughout the time of larval development. Among the FA, palmitic (16 : 0), oleic (18 : 1 n? 9), linoleic (18 : 2 n? 6), and eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5 n? 3) acid were predominant, showing a significant decrease during larval development; stearic (18 : 0), vaccenic (18 : 1 n? 7), and arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n? 6) were found only in small amounts. Our results indicate that the lecithotrophic development of P. zariquieyi is primarily fuelled by the utilization of lipids (especially triacylglycerides and other NL), which is reflected by a decreasing carbon content. Proteins and PL, by contrast, are preserved as structurally indispensable components (nerve and muscle tissues, cell membranes). The abbreviated and non-feeding mode of larval development of P. zariquieyi may have an adaptive value in land-locked freshwater habitats, where planktonic food limitation is likely to occur. The patterns of reserve utilization are similar to those previously observed in other <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> and various other groups of decapod crustaceans with lecithotrophic larvae. This suggests a multiple convergent evolution of bioenergetic traits allowing for reproduction in food-limited aquatic environments...|$|E

This relationship was improved by correcting area by island elevation, indicating that mountainous islands had the richest faunas, potentially due to high cloud interception that feeds freshwater environments favoring the establishment of aquatic fauna.

40|$|Freshwater macroinvertebrates from Cocos Island, Costa Rica: {{species and}} {{comparison}} with other islands of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Cocos Island is an oceanic island in the Eastern Pacific, at 496 km from Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica. This 24 km 2 island {{is surrounded by a}} protected marine area of 9 640 km 2. It was declared National Park in 1978 and a World Heritage by UNESCO in 1997. Freshwater macroinvertebrate fauna was collected in 20 sites covering three rivers (Genio, Chatam and Sucio) and two creeks (Minuto and an unnamed creek behind the park rangers’ house). Tank bromeliads or phytotelmata were also examined for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Physicochemical parameters were determined in 13 study sites. Additionally, a {{comparison with other}} islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific was conducted to determine the most important factors controlling the diversity in Tropical Pacific islands. A total of 455 individuals were collected belonging to 20 taxa (mostly identified to genus level) from 15 families of aquatic insects. Other macroinvertebrates such as <b>Palaemonid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> Hidrachnida and Oligochaeta were also collected. The family Staphylinidae (Coleoptera) was the most abundant, followed by Chironomidae (Diptera). Diptera was the order of insects with the highest taxonomic richness. A relationship between distance and the number of families was observed supporting the premises of the Theory of island Biogeography. This relationship was improved by correcting area by island elevation, indicating that mountainous islands had the richest faunas, potentially due to high cloud interception that feeds freshwater environments favoring the establishment of aquatic fauna. Physicochemical variables were similar in all sites, possibly due to the geology and the absence of significant sources of pollution on the island. La Isla del Coco es una isla oceánica localizada en el Pacífico Tropical Oriental a unos 492 km de Cabo Blanco. La isla cuenta con un área terrestre de 24 km 2 y un área marina protegida de 9 640 km 2. Fue declarada Parque Nacional en 1978 y Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO en 1997. Se realizó una gira de recolecta del 22 de mayo al 12 junio 2008. Se recolectaron macroinvertebrados acuáticos en 20 tramos de tres ríos (Genio, Chatham y Sucio) y dos quebradas (Minuto y quebrada sin nombre atrás de estación de guarda parques). En 13 sitios se tomaron parámetros fisicoquímicos. En total se recolectaron 455 individuos de 20 táxones de 15 familias de insectos acuáticos y otros macroinvertebrados. La familia Staphylinidae presentó la mayor abundancia seguida por Chironomidae, los dípteros fueron el orden con mayor riqueza taxonómica. Una relación entre distancia y número de familias se observó apoyando en parte la Teoría de Biogeografía de Islas. La relación mejoró al corregir área con elevación, indicando que islas montañosas tenían alta riqueza, posiblemente debido a la mayor intercepción de nubes que alimentan los ambientes dulceacuícolas que favorecen el establecimiento de la fauna acuática. Las variables ambientales fueron similares en todos los sitios. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDecapod {{species have}} evolved {{with a variety}} of {{reproductive}} strategies. In this study reproductive features of the <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Leander paulensiswere investigated. Individuals were collected in the coastal region of Ubatuba, São Paulo, Brazil. In all, 46 ovigerous females were examined in terms of the following reproductive traits: fecundity, reproductive output, brood loss and egg volume. Leander paulensis produces a large number of small eggs with an average fecundity of 635 ± 246 eggs. Egg volume increased significantly from early (0. 034 ± 0. 008 mm 3) to late development stage (0. 05 ± 0. 012 mm 3). The reproductive output did not correlate with female size. The weight of females bearing stage 2 eggs was significantly higher than that of females carrying stage 1 eggs. We assume that the reason for this weight gain is the recovery of female reserves that have been depleted for egg production. Moreover, we emphasize that this weight gain must be considered when evaluating weight-dependent variables such as reproductive output or brood loss in relation to female weight. Otherwise, an overestimation of these variables might lead to inaccurate results...|$|R
40|$|The {{stocking}} {{of predators}} can have significant consequences on recipient aquatic ecosystems. We investigated some potential ecological impacts of stocking a predatory fish (Lates calcarifer) into a coastal river {{and a large}} impoundment in north-eastern Australia. L. calcarifer was mostly found in slower-moving, larger reaches of the river or in {{the main body of}} the impoundment where there was abundant suitable habitat. In the tidally influenced freshwater reaches of the coastal river, L. calcarifer predominately consumed aytid and <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> that were associated with local macrophyte beds or littoral grasses. In this area the diets of juvenile stocked and wild L. calcarifer were similar and stocked fish displayed a high degree of site fidelity. Further upstream in the river, away from tidal influence, and in the impoundment, fish were the main prey item. Cannibalism was uncommon and we suggest that, at the current stocking densities, there was little dietary evidence of predatory impacts from L. calcarifer on species of conservation concern. We caution against introducing novel predatory species such as L. calcarifer in or near areas that are outside their natural range and are known to support rare, threatened or endangered species...|$|R
5000|$|The diet of S. thermophilus varies {{significantly}} from seamount to seamount, {{with the only}} constant being polychaete worms, which are most important for individuals on Daikoku and Volcano-1 Seamounts. Other populations feed predominantly on crustaceans; the main prey item of S. thermophilus on the Nikko Seamount is the alvinocaridid shrimp Opaepele loihi, and on the Kasuga-2 Seamount they eat mostly <b>palaemonid</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The fish at these sites appear to be [...] "sit and wait" [...] predators, taking slow-moving shrimp that wander too close. By contrast, the fish at the Daikoku Seamount {{seem to be more}} active, opportunistic foragers; they do not eat many crustaceans and have been observed scavenging on dying fish that fall to the bottom after coming into contact with the volcanic plumes. Snails and sponge spicules have also been found in the stomachs of a few individuals, and in captivity they are known to consume any food offered to them. The large numbers of S. thermophilus found on sulfur crusts where there are no obvious prey items may feed directly on filaments of chemosynthetic bacteria. If so, this would represent a hitherto unknown behavior for vent fish species.|$|R
