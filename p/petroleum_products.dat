Around 1961, there was discussion of converting the Big Inch pipeline back to petroleum use, but it continued in use as a gas pipeline. In 1989, TETCO was taken over by the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, and in 1997 this company was merged with Duke Power, to form the Duke Energy Corporation; in 2007, the oil pipelines were spun off from Duke Energy, to form part of Spectra Energy Partners.|$|E

5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, <b>petroleum</b> <b>products</b> were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of <b>petroleum</b> <b>products</b> made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E
40|$|US biofuel policy {{includes}} {{greenhouse gas}} reduction targets. Regulators {{do not address}} the potential that biofuel policy can have indirect impacts on greenhouse gases through its impacts on <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> markets, and scientific research only partially addresses this question. We use economic models of US biofuel and agricultural markets and US and world <b>petroleum</b> and <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> markets to show that discontinuing biofuel tax credits and ethanol tariff lower biofuel use could lead to increased US <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> use, {{and a reduction in}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> use {{in other parts of the}} world. The net effect is lower greenhouse gas emissions. Under certain assumptions, we show that biofuel use mandate elimination can have positive or negative impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude and the direction of effects depend on how US biofuel trade affects biofuel in other countries with different emissions, context that determines how important use mandates are in the first place, who pays mandate costs, and the price responsiveness of global petroleum supplies and uses. However, our results show that counter-intuitive effects are possible and discourage broad conclusions about the greenhouse gas impacts of removing these elements of US biofuel policy.

5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby {{for the bulk}} storage of <b>petroleum</b> <b>products,</b> so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E

Storage tank location The most important aspect of your liquid petroleum storage tank location is how close it is to your drinking water well. Even though diesel fuel and fuel oil are more dense than gasoline and move more slowly through the soil, they can eventually reach groundwater. Thus, close proximity of petroleum storage to a well is a potentially hazardous practice. How quickly the <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> reaches groundwater will depend upon local soils. Every site has unique geologic and hydrologic conditions that can affect groundwater movement. The more porous the soil (sands and gravels, for example), the faster the rate of downward movement to groundwater. Locate a new tank more than 100 feet away from your well to provide reasonable assurance that subsurface flow or seepage of contaminated groundwater will not reach your well. If possible, the tank should be located downslope from the well. Figure 1 illustrates <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> seepage into soils...|$|R
