40|$|The {{levels of}} {{cytopathic}} enteroviruses at two wastewater-treatment works were monitored {{over a period}} of 9 months. The maximum level of virus at works 1 was 72500 p. f. u. l- 1 and at works 2, 57500 p. f. u. l- 1. Examination of process efficiency showed an overall reduction of 63 % for works 1 and 26 % for works 2 when used without lagooning. When lagooning was employed at the second works, virus reduction was 97 %. Individual treatment processes showed poor reduction of virus levels. Sedimentation and rapid sand filtration had no significant effect on levels whilst both <b>percolating</b> <b>filtration</b> and activated sludge showed some reduction. Only lagooning resulted in substantial reductions of virus levels...|$|E
