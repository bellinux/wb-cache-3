The fiscal deficit narrowed from 6. 5 percent of GDP in 2002 to near balance in 2003, while a tighter monetary policy helped to reduce inflation from 28 percent in 2002 to 13 percent in 2003. The financial system has become increasingly dollarized in recent years, reflecting the lingering effects on confidence of earlier episodes of price instability, as well as regulatory changes favoring foreign currency intermediation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{relationship}} between fiscal policy, aggregate <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt</b> sustainability, and debt relief. In particular, we develop a methodology to compute the fiscal policy path that is compatible with aggregate debt sustainability in the post-HIPC era (Highly Indebted Poor Countries relief initiative). This model explicitly considers the role of domestic debt, and quantifies the extent to which future debt sustainability depends on the availability of concessional loans at subsidized interest rates. The working of the model is illustrated for the cases of Honduras and Nicaragua. Both countries differ markedly in terms of the burdens of their external and internal debts. The results from our simulation analysis indicate that unless Nicaragua receives substantial concessional aid in the future, its <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt</b> is likely to become unsustainable.

40|$|Fiscal {{adjustment}} {{is an illusion}} when it lowers the budget deficit or public debt but leaves government net worth unchanged. Conventional measures of the budget deficit largely show the change in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt.</b> Ideally, the measured deficit would reflect the change in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> net worth. Many people consider it impractical to try to measure <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> assets. My paper does not discuss what the deficit should measure, but instead proposes a positive and testable theory of how governments actually behave.

40|$|The {{causes and}} {{implications}} of the developing country debt crisis - {{as well as its}} solution - all have an important fiscal dimension. The crisis was triggered by the widespread perception that the <b>public</b> <b>sectors</b> in many heavily indebted countries were effectively insolvent in the international environment of the early 1980 s. The actual fiscal response to the resulting liquidity crisis involved increased reliance on domestic financing, the inflation tax, and the curtailment of public investment. This created adverse adjustment incentives for policymakers and resulted in credit rationing, capital flight, assumption of private external claims by the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> and poor domestic investment performance. Solutions involve restoring fiscal health through a combination of debt relief and efficient fiscal adjustment, aimed at mitigating the burden associated with <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt</b> service and minimizing the liquidity problems facing the indebted <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> The <b>debt</b> and debt-service reduction (DDSR) programs implemented so far under the Brady Plan have provided only partial solutions, closing without eliminating the gap between the face value of the external debt and the present value of prospective <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt</b> service. They have done so partly by reducing the former and partly by increasing the latter. Their contribution toward easing the immediate liquidity problems of the debtors has not been encouraging. The amount of debt relief embodied in Brady Plan programs enacted so far has not in itself been sufficient to restore fiscal solvency. Better-quality fiscal adjustment could greatly help improve the situation. The most important potential contribution of such programs, then, may have been the reduction - through the policy conditionality associated with resources provided by the international financial institutions - of the secondary burden associated with the internal transfer of resources to the <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics&Finance,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Strategic Debt Management...|$|R
40|$|Polling in {{the lead}} up to Ireland’s vote on the Fiscal Stability Treaty has pointed to the {{endorsement}} of the Treaty. But will the Treaty be a positive force for Ireland, and for Europe? Simon Wren-Lewis argues that the Treaty is ultimately flawed as it treats the current crisis as stemming from massive <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debts,</b> whilst ignoring that these debts come from governments’ bailouts of banks that were under threat due to unsustainable borrowing from the private sector...|$|R
50|$|Until 1997, Colombia {{had enjoyed}} a fairly stable economy. The {{first five years}} of {{liberalization}} were characterized by high economic growth rates of between 4% and 5%. The Ernesto Samper administration (1994-98) emphasized social welfare policies which targeted Colombia's lower income population. These reforms led to higher government spending which increased the fiscal deficit and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>debt,</b> the financing of which required higher interest rates. An over-valued peso inherited from the previous administration was maintained.|$|R
40|$|The {{ending of}} the civil war has brought to the fore the need to {{reconstruct}} the Angolan economy and address the problem of widespread poverty. A strong medium-term fiscal adjustment effort, including a reduction of the National Bank of Angola's operational deficit, is needed. The government should pursue a much more prudent foreign borrowing policy to avoid a worsening of the external debt burden. A tighter macroeconomic policy accompanied by a decisive structural reform is needed to foster economic diversification, create employment opportunities, and increase productivity.
