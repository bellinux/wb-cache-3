5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> point.|$|E
5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E
5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the age-related changes in anaerobic power in the former highly trained oarsmen and kayakers, i. e. the representatives of sports requiring high endurance capacity and strength. Sixty-six former athletes, aged 30 - 67 years participated in this study. The subjects were assessed for <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> in arms (Pan arms) and legs (Pan legs) during 10 s- maximal cycle ergometer exercise tests and for <b>peak</b> aerobic <b>power</b> (PVO 2 max) during incremental exercise. Body mass, lean body mass and body fat content were measured as well. The <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> decline in the former highly trained athletes examined in the present study equalled to 0. 6 - 0. 7 % per year. The recreational physical activity, based primarily on the endurance exercises, did not affect the <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> whereas the <b>peak</b> aerobic <b>power</b> and body fat content strongly depended on the age and physical activity. The <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> in the upper and lower extremities exhibited similar reduction with age of the subjects. Furthermore, in the less active group the ratio of Pan legs to PVO 2 max did not change with age whereas in physically active subjects this index increased. It was concluded that in the sample of former highly trained oarsmen and kayakers the age-related decline in the <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> approximated that reported by other authors for untrained or endurance trained subjects, the <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> in the arms was almost the same as that in the legs and that in the less active group the ratio of the <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> to the <b>peak</b> aerobic <b>power</b> was independent of age and strongly tended to increase in the physically active subjects...|$|R
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

Introduction: Q-switched fibre lasers were first developed in 1986 [1], and the advances achieved since then have been largely due to improvements in acousto-optic modulator design, advances in pump laser technology [2], the use of more efficient modulators [3, 4], and advantages gained with co-doped systems such as Er/Yb [5]. In this paper we report advances in Q-switched laser performance by focusing on a nove...|$|R
