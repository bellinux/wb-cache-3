40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and physiology}} of pheromone receptors on the antennae of male <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies,</b> Diprion pini L., were investigated. Using scanning electron microscopy, five sensillar types were recognized. The type {{shown to be}} pheromone sensitive has a long (50 - 70 mu m) cuticular hair, is single-walled, and is innervated by 8 or 9 sensory cells as revealed by transmission electronmicroscopy. Electroantennography (EAG) showed similar activity of the acetate and propionate of (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tridecanol, precursor of the main constituent of the female-produced sex pheromone. No other isomer induced any significant response. Single-sensillum recordings confirmed {{the results of the}} EAG, and also showed that several neurons were excited by the active compound. EAG recordings and combined gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection indicated that esters of three 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -pentadecanol (diprionol) isomers were active, but field tests could not demonstrate any behavioural effect. Diprionol esters are used as sex pheromones by all other <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies</b> investigated so far, and D. pini is thus the first diprionid species shown to use a different sex pheromone...|$|R

5000|$|Sawflies {{are major}} {{economic}} pests of forestry. For example, {{species in the}} Diprionidae, such as the <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies,</b> Diprion pini and Neodiprion sertifer, cause serious damage to pines in regions such as Scandinavia. D. pini larvae defoliated 500,000 ha in the largest outbreak in Finland, between 1998 and 2001. Up to 75% of the trees may die after such outbreaks, as D. pini can remove all the leaves late in the growing season, leaving the trees too weak to survive the winter. Little damage to trees only occurs when the tree is large or when there is minimal presence of larvae. Eucalyptus trees can regenerate quickly from damage inflicted by the larvae; however, they can be substantially damaged from outbreaks, {{especially if they are}} young. The trees can be defoliated completely and may cause [...] "dieback", stunting or even death.|$|R

Releases were done at three distances; either at 5 m from one trap, or at 50 or 200 m from five traps, placed in a line perpendicular to the current wind direction. As control, males were released identically but without any pheromone source present. The behaviour of the males prior to take-off was studied. A total of 1729 males were released, and 80 % of them took flight. Males took off significantly faster {{in the presence of}} pheromone. Grooming was significantly more frequent in presence of pheromone compared with control. In all pheromone experiments significantly more males displayed grooming, wing fanning and take-off towards the wind compared with the control. Weather data was simultaneously collected at the study site. Wing fanning was negatively correlated with wind speed. Grooming was not influenced by wind speed. Reduced levels of incoming short-wave radiation lowered the take-off frequency significantly.

40|$|During outbreaks, Microdiprion pallipes (Fall.) is {{the most}} {{destructive}} of the <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies</b> in Sweden. Its distribution includes most provinces, but damaging outbreaks have until recently occurred only in two inland areas in northern Sweden. These areas are characterised by high elevation, a harsh climate, and slow tree growth. The four recorded outbreak periods showed a 10 year periodicity. Outside these areas, a lesser outbreak occurred in 1988 to 1990, {{on the east coast}} (province of Uppland). Outbreak patterns, life history variation, and mortality factors were studied. Factors that may explain the distribution of outbreaks and the population patterns were identified. Experimental and observational evidence on the potential of various factors to influence fecundity, dispersal, and survival was evaluated. In the outbreak areas, there were few major population factors. Parasitism by Rhorus substitutor (Thunb.) was the largest cause of larval mortality and the only important density dependent mortality factor. The different diapause strategies of M. pallipes and R. substitutor may contribute to stabilise this system. Different flight periods of the host and the parasitoid may explain a possible correlation between weather and outbreaks. Elsewhere in Sweden, where low population densities prevail, there may be similarities in population processes between M. pallipes and the other widely distributed diprionids with solitary larvae, which never have attained outbreak densities in Sweden. Interactions with other diprionids through shared natural enemies may be an important population process and may influence the distribution of outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} flavonoids, a {{subgroup}} of phenolic compounds produced by plants, {{and how they}} affect the herbivorous larvae of lepidopterans and sawflies. The {{first part of the}} literature review examines different techniques to analyze the chemical structures of flavonoids and their concentrations in biological samples. These techniques include, for example, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The second part of the literature review studies how phenolic compounds function in the metabolism of larvae. The harmful oxidation reactions of phenolic compounds in insect guts are also emphasized. In addition to the negative effects, many insect species have evolved the use of phenolic compounds for their own benefit. In the experimental part of the thesis, high concentrations of complex flavonoid oligoglycosides were found in the hemolymph (the circulatory fluid of insects) of birch and <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies.</b> The larvae produced these compounds from simple flavonoid precursors present in the birch leaves and pine needles. Flavonoid glycosides were also found in the cocoon walls of sawflies, which suggested that flavonoids were used in the construction of cocoons. The second part of the experimental work studied the modifications of phenolic compounds in conditions that mimicked the alkaline guts of lepidopteran larvae. It was found that the 24 plant species studied and their individual phenolic compounds had variable capacities to function as oxidative defenses in alkaline conditions. The excrements of lepidopteran and sawfly species were studied to see how different types of phenolics were processed by the larvae. These results suggested that phenolic compounds were oxidized, hydrolyzed, or modified in other ways during their passage through the digestive tract of the larvae...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} new methods for thepreparation of enantiomerically pure methyl branched alkylcompounds and their use as building blocks in the synthesis ofstereoisomerically pure pheromones of <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies.</b> The high regioselectivity, enantioselectivity and activityof lipases in organic solvent in conjunction withenvironmentally compatible reaction conditions have madelipase-catalysed synthesis an attractive alternative toconventional synthetic methods in organic chemistry. The lipasefromPseudomonas cepacia(PCL) was used in kineticresolutions of primary 2 - methylalcohols by acylation of thealcohols with vinyl acetate/vinyl butyrate. For alcoholsstudied, PCL showed moderate enantioselectivity(E= 10 - 20) towards 3 -alkyl- or 3 - cycloalkylsubstitutedprimary 2 -methylpropanols, whereas 3 -aryl- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanolswere accepted with high E-values(E> 100). Esterification of substituted methylcarboxylic acids withprimary alcohols catalysed byCandida rugosalipase (CRL) was found to be anenantioselective reaction. In general, CRL showed highselectivity towards(S) - 2 -methylcarboxylic acids(E= 15 - 70) and also towards(R) - 3 -methylcarboxylic acids(E= 15 - 40). For substrates having a double bond located 5 - 6 bonds from the carbonyl moiety a two-fold enhancement ofenantioselectivity value(E-value) was obtained compared to their saturatedanalogues,E≈ 15 - 25. Furthermore, the enantioselectivity of CRL towards a seriesof 3 - to 8 -methyldecanoic acids were studied. CRL surprisinglyshowed enantiorecognition for all of these acids within theE-value range of 2. 3 - 68. Interestingly, whereas the lipaseshowed S-preference when the methyl group was situated ateven-numbered carbons, R-preference was observed for thesubstrates with the methyl group at odd-numbered carbons. In order to establish the stereoisomeric composition of thenatural sex pheromone of the pine sawflyMicrodiprion pallipes, all sixteen individual isomers of 3, 7, 11 -trimethyl- 2 -tridecanol (and their propionate esters) found in this species were synthesised in highdiastereoisomeric purities, 95. 3 - 97. 6 %. The syntheses werebased on six enantiomerically pure building blocks, the fourstereoisomers of 1 -lithio- 2, 6 -dimethyloctane and the twoenantiomers ofcis- 3, 4 - dimethyl-g-butyrolactone.

It affects the Scots, mountain, eastern white, radiata, lodgepole and black pines. Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.|$|E
50|$|Mound-building, forest-dwelling Formica spp. such as F. rufa {{often have}} a {{considerable}} effect on their environments.

In fact in many countries they are introduced in forests to control tree pests, such as swains jack <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> and eastern tent caterpillars in North America. The effects of mound-building grassland species such as F. montana are not well-studied, but their local abundance, conspicuous mound-building and very frequent association with aphids and membracids points to a comparably important ecological role.|$|E
50|$|Adult sawflies are short-lived, {{with a life}} {{expectancy}} of 7-9 days, though the larval stage can last from months to years, depending on the species. Parthenogenetic females, which {{do not need to}} mate to produce fertilised eggs, are common in the suborder, though many species have males. Sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages - egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female uses her ovipositor to drill into plant material (or, in the case of Orussoidea, other insects) and then lays eggs in groups called rafts or pods. After hatching, larvae feed on plants, often in groups. As they approach adulthood, the larvae seek a protected spot to pupate, typically in bark or the soil. Large populations of species such as the <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> can cause substantial damage to economic forestry, while others such as the iris sawfly are important pests in horticulture. Outbreaks of sawfly larvae can defoliate trees and may cause dieback, stunting or death. Sawflies can be controlled through the use of insecticides, natural predators and parasites, or mechanical methods.|$|E
