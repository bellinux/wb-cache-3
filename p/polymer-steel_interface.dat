40|$|A novel {{integrated}} framework is presented for {{the prediction of}} deformation-induced interface roughening and failure in polymer-coated steels. Crystal plasticity is employed to predict the change in steel surface roughness in-situ. The steel substrate is coated with a thin polymer layer and the <b>polymer-steel</b> <b>interface</b> is modeled using an exponential cohesive zone law. Uniaxial tensile simulations are performed and {{the results show that}} the predicted roughness increases with the applied deformation. The local changes in the steel surface profile result in initiation and growth of local interface failure. Furthermore, a compression simulation shows that the roughening rate of the steel is increased compared to tension, with an increase in the predicted interface damage as a result. The presented framework thus allows for a detailed numerical study of the initiation and growth of interface damage in polymer-coated steels during applied deformation. The incorporation of the crystal plasticity model to predict the changes in the steel surface profile complements the cumbersome measurements of detailed experimental displacement fields that accompany deformation-induced roughening and thus enables the analysis of deformation processes where measuring the steel surface profile is difficult if not impossible, e. g. industrial forming processes such as deep-drawing...|$|E
40|$|A numerical–experimental {{method is}} {{presented}} to study the initiation and growth of interface damage in polymer–steel interfaces subjected to deformation-induced steel surface roughening. The experimentally determined displacement field of an evolving steel surface is applied to a numerical model consisting of a polymer coating and interface layer. The measured displacement field is obtained with a Finite Element based Digital Image Correlation method. The resulting simulations provide novel insights into the mechanical behaviour of the <b>polymer–steel</b> <b>interface</b> during interface roughening. The appearance of local hills and valleys on the evolving steel surface results in local bands of intensified stress in the polymer layer. These localized deformation bands trigger interface damage, which grows as the surface deformation increases. Polymer ageing initially delays the initiation of interface damage. However, for increased polymer ages the average interface damage increases. Likewise, the critical strain, at which the interface integrity is locally compromised, decreases. The presented method allows for a detailed study of the interface integrity during deformation-induced steel surface roughening. With properly identified material parameters, it becomes possible to tailor the polymer–steel material properties to minimize interface damage during production and storage of cans or canisters, e. g. for food and beverages...|$|E
