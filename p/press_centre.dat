5|$|The Main Media Centre of the 2010 Commonwealth Games managed media-related activities, and {{comprised}} the International Broadcasting Centre and the Main <b>Press</b> <b>Centre.</b> It {{was set up}} in close proximity to the Games Village and the main venues at Pragati Maidan. State owned agencies managed both centres, with host broadcaster Prasar Bharti managing the International Broadcasting Centre and the Press Information Bureau managing the Main <b>Press</b> <b>Centre.</b> It was believed that by the time the Games are held, New Delhi would stop analogue broadcast and begin digital broadcast through a conditional access system, for which it is the first city in India to do so.|$|E
5|$|Tange further {{developed}} his ideas for expandable urban forms in 1966 when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and <b>Press</b> <b>Centre</b> in Kōfu. It {{was designed for}} three media companies: a newspaper printing plant, a radio station and a television studio. To allow for future expansion Tange grouped the similar functions of three offices together in three zones. The newspaper printing machinery {{was on the ground}} floor, sealed studios on the upper floors and offices on glass walled floors surrounded by balconies. The services, including stairs and lifts, are housed in 16reinforced concrete columns that are of five-metre (17ft) diameter. Space was left between the cluster of functional space to allow for future expansion, although these have been used for gardens and terraces.|$|E
50|$|Interest in Mrs. Oliphant's work {{declined}} in the 20th century. In the mid-1980s, a small-scale revival was led by the publishers Alan Sutton and Virago <b>Press,</b> <b>centred</b> on the Carlingford series and some similarities of subject-matter {{with the work of}} Anthony Trollope.|$|R

5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{proposed}} to hold all sporting events {{within the city}} limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would {{be held in the}} cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible. The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park. The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main <b>Press</b> <b>Centre</b> (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which is the core of the project and includes the largest number of competition venues. A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios. There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC. The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an Olympic Village Training Center, an Olympic Village Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and team officials, including accredited additional officials.|$|E

50|$|In 1942 he was {{appointed}} by Prime Minister John Curtin as minister to the Soviet Union, the first Australian diplomatic representative to the country. En route to his new appointment he visited the United States, eventually arriving in the Soviet Union in late 1942. He took residence in Kuybyshev in January 1943. After falling ill in April 1943 he returned to Australia in June. Although the official reason given for his early return was illness, speculation in the Australian <b>press</b> <b>centred</b> on a disillusionment with the Soviet version of Socialism.|$|R

25|$|The {{exact nature}} of Fitnas release was {{uncertain}} up until its official launch. This was due to concerns of the legality of its content and anticipated acts of terrorism. The Dutch <b>press</b> <b>centre</b> Nieuwspoort offered to release the film, {{on the condition that}} Wilders would pay for the increased security required during the press conference and the weeks after it. Wilders declined to do so, citing prohibitive costs.|$|E

The organisers claimed that 3,000 new permanent jobs would be created, but opponents of the games were concerned that some of the 11,000 existing jobs in the Olympic Zone may be lost. It was also hoped {{that there will be a}} wider economic effect from the improvements which the games might make to London's image.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2010 Thomas Schreiber, {{coordinator}} at ARD, outlined details of Düsseldorf's event concept. The Esprit Arena {{was to be}} split in two parts separated from each other. On {{one side of the}} stadium the stage would be installed while the other side would function as background dressing rooms for the artist delegations. An athletics arena next to the Esprit Arena would serve as the <b>press</b> <b>centre</b> for the event. The Esprit Arena offered comfortable seats relatively near to the stage that created an indoor event arena atmosphere rather than a football-stadium ambiance. There were plans to allow the public the chance to attend the dress rehearsals. Altogether, tickets were sold for seven shows (the final, two semi-finals and four dress rehearsals).|$|E
