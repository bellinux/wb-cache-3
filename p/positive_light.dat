Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{although}} both organizational pride in employees’ efforts and organizational pride in employees’ abilities were positively connected with organizational commitment and thereby, proactive behaviors, they had opposing direct effects on proactive behaviors. Whereas organizational pride in employees’ efforts {{was positively related}} with individual and team member proactivity, organizational pride in employees’ abilities was negatively related with proactive behaviors. Although these direct effects were relatively weak, they indicate that organizational pride can indeed have negative effects in seeing one’s organization in too <b>positive</b> <b>lights</b> (Tangirala and Ramanujam 2008) and impeding constructive change. This finding is particularly notable as researchers and practitioners alike so far predominantly focused on the advantages of organizational pride.|$|R

Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts.

Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E

The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic.

Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most likely would have been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of}} the series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to portray animals as having human traits was not new; Aesop's moralistic animal tales were still popular with {{readers of the}} day, and inspired such works as Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, for example, {{told the story of}} a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against animal cruelty. The budding animal welfare movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a <b>positive</b> <b>light.</b> One popular nature writer of the day, Mabel Osgood Wright, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.|$|E

40|$|Pre {{peer review}} versionAwaiting publicationThe chapter {{focuses on the}} 1959 film The Thirty-Nine Steps, its detective figure Richard Hannay and its medium- or witch-figure Nellie Lumsden. Noting the unusual {{collaboration}} between two character types normally opposed in Victorian and post-Victorian fiction, it argues that in the 1950 s {{the character of the}} medium began to be seen in a new light. Following a change in the law in 1951, mediums were no longer being prosecuted under anti-witchcraft legislation by 1959 and it was recognised that such a definition of their practices was unhelpful. Accordingly, Nellie Lumsden offers a model for contemporary and future understandings of mediums, pagans and witches in <b>positive</b> <b>lights,</b> whilst correspondingly detectives suffered a diminution in authority and respect. Further examples include the novel Ritual (1967) and the film The Wicker Man (1973), although counter examples such as the film Seance on a Wet Afternoon (1964) also exist. The Thirty-Nine Steps, however, presents a near-perfect inversion of expected stereotypes of medium and detective, suggesting the reworking and challenging of Victorian ideas in mid-twentieth century Britain. These ideas include racial and national stereotypes of “Celtic” areas of Britain, as well as expectations of gender, class, authority, reason and faith...|$|R

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{propagation of}} heavy-ion-acoustic (HIA) waves (HIAWs) in a four component multi-ion plasma (containing inertial heavy negative ions and <b>light</b> <b>positive</b> ions, {{as well as}} inertialess nonextensive electrons and positrons) has been theoretically investigated. The nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation is derived by employing the reductive perturbation method. It is found that the NLS equation leads to the modulational instability (MI) of HIAWs, and {{to the formation of}} HIA rogue waves (HIARWs), which are due to the effects of nonlinearity and dispersion in the propagation of HIAWs. The conditions for MI of HIAWs, and the basic properties of the generated HIARWs are identified. It is observed that the striking features (viz. instability criteria, growth rate of MI, amplitude and width of HIARWs, etc.) of the HIAWs are significantly modified by effects of nonextensivity of electrons and positrons, ratio of <b>light</b> <b>positive</b> ion mass to heavy negative ion mass, ratio of electron number density to <b>light</b> <b>positive</b> ion number density, and ratio of electron temperature to positron temperature, etc. The relevancy of our present investigation to the observations in the space (viz. cometary comae and earth's ionosphere) and laboratory (laser plasma interaction experimental devices) plasmas is pointed out.
