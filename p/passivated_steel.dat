It was also shown that the experimentally observed anodic peak was not the usually obtained anodic passivation peak, {{as is the case}} with a number of metal, but an artifact due to the anodic oxidation of hydrogen absorbed during the previously employed cathodic polarization and hydrogen evolution, intended to activate the initially passive surface, or even hydrogen absorbed on the open circuit potential.

Carbon steel presents a wide passive anodic region (0. 0 - 0. 9 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), while those of chromium steel and HSS, either as-received or heat-treated, are narrower because of transpassive anodic dissolution of Cr above ~ 0. 4 V.

40|$|Hydrogen {{permeation}} i a {{high strength}} ferritic steel {{was shown to}} depend on the passivity of the surface and the presence of HfS. In the case where HfS is not present, an oxide {{on the surface of the}} steel reduced the kinetics of the proton discharge rate and, even more so, the kinetics of the molecular hydrogen evolution rate. Thus, a high percent-age of hydrogen permeated the steel. After the oxide was removed, there was an increased proton discharge rate and an equally increased hydrogen evolution rate. thus resulting in very low percentage of hydrogen permeation. When H~S was present, the hydrogen discharge reaction remained high but the recombination reaction was suppressed so the percent of permeation was very high. Thus, HfS plays a multiple role in increasing hydrogen permeation of <b>passivated</b> <b>steel</b> in slightly acidic environments. It increases the rates of iron corrosion and proton discharge and poisons the hydrogen evolution react'ion on the depassivated surface, thereby permitting a large fraction of hydrogen atoms to enter the metal.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} cathodic protection of steel in reinforced concrete is developed. Parameters are set to represent a three-dimensional section of a bridge beam exposed to the atmosphere and coated with a thermally sprayed zinc anode. Both diffusion of oxygen and conduction of charge within the concrete are considered explicitly through a two-dimensional finite element model. The diffusivity and conductivity are represented as functions of concrete moisture content. Electrochemical reactions considered at the rebar-concrete interface are reduction of oxygen, oxidation of iron, and evolution of hydrogen in a constant-potential cathodic protection circuit. Reaction-kinetic parameters for actively corroding steel (not <b>passivated</b> <b>steel)</b> are used. Reactions at the zinc-concrete interface are not considered explicitly. The effectiveness of protection is found to vary significantly with both concrete moisture content and position on the rebar. For spatially uniform pore saturation, the drier the concrete is, the greater the corrosion current and the greater the non-uniformity. Protection is significantly more effective at the "front" of the rebar (closest to the zinc anode) than at the "back" (closest {{to the center of}} the beam). Corrosion current is greater under drying conditions than under wetting conditions. The {{numerical model}} is applied towards interpretation of the " 100 -mV polarization decay criterion" that is often used to assess the effectiveness of cathodic protection. It is found that the polarization decay predicted from relaxation of oxygen concentration gradients was comparable in magnitude to that observed experimentally, but depends on location on the rebar. A numerical model for the transport of ions in porous concrete under cathodic protection is presented. In this initial model, transport of the ions zinc, calcium, chloride and hydroxide is described by a one-dimensional Nernst-Planck equation at constant current density with generation of zinc ions at the anodic interface, generation of hydroxide ions at the cathodic interface, and no chemical reactions in the bulk of the concrete. The equations are solved numerically by two methods: the point method, in which concentrations and electric potentials are solved for directly through finite-difference approximations of the differential equations and the box method, in which the domain is divided into discrete volume elements with flux balances for each chemical component and for charge. A base grid of 41 nodes is used. Results for the system after 96 and 9600 days of cathodic protection are discussed. Both numerical methods yielded concentration profiles that are virtually indistinguishable. Numerical noise in the box method leads to values in the first and second derivatives of the electric potential that tend to oscillate around the central values represented by the same smooth curve of the point method. In contrast, the point method shows greater apparent numerical deviation from electroneutrality which is largest near the boundaries and decays towards the center in damped oscillations. The deviations decrease with smaller size of grid elements and higher order difference approximations. The magnitude of the charge density in the bulk of the concrete calculated from the second derivative of the electric potential through Poisson's equation is shown to be negligible compared to the overall electroneutrality calculated from the concentrations of ions. At 96 days, the relative contributions of migration and diffusion to the overall flux are shown to vary widely with position and species; migration can neither be neglected nor can a "corrected" Fick's law approach be used. Zinc ions are found to have moved approximately 15 mm into the bulk of the concrete at 96 days...|$|E

A major challenge faced by the construction industry in adopting geopolymer material is the variability of fly ash from different sources, which affects the properties of the geopolymer concrete produced.

Sampling one set of containers after about one month of tritium exposure revealed the impurity level to be nearly the same as that {{after more than a year}} of exposure - this result suggests that cleaning new stainless steel components by tritium gas contact for about a month may be a worthy operation...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{control of}} {{electrogalvanized}} steel employing Cr VI based treatments is widely known and studied. However, {{researchers have been}} trying to find out alternatives to replace these salts once they must be banned in accord to environmental and industrial guidelines. Cr III – based conversion coatings have shown performance compatible to Cr VI – based treatments. In this work, EIS measurements are performed in NaCl 0, 05 mol/L and Na 2 SO 4 0, 1 mol/L, during the immersion time, to evaluate the corrosion resistance of electrogalvanized <b>steel</b> <b>passivated</b> with Cr III – based conversion treatment and painted with three different organic coatings. The organic coatings are characterized by their adherence. The results show a similar behavior for the three coatings and, despite a second constant time has been pointed by the EIS fitting, the R 2 values indicate a low corrosion rate. The system Zn – Cr III – organic coating is compatible to the system Zn – Cr VI – organic coating, for the immersion period considered...|$|R

ABSTRACT (Maxtemur 200 words) Conductive polymer coatings were deposited on steel and titanium substrates by elec-trooxidative polymerization of poly(3 -methylthiophene). The properties of the poly-mer coatings in acidic, basic and chloride containing solutions were evaluated by electranalytic means, and the effectiveness of the coatings in providing anodic pro-tection of the substrate were evaluated. The polymer contains a reversible couple with an equilibrium potential near 0. 4 V positive of Ag/AgCl sat'd KCl. It is effec-tive in <b>passivating</b> 430 stainless <b>steel</b> and titanium in sulfuric acid solution at temperatures below 5 OC. Excursions of potential negative of- 0. 3 V result in irre-versible reduction of the polymer to a nonconductive state. The polymer is also rendered permanently inactive by basic solutions and by chloride...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the addition of cerium (IV) ions on the anticorrosion properties of organic-inorganic hybrid coatings applied to <b>passivated</b> tin coated <b>steel.</b> In order to evaluate the specific effect of cerium (IV) addition on nanostructural features of the organic and inorganic phases of the hybrid coating, the hydrolytic polycondensation of silicon alkoxide and the radical polymerization of the methyl methacrylate (MMA) function were induced separately. The corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated by means of linear polarization, Tafel type curves and electrochemical impedance measurements. The impedance results obtained for the hybrid coatings were discussed based on an electrical equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data. The electrochemical results clearly showed the improvement of the protective properties of the organic-inorganic hybrid coating mainly when the cerium (IV) was added to the organic phase solution precursor, which seemed to be due to the formation of a more uniform and densely reticulated siloxane-PMMA film.

40|$|The {{thermal power}} station (TPS) is the {{investigation}} object. The work is aimed at the calculated-experimental investigation of the corrosion process and carbon <b>steel</b> <b>passivating</b> in the desalted water stream with different content of the dissolved gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia) at temperatures up to 600 K, pressures 1 and 200 atm anl in initial stage during 6. 5 h. The following methods and equipment have been used: electron-diffraction examination, Auger-electron spectroscopy, gravimetry, spectrophotometry, EP- 100 electron diffractometer, Auger-spectrometer "Balzers". First, the phase composition and thickness of the oxide films on the steel forming in the conditions modelling the hot water-oxygen treatment (HWOT) have been determined; the character and speed of the acid corrosion during initial 6. 5 h have been investigated and determined. First, the experimental data on the carbon acid steel at HWOT have been obtained that permits to optimize HWOT regime by a establishing the necessary pH water values. HWOT and optimizing investigation results have been investigated at development of HWOT variant of power unit circuit.
