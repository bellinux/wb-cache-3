40|$|The liner {{plays an}} {{important}} role in controlling migration of contaminants present in the leachate in waste containment systems such as land fills and impoundments. Although questions have been raised about the performance of clay liners, they are increasingly used singly or as double liners in disposal sites. Though the clay liners possess many advantages such as low permeability and large attenuative capacity, they also possess high shrinkage potential and hence can crack under unsaturated conditions causing instability and increase in leakage rates. Further, the permeability of the clay linear can increase due to clay–pollutant interaction. This study examines the potential of <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ash</b> as a hydraulic barrier in land fill. The behaviour of three different types of fly ashes, showing a range of physical properties and chemical composition from three different sources are reported in the study. Geotechnical properties, needed to evaluate the use of fly ashes as barriers, such as shrinkage, compaction, permeability, consolidation and strength characteristics are reported. The results show that fly ashes possess low shrinkage and hence do not crack. Compacted fly ashes undergo very little volume changes. They also show that <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ashes</b> develop good strength properties with time. <b>Pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ashes</b> containing sufficient lime develop strength even without addition of lime. Non-pozzolanic fly ashes do not develop strength even on addition of lime. Fly ashes generally consist of silt size particles and consequently possess high permeability. However, <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ashes</b> with lime exhibit low permeability on curing because of the formation of gelatinous compounds which block the pores. Thus, <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ashes</b> appear to be promising for construction of liners to contain alkaline leachate...|$|R

50|$|Pozzolana, {{also known}} as <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>ash</b> (pulvis puteolanus in Latin), is a {{siliceous}} or siliceous and aluminous material which reacts with calcium hydroxide {{in the presence of}} water at room temperature (cf. pozzolanic reaction).

The designation pozzolana is derived from one of the primary deposits of volcanic ash used by the Romans in Italy, at Pozzuoli. Nowadays the definition of pozzolana encompasses any volcanic material (pumice or volcanic ash), predominantly composed of fine volcanic glass, that is used as a pozzolan. Note the difference with the term pozzolan, which exerts no bearing on the specific origin of the material, as opposed to pozzolana, which can only be used for pozzolans of volcanic origin, primarily composed of volcanic glass.|$|R

Proximate analysis by thermogravimetry was carried out to cover volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content of the different straws. Detailed measurements of X-ray diffraction, oxide percentages, loss on ignition, and BET specific surface area were performed to compare hot water washed, acid leached, and non-pretreated ashes, after controlled processes of burning and grinding. The pozzolanic activity of the ashes was evaluated from the modified Chapelle and electrical conductivity methods.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} early ages of {{hydration}} behavior when basaltic volcanic ash {{was used as}} a partial substitute to ordinary Portland cement using ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The mix design consisted of 10, 30 and 50 % substitution of Portland cement with two different-sized volcanic ashes. The data showed that substitution of volcanic ash above 30 % results in excess unreacted volcanic ash, rather than additional pozzolanic reactions along longer length scales. WAXS studies revealed that addition of finely ground volcanic ash facilitated calcium-silicate-hydrate related phases, whereas inclusion of coarser volcanic ash caused domination by calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate and unreacted MgO phases, suggesting some volcanic ash remained unreacted throughout the hydration process. Addition of more than 30 % volcanic ash leads to coarser morphology along with decreased surface area and higher intensity of scattering at early-age hydration. This suggests an abrupt dissolution indicated by changes in surface area due to the retarding gel formation that can have implication on early-age setting influencing the mechanical properties of the resulting cementitious matrix. The findings from this work show that the concentration of volcanic ash influences the specific surface area and morphology of hydration products during the early age of hydration. Hence, natural <b>pozzolanic</b> volcanic <b>ashes</b> can be a viable substitute to Portland cement by providing environmental benefits in terms of lower-carbon footprint along with long-term durability...|$|R

The effect of gradual decomposition of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel was examined using Raman spectroscopy and Magic Angle Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR), while the mechanical properties were determined using nanoindentation and compression tests. Exposure to magnesium sulfate solution led to formation of magnesium-silicate-hydrate (M-S-H) along with crystallization of gypsum and brucite, while exposure to sodium sulfates led to the formation of thenardite and mirabilite. An optimum mix combination of 10 - 30 % partial substitution of volcanic ash was determined for optimal sulfate resistance and compressive strength.

This study focuses on the apparent chloride diffusion coefficients, as well as chloride binding isotherms which are obtained by the profile method. In addition, some aspects of the microstructure and of the pore structure are investigated, by using Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry and 27 Al NMR, in order to better understand the results obtained relatively to the apparent chloride diffusion coefficients and to the chloride binding. Chloride ingress increases when sulphates are present in the contact solution for all cement materials tested (partially carbonated or not). In addition, chloride ingress is faster when the material is partially carbonated before contact with chloride solution. It appears that both carbonation or presence of sulphate decrease chloride binding, thus explaining the results.

Grinding aids are divided into two groups, Process grinding aids (PGA), used for improving grinding efficiency, and Enhancing grinding aids (EGA), used for enhancing cement performance in addition to improving grinding efficiency. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, experimental work is presented. As the basis CEM V/A (S-V- L) 42, 5 N LH type of cement or étalon, was used. A comparison of 13 grinding aids of different manufacturers was conducted. The following characteristics were tested: “ specific surface and fineness of cement, workability of cement paste, standard consistency, initial and final setting time, soundness of cement paste, early and late (after 28 days) flexuval and bending strength”. According to the results of the test, three of the best grinding aids were selected on the basis of effect versus price ratio...|$|R
40|$|Sub-surface soil {{pollution}} by various processes with {{high concentration of}} contaminants can significantly alter geotechnical properties of soils causing unexpected failures of structures founded on them. The changes can occur due to alteration in soil water interaction processes and/or by intense chemical interactions leading to mineralogical and microstructural changes. Behaviour of soil upon contamination with alkali pollutant {{is one of the}} major concerns faced by the geotechnical researchers in recent years. In the present study an attempt has been made to understand the role of mineralogical and morphological changes on the volume change (swelling and compressibility) behaviour of soils by prolonged interaction with caustic alkali pollutant. Based on the results it has been proposed to develop remedial measures to nullify and/or control the detrimental effects. A comprehensive experimental program has been planned to achieve these objectives. The experimental investigations carried out and results obtained are presented in eight chapters as follows. The broad outline of thesis is given in Chapter 1. A detailed review of literature on the type of phyllosilicate minerals present in various soils is presented in Chapter 2 with a view to select most common soils for the study. Various sources of contaminants and their effect on the properties of soils have been summarised. Present understanding on the mechanisms leading to changes in the soil properties has been elucidated. The occurrence of alkali contamination has been reviewed in this chapter which enabled to select the ranges of alkali concentration for the study. Based on the review of various methods employed to improve the soil behaviour, the use of salt solutions such as potassium chloride (KCl) and magnesium chloride (MgClB 2 B) and <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ash</b> has been considered to counteract the alkali effects. Based on this detailed survey, the scope of the present investigation has been elaborated at the end of the chapter. Chapter 3 presents different materials used and various methods adapted in the current study. Three soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study to bring out the effect of alkali solutions on their volume change behaviour. While two soils were classified as CH, the third one was of CL. The CH soils used in this study are called Black Cotton Soils in India. One soil contained predominantly mixed layer illite-smectite mineral (BCS I) and the other contained predominantly montmorillonite mineral (BCS M). The locally available CL soil used is referred as red earth (RE) whose predominant mineral is kaolinite. Alkali solutions of concentration ranging from 1 N to 4 N are prepared using sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH). Slat solutions viz. potassium chloride and magnesium chloride and <b>pozzolanic</b> fly <b>ash</b> obtained from Neyveli thermal power plant (NFA) are used as additives. Procedures to determine the geotechnical properties of the soils such as Atterberg limits, specific gravity, grain size distribution and compaction characteristics are given in this chapter. Procedures for identifying the mineral and microstructure of the soils such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are also presented in this chapter. Standard oedometer tests with fixed ring apparatus were performed to study the volume change behaviour of soils under various conditions. Volume change behaviour of soils in the presence of alkali solutions is presented in Chapter 4. In order to assess the effect of alkali solution on the volume change behaviour of soils it is necessary to study their behaviour in water. Relatively very high swell was observed in BCS M, whereas the swell in RE and BCS I soil specimens was very low and moderate respectively. Adsorption of water to form diffuse double layer near the negative surface of clay mineral particles leads to swelling in soils. The thickness of the double layer depends on the cation exchange capacity of soil. Higher cation exchange capacity leads to development of higher thickness of double layer thereby inducing swell. The higher is the swell the higher would be the compression. The effect of different concentrations (1 N, 2 N and 4 N) of alkali solutions on volume change behaviour of three types of soil is presented in this chapter. All the three soils studied, irrespective of their mineralogical composition, exhibited high swell when contaminated with alkali solution compared to water. However, the extent and nature of swell varied both with the type of mineral present in the soil and concentration of sodium hydroxide solution. The swell in BCS I increases with increase in the concentration of the alkali solution. In 1 N alkali solution the high swell occurred is due to the breaking up of interstratified mineral into constituent minerals initiated by the leaching of potassium from soil due to high pH. In 2 N and 4 N alkali solutions, the observed high swell occurs in two stages: the first stage of swelling is due to breaking up of interstratified mineral into constituent minerals initiated by the leaching of potassium from soil due to high pH, and the second stage of swelling is due to the formation of new minerals (Zeolite P in case of 2 N NaOH and Sodalite in case of 4 N NaOH). The nature of swell is influenced by the formation of minerals depending on the concentration of alkali solution. Thus the studies clearly indicate that the swelling is due to the release of potassium from soil at higher pH and due to mineralogical changes depending upon the concentration of alkali solution. Confirmative tests were conducted to support the release of potassium during first stage of swelling and mineralogical alteration after second stage of swelling. The high swell in BCS M becomes higher in 1 N alkali solution. The increased swell in the soil with 1 N alkali solution is due to increase in the ion exchange capacity of soil at higher pH. The swell which is very high with 1 N alkali solution decreases with 2 N alkali solution. With increase in concentration of alkali solution to 2 N, the increase in the negative charges due to alkalinity becomes less and the swell decreases due to dominant influence of electrolyte effect. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, both these influences become less and the amount of swell remains the same. Significant increase in the amount of swell is observed with alkali solution even in non-swelling red earth. The nature of swell as well as the formation of minerals is not altered by the change in the concentration of alkali solution. At any concentrations of alkali solution the observed swell is noticed in two stages – very small first stage of swell due to lower ion exchange capacity and considerable second stage of swell due to the formation of new mineral (Sodalite) with any concentration of alkali solution. It has been observed that the normal hyperbolic swell – compression relationship does not apply for the alkali contaminated soils. The higher swell does not result in higher compression, as the swollen soil remains fairly incompressible. Analysis of the results and detailed studies on micro-structure and mineralogy of soils bring out mechanism of alkali effects. Comparing the swell behaviour of soils with alkali solutions brings out the relative importance of various mechanisms proposed for induced heave. The effect of salt solutions used viz., potassium chloride and magnesium chloride to restrict the influence of alkali solution on the volume change behaviour of BCS I is presented in Chapter 5. These salts react with alkali solution to form partly soluble potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) B 2 B) respectively. Presence of ionic potassium can bring out potassium linkages, by bridging potassium ion between the unit layers of expansive minerals reducing the swell. Magnesium ions can restrict swell, by replacing the monovalent exchangeable ions present in soil and/or by formation of magnesium hydroxide which is a weak cementing agent. The effect of potassium hydroxide on the volume change behaviour of soil has been studied and the results clearly indicate that fixation of potassium is facilitated by high pH of KOH solution. Addition of potassium chloride has partially controlled the alkali induced heave in soil. Of the two stages of swelling observed in soil in the presence of 4 N alkali solution, only the first phase of swelling is reduced which may be due to electrolyte effect and/or due to fixation of potassium. The second phase of swelling that occurs in soil due to mineralogical changes can not be controlled with the use of potassium chloride. Addition of magnesium chloride salt solution also reduced the effect of alkali solution mostly due to suppression of thickness of diffuse double layer that develops near clay surface. The nature of reduction in the swell of alkali solution during the two stages by magnesium chloride is similar to that of potassium chloride. The partial reduction in swell of soil in the presence of salt solutions leads to reduction in the compressibility of soil. Detailed data and analysis, presented in this chapter, bring out the role of microstructure and mineralogy on soil behaviour. The abnormal volume changes due to mineralogical changes affected by high concentration of sodium hydroxide could not be controlled with salt solutions, attempts are made to utilize fly ash to control the alkali induced heave. The pozzolanic compounds produced by hydration of compounds presented and/or produced by lime silica reactions can bind the soil particles controlling the swelling. The results on the effectiveness of fly ash on BCS I soil are presented in Chapter 6. The physical and chemical properties of fly ash along with the mineralogical composition and the microstructure of the fly ash are also presented in this chapter. Before studying the effect of fly ash to control the volume change behaviour of soils in presence of alkali solutions, the effect of alkali solutions on the volume change behaviour of fly ash itself has been studied. The results showed no noticeable changes in swell and compressibility of fly ash, encouraging its use for controlling the alkali induced swell. The ability of different percentages (10 %, 20 % and 50 %) of fly ash to control alkali induced volume changes in soil with varying concentrations of alkali solutions, viz., 1 N, 2 N and 4 N has been studied. The results indicate that the addition of fly ash effectively reduces alkali induced swell in BCS I. The effectiveness of fly ash increases with increase in its content. The reduction in swelling of soil is partially due to replacement of soil with fly ash and mainly due to cementation of soil particles by pozzolanic compounds produced. More than 25 % of fly ash is generally required to significantly reduce the swell in alkali solutions. The reduction in swell with addition of fly ash also leads to lower compressibility of soil. The role of microstructure and mineralogy in controlling the volume change behaviour are also presented in this chapter. The effectiveness of fly ash in controlling the volume changes in RE and BCS M due to alkali solutions are studied in Chapter 7. The addition of fly ash completely eliminates the swelling in both the soils. The reduction in swelling up on addition of fly ash is essentially due to efficient binding of particles by pozzolanic reaction compounds. Addition of even 10 % of fly ash is sufficient in completely arresting the swelling of RE and BCS M by alkali solution. Detailed data and analysis of the results to bring out the role of microstructure and mineralogy on the behaviour of soils are presented. It is clear that relatively higher amounts of fly ash is required to control the alkali induced heave in BCS I than in other soils at higher concentrations of alkali solution. The major conclusions from the study are presented in Chapter 8. The thesis demonstrates that alkali contamination alters mineralogy and morphology of soils affecting the volume change behaviour significantly. The study also brings out that fly ash can control the undesirable swell that occurs in most types of soils by cementing the soil particles to resist swelling. Though the amount of fly ash required to control the alkali induced heave varies, 25 % of fly ash is often sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Pozzolanic {{reactions}} play a {{key role}} in improving the compressive strengths of compacted fly ash-lime specimens. Based on studies performed with cement amended fly ash (FA), activation of fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions should accelerate the rate of strength development and mobilize larger compressive strengths facilitating improved engineering performance of fly ash amended materials. Further, use of phosphogypsum (PG) is a cause of environmental concern as the material is acidic (pH < 3. 0) and contains considerable amounts of fluoride (0. 86 %). The main research objectives of the thesis are to activate lime-fly ash reactions by thermal and chemical activation process and examine the efficacy of fly <b>ash</b> <b>pozzolanic</b> reactions in controlling fluoride release by phosphogypsum. A comprehensive laboratory experimental program was performed to examine the influence of curing temperature (thermal activation) and calcined PG addition (chemical activation) on lime-fly ash reactions. The kinetics of fly ash-lime reactions are examined by monitoring the reacted lime content as function of curing period and temperature. The influence of variations in fly ash/lime content and dry density on the compressive strength developed by specimens is evaluated. The thermodynamic parameters for the fly ash-lime (FA-L) reactions have been delineated. Fly ash-lime-phosphogypsum (FA-L-G) mixes in slurry and compacted states were monitored for fluoride released as function of curing period The influence of curing temperature in activating fly ash-lime reactions is first examined. Specimens were cured at 25 °C (termed RTC or room temperature cured) and at 80 ° (termed SC or steam cured) to understand thermal activation of fly ash-lime reactions. The rate of lime consumption by SC specimens classified as 2 stage process. The robust increase during stage 2 of steam curing suggested that the lime-solidification reactions did not reach equilibrium even after 4 days of curing at the elevated temperature. While only 3. 1 to 3. 3 % of added lime was consumed after 28 days of curing at room temperature, much larger amounts of lime (8. 6 - 9. 3 %) were consumed after 4 days of steam-curing. Further, the lime-fly ash reactions were accelerated by 6 to 7 folds on curing the specimens at elevated temperature. The results indicated that activation of lime-fly ash reactions by curing at elevated temperature besides accelerating the rate of strength development also facilitated development of larger strength. Analysis of the free energy change values (ΔG°) indicated that the lime solidification reaction alters from dis-favored (less spontaneous) to favoured (spontaneous) state on curing at 80 oC. The positive ΔH° (enthalpy change) values for the fly ash-lime reactions indicated that the reactions are endothermic in nature and are facilitated by increase in curing temperature. Gypsum activation was achieved by addition of 2. 5 to 5 % calcined phosphogypsum to fly ash lime mixes and curing the compacted specimens at room temperature (FA-L-G specimens). The rate of lime consumption by FA-L-G specimens appeared to be three stage process. The mass of lime consumed by FA-L-G specimens was about 1. 5 to 3 folds higher than values of the RTC and SC specimens. Additional lime is consumed by FA-L-G specimens in ettringite formation. A similarity existed between rate of lime consumed and rate of strength developed by the FA-L-G specimens. It is proposed that besides lime solidification reactions, densification of the matrix by filling up of voids by fine gypsum particles and compaction of matrix by the growth of ettringite crystals also contribute to compressive strength of FA-L-G specimens; this additional mechanism of strength development accounts for their higher compressive strength in comparison to the SC and RTC specimens despite similar initial lime addition values. The trend of results suggests that activation of FA-L reactions by calcined PG addition is more effective than steam curing. Comparison of ΔG° values of RTC, SC and FA-L-G specimens revealed that the spontaneity of the lime solidification reactions is least for RTC specimens and improves with addition of phosphogypsum and further improves on curing at elevated temperature. Fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions substantially reduced the fluoride released from the FA-L-G specimens. The marked reduction in fluoride released by PG amended with fly ash and lime is ascribed to entrapment of PG particles in the cemented matrix formed by fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions together with consumption of fluoride in formation of insoluble fluoride bearing compounds. 	The thesis brings out that activation of fly ash-lime reactions leading to quicker and larger compressive strength development is achieved by curing the compacted fly ash-lime specimens at 80 °C for 24 hr or by addition of 2. 5 to 5 % of calcined PG to fly ash-lime mix and curing the compacted specimens at room-temperature. As larger strengths are developed by PG addition than by curing at 80 oC, it is recommended that FA-L-G technique be adopted for manufacture of building materials in the civil engineering industry. This technique is also sustainable as it does not require energy for heating which is needed in the steam-curing technique...|$|R
40|$|Fly ash is a {{by-product}} of burning coal in electric power generating plants. It is commonly known that owing to its <b>pozzolanic</b> properties fly <b>ash</b> is widely used as a partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete. The use of fly ash in concrete not only reduces the landfill costs of fly ash, but also reduces the use of Portland cement in concrete, consequently reduces CO 2 emission per ton concrete. More important, the presence of fly ash improves the durability of concrete and extends the service life of concrete structures. Today, there is a demand for concrete structures with a service life of 80, 100, or even 200 years. In many cases chloride-induced rebar corrosion {{is assumed to be}} the dominant mechanism determining the service life of reinforced concrete structures. It is commonly believed that fly ash concrete has a better resistance to chloride penetration than Portland cement concrete, since the microstructure development of Portland cement-fly ash binary systems is different from that of pure Portland cement system. The resistance of concrete to chloride penetration is highly related to their microstructure. The studies on Portland cement-fly ash binary systems (concrete or paste) have been carried out for many years. Most studies are based on experimental results at a relative short curing period (i. e. 3 months) or from different concrete mixtures with different fly ash and Portland cement. The advantage of using fly ash, however, becomes evident at later ages, i. e. beyond 90 days. Systematic long-term investigations on Portland cement-fly ash binary systems are still limited. In this thesis the research on these binary systems starts from the hydration process (chapter 3), the microstructure development (chapter 4) to transport properties (water permeability and chloride penetration) (chapter 5 - chapter 8) in view of service life predictions of concrete structures made with fly ash-blended cements. In a fly ash cement paste {{there are two types of}} chemical reactions: hydration of cement and pozzolanic reaction of fly <b>ash.</b> The <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction of fly ash needs calcium hydroxide (CH), produced by the hydration of cement, to occur. The evolution of the amount of CH with time reflects the rate of hydration of cement and pozzolanic reaction of fly ash in binary systems. As discussed in chapter 3 at early ages, i. e. before 7 days, the CH content of blended cement paste was higher than that of Portland cement paste. It indicated that the presence of fly ash leaded to faster hydration of cement in binary systems. After about 7 days, the CH content in blended cement paste decreases significantly. It suggests that in binary systems the rate of the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash (consuming CH) is faster than that of the hydration of cement (producing CH). At later ages, i. e. beyond 180 days, the CH content in blended cement paste stays at a constant low level. It is inferred that beyond 180 days the rate of the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash in binary systems becomes very slow. The pozzolanic reaction of fly ash results in a different microstructure development of blended cement paste compared with pure Portland cement paste. In chapter 4 the evolution of the pore structure of Portland cement paste and blended cement paste was investigated at ages up to 3 years. The porosity of blended cement paste was higher than that of pure Portland cement paste, even at an age of 3 years. At later ages, i. e. after about 28 days, the presence of fly ash results in the formation of a large amount of small capillary pores in the range between 10 and 100 nm. At later ages, i. e. after 180 days, blended cement paste had a lower connectivity of the pores than Portland cement paste. The pore structure of blended cement paste was refined at later ages while the porosity of blended cement was still higher than that of Portland cement paste (at ages up to 3 years). The microstructure of paste determines the transport properties. In chapter 5 the water permeability of Portland cement paste and blended cement paste was studies. At early age the pastes containing fly ash exhibit a higher capillary porosity than pure Portland cement paste. The initial water permeability of blended cement paste is higher than that of Portland cement paste. However, after about 180 days blended cement paste is less permeable than pure Portland cement paste, even though the capillary porosity of blended cement paste is higher than that of Portland cement paste. The water permeability of pure cement paste and blended cement paste depends on the connectivity of the pores. At later ages, i. e. after 180 days, the connectivity of the pores of blended cement paste is lower than that of pure Portland cement paste, resulting in a less permeable microstructure. In chapter 6 the resistance of Portland cement concrete and fly ash concrete to chloride penetration was investigated. Under moist curing conditions the DRCM values of Portland cement concrete made with different w/c ratios (0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6) decrease with time at early ages, i. e. from 28 to 180 days. After that the DRCM values of Portland cement concrete increase and then turn to decrease again after around 1 year (Figure 6. 6). The possible reason might be the delayed ettringite formation in Portland concrete when limestone powder (as filler) is blended with Portland cement clinker and when it is cured under moist conditions (see chapter 7). The DEF results in a change of the microstructure of hydrated cement paste and an increase of DRCM at later ages. At ages beyond about 28 days the concrete mixtures made with fly ash have better resistance against chloride penetration than Portland cement concrete. Ettringite forms in fly ash concrete at later ages. This ettringite is found in voids initially present in the paste and in the spaces left after the reaction of fly ash particles. Formation of ettringite in empty spaces explains why DEF in fly ash concrete does not lead to expansion and micro-cracking and an associated increase of the DRCM values as observed for Portland cement concrete. Based on the measured DRCM values for Portland cement concrete and fly ash concrete, the ageing factor n was determined (see chapter 8). It represents how rapidly the chloride migration coefficient of the concrete decreases with time. In DuraCrete the 28 days values of DRCM and n are two important input parameters to predict the service life of concrete structures. An important question is whether new n-values, as those determined in this study, can directly be adopted in the currently used version of DuraCrete for service life predictions. In DuraCrete it is assumed that the chloride diffusion (migration) coefficient of concrete, D(t), decreases considerably with increasing age of the concrete. This decrease is quantified with a constant value of n. It means that D(t) would go to zero as time tends to infinity (t ? ?), which is known not to be realistic. In reality, the chloride diffusion coefficient D(t) is directly determined by the microstructure of concrete. In fact, the decrease of the diffusion coefficient cannot be described adequately with a constant value of n. A more accurate description of the evolution of the diffusion coefficient D(t) with an not constant value of n, however, will affect the consistency of the currently used version of DuraCrete. A reconsideration of n-values should be accompanied by reconsidering the values of other model parameters values (e. g. environmental factor ke and curing factor kc in DuraCrete), since these parameter, ke, kc and n, are mutually interdependent.

40|$|Due to {{the rather}} limited {{obtainable}} resources of natural aggregates suitable for concrete purposes, {{the technology of}} crushed aggregates becomes more important. The production of crushed aggregates generates large amounts of fines of fillers, presently to some extent considered to be leftovers. From an environmental point of view, {{as well as from}} an economic point of view, {{it is important to be}} able to utilize these fines. Because of the large surface area of the filler fraction of the aggregate, the addition of filler may modify the rheological properties of fresh concrete to a great extent. Recently, the need for good fillers has increased due to the development of self-compacting concrete. To attain the much higher flowability of self-compacting concrete compared to ordinary vibrated concrete, the volume of the fluent phase, i. e. the matrix phase, has to be increased. At the same time, the self-compacting concrete has to be stable. The addition of filler may then be beneficial from a technical point of view. In addition, the use of fillers may be more cost efficient than other possible solutions. There are examples in the literature that fillers may modify the properties of the hardened state as well as the properties of the fresh state of concrete. Fillers have been reported to accelerate the cement hydration in some cases. Examples of increased compressive strength also exist. This is believed to be due to a general filler effect, i. e. that the cement hydration products may grow faster and become more evenly distributed in the presence of small mineral particles. In addition to the general filler effect, there might be chemical effects, in some cases pozzolanic reactions. The present study has focused on filler classified as alkali-reactive. The alkali-silica reaction in concrete is known to result in cracking and overall expansion of structural elements. There are some examples in the literature indicating that the finest particles of alkali-reactive aggregates should not be considered dangerous in concrete. Some researchers have reported that filler particles below a critical limit, which has been reported to be in order of 50 μm for some rocks, may give pozzolanic reactions, and consequently be beneficial. However, there have been reported cases where particles smaller than 20 - 30 μm gave very fast and deleterious reactions. In the present study, alkali-reactive fillers from two Norwegian cataclastic rocks have been investigated. The study has included fillers of Icelandic glassy rhyolite and crushed bottle glass. Non-reactive reference fillers were included in the study, as well as silica fume and fly ash known to mitigate alkali-silica reactions. The direct pozzolanic reactivity of the fillers has been quantifies by mixing calcium hydroxide, filler and artificial pore water. The loss of calcium hydroxide over time measured by TGA is then a direct measure of the pozzolanic reactivity. When testing the 0 - 20 μm fractions of the different fillers at 20 °C, the materials could be divided into two distinct classes with respect to pozzolanity: • The pozzolanic reactivity of fly ash, glass and rhyolite filler was distinct •The pozzolanic reactivity of mylonite, cataclasite and quartz fillers was insignificant at the age of 28 days All the materials being highly pozzolanic have a distinct amorphous phase, while the silica phase of the non-pozzolanic materials is well crystalline quartz. The known deformation and sub-grain development due to cataclasis of the tested reactive Norwegian rocks does not seem to increase the pozzolanic reactivity much. The mylonite filler has also been tested at curing temperatures of 38 °C and 80 °C. The pozzolanic reactivity was very low also at 38 °C. However, at a temperature of 80 °C, corresponding to the temperature used by the accelerated mortar bar test, the pozzolanic reactivity was significant. Non-reactive granite/gneiss filler of glacioflucial origin was also pozzolanic at 80 °C. It may then be suggested that all fillers of rocks containing silica will be more or less pozzolanic as such high temperatures as 80 °C. Based on testing by the concrete prism method, the fillers could be divided into two distinct classed with respect to their effect on alkali-silica reactions in concrete: • Fly ash, silica fume, glass filler and rhyolite filler significantly reduced the expansions compared to the reference concrete • Mylonite and cataclasite filler had no effect or gave increased expansions compared to the reference concrete These results are based on experiments by the concrete prism test, which is believed to provide a realistic picture of the real behaviour in field conditions. Micro structural analyses, using optical microscopy and electron probe micro analyser, have given additional information regarding the performance of glass filler, mylonite filler and rhyolite filler compared to the reference concrete, and confirmed the expansion results of the concrete prism test. The effect of the tested fillers with respect to alkali-silica reactions matched their pozzolanic reactivity. Fillers being highly pozzolanic reduced the expansions due to ASR, while non-pozzolanic alkali-reactive fillers gave in most cases increased expansion compared to the reference mix. Consequently, such alkali-reactive fillers should be treated as potentially deleterious in concrete. The accelerated mortar bar test has been widely used around the world to test the effect of different additives, such as silica fume, fly ash and slag. Other additional materials, such as crushed bottle glass, have also been tested using this method. Some studies have indicated a rather strong correlation between the results obtained by concrete prism testing and results obtained by accelerated mortar bar testing. In the present study, extensive testing of fillers by the accelerated mortar bar test was carried out to give a preliminary screening of the materials. Testing of rhyolite filler, glass filler, fly ash and silica fume reduced the expansions significantly compared to the reference mortar when tested by the accelerated mortar bar test. This is in accordance with the results obtained for the same fillers by the concrete prism test. However, the accelerated mortar bar test also predicted that Norwegian reactive rock fillers to inhibit expansions due to alkali-silica reactions. This contradicts the predicted effect of these fillers by the concrete prism test. Testing of non-reactive limestone fillers gave no effect at all on mortar bar expansion. This indicates that the effects of the Norwegian reactive rock fillers by this method is due to chemical, and not physical effects. Due to the high temperature used by the accelerated mortar bar test (80 °), the quartz in these rock fillers are believed to react pozzolanic. Methods such as the accelerated mortar bar test, or other methods using very high temperatures, should consequently not be used to evaluate the effect of rock fillers containing silica, unless their pozzolanic reactivity are evident also at lower temperatures. The <b>pozzolanic</b> materials (fly <b>ash,</b> silica fume, rhyolite and glass filler) gave a significant increase in compressive strength. This is believed to be due to their pozzolanic reactivity. Ni significant effect on the compressive strength of any of the Norwegian rock fillers (mylonite, cataclasite and granite/gneiss filler) was notified at normal filler additional levels. The present study has given valuable information concerning the practical implications of using alkali-reactive fillers. The similarity between the alkali-silica reaction and the pozzolanic reaction has been highlighted. However, some of the more fundamental issues concerning the paradox of the alkali-silica reaction and the pozzolanic reaction are still far from being fully understood, and it is clear that more basic research is needed in this area. Testing of the effects of fillers on the rheological properties of fresh concrete was done by matrix testing within the present study. The matrix refers to the fluent phase of the particle-matrix model. It consists of the cement paste and all powders of particle size < 0. 125 mm, including the aggregate filler. Some of the limitations of the particle-matrix model with respect to self-compacting concrete have been treated in the present study. The characterisation of the matrix phase by simple flow viscometers are believed to be insensitive to the small, but significant, changes in yield stress. A more fundamental characterisation of the matrix phase has been introduced. By using the Physica rheometer with parallel plate configuration, the fundamental measures yield stress and plastic viscosity could be obtained. The effect of fillers on the flow resistance ratio of the matrix has benn tested. As expected, addition of filler increased the flow resistance ratio. The effect of the different fillers varied much, to a large extent due to the variations in particle size distribution. The granite/gneiss filler, which is coarse compared to the crushed rock fillers, gave the lowest flow resistance ratio. Fly ash, which has a particle size distribution similar to cement, gave the highest flow resistance ratio. Replacement of cement by reduced the flow resistance ratio for most of the fillers. The exception was fly ash and glass filler, the mineralogy seems to have some influence. In this respect, limestone filler gave rather low flow resistance ratios in relation to its fine particle size distribution. A laboratory program using the Physica rheometer to give a more fundamental characterisation of the effects of filler on the matrix has been carried out. The plastic viscosity obtained from testing by the Physica rheometer is more or less an equivalent measure to the empirical flow resistance ratio obtained by the FlowCyl testing. Consequently, the effect of the fillers with respect to plastic viscosity was basically equal to their effect on flow resistance ratio. The replacement of cement by filler has been shown to alter the rheological properties significantly. Generally, fillers have lower yield stress and plastic viscosity than equal volumes of cement. An increase in plastic viscosity was generally followed by an increase in yield stress. However, it has been shown that the ratio between yield stress and plastic viscosity is highly dependent on the type and dosage of plasticizer. The new co. polymers generally reduced the yield stress to a much higher extent than lignosulphonate or naphthalene. Further, the co-polymer seems to level out the large difference due to different fillers, which may be apparent when using other types of plasticizers. Also the cement type has been shown to influence the ratio between yield stress ad plastic viscosity largely. A study of the relationship between the rheological properties of the matrix phase and self-compacting concrete has indicated that the yield stress of the matrix phase has a crucial influence on the empirical slump-flow measure. No straightforward correlation between the rheological properties of self-compacting concrete and the corresponding matrix phase was found. Studies of rheological properties of the matrix phase should be considered useful to gain fundamental knowledge regarding the effects of different constituents. Matrix testing may to some extent be useful to predict the effects in self-compacting concrete, but the limitations should be kept in mind when using matrix results to predict the behaviour of a given constituent in concrete. The study had confirmed the basic principles of the particle-matrix model for self-compacting concrete. However, further work is needed to go deeper into the very complex relationship between the concrete rheology and the matrix rheology. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
