2500|$|The tripodfish Bathypterois grallator uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to {{identify}} food; it apparently {{does not have}} special visual adaptations to help it find food in the low-light environment. When the fish is perched with its long rays on the ocean floor, it can get food without even seeing it. The tripodfish’s mouth ends up {{at just the right}} height to catch shrimp, tiny fish, and small crustaceans swimming by. They seem to prefer to perch on the mud using much elongated fin rays in their tails and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream into the current to ambush with the pectoral fins turned forward so [...] the outthrust <b>projecting</b> <b>fins</b> resemble multiple antennae. The fish senses objects in the water with its front fins. [...] These fins act like hands. [...] Once they feel prey and realize it is edible, the fins knock the food into the fish’s mouth.

50|$|The tripodfish or tripod spiderfish, Bathypterois grallator, is a deep-sea benthic {{fish in the}} Ipnopidae family {{found at}} lower latitudes. It is now {{relatively}} well known from photographs and submersible observations, and seem to prefer to perch on the ooze using much elongated fin rays in the tail and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream with the pectoral fins turned forward so the outthrust <b>projecting</b> <b>fin</b> rays resemble multiple antennae, and are indeed used as tactile organs. B. grallator is hermaphroditic. At least 18 species are placed in the genus Bathypterois, several of which have similar appearance and behavior to B. grallator. B. grallator is the largest member of its genus, commonly exceeding a standard length of 30 cm and reaching up to 43.4 cm.|$|R
50|$|Carl-Nielsen's mermaid is, {{with her}} <b>projecting</b> <b>fins,</b> flat nose and fish-like mouth, more {{creature}} and less human than Edvard Eriksen's nine years older Little Mermaid. She is also depicted {{in a more}} dynamic pose and with a more dramatic expression than that of Eriksen's more famous mermaid: She has a terrified {{look in her eyes}} and appears to have just come out of the water, gasping for breath and with hair dripping with water. The Carl Nielsen specialist John Fellow has suggested that the mermaid's tormented facial expression is Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's comment to her difficult marriage and her husband's repeated infidelity. He has pointed out that the mermaid sculpture was the only work that she created during this difficult period that was not a commission created out of economic necessity. It has also been suggested that the sculpture symbolizes the transition from girl to woman.|$|E
50|$|The east {{elevation}} {{contains the}} building's vehicular and service entrances. The overhead garage doors are sheltered under a wide projecting metal canopy which stretches {{the length of}} the elevation. The next two floor levels are clad with smooth limestone and contain long horizontal bands of windows. At the fourth floor level, the elevation changes character. The southern half, the 16-story tower, consists of a projecting glass and steel curtain wall that appears to be supported by projecting metal brackets. The curtain wall is divided horizontally by the same <b>projecting</b> <b>fins</b> at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The curtain wall is divided vertically by a central recessed channel. A bracketed vertical metal fin, rising from the 4th through the 15th floors, accentuates this channel. The 16th-floor level is set back from the plane of the elevation, creating another open-air rooftop terrace covered by an open canopy which is an extension of the building's vaulted metal roof.|$|E
50|$|The same {{materials}} and similar details continue {{around to the}} south elevation. The employees entrance is located {{near the center of}} the first floor. The eight-story block of the south elevation features a wide, vertical band of windows near its west end and a punched four-story window opening which constitutes nearly two-thirds of the elevation's wall surface. The windows are divided horizontally by metal spandrels and mullions. The top floor of the eight-story block is fully glazed and sheltered under a projecting metal canopy. A four-story metal bracket appears to support the cantilevered canopy. The 16-story tower is set back from the plane of the eight-story block, allowing for the open-air rooftop terrace. The tower's elevation consists of a limestone center shaft flanked by glass and steel curtain walls. The limestone wall surface has punched window openings of horizontal bands and small squares. The curtain walls are divided horizontally by <b>projecting</b> <b>fins</b> at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The vaulted metal roof crowns the tower.|$|E
50|$|Hughes had {{assembled}} a team including Aérospatiale (propulsion), Shorts (integration and final assembly), Thomson-Thorn Missile Electronics (TTME), Fokker Special <b>Projects</b> (<b>fin</b> actuation), and Diehl BGT Defence (warhead). Incidentally, {{the adoption of}} FMRAAM as the name of Hughes' proposal forced the UK MoD to change the title of SR(A)1239 to BVRAAM. Hughes would provide the seeker, with electronics from its Scottish subsidiary, based in Glenrothes. The upgraded guidance electronics would be compressed compared to the existing AMRAAM. Other changes included: a new electronic, {{as opposed to the}} usual mechanical, safe and arm device, based on Diehl BGT Defence's IRIS-T system; a TTME digital target detection device (a two-way conformal microwave proximity fuze unit); and a shortened control and actuation system. The seeker and warhead were basically unchanged from AMRAAM's.|$|R

50|$|The building's main {{entrance}} {{is located on}} its west elevation. The glass and steel storefront entrance is recessed at an angle from {{the plane of the}} elevation behind a row of massive pillars and is sheltered under a projecting metal canopy. The exterior wall surfaces of the eight-story block (southern half of the elevation) above the canopy is smooth limestone veneer with punched window openings, one such being a five-story opening which constitutes virtually half of the wall surface. It is divided into four bays by vertical metal fins which terminate as flagpoles or decorative poles and horizontally by metal spandrels and mullions. The top floor of the eight-story block contains the law library. Its west elevation is fully glazed and recessed from the plane of the elevation and set under another projecting metal canopy. An open-air rooftop terrace caps the eight-story block. The northern half of the west elevation above the {{main entrance}} canopy consists of the 16-story smooth limestone and glass and steel curtain wall tower. The northwest corner is a solid limestone shaft. A curved elevator penthouse with projecting metal skirt rises above the shaft like a campanile. The curtain wall portion follows the same recessed angle back from the plane of the elevation as the main entrance. The curtain wall is divided horizontally by <b>projecting</b> <b>fins</b> at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} new South African Mutual Life Assurance Building. Eight storey office {{highrise}} building with basement. Includes elevations, perspectives & sections. Similar to the aspirations for Eaton's Netherlands Bank proposal, canopies project over the pavement to protect pedestrians from the elements, while the building steps back generously to allow pedestrian movement and {{trees on the}} widened sidewalk. The building is split into two distinct wings to optimize northern exposure and cross-ventilation, with horizontal projecting ledges protecting all strip windows. A roof garden draws from Brazilian traits, along with facades similar to the Ministry of Transport (not executed) with fins on a grid (sans brise soleil). Large projecting frames hold {{the composition of the}} smaller scaled <b>projecting</b> <b>fins</b> on a grid to address each street separately. The design is parallel {{to the development of a}} high-rise vernacular in Johannesburg at the time, based on adaptations from pre-war Corbusier ideas, Martienssen’s projecting frames and set within the post-war Brazilian rhetoric. 7 jpg files of digitized designs for new South African Mutual Life Assurance Building in Pretoria...|$|E

5000|$|In September 2013, FCS {{introduced}} FCS II [...] a new pre-glass fin {{system to}} the market. The new system boasts {{a number of key}} advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, {{the leading edge of the}} fin resides inside the plug, and the base of the fins sit flush to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the new system is that it’s backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two grub screws and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the new system. Many consider the new system inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the new system and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity <b>Project</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R

50|$|Singapore has {{a wealth}} of Art Deco architecture, dating mainly from the 1920s and 1930s. The style was {{especially}} popular in commercial architecture, like factories and offices. Often, Art Deco style ornaments and elements were applied onto otherwise typical shophouses or bungalows. In other cases, Art Deco was applied to newly emergent types of buildings, like Kallang Airport (by the Public Works Department), the Ford Factory (by Emile Brizay), or the Cathay Building (by Frank Brewer) and the Asia Insurance Building (by Ng Keng Siang). Features of this style in the local context included a penchant for inscribing {{the date of the}} erection of the building prominently on its facade, the use of <b>projecting</b> horizontal <b>fins</b> as sun shading devices over windows and the use of flagpoles. Quite apart from the aesthetics of this style, the Art Deco period also marked the introduction of modern construction technologies like reinforced concrete in Singapore.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{growth of}} the {{international}} market for shark fins has coincided with an expansion of shark fishing in India, raising concerns that some shark stocks are over-exploited. India exports almost all shark fins it produces in what is largely an informal and unregulated sector, and most observers believe that official export data greatly understate actual shark fin exports. Two estimates of Indian shark fin exports, one based on <b>projected</b> shark <b>fin</b> production from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (fao) recorded landings data and the other based on recorded Hong Kong imports from India, show that actual exports are likely many times greater than officially recorded amounts. A comparative analysis of Hong Kong and fao data indicates that fao landings data may be much lower than actual shark landings. Recent events [...] the short-lived 2001 blanket ban on shark fishing and trade by the Government of India in particular [...] are analysed {{in terms of their}} effect on shark fin trade and production. The implications of a trade-based estimate of total shark landings on current shark fishing practices in India are examined, and suggestions are given regarding effective and equitable methods to protect shark stocks and fishers livelihoods...|$|R

50|$|Another {{focus of}} conservationists is on curtailing human {{activities}} that are detrimental to either marine ecosystems or species through policy, techniques such as fishing quotas, like those {{set up by the}} Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, or laws such as those listed below. Recognizing the economics involved in human use of marine ecosystems is key, as is education of the public about conservation issues. This includes educating tourists that come to an area who might not be familiar with certain regulations regarding the marine habitat. One example of this is a <b>project</b> called Green <b>Fins</b> based in Southeast Asia that uses the scuba diving industry to educate the public. This project, implemented by UNEP, encourages scuba diving operators to educate their students about the importance of marine conservation and encourage them to dive in an environmentally friendly manner that does not damage coral reefs or associated marine ecosystems.|$|R
