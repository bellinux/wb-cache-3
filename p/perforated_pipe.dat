25|$|To {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} water {{into and out of the}} wetlands, the parks department adds or removes boards at a small dam near the railroad berm. The idea is to replicate conditions that existed when the wetlands were fully connected to the river. Part of the water in the wetlands comes from natural springs, and part of the water comes from the river, when it runs high in the winter. Beavers have at times foiled the plan by damming the small stream that carries water between the lake and the river. The parks department has foiled the rodents by running a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> through the beaver dam.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} primary {{function}} {{of being the}} discharge of treated stormwater, infiltration systems are generally positioned as the final element in a WSUD system. Infiltration trenches should not be located on steep slopes or unstable areas. A layer of geotextile fabric {{is often used to}} line the trench in order to prevent the soil from migrating into the rock or gravel fill. Infiltration systems are dependent on the local soil characteristics and are generally best suited to soils with good infiltrative capacity, such as sandy-loam soils, with deep groundwater. In areas of low permeability soils, such as clay, a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> may be placed within the gravel.|$|E
25|$|Bioretention swales, {{similar to}} buffer strips and swales, are placed within {{the base of}} a swale that is {{generally}} located in the median strip of divided roads. They provide both stormwater treatment and are. A bioretention system can be installed in part of a swale, or along the full length of a swale, depending on treatment requirements. The runoff water usually goes through a fine media filter and proceeds downwards where it is collected via a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> leading to downstream waterways or storages. Vegetation growing in the filter media can prevent erosion and, unlike infiltration systems, bioretention swales are suited {{for a wide range of}} soil conditions.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 <b>Perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> {{were buried}} in the gravel bed of a {{laboratory}} stream, extending upstream from a simulated riffle in order to study their effect upon mixing and interchange of stream water and intragravel water. In {{the absence of such}} pipes the drop of energy gradient of the stream was concentrated locally at the riffle whereas the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> caused the local drop of hydraulic gradient to occur over an extensive portion of the gravel bed due to the direct connection of the pipes with the flow downstream of the riffle. The resulting increase in interchange of stream and intragravel water would be directly beneficial to fish eggs and hatched fry in the gravel pore space by permitting a greater supply of dissolved oxygen to reach them and thus reducing the risk of suffocation. A significant difference in the permeabilities of gravel beds with and without imbedded <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> was found after the same amount of fine sediment was applied to each bed. The much higher final permeability of the gravel streambed containing imbedded <b>pipes</b> suggests that <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> might be of considerable use in reducing silt deposition in spawning gravels and thus minimizing exit-route blockage and environmental stresses for the hatched fry...|$|R
50|$|In 1812, British {{inventor}} Sir William Congreve patented {{a manual}} sprinkler system using <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> along the ceiling. When someone noticed a fire, a valve {{outside the building}} could be opened to send water through the pipes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Negative Pressure {{technique}} generates appropriate {{soil temperature}} at a 60 cm depth and {{complete control of}} nematodes, fungi and weeds is achieved. In this technique, the steam is introduced under the steaming sheath and forced to enter the soil profile by a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created by a fan that sucks {{the air out of}} the soil through buried <b>perforated</b> polypropylene <b>pipes.</b> This system requires a permanent installation of <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> into the soil, at a depth of at least 60 cm to be protected from plough." ...|$|R

An air of indomitable {{resolution}} came and went upon his face like a vain and passing shadow. Next moment he looked a dear good boy in trouble, as before. He flung away the cigarette. [...] "Good-bye," [...] he said, with the sudden haste {{of a man who had}} lingered too long in view of a pressing bit of work waiting for him; and then for a second or so he made not the slightest movement. The downpour fell with the heavy uninterrupted rush of a sweeping flood, with a sound of unchecked overwhelming fury that called to one's mind the images of collapsing bridges, of uprooted trees, of undermined mountains. No man could breast the colossal and headlong stream that seemed to break and swirl against the dim stillness in which we were precariously sheltered as if on an island.

5000|$|The {{pneumatic}} barrier {{consists of}} <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> and a compressed air source. Air escaping from the pipe provides a [...] "hump" [...] of rising water and air which contains the oil spill. Anchors keeping the pipe in a decided spot are helpful.|$|E
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{barrier is}} a method of containing oil spills. Air bubbling through a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> causes an upward water flow that slows the spread of oil.

500|$|A mobile {{flame trap}} {{comprised}} surplus bulk storage tanks on trucks, {{the contents of}} which could be hosed into a sunken road and ignited. A static flame trap was prepared with <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> running down the side of a road connected to a [...] elevated tank. Usually gravity sufficed but in a few cases a pump assisted in spraying the mixture of oil and petrol.|$|R
50|$|However, {{out of ten}} planned plants {{only four}} became operational. The {{technology}} was primitive carbonization and oil yield was low. Mined oil shale was heaped into mounds which were ignited after covering by peat. Distilled shale oil and oil shale gas were collected through 300 mm <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Oil was separated from gas by electric filters. Until {{the end of the}} war, only 1,500 tonnes of shale oil was produced.|$|R
50|$|Ditches may be dug by hand {{or with a}} trencher. An {{inclination}} of 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 is typical. Lining {{the bottom}} of the ditch with clay or plastic pipe increases the volume of water that can flow through the drain. Modern French drain systems can be made with <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> (weeping tile) surrounded by sand or gravel and geotextile or landscaping textile. Landscaping textiles are used to prevent migration of the drainage material as well as preventing dirt and roots from entering and clogging the drainage pipe. The <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> provides a minor underground storage volume but the prime purpose is for the perforations to drain the area along the full length of the pipe and to discharge any surplus water at its end. The direction of percolation will depend on the relative conditions inside and outside the pipe.|$|E
50|$|On this locomotive, the {{arrangement}} of the saddle-tank precluded the use of the usual steam dome on the boiler barrel. Instead, steam for the cylinders was collected by a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe,</b> fitted to the combined regulator and steam collector box, which was arranged at the highest point in the steam space above the crown of the firebox.|$|E
50|$|Trench drains are {{commonly}} confused with French drains, which {{consist of a}} <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> that is buried in a gravel bed, and which are used to evacuate ground water. A slot drain, also wrongly associated with a trench drain, consists of a drainage pipe with a thin neck (or slot) that opens at the ground surface with sufficient opening to drain storm water.|$|E
50|$|A static {{flame trap}} allowed {{a length of}} road, {{typically}} 60 to 150 ft, to be covered in flame and smoke at a moment's notice. The weapon was a simple arrangement of <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> placed alongside a road. The pipes were steel, one to two inches in diameter and drilled with 1/8th inch holes at angles carefully calculated to cover the road evenly. The <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> were connected to larger pipes {{that led to a}} tank of fuel in a raised position. The fuel mixture was 25% petrol and 75% gas-oil that was contrived to be of no use as motor vehicle fuel should it be captured. All that was required to trigger the weapon was to open a valve and for a Home Guardsman to throw in a Molotov cocktail creating an inferno. The ideal location for the trap was a place where vehicles could not easily escape, such as a steep-sided sunken road. Some trouble was taken with camouflage: pipes could be hidden in gutters or disguised as handrails; others were simply left as innocent looking plumbing.|$|R
5000|$|A 2004 {{agreement}} between Arizona and New Mexico, the Arizona Water Settlements Act of 2004, limited New Mexico's consumption of Gila River water to /year, with stipulations on minimum pass-through flows, all {{subject to a}} reserve of [...] in Arizona's San Carlos Lake. New Mexico is to present a plan to develop its rights by 2014; none of the options presently being considered involve a major dam. Water would be diverted from the Gila through <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> in an infiltration gallery, or simply pumped from the river.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of subsurface {{structures such as}} Tunnel beneath the water table causes the groundwater seepage into the structure and impacts {{the stability of the}} structure. A 2. 483 km long railway Tunnel was constructed between Katara and Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir province of India. It is occupied by alluvium with scanty exposures of sandstone belonging to the Middle Shiwalik group. A huge amount of infiltrated water from the perennial canals and agriculture fields is entering the Tunnel. In addition to this, dry Nala/Palaeo channel across the Tunnel alignment contributes significant groundwater seepage during rainy season. A finite difference based groundwater flow model was constructed using the inferences from hydro-geo-morphological features and geologic lineaments to estimate the groundwater seepage and find out the possible solution. The computed flow model indicated that Tunnel would receive groundwater seepage of 78, 133 m 3 /day. The analysis of the model results revealed that 500 lateral <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> of 5 m in length at an interval of 2 m with an annular space filled with highly permeable geo media can drain out the seepage water. The suggested <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> were successfully installed in the Tunnel. They were effective in draining out the groundwater seepage...|$|R
50|$|The tank {{is about}} half-filled {{with cold water}} and steam is blown in from a boiler via a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> {{near the bottom of}} the drum. Some of the steam {{condenses}} and heats the water. The remainder fills the space above the water level. When the accumulator is fully charged the condensed steam will have raised the water level in the drum to about three-quarters full and the temperature and pressure will also have risen.|$|E
50|$|A French drain or weeping tile (also blind drain, rubble drain, rock drain, drain tile, {{perimeter}} drain, land drain, French ditch, sub-surface drain, sub-soil drain or agricultural drain) is {{a trench}} filled with gravel or rock or containing a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> that redirects surface water and groundwater {{away from an}} area. A French drain can have perforated hollow pipes along the bottom (see images) to quickly vent water that seeps down through the upper gravel or rock.|$|E
50|$|Driven wells may be {{very simply}} created in unconsolidated {{material}} with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen (<b>perforated</b> <b>pipe).</b> The point is simply hammered into the ground, usually with a tripod and driver, with pipe sections added as needed. A driver is a weighted pipe that slides over the pipe being driven and is repeatedly dropped on it. When groundwater is encountered, the well is washed of sediment and a pump installed.|$|E
5000|$|A septic tank, the septic drain field, and the {{associated}} piping compose a septic system. The septic drain field is effective for disposal of organic materials readily catabolized by a microbial ecosystem. The drain field typically consists of an arrangement of trenches containing <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> and porous material (often gravel) covered by a layer of soil to prevent animals (and surface runoff) from reaching the wastewater distributed within those trenches. [...] Primary design considerations are hydraulic for the volume of wastewater requiring disposal and catabolic for the long-term biochemical oxygen demand of that wastewater.|$|R
50|$|While serving at the Ministry of Transportation in Ontario in the 1970s, John Fitzpatrick {{devised a}} {{bubbling}} system {{used in the}} St. Lawrence River to prevent ice from forming in the winter. The formation of ice had hindered ferries from connecting {{the people of the}} Frontenac Islands to the mainland. The invention pumps compressed air through a network of <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> at the river bottom that run between the docks and along the routes of the ferries. The bubbles hinder ice from forming which allows the ferries to function regularly in the winter.|$|R

The single-phase model was developed in 1987, {{but it is not}} generally known in the petroleum industry. This model is compared to three experiments: one using air and two using water. The model must be manipulated to conform with the way individual experimenters report their findings. In general there is good agreement. Where there is poor agreement, the cause may be experimental artifacts. A second model fails to match experimental results when the pipe geometry changes significantly...|$|R

50|$|The first Niagara was Class S-1a #6000 in 1945; the S-1b (6001-6025) were {{delivered}} in 1945-46. The NYC's last steam locomotive was Class S-2 #5500; it had poppet valves. The Niagaras {{did not have}} steam domes, as did most steam locomotives, {{which resulted in a}} smooth contour {{along the top of the}} boiler. A <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> collected steam instead. This was necessary because of the lower loading gauge of the New York Central (15 ft 2 in versus 16 ft for other American railroads).|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} of horizontal dewatering systems is relatively easy. A trencher installs an unperforated pipe {{followed by a}} synthetic or organic wrapped <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe.</b> The drain length {{is determined by the}} drain diameter, soilconditions and the water table. In general drain lengths of 50 meters is common. After {{installation of}} the drainpipe a pump is connected to the drain. After the water table has been lowered, the intended construction can start. After the construction is finished the pumps are stopped, and the water table will rise again. Installation depths up to 6 meters are common.|$|E
50|$|The {{very hot}} temperatures, large class sizes {{and lack of}} {{air-conditioning}} in Burkina Faso {{make it very difficult}} for pupils to concentrate. Therefore, we developed an innovative air-cooling system only using natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a bank of earth, on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. <b>Perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award Gold.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} septic systems {{used in the}} United States employ soil {{absorption}} fields to treat and disperse wastewater (see Figure 1).

Flooding risks include sewage backing up in the home, contaminated drinking water, and lack of sanitation. The purpose of this publication is to explai...|$|R
50|$|Hand-dug wells are {{inexpensive}} and low tech (compared to drilling) as they use mostly manual labour to access groundwater in rural locations in developing countries. They may be built {{with a high}} degree of community participation, or by local entrepreneurs who specialize in hand-dug wells. They have been successfully excavated to 60 m. They have low operational and maintenance costs, in part because water can be extracted by hand bailing, without a pump. The water is often coming from an aquifer or groundwater, and can be easily deepened, which may be necessary if the ground water level drops, by telescoping the lining further down into the aquifer. The yield of existing hand dug wells may be improved by deepening or introducing vertical tunnels or <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R

Research was later expanded in the 1920s to include the application of <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> systems. The usage of plastic to hold and distribute water in drip irrigation was later developed in Australia by Hannis Thill.|$|E
