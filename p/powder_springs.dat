One of the Marietta scenes filmed involved a young boy on a skateboard being abducted by aliens. Scenes were also filmed in the Brookhaven community. On October 25, 2011, a casting call was made for extras to fill the football stadium during two nights of filming on November 2–3 at Campbell High School in Smyrna, Georgia. On November 23, 2011 a minor, walk-on role in the film was auctioned to benefit the Stiller Foundation; the role was sold for $23,000 to an undisclosed bidder.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{a two-part}} article by Howard Blum and Paul L. Montgomery {{appeared}} in the New York Times that accused LaRouche of running a cult.

The Times alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles, and had produced reports for South Africa on anti-apartheid groups in the United States. A farm in upstate New York was allegedly being used for guerrilla training, attended by LaRouche members from Germany and Mexico. Several members also underwent a six-day anti-terrorist training course, at a cost of $200 per person per day, at a camp in <b>Powder</b> <b>Springs,</b> Georgia, run by WerBell.|$|E

50|$|Early {{during the}} Civil War, Confederate cannons were mounted at the <b>Powder</b> <b>Spring</b> Gap on Clinch Mountain facing the Clinch Valley {{in order to}} prevent Union forces {{crossing}} from the northwest side of the ridge to the Federal Road and the Richland Valley to the southeast. As the war progressed, Confederate soldiers engaged in guerrilla warfare tactics from numerous vantage points along Clinch Mountain, including the rocks and caves around Joppa Mountain's summit at Buzzard Rock where they extracted saltpeter, one of the ingredients of gunpowder, from the droppings of buzzards.|$|R

25|$|With such a {{large amount}} of {{libraries}} representing much more than just Marietta, the system changed its name to the present-day Cobb County Public Library System in 1969. Shortly thereafter the Stratton branch was added in 1974, and the Merchant's Walk branch was added in 1979. In 1978 taxpayers overwhelmingly approved a $7.16 million library issue to renovate and expand the Switzer (then Central) library to 64,000 square feet, and construct the Kemp Memorial Library, Mountain View Library, and Vinings Library. The money was also used to renovate the Kennesaw and <b>Powder</b> <b>Springs</b> branches. By the early 1980s the system had grown to fourteen libraries with an annual budget of $1.5 million and passed one million materials circulated annually. The Fort Hill library was rededicated as the Hattie G. Wilson library in memory of the late librarian's 33 years of service. The final two libraries {{to be added to the}} sixteen branch system were the Mountain View and Vinings libraries constructed in 1989 and 1990 respectively.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automated pre-production particle size distribution analyser for particles in the 20 - 2000 #mu#m size range. This work is follow up to the vibro-spring particle sizer reported by Shaeri. In its most basic form, the instrument comprises a horizontally held closed coil helical spring that is partly filled with the test powder and sinusoidally vibrated in the transverse direction. Particle size distribution data are obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring {{the mass of the}} powder discharged from the spring's coils. The size of the particles on the other hand is determined from the spring 'intercoil' distance. The instrument developed by Shaeri had limited use due to its inability to measure sample mass directly. For the device reported here, modifications are made to the original configurations to establish means of direct sample mass measurement. The feasibility of techniques for measuring the mass of powder retained within the spring are investigated in detail. Initially, the measurement of mass is executed in-situ from the vibration characteristics based on the spring's first harmonic resonant frequency. This method is often erratic and unreliable due to the particle-particle-spring wall interactions and the spring bending. An much more successful alternative is found from a more complicated arrangement in which the spring forms part of a stiff cantilever system pivoted along its main axis. Here, the sample mass is determined in the 'static mode' by monitoring the cantilever beam's deflection following the wanton termination of vibration. The system performance has been optimised through the variations of the mechanical design of the key components and the operating procedure as well as taking into account the effect of changes in the ambient temperature on the system's response. The thesis also {{describes the}} design and development of the ancillary mechanisms. These include the pneumatic feeding of the test <b>powder</b> into the <b>spring,</b> the non-interfering spring extension mechanism and means for measuring the cantilever deflection and hence the sample mass via a non-contact transducer. For an automated operation, a control software is developed which car allow an unattended analysis whilst providing particle size distribution in real-time. Data are reported in conjunction with a variety of powders with different size, density and shape. Typical resolutions in terms of size and mass measurement are better than #+-# 10 #mu#m and #+-# 0. 1 g respectively.
