5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including <b>ponyfishes,</b> grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E
50|$|Photolateralis is a genus of <b>ponyfishes.</b> This genus {{is unique}} among <b>ponyfishes</b> in {{possessing}} a translucent mid-lateral flank stripe which, {{depending on the}} species, may be either a composite stripe of numerous independent translucent windows or a continuous translucent lateral stripe.|$|E

50|$|Leiognathus is a genus of <b>ponyfishes</b> {{native to}} the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. All the species can {{separated}} by other fish due to silver colored body and presence of a nuchal crest just before the dorsal fin starts in forehead region. The fish {{are commonly known as}} Silverbelly due to silver colored bodies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ponyfishes</b> {{are small}} and {{laterally}} compressed in shape, with a bland, silvery colouration. They are distinguished by highly extensible mouths, {{and the presence of}} a mechanism for locking the spines in the dorsal and anal fins. They also possess a highly integrated light organ in their throats that houses symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria that project light through the animal's underside. Typically, the harbored bacterium is only Photobacterium leiognathi, but in the two ponyfish species Photopectoralis panayensis and Photopectoralis bindus, Photobacterium mandapamensis is also present. Two of the most widely studied uses for luminescence in ponyfish are camouflage by ventral counterillumination and species-specific sexual dimorphism.|$|E

50|$|The longtail {{butterfly}} ray feeds on bony fishes, in particular <b>ponyfishes</b> {{of the genus}} Leiognathus, as well as molluscs and crustaceans. It is not known to shoal in large numbers. Known parasites of this ray include the nematode Hysterothylacium poecilurai and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium micracantha. Like other {{butterfly ray}}s, this species is viviparous with the young sustained initially by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproductive activity proceeds throughout the year, with a peak from April to October. The gestation period is unknown, though {{it is possible that}} females bear more than one litter per year. The litter size is at least seven pups and is not correlated with female size. The newborns measure 20 - 26 cm across and look like stingless miniatures of the adult; siblings may differ from each other in color. Males and females mature sexually at roughly 45 and 41 cm across respectively.|$|E

40|$|Recent phylogenetic work on <b>ponyfishes</b> has delimited and {{revealed}} the interrelationships of major leiognathid clades. To begin {{to recognize a}} monophyletic taxonomy for Leiognathidae we diagnose, delimit, and describe a number of ponyfish genera to reflect our current knowledge of their phylogenetic history. Equula Cuvier, 1815, is resurrected from synonymy with Leiognathus Lacepède, 1802, and comprises E. fasciata and E. longispinis. Members of Equula, the sister group to all other members of Leiognathidae, are large-bodied <b>ponyfishes</b> characterized by conspicuous round yellow blotches on the flank. The genus Leiognathus Lacepède, 1802, the sister group to the remaining members of Leiognathidae less Equula, is herein restricted to a clade comprising Leiognathus equulus, L. robustus, and L. striatus. The subgenus Equulites Fowler, 1904, comprising E. leuciscus, E. klunzingeri, and E. laterofenestra, is removed from synonymy with Leiognathus and is elevated to generic rank. The subgenus Eubleekeria Fowler, 1904 is removed from synonymy with Leiognathus and is likewise elevated to generic rank. Eubleekeria encompasses the ‘‘Leiognathus’ ’ splendens species complex, which is recovered as the sister group to Photopectoralis. To remedy the paraphyly of the remaining species placed within Leiognathus we describe a new genus, Karalla, which is recovered as the sister group to Nuchequula...|$|E

40|$|Fishes of {{the family}} Leiognathidae, popularly called silverbellies, <b>ponyfishes,</b> {{slipmouths}} and toothponies are small to medium sized fishes living at the bottom in shallow coastal waters. They are widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. These fishes are captured in several types of fishing gear including bottom trawls, shore seines, gillnets, bagnets etc. Some species occur in dense schools offering great potentialities for commercial exploitation, especially along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. A few species enter brackishwaters and estuaries. Being small and scanty of flesh, they are consumed very little in fresh condition but mostly sun dried or salt cured. As such they are {{an important source of}} food and fish meal...|$|E
