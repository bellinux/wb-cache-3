500|$|Helped by the {{speculation}} surrounding Starr's collaborations {{with his former}} bandmates, and by the interest generated by the two Beatles compilations, Ringo was a commercial success, overshadowing Lennon's concurrently released Mind Games. Acknowledging Starr's achievement, Lennon sent him a telegram that read: [...] "Congratulations. How dare you? And <b>please</b> <b>write</b> me a hit song." [...] Lennon pushed for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] to be issued as the third single off the album in the United States, but [...] "Oh My My", written by Starr and Vini Poncia, was chosen instead.|$|E
500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady {{you are and what}} I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... <b>Please</b> <b>write</b> to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance." [...] Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the show was generally negative: writing in The Times following the broadcast of [...] "Conversations with the Dead", Andrew Hislop wrote that [...] "Star Cops has neither the campiness of Star Trek nor the imagination of Dr. Who to overcome its technological limitations". Also in The Times, reviewing [...] "Intelligent Listening for Beginners", Martin Cropper found that [...] "some of the individual plot-lines show invention of a sort, but the script is uniformly feeble". Meanwhile, in The Sunday Times, Patrick Stoddart was confused by the plot of [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" [...] asking readers [...] "if you are following any of this, <b>please</b> <b>write</b> to me and explain". Letter writers to the Radio Times were split {{on the merits of}} the show: some such as P. Tricker of Alpheton, Suffolk praising it for having [...] "brilliant special effects, well-written scripts and actors who were convincing" [...] while others like Martin Bower of Allendale, Northumberland slated the [...] "dated designs, poor music [...] cheap sets" [...] and P. Curwen of Balloch, Dunbartonshire described it as [...] "boring – too much talk and not enough action". Science fiction fandom at the time was more positive with Anthony McKay in Time Screen describing the series as [...] "one of the most refreshing telefantasy series for years" [...] while the British Science Fiction Association gave the show their Media Award in 1987.|$|E

50|$|Lee {{began his}} acting {{career as a}} {{university}} student, and in the 1950s and 1960s he was known, along with other veteran actors like Yeo Woon-kay, as the original stars of daehakgeuk or amateur student theatrical productions. Lee has since built a prolific career on the small and big screen spanning nearly six decades. He was most active in film in the late 1960s through the 1970s, most notably in Yu Hyun-mok's Bun-Rye's Story. As he grew older, Lee shifted to a primarily TV career in the 1990s, receiving acclaim for his roles in the television dramas Live As I <b>Please</b> (<b>written</b> by Yoo Ho), Pungwoon (Crisis), What is Love (written by Kim Soo-hyun) and Hur Jun.|$|R

In 1593, Bacon was chiefly occupied, we shall see, with the affairs of a young and beautiful Earl--the Earl of Essex, not of Southampton: to Essex he did not dedicate his two poems (if Venus and Lucrece were his). He [...] "did nothing but ruminate" [...] (he tells the world) on Essex. How Mr. Greenwood's Unknown was occupied in 1593-4, of course we cannot possibly be aware.|$|R
