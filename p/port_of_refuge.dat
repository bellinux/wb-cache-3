Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for ships caught in storms, and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him.

25|$|Because of {{the natural}} layout of the harbour, Ilfracombe became a {{significant}} safe port (registered <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge)</b> on the Bristol Channel. It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon {{has been there for}} over 650 years.|$|E

60|$|The old buccaneers {{knew all}} about our {{southern}} coast, for {{they were among the}} very first white men who ever set foot on the shores of North and South Carolina before that region had been settled by colonists, and when the only inhabitants were the wild Indians. These early buccaneers often used its bays and harbors as convenient <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge,</b> where they could anchor, divide spoils, take in fresh water, and stay as long as they pleased without fear of molestation. It was natural enough that when the Spanish-hating buccaneer merged into the independent pirate, who respected no flag, and preyed upon ships of every nation, he should feel very much at home on the Carolina coasts.|$|R
60|$|By morning no {{more than}} a faint air was blowing from the eastward, and, unable to make appreciable southing by it, Captain Davenport hauled up full-and-by on the port track.

Also, they were growing weak and complaining of stomach pains caused by the straight banana diet. All day the current swept the PYRENEES to the westward, while there was no wind to bear her south. In the middle of the first dogwatch, cocoanut trees were sighted due south, their tufted heads rising above the water and marking the low-lying atoll beneath.|$|R

Representatives of the British East India Company did call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions as early as 1601, but later came to favour Ascension Island and St. Helena as alternative <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were shipwrecked there for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives. They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil. Upon their return to Holland they reported favourably on the Cape's potential as a [...] "warehouse and garden" [...] for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: The Western {{coast of}} the Iberian Peninsula, and {{particularly}} Galicia, lies close {{to one of the}} European corridors with higher density of maritime traffic. Consequently, it suffers a permanent hazard of spills from tankers and other vessels in distress with toxic cargo, as the historical experience shows. Particularly after the 2002 Prestige experience, each new crises of a pollutant vessel in this area is followed by media claims for plans to determine places <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for vessels under risk. The argument frequently used is that Galicia needs a plan relating to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> which could reduce the potential damage to the whole regional population. But each time that a particular area is studied as a place <b>of</b> <b>refuge,</b> local stackholders show a strong opposition against the designation of their area as a place <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> In Environmental and Land Economics, this type of conflict between local and general interests has been approached under the name of “Not in my backyard” (NIMBY). We use the name “not in my garden” as a more proper translation of this type of conflict to the Galician debate on places <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> in order to emphasize the environmental and social concerns on the Galician coast. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the European Commission, and the Spanish Government have set out a series of recommendations for the <b>refuge</b> <b>of</b> vessels in distress. However, the international experience so far reveals a variety of incidents where potentially polluting ships have been refused access to places <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> The NIMBY approach, usually applied to matters of waste disposal, allows for an understanding of these cases and offers an explanation {{to the fact that the}} European Union and the Spanish Government are currently refusing to publish a list <b>of</b> places <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for vessels in distress. Recently (April, 2007), the European Parliament backed a few measures put forward by the European Commission under the name of “third maritime safety package". The Parliament supported the report of Dirk Sterckx to modify Directive 2002 / 59 /CE about the traffic monitoring system. The new proposal suggests an alternative to the debate on the designation of places of refuge: an independent authority should be set up to designate <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> for vessels in distress. The decision, close to the model of the British SOSREP, is consistent with the NIMBY perspective and it sets up a new approach for Spanish contingency plans on maritime pollution. In this report, we discuss the new proposal of the European Parliament from the point of view of the NIMBY conflict, which emphasizes the importance of creating a proper response capacity in local communities and a social culture of risk management. At the same time, we address a few general topics related to marine safety and to the places <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> debate: <b>port</b> state control, convenience flags, classification societies and liability and compensation...|$|R
