60|$|It {{is likely}} that young Low {{inherited}} his knavish disposition, {{for one of his}} brothers became a very bold and ingenious thief, and invented a new kind of robbery which afterwards was popular in London. This brother grew to be a tall fellow, and it was his practice to dress himself like a porter,--one of those men who in those days carried <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcels</b> about the city. On his head he poised a basket, and supporting this burden with his hands, he hurriedly made his way through the most crowded streets of London.|$|E
60|$|The <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcels</b> for the errand cart were numerous; {{and there}} were many {{stoppages}} to take them in and give them out, which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey. Some people were so full of expectation about their parcels, and other people were so full of wonder about their parcels, and other people were so full of inexhaustible directions about their parcels, and John had such a lively interest in all the parcels, that it was as good as a play. Likewise, there were articles to carry, which required to be considered and discussed, and in reference to the adjustment and disposition of which councils had to be holden by the Carrier and the senders: at which Boxer usually assisted, in short fits of the closest attention, and long fits of tearing round and round the assembled sages, and barking himself hoarse. Of all these little incidents, Dot was the amused and open-eyed spectatress from her chair in the cart; and as she sat there, looking on--a charming little portrait framed to admiration by the tilt--there was no lack of nudgings and glancings and whisperings and envyings among the younger men. And this delighted John the Carrier beyond measure; for he was proud to have his little wife admired, knowing that she didn't mind it--that, if anything, she rather liked it perhaps.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "Yes, I know; and I was {{perfectly}} sure of it; you're always so prompt, and I always wonder at it, such an absent-minded creature as you are. But you came near spoiling everything by getting here behind this pillar, and burying yourself {{in your book}} that way. If it hadn't been for my principle of always asking questions, I never should have found you in the world. But just as I was really beginning to despair, the Chorewoman came by, and I asked her if she had seen any gentleman here lately; and she said there was one now, over here, and I stretched up and saw you. I had such a fright for a moment, not seeing you; for I left my little plush bag with my purse in it at Stearns's, and I've got to hurry right back; though I'm afraid they'll be shut when I get there, Saturday afternoon, this way; but I'm going to rattle at the front door, and perhaps they'll come--they always stay, some of them, to put the goods away; and I can tell them I don't want to buy anything, but I left my bag with my purse in it, and I guess they'll let me in. I want you to keep these things for me, Edward; and I'll leave my shopping-bag; I sha'n't want it any more. Don't lose any of them. Better keep them all in your lap here together, and then nobody will come and sit on them." [...] She disburdens herself of her <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcels,</b> and arranges them on her husband's knees, while she goes on talking. [...] "I'm almost ready to drop, I'm so tired, and I do believe I should let you go up to Stearns's for me; but you couldn't describe the bag so they would recognize it, let alone what was in it, and they wouldn't give it to you, even if they would let you in to inquire: they're much more likely to let a lady in than a gentleman. But I shall take a coupe, and tell the driver simply to fly, though there's plenty of {{time to go to the}} ends of the earth and back before our train starts. Only I should like to be here to receive the Campbells, and keep Willis from buying tickets for Amy and himself, and us, too, for that matter; he has that vulgar passion--I don't know where he's picked it up--for wanting to pay everybody's way; and you'd never think of your Hundred-Trip ticket-book till it was too late. Do take your book out and hold it in your hand, so you'll be sure to remember it, as soon as you see Willis. You had better keep saying over to yourself, 'Willis--Hundred-Trip Tickets--Willis--Hundred-Trip Tickets;' that's the way I do. Where is the book? I have to remember everything! Do keep your ticket-book in your hand, Edward, till Willis comes." ...|$|E

50|$|The Railway Express Agency (REA) was a {{national}} monopoly {{set up by the}} United States federal government in 1917. Rail express services provided small <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> transportation using the extant railroad infrastructure much as UPS functions today using the road system. The United States government was concerned about the rapid, safe movement of <b>parcels,</b> money, <b>and</b> goods during World War I and REA was its solution to this problem. REA ceased operations in 1975, when its business model ceased to be viable.|$|R

50|$|The {{postal service}} is a Crown {{corporation}} that delivers mail (letters, maps, documents) and goods (<b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcels),</b> along with transferring money. It has 197 offices throughout the territory, 56 distribution centers in rural areas, two postal sorting centers, two centers of parcels, and a philatelic center.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} parcel service, which allowed the orderly shipment of mailed <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcels</b> {{from one country}} to another according to predetermined rates, was established by the Universal Postal Union on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject. The service was difficult to introduce as in several countries the carriage of parcels was a monopoly of the railway companies, and Egypt, Great Britain, India, Canada and Italy all initially claimed that there was no parcel service in their country.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Helene Hanff is {{in search}} of obscure {{classics}} and British literature titles {{that she has been}} unable to find in New York City. She notices an ad in the Saturday Review of Literature placed by antiquarian booksellers Marks & Co, located at the titular address in London. She contacts the shop, where chief buyer and manager Frank Doel fulfills her requests. A long-distance friendship develops over time between the two and between Hanff and other staff members, as well, including birthday gifts, holiday <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> food <b>parcels</b> to compensate for post-World War II food shortages in Britain. Their correspondence includes discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of John Donne, how to make Yorkshire pudding, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the coronation of Elizabeth II.|$|R
5000|$|The project {{started by}} taking a [...] "20,000 foot overview" [...] of {{existing}} mail systems, {{and trying to find}} common concepts and problems. Their key conclusion was that e-mail systems were designed for the wrong purpose—to deliver e-mail to people, when they should instead store and forward things to places. Compare this with the real-world postal service, which delivers not only mail, but magazines, <b>packages,</b> large <b>parcels,</b> <b>and</b> even (in one example) building materials to a worksite.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{proposed}} methodology presents other limits. Nowadays, {{there are not}} unified and standard databases to quantify food transport flows (only some general surveys on goods transport are available, but {{they are based on}} non-perishable goods transport mainly <b>packaged</b> in <b>parcels</b> <b>and</b> pallets). Moreover, canteen distribution data are issued in France mainly from private companies, which imply confidentiality issues and the need of reconstructing part of those data. For those reasons, it is currently difficult to define very specific demand models (for example by type of product, with a fine disaggregation for food supply frequencies, etc.). That has an impact on the route construction procedure and the representation of the resulting transport supply schemes (which degree of detail is dependent on the demand specifications). Nonetheless, further developments on the demand estimation seem to be possible, for example using time series data issued from local authorities (which are customers of distribution carriers). That data is not nowadays available, but they would be used for research purposes; therefore, further work will explore such possibilities. Consequently, with a more detailed demand model, the route construction procedure would evolve to take into account such specificity.|$|R
