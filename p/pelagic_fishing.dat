50|$|The town is {{the centre}} of the Irish <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> and {{processing}} industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting. The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.|$|E

40|$|Small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> are termed “wasp-waist” {{species as}} they {{dominate}} mid trophic levels and comprise relatively few species but attain large abundances that can vary drastically in size. They {{have been found}} to exert top-down control on their prey species and bottom-up control on their predators and, in this way, appear to induce unsuspected ecosystem dynamics. Largely based on model results, this chapter explores these effects and associated dynamics, not only illustrating the importance of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in structuring marine ecosystems, but also revealing the consistency of the role of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> across various upwelling systems in which they play key roles. The Northern and Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt, South Catalan Sea and North and Central Adriatic Sea ecosystems are compared in terms of the importance and role of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> using information gained from landings and ecological models. Trophic level of the catch, the Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index and the ratio of pelagic:demersal fish are calculated from reported landings. Sums of all flows to detritus are compared across modelled ecosystems. Models of the Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt and South Catalan Sea are used to perform two simulations: (1) closure of fisheries on small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> and (2) collapse of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> stocks, to further explore the roles of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in the dynamics of these ecosystems.

50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing),</b> and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, Norway pout, blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total industrial fish catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|E
5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} splendid alfonsino, black cardinal fish, black scabbardfish, and wreckfish. Trawl fishing during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in approximately 20,000 tons of fish being harvested. [...] As a result, the seamounts were closed to demersal fishing (collecting fish {{near the bottom of}} the ocean, as opposed to <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing,</b> collecting fish near the surface) beginning 1 January 1997. The original ban was supposed to be lifted 31 December 2010, but was extended until 31 December 2020. Almost a decade into the ban, a 2005 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution survey found that two of the peaks, Kükenthal and Yakutat, had been stripped bare of both corals and bottom-dwelling animals. However the survey, which covered both the Corner Rise and New England Seamounts, found 270 species of invertebrates and crustaceans, including 70 species unique to the Corner Rise Seamounts.|$|E
50|$|Another {{gift from}} nature is {{the fish and}} the helpful environment.The fish head dish is a {{favorite}} specialty of Chinese people. High quality fish heads are more expensive than fresh fish. At such a low temperature, fish keep still. Traveling long distances within one day,the people who depend on the sea finally received generous gifts from nature once again. But <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> only runs months a year. There's no time to be lost. The fishermen have a unique way to celebrate the harvest: A rich feast of fish. The decocted mackerel can retain its original flavor after being cooked alone. Chizi fish tastes good after being braised with garlic. Shell fish has the fine quality of making soup with sour bamboo shoot. The dishes retain the original flavor of seafood. Only time can see how human beings will adapt to the changing ocean. When we enjoy delicacies, we should appreciate {{the people who make}} this happen through their hard work and wisdom. Nature tends to be generous and forthcoming with her rewards for man.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{shallow water}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> found in both {{tropical}} and temperate waters around the world, are grey mullet, sprats and garfish. As <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> all these fish {{spend most of}} their time living in the water column away the sea floor.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of fish in}} Croatia is relatively low for a Mediterranean country. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is the inadequate supply of fish. The supply of fish is usually limited to expensive species of whitefish, while the supply of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> is very scarce. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> can rarely be found in restaurants, and in the fish- markets it reaches very high prices. The basic goal of the project "Srdela Snack" (srdela - Croatian word for sardine) was to set up and test a new model of commercialization of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> through franchise "fast - food" outlets. In the paper we will describe the concept of this new model which includes the whole distribution channel, from fishermen, through processors, restaurants to consumers. In this model fishermen supply fresh <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> to approved restaurant s (members of the franchise) which prepare the fish according to traditional recipes. In this way a completely new product is introduced in the Croatian market. The main idea was to offer a high- quality, simple and convenient meals made of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> from the Croatian Adriatic. This model of commercialization of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> was tested through a pilot project. In the pilot project the standards of food quality were determined, the traditional recipes for preparing the food were selected, and the menu, consisting entirely of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> dishes was made. Finally, the logo of the franchise restaurant was designed. The test restaurant was opened in the summer 2004. The visitors of the restaurant participated in a survey which was used to determine the degree of their satisfaction with the new product and the new model of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> commercialization. The results of the survey showed that there is a strong demand for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in the Croatian market. Most of the interviewed consumers liked the new product; they consider it very healthy, affordable, tasty, and typical for Mediterranean and Croatia. Fishermen and restaurant - owners also showed a great interest for this new model of commercialization because it could provide them with a bigger income. Since the results of the pilot project showed that this kind of innovation in the distribution channel is very successful, this model of franchise restaurants offering <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> "fast - food" can be implemented on the national level.

25|$|Demersal {{fish are}} bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> which live and feed {{away from the}} bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> can contain up to 30 percent.|$|R
50|$|Several {{aspects of}} their biology (i.e. lack of a swimbladder, its pelvic suction disc) led some {{to believe that they}} were a bottom {{dwelling}} species. Lumpfish are frequently caught in <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> nets, however, capture in bottom trawls is also common. An investigation using electronic data-storage tags attached to the fish have confirmed that, at least during its breeding migration, this fish will spend time associated with the sea bed, and also some time in the pelagic zone. As the fish came close to breeding, they began to spend a greater amount of time in the pelagic zone. With the lack of a swim bladder, the fish were able to make rapid movements through the water column, moving between surface waters and depths of over 300 m within one day. Data from research surveys and data-storage tags show that adult lumpfish alter their behaviour between night and day with the fish spending more time in the pelagic zone at night and found associated with the seabed during the day, the reasons for this are unclear. This fish is now considered to be a semi-pelagic/semi-demersal fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{peak of the}} herring fishery {{industry}} and also its main decline came between 1900 and the First World War. Steam-powered fishing boats appeared {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and it was steam drifters that would take the volume of the catch to new heights. The powered winches allowed longer nets to be deployed and their speed enabled the boats to get to market quickly and to return to sea. In those early years of the 20th century, the Scottish catch reached 2 million barrels annually. Before the First World War, Germany and Russia were the main market for British herring. After the war, however, Germany was racked by inflation and was impoverished. Russia underwent the 1917 Revolution and civil war. Other European countries started to compete strongly with the British fleets and for twenty years the industry went into a steep decline. The beginnings of the seine net fishing began in Scotland in 1921 but the use of the large inefficient steam boats greatly hindered this new whitefish fishery. After the Second World War, the Scottish east coast fleet, with government assistance, was totally regenerated becoming mainly a whitefish industry. This in turn declined in the 1970s and 1980s due to overfishing and the subsequent imposition of quotas by the European Union. The herring industry continued to shrink. From the 1960s, trawling and purse-netting were the main methods of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing,</b> which not only includes herring but also mackerel. Although a quota is placed on the total herring catch and with no limit on mackerel, this sector is now the healthiest in the Scottish fleet.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs), ideally, manage human uses that threaten ecosystems, or components of ecosystems. During several recent MPA designation processes, concerns have arisen over the scientific justification for no-take MPAs, {{particularly those that}} restrict recreational fishing for pelagic species. An important question is: under what conditions might recreational <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> be compatible with the conservation goals of an MPA that is primarily focused on benthic communities? In 2005, an expert workshop of fisheries biologists, marine ecologists, MPA managers, and recreational fishermen was convened by NOAA's National MPA Center to evaluate the limited empirical data on benthic-pelagic coupling and to help provide practical advice on this topic. The participants (i) proposed a preliminary conceptual framework for addressing vertical zoning, (ii) developed preliminary guidelines to consider when evaluating whether to allow or restrict <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> in an MPA, and (iii) identified future research priorities for understanding benthic-pelagic coupling. A suite of ecological conditions where recreational <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> may not be compatible with benthic conservation were identified: (1) high relief habitats, (2) depths shallower than 50 - 100 m (depending upon the specific location), (3) major topographic and oceanographic features, and (4) spawning areas. Similarly, <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishing</b> {{is not likely to}} affect benthic communities adversely in many circumstances. Until further scientific study can shed more light on the issue of how benthic-pelagic linkages affect specific conservation targets, the proposed framework in this manuscript provides practical, easily-applied guidance for using vertical zoning to manage fishing in multiple use MPAs that focus on benthic conservation...|$|E
40|$|Mid-water baited remote {{underwater}} video systems (BRUVS) {{are becoming}} an increasingly popular tool for examining <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages in a non-destructive, fisheries independent manner. As {{the technique is}} relatively novel, critical methodological questions such as the most appropriate attractant for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> to mid-water RUVS remain unresolved. In this study, we compared the relative effectiveness of 4 attractant treatments (sight: metallic reflectors, sound: bait fish recordings, scent: pilchards and their combination) {{on the time of}} first arrival, total abundance of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> and the relative abundance of 3 <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> species: Trachurus novaezelandiae, Sarda australis and Seriola lalandi. Recordings were made using mid-water RUVS in the Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. RUVS using a combination of all attractants recorded the highest abundances and shortest time of first arrival of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish.</b> This result was primarily driven by Trachurus novaezelandiae. Although not significant, the abundance of Sarda australis was also greatest on the RUVS with all attractants. In contrast, the type of attractant had no effect on the abundance of Seriola lalandi. Bait, the standard attractant used in BRUVS surveys, was a poor performer for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in all instances.
