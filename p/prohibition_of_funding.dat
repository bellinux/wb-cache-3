40|$|The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), {{which is}} {{supported}} by the German Gesetz zur Uebernahme von Gewaehrleistungen im Rahmen des europaeischen Stabilisierungsmechanismus (StabMechG), suspends the Stability and Growth Pact as the basis of the European Economic and Monetary Union. The actual ‘suspension’ from the ’no bail-out’ restriction (Art. 125 TFEU) and the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> national debts (Art. 123 TFEU) transfers risks and financial burdens from deeply indebted states to solvent EU member states. As a result an unauthorized „transfer union" emerges, whose Central Bank lost its independence to a political leadership and cannot focus on its objective of price stability as contracted any longer. Even without the use of financial and guarantee aids the German economy suffers from a distorted yield structure and crowding-out effects of private investments. From the economic point of view the used measures are neither appropriate nor necessary for achieving financial stability within the European Economic and Monetary Union. Much less these measures are proportionate. Of course, the alternative of accepting a ‘controlled’ national bankruptcy would not have been without its formidable costs. However, its attribution of arrangements in the line with market requirements and the adherence to EU-contract provisions would have been the more worthwhile regulatory policy option for a more solid budgetary policy in the future.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the Mexican pension reform of December 1995. Essentially, the reform substituted a defined-benefit pay-as-you-go {{system with a}} fully funded defined contribution system based" on individual accounts with a minimum pension guarantee provided by the government. Total contributions to the accounts will amount to 13. 5 percent of the salary for the average worker plus 2. 5 percent for disability and life insurance that will still be managed by the government's Social Security Institute (IMSS). The new system shares many common elements with other Latin American experiences. However, it shows some advantages and disadvantages with respect to them. Regarding the advantages, the new system completely substitutes the old system; administrative costs are reduced by {{limiting the number of}} transfers between pension fund managers to once per year; pension managers are allowed to operate several funds; the law does not establish a minimum guaranteed rate of return for pension funds; and there is a centralized contributions collector agency. Disadvantages include the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>funds</b> from investing in foreign securities; the IMSS is the sole provider of disability and life insurance; the IMSS will be able to operate a pension fund manager; the housing subaccount offers low returns; there are market share limits; and the new system still faces some portability problems. Finally, we found that the fiscal cost of the transition to the new system is relatively low compared to similar reforms in other Latin American countries. ...|$|R

While many argue that soft dollar brokerage leads to the unjust enrichment <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> managers at the expense <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> beneficiaries, Johnsen concludes that soft dollars are efficient.

The article present and analyzes the impediments to marriage according to articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code. Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the impediments to marriage are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; 3. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage.

2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of President Ulysses S. Grant after two terms, the Republicans had to settle on a new candidate for the 1876 election. Hayes's success as Governor of Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency, alongside James G. Blaine of Maine, Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, and Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Despite {{the strength of the}} other candidates, the Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind Hayes, and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to aid the nomination to his fellow Ohioan. In June 1876, the convention assembled in Hayes's hometown of Cincinnati with Blaine as the favorite. Hayes did not see himself as the favorite to win the presidential nomination, but made an effort to position himself as a potential compromise candidate. Hayes placed fifth on the first ballot of the convention, behind Blaine, Morton, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Conkling. After six ballots, Blaine remained in the lead, but on the seventh ballot, Blaine's adversaries rallied around Hayes, granting the presidential nomination to the latter. The convention then selected Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for Vice President, a man about whom Hayes had recently asked, [...] "I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?" [...] Hayes's views were largely in accord with the party platform, which called for equal rights for all (including women), continued Reconstruction, the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> public <b>funding</b> for sectarian schools, and the resumption of specie payments. Hayes's nomination was well received by the press, with even Democratic papers describing Hayes as honest and likable. In a public letter accepting the nomination, Hayes vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve for only one term.|$|R

In addition the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture is absolute and non-derogable. Therefore. it entails some obligations for states whether or not they ratify the CAT.
