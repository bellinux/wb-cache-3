40|$|Conventional vaccine {{strategies}} have been highly efficacious {{for several decades}} in reducing mortality and morbidity due to infectious diseases. The bane of conventional vaccines, {{such as those that}} include whole organisms or large proteins, appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that, not only contributes little to the protective immune response, but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses. <b>Peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting. In this article, we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases. Additionally, we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Most {{attempts}} to develop synthetic <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{assume that it}} is possible to obtain effective vaccine immunogens by making short linear peptides adopt the structures observed when epitopes of pathogens are bound to neutralizing antibodies. Although more than a thousand synthetic peptides have been examined as potential prophylactic <b>vaccines,</b> only 125 <b>peptides</b> have progressed to phase I clinical trials, 30 have made it to phase II trials but not a single one has passed phase III trials and is currently marketed for human use. Reasons for this lack of success include 1) an excessive reliance on continuous epitopes as vaccine candidates, 2) an exaggerated confidence in the specificity of antibodies, 3) the failure to recognize that an operational bias is introduced when monoclonal antibodies are used to characterize epitopes and, 4) a tendency to underestimate the difference between antigenicity and immunogenicity. There clearly is a need to overcome these misconceptions if synthetic <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> are ever to become a reality.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the H- 2 class II allele-specific amino acid motif of the agretope (the site of {{contact between the}} peptide antigen and the major histocompatibility complex) for a synthetic peptide composed of residues 43 - 58 of pigeon cytochrome c (p 43 - 58). Residues 46 and 54 functioned as the agretope, and residues 50 and 52 functioned as the epitope (the site for contact between the peptide antigen and the T-cell antigen receptor). In general, agretopes and epitopes function independently. Thus, substitution of amino acids in the epitope does not significantly affect binding of the peptide antigen to a class II molecule. On {{the basis of these}} findings, synthetic <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> against influenza Aichi (H 3 N 2) virus were prepared by introducing seven residues of the influenza virus hemagglutinin into the frame component residues 43 - 46 and 54 - 58 of p 43 - 58 analogues including the agretopes for Ak or Ab previously determined on the p 43 - 58 segment. These <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> induced both helper T-cell responses and production of antibodies that were specific for influenza Aichi hemagglutinin but not for the major histocompatibility complex binding frame in mice bearing Ak or Ab.

50|$|HER-Vaxx {{has been}} {{designed}} as a more effective alternative to the HER-2-targeting monoclonal antibody drugs Herceptin and Perjeta. In creating HER-Vaxx, Ursula Wiedermann and her colleagues at Medical University of Vienna took the three most immunogenic B cell epitopes from the extracellular domain of HER-2 molecule - called the P4, P6 and P7 antigens - and out of it constructed a <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine.</b> P6 and P7 sit at the Herceptin binding site while P4 sits at the Perjeta site. The vaccine had been intended to be delivered in 'virosomes', that is, influenza virus particles stripped of their disease-causing contents {{so as to be}} able to carry peptides instead. However, in 2015 Imugene announced that it would deliver the vaccine with the diphtheria toxoid CRM197. The vaccine's developers argue that HER-Vaxx has a number of benefits over the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. The vaccine generates a 'polyclonal' rather than a monoclonal antibody response to HER-2 - i.e. different kinds of antibodies - increasing the chance that cells carrying HER-2 will be killed, particularly those at an earlier stage of disease. The delivery system helps adjuvant the vaccine, increasing the size of the immune response. Thirdly, polyclonal antibodies do not appear to have the cardiotoxicity that has been observed in >10% of patients on Herceptin. The potential for immune memory may mean that the treatment effect is long-lasting (by contrast antibodies have a short half-life - that of Herceptin is only 12 days - meaning that the patient has to have infusions every 1-3 weeks). The vaccine would be available intra-muscularly, where Herceptin and Perjeta have to be given by regular infusions.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} cancer <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> therapy is insufficient. To enhance the anti-tumor effect of <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> therapy, we combined this therapy with an anti-CD 4 mAb (GK 1. 5), {{which is known}} to deplete CD 4 + cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs). Methods: To determine the treatment schedule, the number of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of mice was traced by flow cytometry after administration of anti-CD 4 mAb. The ovalbumin (OVA) 257 – 264 <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> was injected intradermally and anti-CD 4 mAb was administered intraperitoneally into C 57 BL/ 6 mice at different schedules. We evaluated the enhancement of OVA peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction in the combination therapy using the ELISPOT assay, CD 107 a assay, and cytokine assay. We then examined the in vivo metastasis inhibitory effect by OVA <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> therapy in combination with anti-CD 4 mAb against OVA-expressing thymoma (EG 7) in a murine liver metastatic model. Results: We showed that peptide-specific CTL induction was enhanced by the <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> in combination with anti-CD 4 mAb and that the optimized treatment schedule had the strongest induction effect of peptide-specific CTLs using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. We also confirmed that the CD 107 a+ cells secreted perforin and granzyme B {{and the amount of}} IL- 2 and TNF produced by these CTLs increased when the <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> was combined with anti-CD 4 mAb. Furthermore, metastasis was inhibited by peptide vaccines in combination with anti-CD 4 mAb compared to <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> alone in a murine liver metastatic model. Conclusion: The use of anti-CD 4 mAb in combination with the OVA <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> therapy increased the number of peptide-specific CTLs and showed a higher therapeutic effect against OVA-expressing tumors. The combination with anti-CD 4 mAb may provide a new cancer vaccine strategy...|$|E

One concern in RSV vaccine development is that a non-live virus vaccine would predispose for enhanced disease similar to that seen with the formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine.

In support of this hypothesis, we show that FI-RSV vaccinated mice administered RSV G <b>peptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> had {{a significant reduction in}} enhanced disease after RSV challenge.
