We have examined the distribution and abundance of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, key structural components of the elastic fiber network, in <b>photoaged</b> and photoprotected skin. Punch biopsies taken from <b>photoaged</b> forearm and from photoprotected hip and upper inner arm of 16 subjects with a clinical range of <b>photoaging</b> were examined for fibrillin- 1 and fibrillin- 2 expression and microfibril distribution. In situ hybridization revealed decreased fibrillin- 1 mRNA but unchanged fibrillin- 2 mRNA levels in severely <b>photoaged</b> forearm biopsies relative to photoprotected dermal sites. An immunohistochemical approach demonstrated that microfibrils at the dermal–epidermal junction were significantly reduced in moderate to severely <b>photoaged</b> forearm skin. Confocal microscopy revealed that the papillary dermal microfibrillar network was truncated and depleted in <b>photoaged</b> skin.

40|$|Although histopathological dermal elastosis is {{the current}} gold {{standard}} for the diagnosis of <b>photoageing,</b> noninvasive methods for quantifying the amount of photodamage to skin are clearly preferable.

40|$|International audienceThe {{comprehensive}} study of photoinduced morphological and chemical changes of the surface of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and new EVOH/zeolite nanocomposite as a potential candidate for packaging of flexible electronics was carried out. The films ageing was performed upon accelerated <b>photoageing</b> conditions with low-pressure mercury lamps as a light source. The impact of particles addition was evaluated in terms of surface photochemical behaviour and durability. The morphology data obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were complemented by information collected by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), providing high sensitivity and selectivity for database analysis. The combined results showed the complexity of <b>photoageing</b> processes and highlighted significant difference in surface behaviour for plain polymer and nanocomposite. It reflects different evolution of surface morphology with roughness increase for nanocomposite and smoothing in case of plain polymer upon <b>photoageing.</b> This phenomenon was interpreted by the theory of particles accumulation at {{the surface of the}} films due to polymer photooxidation and was supported by information on chemical composition at the surface obtained by ToF-SIMS. Evolution of ion peak areas displayed an increase of the particle-related ions at the surface of the films with irradiation time.

40|$|To {{understand}} the molecular alterations occurring during the aging process, we compared mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase {{activities in the}} intrinsically aged and <b>photoaged</b> skins in the same individuals. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular events related to MAP kinase changes in intrinsically aged and <b>photoaged</b> skins. We found that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity in <b>photoaged</b> skin was reduced, and that the activities of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38 kinase were increased compared with intrinsically aged skin in the same individuals. Phospho-c-Jun levels and activator protein 1 activities in <b>photoaged</b> skin were also higher than in intrinsically aged skin. Moreover, catalase activity {{was found to be}} much reduced in primary dermal fibroblasts from <b>photoaged</b> skin, and as a result, H 2 O 2 accumulated more in primary dermal fibroblasts in <b>photoaged</b> skin. In addition, treating primary dermal fibroblasts from <b>photoaged</b> skin with catalase reduced H 2 O 2 levels, reversed aging-dependent MAP kinase changes, and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 1 expression. Our results indicate that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species due to catalase attenuation may be a critical aspect of the MAP kinase signaling changes that may lead to skin aging and <b>photoaging</b> in human skin in vivo. Thus, the induction and regulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes including catalase may offer a strategy for preventing and treating skin aging...|$|R
40|$|The {{free radical}} theory proposes that <b>photoaging,</b> {{which is both}} qualitatively and quantitatively {{different}} from chronological aging, may result from imperfect protection against cumulative stress of free radicals produced by chronic and repeated ultraviolet irradiation. Since the skin is always in contact with oxygen and is occasionally exposed to ultraviolet light, skin {{is one of the}} best target organs of environmental photo-oxidative stress. A growing body of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species are generated by ultraviolet irradiation resulting in the structural and functional alteration of cutaneous components which should affect the <b>photoaging</b> process over a long period. The age-related alteration of cutaneous antioxidant defense capacity against cumulative effects of continual photo-oxidative stress to the skin may also affect the <b>photoaging.</b> Thus the possible use of antioxidants that attenuate photo-oxidative toxicity is believed to be an important strategy modulating <b>photoaging.</b> Several antioxidants have readily been proved to work in the experimental conditions.

40|$|Skin aging may {{be divided}} into <b>photoaging</b> and {{intrinsic}} aging. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate and sodium lauryl sulfate on the production and expression of cytokines and proto-oncogenes in <b>photoaged</b> and intrinsically aged skin, compared with young skin. Keratinocytes were taken from newborns, young adults in their twenties, and from the forearm and thigh of volunteers in their fifties and seventies. Interleukin- 1 α and - 6, and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, c-fos and c-myc were measured after cultured keratinocytes had been treated with 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate and sodium lauryl sulfate. There has been no report concerning the dependence of cytokine production by sodium lauryl sulfate upon <b>photoaging</b> and intrinsic aging. This study also involves the first investigation of the effects of aging on c-myc expression by 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate treatment. Cytokine production decreased markedly with age. These results suggest the progressive decline of cellular function with age. The ratio of cytokine production in the irritant-treated group compared with that in the control group showed a different pattern in <b>photoaging</b> and intrinsic aging. With the significant difference between <b>photoaging</b> and intrinsic aging, T/C ratio decreased in interleukin- 1 α and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist upon aging, whereas it increased in interleukin- 6. S/C ratio was uniquely elevated on <b>photoaged</b> skin in the 50 y age group. It is suggested that <b>photoaged</b> skin shows an exaggerated reaction to surfactant. Compared with the control, c-fos expression in 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate-treated keratinocytes decreased with age in the thigh, but increased in the <b>photoaged</b> skin of forearm.

40|$|Suntanning {{increases}} {{skin cancer}} risk and prematurely ages skin. <b>Photoageing</b> photography {{is an effective}} means of increasing adult ultraviolet radiation (UVR) awareness and skin-protection practices. While adults’ largely positive suntanning-deterrence responses to <b>photoageing</b> photography are well-documented, comparatively {{little is known about the}} deterrence effectiveness of <b>photoageing</b> photography with adolescents. To help fill this knowledge gap, in-depth interviews were collected from 10 adolescent females and were subsequently subjected to interpretive phenomenological analysis. The emergent central theme – Having a tan and looking good in the short-term is okay, however, in the longer-term you can end up looking far worse… but still a tan is worth it – and its component subthemes reveal that the adolescent female’s desire for a suntan is largely appearance driven. While photoaged photography is effective in increasing their awareness of the skin damage that UVR exposure causes, it does not alter their suntanning intentions. The analysis also revealed that one of the major barriers to adolescent females’ adoption of skin-protective behaviours is their belief in their own invincibility. Hence, skin-protection interventions that lessen the aura of invincibility around adolescent females’ understanding of their risk for developing skin cancers are vital to reducing the incidence of malignant melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Context: Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) {{is the second}} most common skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, its most important risk factor, has mostly been investigated in cross-sectional study designs. This study presents a comprehensive and longitudinal examination of determinants of SCC, including <b>photoageing.</b> Objective: To examine the determinants of SCC and its precursor condition of <b>photoageing.</b> Above all, the objective was to investigate the interplay of phenotypic traits; occupation and leisure-time sun exposure patterns; and personal exposures, in particular, tobacco smoking and life course sun exposure, upon the risk of SCC and <b>photoageing.</b> Setting and Design: This investigation formed part of a large community-based, long-term cohort study of skin cancer. The Nambour Skin Cancer Study (forthwith, the Nambour Study) began in 1986 and concluded in 2007. In 1986 a random sample of 2095 people (aged 20 - 69 years) from Nambour, Queensland participated in a skin cancer survey. In 1992, a 5 year field trial to assess the preventive actions of sunscreen and beta-carotene was initiated (n= 1621). Regular full skin examinations were conducted to determine the presence of skin cancer and actinic skin damage. In 1994, participants detailed their life course sun exposure (n= 1290). After the trial ended in 1996, participants continued to complete regular questionnaires and ascertainment of skin cancers continued to 2007. Participants: The participants were 1339 unselected adults aged 25 to 75 years who had taken part in the Nambour Study in 1992 and consented to the follow-up study. Methods: Life course sun exposure hours were estimated from questionnaires and the approximate UVR exposure for Nambour (latitude 26 S) was determined. Descriptive analyses examined patterns of exposure within the population. Factors influencing the severity of <b>photoageing</b> were also investigated. Informed by these analyses, relative risks were calculated for determinants of SCC and population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) for key modifiable risk factors. To investigate tobacco smoking as a risk factor for SCC, systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Exposure measures: Pigmentary phenotype, estimated UVR exposure, tobacco smoking, sun-related behaviours, e. g. sunscreen use. Outcome measures: Incident and histologically proven SCC of the skin from 1992 to 2007 was the main outcome assessed. <b>Photoageing,</b> assessed clinically and micro-topographically (Beagley and Gibson scale), was an intermediate outcome measure and an objective measure of cumulative sun exposure in the final SCC analysis. Results: Examination of self-reported UVR revealed mean annual exposures were highest in early life and older adulthood (older than 60 years.) Women reported spending less time in the sun than men in all stages of life (...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Human skin, {{in common}} with other organs, ages as a {{consequence}} of the passage of time, but in areas exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation, the effects of this intrinsic ageing process are exacerbated. In particular, both the severity and speed of onset of age-related changes, such as wrinkle formation and loss of elasticity, are enhanced in photoaged (also termed extrinsically aged) as compared with aged, photoprotected, skin. The anatomy of skin is characterised by two major layers: an outer, avascular, yet highly cellular and dynamic epidermis and an underlying vascularised, comparatively static and cell-poor, dermis. The structural consequences of <b>photoageing</b> are mainly evident in the extracellular matrix-rich but cell-poor dermis where key extracellular matrix proteins are particularly susceptible to photodamage. Most investigations to date have concentrated on the cell as both a target for and mediator of, ultraviolet radiation-induced <b>photoageing.</b> As the main effectors of dermal remodelling produced by cells (extracellular proteases) generally have low substrate specificity, we recently suggested that the differential susceptibility of key extracellular matrix proteins to the processes of <b>photoageing</b> may be due to direct, as opposed to cell-mediated, photodamage. In this review, we discuss the experimental evidence for ultraviolet radiation (and related reactive oxygen species) -mediated differential degradation of normally long lived dermal proteins including the fibrillar collagens, elastic fibre components, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Whilst these components exhibit highly diverse primary and hence macro- and supra-molecular structures, we present evidence that amino acid composition alone may be a useful predictor of age-related protein degradation in both photoexposed and, {{as a consequence of}} differential oxidation sensitivity, photoprotected, tissues. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Skin is {{a window}} to aging changes, a {{biological}} reality. There is a dearth of studies regarding the various chronological (intrinsic) aging and <b>photoaging</b> (extrinsic) changes seen in Asians. This study was undertaken to detect the clinical pattern of aging skin changes and dermatoses seen in the elderly. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive study conducted on 500 consecutive elderly individuals attending the Dermatology out-patient department. The severity of <b>photoaging</b> was graded using Glogau scale. Results: Most of the population had skin type IV and V. Majority (415, 83 %) of our cases had chronological aging without <b>photoaging</b> and the remaining 85 (17 %) individuals had <b>photoaging</b> along with chronological aging. The common skin changes due to chronological aging were thin skin, fine wrinkles, xerosis, and loss of elasticity. <b>Photoaging</b> changes such as dyspigmentation, freckles, thick skin, deep wrinkles, melasma, citrine skin, senile purpura, pseudostellate scar, acrokeratoelastoidosis marginalis, and lentigines were less frequent in our study. Smoking and prolonged sun exposure was the risk factors aggravating <b>photoaging.</b> The most common dermatosis was pruritus in 248 (49. 6 %) individuals, of which 149 (29. 8 %) had pruritus associated with xerosis. Contact dermatitis was more common in males. Fungal infections were frequently seen in females. Seborrhoeic keratosis (253, 50. 6 %) {{was the most common}} benign neoplasm more commonly seen in males. Cutaneous malignancies were less common in our study population.

In this study, we compared collagen synthesis, matrix metalloproteinase- 1 levels, and gelatinase activity of sun-exposed and sun-protected skin of both young and old subjects. Using northern blot analysis, immunohistochemical stain, and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that the levels of procollagen type I mRNA and protein in <b>photoaged</b> and naturally aged human skin in vivo are significantly lower than those of young skin. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by northern blot analysis, that the procollagen α 1 (I) mRNA expression of <b>photoaged</b> skin is much greater than that of sun-protected skin in the same individual. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical stain were used to show that the expression of type I procollagen mRNA and protein in the fibroblasts of <b>photoaged</b> skin is greater than for naturally aged skin. In addition, it was found, by Western blot analysis using protein extracted from the dermal tissues, that the level of procollagen type I protein in <b>photoaged</b> skin is lower than that of naturally aged skin. The level of matrix metalloproteinase- 1 protein and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 were higher in the dermis of <b>photoaged</b> skin than in naturally aged skin. Our results suggest that the natural aging process decreases collagen synthesis and increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, whereas <b>photoaging</b> results in an increase of collagen synthesis and greater matrix metalloproteinase expression in human skin in vivo.

40|$|Background Skin ageing is {{a complex}} process due to {{intrinsic}} chronological factors (chronoageing) and extrinsic environmental factors. The primary extrinsic factor is cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure, and is therefore termed <b>photoageing.</b> The current standards for measuring cumulative sun damage are biopsy histology and skin microtopography. However, skin biopsies are too invasive for population studies and skin replicas render only superficial skin architecture data. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive imaging tool that allows for in vivo imaging of the skin at quasihistological resolution. Objectives To define and identify RCM features associated with chronological ageing and <b>photoageing</b> on the forearm in two age groups with different skin phototypes and to assess whether these results agree with previous findings. Methods We obtained RCM images of dorsal and volar nonlesional skin of the lower forearm of 75 individuals with skin Fitzpatrick phototypes I-III in two age groups (20 - 30 years and 50 - 60 years). From each participant and body site, 21 RCM features were assessed and {{statistically significant differences between}} the two age groups and different forearm sites determined. Results RCM enabled identification of changes in architecture, cell morphology and extracellular matrix (collagen) at the level of the epidermis, dermoepidermal junction and papillary dermis. Changes that were correlated with chronological ageing and which were aggravated on the UV-exposed dorsal forearm were: loss of small skin furrows resulting in wider and less intersecting furrows; irregularity of the epidermal honeycomb pattern; irregularly distributed (mottled) pigmented keratinocytes/melanocytes; irregularity of the papillary rings and/or effacement of the rete ridges; and loss of thin collagen fibres and presence of collagen clods.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsExcessive {{exposure}} to the sun can cause severe <b>photoaging</b> {{as early as the}} second decade of life resulting in a loss of physiological elastic fiber functions. We designed a first study to assess differences in facial skin pH, sebum, elasticity, hydration and tonicity and serum levels of fibronectin, elastin, neutrophil elastase 2, hyaluronic acid and carbonylated proteins between patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls. In a second study we tested the hypothesis that a dietary supplement would improve facial <b>photoaging,</b> also promoting changes in the above mentioned skin and serum parameters. MethodsIn the first study we enrolled 30 women [age: 47. 5 ± 1. 6 years (mean±standard error of the mean) ] affected by moderate facial <b>photoaging</b> (4 cm≤Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) < 7 cm) and 30 healthy women [age: 45. 9 ± 1. 6 years (mean±standard error of the mean) ]. In the second study we enrolled a cohort of 30 women [age: 43. 6 ± 1. 2 years (mean±standard error of the mean) ], affected by moderate (n= 22) and severe (VAS≥ 7 cm; n= 8) facial <b>photoaging,</b> who were randomized to receive a pharmaceutical formulation (VISCODERM® Pearls; IBSA FARMACEUTICI ITALIA Srl, Lodi, Italy) containing Pycnogenol®, collagen, coenzyme Q 10, low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate (n= 15) or placebo (n= 15). Dietary supplement and placebo were administered 2 times a day for 4 weeks. Facial <b>photoaging</b> was assessed by VAS in the first cohort of patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls and, at baseline and 2 weeks after the end of treatment, in the second cohort of patients who underwent treatment with VISCODERM® Pearls and placebo. Skin Tester was used to analyze differences in facial skin parameters between patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls. Skin Tester was also used to assess the effect of VISCODERM® Pearls on facial skin parameters and compared with placebo 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Serum levels of fibronectin, elastin, neutrophil elastase 2, hyaluronic acid and carbonylated proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the first cohort of patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls and, at baseline and 2 weeks after the end of treatment, in the second cohort of patients who underwent treatment with VISCODERM® Pearls and placebo. ResultsVAS <b>photoaging</b> score was higher in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (p< 0. 0001). pH and sebum were increased in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (both p< 0. 0001), while elasticity, hydration and tonicity were decreased in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (all p< 0. 0001). Serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid concentrations were lower in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (both p< 0. 0001). Serum neutrophil elastase 2, elastin and carbonylated protein concentrations were higher in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 0001, respectively). Dietary supplement administration resulted in an improvement in VAS <b>photoaging</b> score, if compared with placebo (p< 0. 0001), as observed 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Facial sebum, hydration and tonicity were increased in the active treatment group vs. placebo (p< 0. 0001, p< 0. 0001 and p< 0. 05, respectively) 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid concentrations were increased in the dietary supplement group, if compared with placebo (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 001) 2 weeks after the end of treatment, while no statistical difference in serum elastin concentration was observed between the two groups. Serum neutrophil elastase 2 and carbonylated protein concentrations were decreased in the dietary supplement group 2 weeks after the end of treatment, if compared with placebo (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 0001). ConclusionsWe found significantly increased serum levels of neutrophil elastase 2, elastin and carbonylated proteins and decreased levels of hyaluronic acid and fibronectin in patients affected by facial <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls. These findings coupled with a significant decrease in skin hydration, tonicity and elasticity and increased skin pH and sebum. Treatment with the dietary supplement VISCODERM® Pearls significantly improved VAS <b>photoaging</b> score and skin hydration, sebum and tonicity 2 weeks after the end of a 4 -week treatment period in patients affected by moderate to severe facial <b>photoaging.</b> These findings coupled with a significant increase in serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid and a decrease in serum carbonylated proteins and neutrophil elastase 2 in the active treatment group, if compared with placebo.

These aldehydes can modify proteins of the extracellular matrix, but {{their role in the}} pathogenesis of <b>photoaging</b> is not clarified. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether these aldehydes contribute to alter elastin metabolism and whether topical carbonyl scavengers delay UV-induced skin <b>photoaging.</b> Hairless mice (4 – 6 -week old) daily exposed to UV-A (20 Jcm- 2 per day, up to 600 Jcm- 2) exhibited the typical features of <b>photoaging,</b> associated with a significant increase in 4 -HNE- and acrolein-adduct content, and elastotic material deposition. Immunofluorescence studies showed the accumulation of 4 -HNE adducts on elastin in the dermis of UV-A-exposed mice. This was mimicked in vitro by incubating orcein-elastin with 4 -HNE or acrolein, which altered its digestion by leukocyte-elastase, a feature possibly involved in the accumulation of elastotic material. A daily topical application of carnosine completely reversed the development of <b>photoaging</b> alterations and 4 -HNE-adduct formation on elastin.

40|$|Background Sun {{exposure}} {{is responsible for}} long-term clinical skin changes such as <b>photoageing,</b> photodamage and photocancers. Ultraviolet (UV) A wavelengths stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may contribute to <b>photoageing.</b> To protect against oxidative stress, skin cells have developed several defence systems, including ROS and metal ion scavengers and a battery of detoxifying, haem-degrading and repair enzymes. Melatonin's antioxidant activity {{is the result of}} three different but complementary actions: (i) a direct action due to its ability to act as a free radical scavenger; (ii) an indirect action that is a consequence of melatonin's ability to reduce free radical generation (radical avoidance); and (iii) its ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes. Objectives In this study, we focused our attention on the prevention of photodamage, choosing melatonin as an antioxidant agent. Methods In the present study we analysed the effects of pretreatment of murine fibroblasts cells (NIH 3 T 3) with melatonin (1 mmol L- 1) followed by UVA irradiation (15 J cm- 2). Thereafter, changes in components of the extracellular matrix and in some antioxidant enzymes (inducible and constitutive haem oxygenase) were evaluated. Results We observed that UVA radiation caused altered expression of extracellular matrix proteins and induced the expression of inducible haem oxygenase. This increase was not sufficient to protect the cells from damage. Instead, melatonin pretreatment led to increased expression of haem-degrading enzymes and suppression of UVA-induced photodamage. Conclusions These results suggest that melatonin, as a modifier of the dermatoendocrine system, may have utility in reducing the effects of skin ageing. What's already known about this topic? Ultraviolet (UV) A radiation is responsible for skin induced-oxidative stress, <b>photoageing,</b> photodamage and photocancers. Melatonin might help to maintain a functional epidermal barrier and protect keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts against the damaging effects of UV radiation. What does this study add? Fibroblast haem oxygenase (HO) - 1 is upregulated after a short interval of UVA irradiation. Melatonin restores the physiological balance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins via the induction of HO- 1 in murine fibroblasts irradiated with UVA...|$|E

Preface: Skin ageing {{is a complex}} biological phenomenon consisting of extrinsic ageing and intrinsic ageing. The process of extrinsic ageing commonly called <b>photoageing,</b> involves changes in cellular biosynthetic activity which leads to gross disorganisation of the dermal matrix whereas intrinsic skin ageing of skin derived cells. Outcome: The paper highlights strategies for treatment of skin ageing which causes reduction in proliferative capacity leading to cellular senescence, and altered biosynthetic activity...|$|E
40|$|Background Skin ageing is {{a complex}} process due to {{intrinsic}} chronological factors (chronoageing) and extrinsic environmental factors. The primary extrinsic factor is cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure, and is therefore termed <b>photoageing.</b> The current standards for measuring cumulative sun damage are biopsy histology and skin microtopography. However, skin biopsies are too invasive for population studies and skin replicas render only superficial skin architecture data. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive imaging tool that allows for in vivo imaging of the skin at quasihistological resolution...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{ultraviolet}} （UV） radiation {{results in}} <b>photoaged</b> skin characterized by deep wrinkle formation. Recent {{studies suggest that}} diminishment of anchoring fi brils（ AF）, stabilizing the association of the basement membrane to the underlying dermis, are involved in <b>photoaged</b> skin. Expression of COL 7 A 1, encoding type VII collagen that is {{a major component of}} AF, is also decreased in <b>photoaged</b> skin. In this study, we have investigated COL 7 A 1 transcription by UV and UV-related cytokines involved in <b>photoaged</b> skin. Nuclear run-on assay, luciferase assay and gel shift assay revealed that UV and UV-related cytokines（ TNF-α, IL- 1 β） tissue specifi cally downregulated COL 7 A 1 transcription in epidermal keratinocytes, whereas COL 7 A 1 transcription was upregulated by each modulator in dermal fi broblasts. The responsive element of each modulator was located between nucleotide - 524 and - 22 of COL 7 A 1 promoter and AP- 1 and NF-κB families band to this region. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the downregulation of COL 7 A 1 transcription in epidermal keratinocytes, main cells expressing COL 7 A 1 in the skin, and subsequent diminishment of AF are involved in <b>photoaged</b> skin. We also have discussed relation between these results and pathophysiology of wrinkle formation, characteristic feature of <b>photoaged</b> skin...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Excessive {{exposure}} to the sun can cause severe <b>photoaging</b> {{as early as the}} second decade of life resulting in a loss of physiological elastic fiber functions. We designed a first study to assess differences in facial skin pH, sebum, elasticity, hydration and tonicity and serum levels of fibronectin, elastin, neutrophil elastase 2, hyaluronic acid and carbonylated proteins between patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls. In a second study we tested the hypothesis that a dietary supplement would improve facial <b>photoaging,</b> also promoting changes in the above mentioned skin and serum parameters. Methods: In the first study we enrolled 30 women [age: 47. 5 ± 1. 6 years (mean ± standard error of the mean) ] affected by moderate facial <b>photoaging</b> (4 cm ≤ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) < 7 cm) and 30 healthy women [age: 45. 9 ± 1. 6 years (mean ± standard error of the mean) ]. In the second study we enrolled a cohort of 30 women [age: 43. 6 ± 1. 2 years (mean ± standard error of the mean) ], affected by moderate (n = 22) and severe (VAS ≥ 7 cm; n = 8) facial <b>photoaging,</b> who were randomized to receive a pharmaceutical formulation (VISCODERM® Pearls; IBSA FARMACEUTICI ITALIA Srl, Lodi, Italy) containing Pycnogenol®, collagen, coenzyme Q 10, low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). Dietary supplement and placebo were administered 2 times a day for 4 weeks. Facial <b>photoaging</b> was assessed by VAS in the first cohort of patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls and, at baseline and 2 weeks after the end of treatment, in the second cohort of patients who underwent treatment with VISCODERM® Pearls and placebo. Skin Tester was used to analyze differences in facial skin parameters between patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls. Skin Tester was also used to assess the effect of VISCODERM® Pearls on facial skin parameters and compared with placebo 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Serum levels of fibronectin, elastin, neutrophil elastase 2, hyaluronic acid and carbonylated proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the first cohort of patients affected by facial <b>photoaging</b> and healthy controls and, at baseline and 2 weeks after the end of treatment, in the second cohort of patients who underwent treatment with VISCODERM® Pearls and placebo. Results: VAS <b>photoaging</b> score was higher in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (p < 0. 0001). pH and sebum were increased in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (both p < 0. 0001), while elasticity, hydration and tonicity were decreased in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (all p < 0. 0001). Serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid concentrations were lower in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (both p < 0. 0001). Serum neutrophil elastase 2, elastin and carbonylated protein concentrations were higher in patients affected by <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 0001, respectively). Dietary supplement administration resulted in an improvement in VAS <b>photoaging</b> score, if compared with placebo (p < 0. 0001), as observed 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Facial sebum, hydration and tonicity were increased in the active treatment group vs. placebo (p < 0. 0001, p < 0. 0001 and p < 0. 05, respectively) 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid concentrations were increased in the dietary supplement group, if compared with placebo (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 001) 2 weeks after the end of treatment, while no statistical difference in serum elastin concentration was observed between the two groups. Serum neutrophil elastase 2 and carbonylated protein concentrations were decreased in the dietary supplement group 2 weeks after the end of treatment, if compared with placebo (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: We found significantly increased serum levels of neutrophil elastase 2, elastin and carbonylated proteins and decreased levels of hyaluronic acid and fibronectin in patients affected by facial <b>photoaging,</b> if compared with healthy controls. These findings coupled with a significant decrease in skin hydration, tonicity and elasticity and increased skin pH and sebum. Treatment with the dietary supplement VISCODERM® Pearls significantly improved VAS <b>photoaging</b> score and skin hydration, sebum and tonicity 2 weeks after the end of a 4 -week treatment period in patients affected by moderate to severe facial <b>photoaging.</b> These findings coupled with a significant increase in serum fibronectin and hyaluronic acid and a decrease in serum carbonylated proteins and neutrophil elastase 2 in the active treatment group, if compared with placebo. Our findings suggest that VISCODERM® Pearls is effective for treatment of facial <b>photoaging</b> but further studies in larger cohorts of patients are required...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{irradiation}} causes {{damage in}} skin by generating excessive {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to skin <b>photoageing.</b> Dandelion extracts have long been used for traditional Chinese medicine and native American medicine to treat cancers, hepatitis, and digestive diseases; however, less is known {{on the effects of}} dandelion extracts in skin <b>photoageing.</b> Here we found that dandelion leaf and flower extracts significantly protect UVB irradiation-inhibited cell viability when added before UVB irradiation or promptly after irradiation. Dandelion leaf and flower extracts inhibited UVB irradiation-stimulated MMP activity and ROS generation. Dandelion root extracts showed less action on protecting HDFs from UVB irradiation-induced MMP activity, ROS generation, and cell death. Furthermore, dandelion leaf and flower but not root extracts stimulated glutathione generation and glutathione reductase mRNA expression in {{the presence or absence of}} UVB irradiation. We also found that dandelion leaf and flower extracts help absorb UVB irradiation. In addition, dandelion extracts significantly protected HDFs from H 2 O 2 -induced cellular senescence. In conclusion, dandelion extracts especially leaf and flower extracts are potent protective agents against UVB damage and H 2 O 2 -induced cellular senescence in HDFs by suppressing ROS generation and MMP activities and helping UVB absorption...|$|E

40|$|International audienceChronic sun {{exposure}} and especially UVA wavelengths {{are responsible for}} long-term clinical skin changes such as <b>photoageing</b> and photocancers. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to analyse the contractile activity of fibroblasts irradiated with several doses of UVA and to evaluate the preventive, protective and restoring effects of a mixture of monomethylsilanetriol mannuronate and dimethylsilanediol salicylate. The forces generated by fibroblasts in tense collagen lattices were quantified using Glasbox device before and after UVA irradiation and the addition of a mixture of monomethylsilanetriol mannuronate and dimethylsilanediol salicylate. The production of collagen was also evaluated before and after irradiation and with and without the presence of a mixture of monomethylsilanetriol mannuronate and dimethylsilanediol salicylate. A dose of 3 J cm(- 2) of UVA showed more than 50 % of mortality in fibroblast population after 48 h and significant decreases in contractile forces developed by irradiated fibroblasts and collagen I production. One percentage of a mixture of monomethylsilanetriol mannuronate and dimethylsilanediol salicylate protected fibroblasts from UVA irradiation and made it possible to restore their capacity to the same level as fibroblasts that were not irradiated. It also tended to restore the capacity to synthesize collagen I. These results show that the use of the new device Glasbox makes it possible to evaluate a possible preventive and repairing effect of a cosmetic functional active on <b>photoageing...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} study {{of the changes in}} major antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant molecules during intrinsic aging and <b>photoaging</b> processes in the epidermis and dermis of human skin in vivo. We show that the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are not changed during these processes in human skin in vivo. Interestingly, the activity of catalase was significantly increased in the epidermis of <b>photoaged</b> (163 %) and naturally aged (118 %) skin (n = 9), but it was significantly lower in the dermis of <b>photoaged</b> (67 % of the young skin level) and naturally aged (55 %) skin compared with young (n = 7) skin. The activity of glutathione reductase was significantly higher (121 %) in naturally aged epidermis. The concentration of α-tocopherol was significantly lower in the epidermis of <b>photoaged</b> (56 % of young skin level) and aged (61 %) skin, but this was not found to be the case in the dermis. Ascorbic acid levels were lower in both epidermis (69 % and 61 %) and dermis (63 % and 70 %) of <b>photoaged</b> and naturally aged skin, respectively. Gluta thione concentrations were also lower. Uric acid did not show any significant changes. Our results suggest that the components of the antioxidant defense system in human skin are probably regulated in a complex manner during the intrinsic aging and <b>photoaging</b> processes...|$|R
