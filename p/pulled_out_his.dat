5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith {{asked him what he}} was doing in the classroom, he <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

On April 2, 2009, while appearing before a legislative panel to promote his renewable energy bill, Gibbons <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> cellphone and began texting. News stories used this incident to revisit the 860 messages he sent to his alleged paramour, and a 37-second video of him introducing himself to the panel, with a 17-second break in order to send the text message and refocus on the hearing was posted on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|The Wei regent Sima Shi summoned Yu Song (虞松) to seek {{his opinion}} {{on how to}} deal with the Wu and Shu incursions in the east and west respectively. Yu Song {{analysed}} the situation and said that the defences at Hefei were strong enough to resist the Wu attack for some time and that the Wu forces would eventually withdraw once they lost momentum. He suggested that they launch a swift counterattack on the Shu invaders to catch them off guard and drive them back. Sima Shi agreed and ordered Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack Jiang Wei and lift the siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the enemy at Luomen (洛門; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu). Jiang Wei eventually <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> troops when they ran out of food supplies.|$|E

25|$|A month later, Forrest {{was back}} in action at the Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862). He {{commanded}} a Confederate rear guard after the Union victory. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the Union skirmish line. Not realizing {{that the rest of}} his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade single-handedly, and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> saber, hacking and slashing. A Union infantryman on the ground beside him fired a musket ball into Forrest's spine with a point-blank musket shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through his pelvis and lodged near his spine. Steadying himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable. Forrest would likely have been given a generous dose of alcohol to muffle the pain of the surgery.|$|E

Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
2500|$|Seward's son, Frederick, {{appeared}} {{at the top of}} the steps in his nightclothes. As Powell reached the second floor, Frederick ordered Powell to stop. Seward's daughter, Fanny, stuck her head out of her father's bedroom door and warned the men that Seward was sleeping. She then returned to the bedroom. Powell said he was delivering medicine, and Frederick asked for the bottle. Powell gave it to him, then <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> revolver and pulled the trigger with the barrel of the gun against Frederick's chest. The revolver misfired, and Powell pistol-whipped Frederick over and over. Bell fled the house screaming [...] "Murder! Murder!" [...] and raced to the office of General Christopher C.

2500|$|In 1926, a {{sighting}} {{is claimed}} to have occurred at an Okanagan Mission beach. This event was supposedly witnessed by about thirty cars of people who all {{claimed to have}} seen the same thing. In 1968, Art Folden filmed what is claimed to be footage of the alleged creature, showing a large wake moving across the water. A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object. [...] Folden noticed [...] "something large and lifelike"; in the distance out on the calm water and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> home movie camera to capture the object. An investigation conducted by Benjamin Radford with Joe Nickell and John Kirk for the National Geographic Channel TV show Is It Real?, in 2005 revealed that the object Folden filmed was indeed a real animal but its size had been greatly overestimated. It was probably a water fowl or beaver {{too far away to}} be identified.|$|E

2500|$|Cicero's {{last words}} {{are said to}} have been, [...] "There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but do try to kill me properly." [...] He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was {{indicating}} that he wouldn't resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch), Antony's wife Fulvia took Cicero's head, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.|$|E
2500|$|A 1934 New Yorker article {{reported}} that at her execution she wore [...] "a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially {{made for the}} occasion, {{and a pair of}} new white gloves" [...] though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, [...] "Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, her head up always, and without the slightest change of expression on her face. For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her." [...] A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> revolver, and shot her in the head to make sure she was dead.|$|E

Hammer {{was arrested}} on February 21, 2013 in Dublin, California for {{allegedly}} obstructing {{an officer in the}} performance of their duties and resisting an officer (according to [...] "stop and identify" [...] statutes). Hammer claims he was a victim of racial profiling by the police, stating an officer <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> gun and randomly asked him: [...] "Are you on parole or probation?" [...] Hammer stated that as he handed over his ID, the officer reached inside the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was 'blasting music' in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. [...] "After asking Hammer who the registered owner was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions," [...] police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to CNN.

Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth.

The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Nick and Sharon {{experienced}} a health scare when Cassie nearly had tuberculosis, {{but ended up}} being okay. The couple became the new owners of the Crimson Lights coffeehouse, their teenage hang-out spot. Having undergone severe cosmetic surgery, Matt Clark (now played by Rick Hearst) returned to Genoa City under the fake identity 'Carter Mills' and began working at the coffeehouse where he schemed with Larry Warton (David [...] "Shark" [...] Fralick) to frame Nick for selling drugs. Matt became a [...] "beloved" [...] employee and Sharon invited {{him over to the}} ranch, where he attempted to drug and date rape her but failed. His plan to have Nick thrown in jail worked, and he lured Sharon to an isolated cabin where he nearly raped her until help showed up and he ran. Matt was driven off a cliff in a car driven by the unstable Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet). A dying Matt told Nick that he raped Sharon, and later <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> own ventilator and framed Nick for his death; Nick was arrested again but eventually freed. Sharon became pregnant and Nick believed it was Matt's child, and wanted her to give it up for adoption. They argued, causing Sharon to fall and give birth to a stillborn baby-girl which was later confirmed through DNA testing to be, in fact, Nick's child. They drifted apart and the marriage began to breakdown. Sharon became hostile towards Nick, resenting him, and she left him. Months later, they came close to a reunion. Sharon mistakenly believed Nick slept with Grace again, so she slept with the Newman handyman, Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Angry, Nick assaulted Diego and had sex with Grace, which he immediately regretted. Sharon and Nick spent the Christmas of 2002 together {{for the sake of the}} kids, but once it was finished, Sharon realized she needed to move on and decided to file for divorce.|$|E
