5|$|A {{total of}} five <b>pioneer</b> battalions {{were raised by}} the AIF during the war, with one being {{assigned}} {{to each of the}} five infantry divisions that the Australians deployed to the battlefield in France and Belgium. The battalions consisted of four companies, under a headquarters company. To identify the 3rd <b>Pioneer</b> Battalion's personnel, they were issued with a purple and white Unit Colour Patch. The colours were in common with other Australian <b>pioneer</b> battalions, while the horizontal oval shape denoted that the unit was part of the 3rd Division.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 <b>Pioneer,</b> an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the <b>Pioneer</b> carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the <b>Pioneer</b> UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a <b>Pioneer</b> UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular <b>Pioneer</b> was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the <b>Pioneer</b> UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{managerial}} {{and organizational}} {{factors associated with}} engaging in a market <b>pioneering</b> strategy. Specifically, top management risk taking and the firm-level capability of market responsiveness are hypothesized {{to be associated with}} market <b>pioneering.</b> Additionally, strategic learning self efficacy is hypothesized to moderate the effects of top management risk taking and market responsiveness on market <b>pioneering.</b> Moderated regression analysis based on data collected from 111 manufacturing firms supports the hypotheses. Top management risk taking and market responsiveness positively predict the use of a <b>pioneering</b> strategy. Strategic learning self efficacy makes market <b>pioneering</b> more palatable to risk-averse top managers who might not otherwise engage in <b>pioneering.</b> Finally, strategic learning self efficacy strengthens the relationship between market responsiveness and market <b>pioneering.</b> Implications for future theory, practice, and research are discussed.

5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked <b>Pioneer</b> 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, <b>Pioneer</b> 3 in December 1958, and <b>Pioneer</b> 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked <b>Pioneer</b> 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles (12.9 million km) away. It also received data from <b>Pioneer</b> 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of 36.2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pioneer</b> Mother Memorial, {{also known}} as <b>Pioneer</b> Mother and <b>Pioneer</b> Mothers, is a 1928 bronze {{sculpture}} by American artist Avard Fairbanks, installed at Esther Short Park in Vancouver, Washington, in the United States.

The main female figure may depict Esther Short, {{one of the first}} U.S. citizens to arrive in Fort Vancouver. Commissioned by Vancouver banker Edward Crawford and his wife Ida for $10,000, {{it is one of the}} city's oldest works of public art, acquired in 1928 and unveiled in 1929. The sculpture was renovated around the start of the 21st century and is maintained by the City of Vancouver's Parks & Recreation department.|$|E

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was <b>Pioneer</b> 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by <b>Pioneer</b> 11 twelve months later. <b>Pioneer</b> 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. <b>Pioneer</b> 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
