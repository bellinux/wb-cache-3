Nowa zbiorowość okazała się być kategorią silnie heterogeniczną i niejednorodną. Mimo upływu ćwierćwiecza od początku przemian zachodzących w strukturze klasa średnia jako pewna zbiorowość nie uległa wyraźniejszej krystalizacji. Niemniej jednak z owej zbiorowości wyodrębniła się specyficzna kategoria, którą można określić jako nową klasę średnią. Jej obraz jest silnie reprezentowany w polskich mediach. Nowa klasa średnia jest szczególnie obecna w telewizyjnych programach o charakterze kulinarnym. Mimo że w sensie socjologicznym nowa klasa średnia nie stanowi klasy społecznej, a jest jedynie traktowana jako kategoria deskryptywna, to umożliwia ona opis przemian przemian społecznych i kulturowych. Poza tym opis reprezentantów nowej klasy średniej będących bohaterami "Kuchennych rewolucji" oraz "Ugotowanych" odtwarzają model konsumpcji wyrażający się w stylu życia, spędzaniu wolnego czasu, indywidualnych dążeniach, wykonywanych profesjach, zainteresowaniach, wyborach estetycznych i tych dotyczących kultury materialnej. Kultura kulinarna jest przestrzenią, która okazuje się być miejscem umożliwiającym ukazanie wszystkich charakterystycznych właściwości i wartości istotnych dla nowej klasy średniej. Programy kulinarne nie traktują zatem o samym gotowaniu. One mają rozbudzać ambicje o przynależności do tej klasy społecznej. Programy kulinarne promują przekaz, że właściwie każdy z telewidzów przy odrobinie wysiłku jest w stanie wieść atrakcyjne życie i przynależeć do owej uprzywilejowanej części polskiego społeczeństwa. Dziedzictwo kulinarne i przemiany kulinarne, podobnie jak struktura społeczna ulegają przekształceniom. Kultura kulinarna jest ściśle powiązana z życiem społecznym i kulturowym a kulinaria okazują się stanowić jeden z czynników mających właściwości strukturyzujące. In the {{aftermath}} of 1989 Polish society faced many changes. The first changes {{were associated with the}} processes of implementing ready products and objects of the western economy and culture. The implants presented new forms and organizations of social life. The implants provided designs, new styles of life, Western movies, popular television series, fast food restaurants, supermarkets, malls, Western corporations, and even new occupations and professions. I would like to examine the result of all these changes in Polish society. How did all of them change individual and collective life of people? How did the city change {{under the influence of the}} culinary culture and TV cooking programs? I am also interested in how nowadays the culinary culture is used to promote the values of the consumerist society like competition, rivalry, pleasure and entertainment. I would like to present the examples of popular TV series "Cooked" and "The Kitchen Revolutions". Both of them play very important role in changing Polish attitude to the cuisine and its meaning in social life. The program "Cooked" present in each part young representatives of new middle class from the big and global cities who are the beneficiaries of the Polish transformation in 1989. They are presented in their apartments and houses which are very similar because of the middle class homogeneous taste. They are usually professional in new professions like fitness trainer or stylist. The preparation of their cuisine is the excuse to present themselves. They are proud of their social and cultural position and status. The cuisine culture is the aim to create their identity in the global world. They seem to be like "social clones" who try to express themselves by the very popular cuisine culture. The cuisine culture is treated by them in very instrumental way to present their social status and the proof of being a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>community.</b> The second example of TV series is called "The Kitchen Revolutions". The main character is the Polish famous cook who visits different restaurants in Poland helping the owners to change not only material aspects of them, but also general attitude to the cuisine culture. She visits people who aspire to the middle class. The process of change the material and aesthetics vision of restaurants creates also opportunities to compare global imagination about the cuisine culture with the local tradition of nutrition. Both popular TV programs create the possibilities to discuss and negotiate the cultural and social meanings of what is global and local status of identities, lifestyles or mentality. It is chance to define the attitude to inequality and differences between the global cities and other parts of country. The aim of this presentation is to find main factors which define what is global and local and to concentrate on the process of negotiation between them. The cuisine culture and its popularity can be treated as the instrument to understand the process of changing rules of lifestyles and construction of new middle-class in the new democracies. I would like to present the examples of popular TV series "Cooked" and "The Kitchen Revolutions". Both of them play very important role in changing Polish attitude to the cuisine and its meaning in social life. They present the image of the new middle class which can be observed in the culinary culture – the culinary television programs...|$|E

Many Bollywood films present a cine-geography based on foreign landscapes (and cityscapes) that offer a visual distraction from the realities of urban and rural poverty in India. A recent Times of India article suggested that the weakening of the rupee caused a return to productions based solely in India, but this chapter suggests that financial considerations are only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the story. The return to the homeland location is indicative of a new pride in the Indian nation where filmmakers are now keen to promote the nation's urban gentrification and recognition of the natural environment as a tourist drawcard.

Bangladesh‟s {{need to be}} a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the <b>global</b> <b>community</b> has {{manifested itself}} in the government‟s implementing compulsory English learning at various levels of education. However, writing samples of tertiary level Bangladeshi students show that even after twelve years of English learning, students‟ proficiency of English is far below the required standards to study abroad or in English medium universities in the country. Local experts believe that the main reason for the students‟ low proficiency lies in the wrong method of teaching English at the primary level. The fact is, although theoretically, children learn a language quicker than adults, wrong methods of teaching can bring in an opposite result. In Bangladesh, students are not getting benefited from compulsory primary English education as the effects of wrong learning at this level are preventing their English language development even at the later stages. Therefore, it is high time to change the existing methodology for teaching English at the primary level. This paper focuses on the problems in the existing method of teaching English at the primary level, shows some effective ways of teaching English at this level and finally suggests some policy level changes to make English education really fruitful in Bangladesh.
