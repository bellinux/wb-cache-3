25|$|Indications for bracing: <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> growing who {{present with}} Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} {{to the risk of}} progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table. For example, a person who is still growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|E

He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> currently trying to tread their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E

6000|$|Now it is {{all very}} well for you at the {{beginning}} of the XX century to ask me for a Don Juan play; but you will see from the foregoing survey that Don Juan is a full century out of date for you and for me; and if there are millions of less literate <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in the eighteenth century, have they not Moliere and Mozart, upon whose art no human hand can improve? You would laugh at me if at this time of day I dealt in duels and ghosts and [...] "womanly" [...] women. As to mere libertinism, you would be the first to remind me that the Festin de Pierre of Moliere is not a play for amorists, and that one bar of the voluptuous sentimentality of Gounod or Bizet would appear as a licentious stain on the score of Don Giovanni. Even the more abstract parts of the Don Juan play are dilapidated past use: for instance, Don Juan's supernatural antagonist hurled those who refuse to repent into lakes of burning brimstone, there to be tormented by devils with horns and tails. Of that antagonist, and of that conception of repentance, how much is left that could be used in a play by me dedicated to you? On the other hand, those forces of middle class public opinion which hardly existed for a Spanish nobleman in the days of the first Don Juan, are now triumphant everywhere. Civilized society is one huge bourgeoisie: no nobleman dares now shock his greengrocer. The women, [...] "marchesane, principesse, cameriere, cittadine" [...] and all, are become equally dangerous: the sex is aggressive, powerful: when women are wronged they do not group themselves pathetically to sing [...] "Protegga il giusto cielo": they grasp formidable legal and social weapons, and retaliate. Political parties are wrecked and public careers undone by a single indiscretion. A man had better have all the statues in London to supper with him, ugly as they are, than be brought to the bar of the Nonconformist Conscience by Donna Elvira. Excommunication has become almost as serious a business as it was in the X century.|$|E
