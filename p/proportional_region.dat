40|$|Abstract–A {{new type}} of highly-pixelated, photon {{counting}} radiation detector is described based on the integration of a photocathode into a plasma panel sensor (PPS). This device called a plasma panel photosensor (or PPPS) should be low cost as it can directly leverage off of the fabrication and materials technologies employed in plasma display panels (PDP’s) and photomultiplier tubes (PMT’s). When optically coupled to a scintillator, the device becomes a PPPS-scintillation detector. The PPS, PPPS and PPPS-scintillation detector all hold promise for high sensitivity with gains {{on the order of}} 1011, high positional and pixel resolutions approaching 10 µm, and fast picosecond to nanosecond response times. Although the PPPS in some ways resembles a flat-PMT or a micropattern detector, it is not an analog device as it does not operate in the <b>proportional</b> <b>region</b> and in this sense resembles an avalanche photodiode. The PPS and PPPS, as plasma panel devices operating in the Geiger region, are digital detectors with the potential to expand beyond the capability of micropattern detector technology for a host of applications covering ionizing particles and photons, as well as non-ionizing photons. Key applications include medical imaging, homeland security and nuclear physics. Because of its thin form-factor (~ 1 mm) and highly-pixelated structure, the PPPS-scintillation detector should be capable of both good spectral and high directional/angular resolution. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{capabilities}} {{of a new}} microstructure, anode point based, {{for the detection of}} gas ion-izing radiations are presented. For every single detected ionizing radiation it gives a pair of ‘induced’ charges (anodic and cathodic) of the same amount (pulses of the same amplitudes), of opposite sign, with the same collection time and essentially in time coincidence, that are proportional to the pri-mary ionization collected. Each pulse of a pair gives the same energy and timing information, thus one can be used for these information and the other for the position. The complete lack of insulat-ing materials in the active volume of this microstructure avoids problems of charging-up and makes stable and repeatable its behavior. It is possible to observe primary avalanches with a size of more than 2 : 5 107 electrons (4 pC), which give current pulses with a peak of more than 0. 26 mA on 100 Ohm and about 30 ns duration, with 5. 9 KeV X-rays of 55 Fe working in <b>proportional</b> <b>region</b> in 760 Torr of isobutane gas.

40|$|Gas gain {{measurements}} {{were made for}} nitrogen, xenon and x non with 2, 3 dimethyl- 2 -butene (DMB) as an additive. Two different methods of measuring gas gain were examined, pulse matching methods and current comparison methods. A preliminary investigation {{was made into a}} new approach to the pulse matching method. Previous authors had shaped their test pulses to the same shape as their detector pulses or used a calibration factor to correct for the difference between the shape of the test pulses and the detector pulses. These approaches would be valid only if the detector pulses were always the same shape. The pulses from the detector vary in shape depending upon where the primary ion pairs are formed in the detector sensitive volume. The new approach' I have investigated shapes the detector pulses and the test pulses to the same shape so that the variation in the detector pulse shape becomes irrelevant. This method of measuring gas gain was tested using P- 10 and 148 Gd as an alpha particle source and gave similar results to gas gains determined by current comparisons. The measurements of gas gain finally used to obtain the data were all performed using the current comparison technique. When the electrons were collected at the central wire and 55 Fe was used as the radiation source the ion saturation curves for xenon showed no definite plateaus, only points of inflexion. I found that ion saturation currents could be determined by fitting the observed currents and associated operating voltages to an expression proposed by Johnson. This expression also enabled me to determine the voltage region where gas gain began. The gas gain characteristics of nitrogen and xenon were measured for a range of gas densities. From these measurements it was shown that the gas gain of a cylindrical proportional counter operating in the <b>proportional</b> <b>region</b> is a function only of the reduced field strength at the surface of the anode. Aoyama has proposed an expression for the first Townsend coefficient and {{he has been able to}} show that previously proposed expressions are only special cases of his expression. I was able to obtain an excellent fit to Aoyama's expression using my gas gain data for xenon and a value for one of the parameters determined by Kowalski. It is widely held that the mechanism of gas gain in proportional counters is primarily by electron impact. Ionization may also occur in binary mixtures by the non-metastable Penning effect, and the metastable Penning effect. A binary mixture of xenon and DMB was used to investigate these effects. It was found that the gas gain in xenon could be greatly increased by the addition of a small quantity of DMB. A broad peak in gas gain appeared when the concentration of additive was between 0. 4...|$|E

40|$|This work {{is divided}} into three parts. Part A, {{discusses}} some of the focusing properties of magnetic fields used for the deflection and analysia of ion beams; part B describes the design and construction of magnets employing these theoretical principles; and Part C is an account of some experimental work done using focussed beams of deuterons. The work was all alone at the Clarendon Laboratory, between Michaelmas Term 1948 and Michaelmas Term 1953, and the three parts form a roughly chronological sequence. Part A: The Focusing Properties of Magnetic Analysers. The 1 M. V. and 500 KV. acaelerators of the Clarendon Laboratory provide relatively high current beams of positive ions which are very homogeneous in energy. For separating the ions of different masses a magnetic analyser is clearly necessary, since it can be shown that the alternative, an electrostatic analyser, gives energy dispersion only. The simple magnetic analyser which was customarily used until recently, being a sector shaped uniform field, has strong focussing properties in the plane containing the beam and perpendicular to the field lines (the "perpendicular" plane), but none in a plane containing the emergent beam and parallel to the field lines (the "parallel" plane). This focussing becomes stronger as the sector angle Φ is increased, until at 90 Â°, which is frequently a convenient angle, an incident collimated beam of circular cross-section converges to a line focus at the exit boundary. This is a great inconvenience in mnny cases where care has been taken with the accelerator to provide an intense ion beam for nuclear bombardment studies. The properties of such uniform sector fields are discussed briefly, since they serve to demonstrate the formal analogy between ion trajectories in magnetic fields (ion optics) and light optics. The power of the lens in the two planes can be changed by using a field which in non-uniform, varying with radial distance as H α r -n. Such a field focusses in both planess but it is shown that coincident foci can only be obtained at image distances too close to the magnet for practical convenience in many cases. The inherent non-uniformity of the "fringe" field at the pole boundaries can be used to change the power of the lens in both planes if the boundaries make an angle with the beam at entrance or exits. Expressions are derived for the image distances in both planes and the conditions for equality are then discussed. The equation has a variety of possible solutions which are to some extent limited by practical considerations. In particular, the magnification of the systme will in general increase with the increase of image distance and this proves to be the principal limiting factor, since the object for the ion-optical system has a finite size (initially the ion source canal). The theoretical results for a 90 ° analyser are compared with experiment and reasonable agreement is found. However it is found that there is a great loss of intensity in the analysed beam. the whole question of abberations is discussed and it is found that the loss of intensity is likely to be due to spherical abberation in the electron lens system, a circumstance that can probably not be improved in the existing type of accelerator column, and which makes 90 ° analyser of the type discussed of no great advantage over the uniform-sectpr field for many purposes. For an accelerator with large spherical aberration the only way out of this difficulty is to sacrifice the large dispersion and mechanical convenience of 90 ° deflection and use deflection through small angles. this is seperately considered as a special case of a field with oblique non-uniform boundaries, and the optical properties of such a magnet as is used in Part C are discussed. Part B: The Design of Magnets for Ion Analysers. The general considerations which guide the design of an analysing electromagnetic are presented, and details are given of the construction of a magnet and pole-pieces designed to give 90 ° deflection of l M. V. deutrons in either of the two opposite directions. The pole-pieces have faces which give the beam a 19 cm. radius path in the field, and freedom to choose the boundary angle (in accordance with the principles of Part A) is provided by the adjustable segments at the pole tips. The limitations on operation imposed by heating of the windings, non-uniformity of the field due to magnetic saturation and the proximity of the coils, and the effect of the hysteresis on field stabilisation are mentioned The vacuum box the carries the beam between the magnet poles is made of brass wave guide with a rigid supporting structure of Yorkshire tubing which also serves as a high speed pumping by-pass. The field is stabalised by referring the voltage developed by the magnet current across a resistance to that of a standard cell. The unbalance current is amplified by means of a galvanometer, modulated light beam, photocell and AC amplifier, and corrects the magnet current by a moter driven variac in the power supply before rectification. It is shown that a satisfactory magnet design can be based on triangular cores and windings. The dimensions of a magnet to deflect 1. 4 M. V. tritons through 90 ° in either of the two opposite directions are given, and also details of the tests, on a &frac 14; scale model, to find the temperature rise in the windings and the expected uniformity of the field in the full-size magnet. The field at various points in space near a triangular winding has been worked out. Part C: A Further Study of the D- D Reactors The angular distribution of the products of the two reactions: (a) D + D → He 3 + n (b) D + D → H 3 + p has been investigated in the energy range 150 KV. to 450 KV. (deuteron bombarding energy). Although other workers have made measurements of (a) in this region, the technique used was different, and the present work partly bridges the gap between the work of Eliot (0 to 50 KV.) and that of Blair (1 to 315 MV.), both of whom used similar methods. The apparatus consisted of a cylindrical target chamber filled with deuterium at a pressure of about 0. 1 mm. Hg., and attached {{to the end of the}} accelerator column of a 500 KV Phillips generator. the beam was carefully collimated by a canal system, and the charged reaction products from a small volume at the centre of the target box were counted by ion counters operated in the <b>proportional</b> <b>region.</b> Two counters were arranged to swivel about an axis through the centre of the reaction volume, and a third, which was used to monitor conditions, was fixed to the lid of the box. The counter windows were of very thin (about 0. 5 μ) quartz. The counter gas was heptane vapour at a pressure (about 1 cm.) determined by a fixed temperature bath. Counts were made of the number of He 3 and H,sup> 3 particles penetrating the counter window at various angles. These particles were distinguished by a careful choice of bias applied to a phase height disoriminato, and by the use of absorbing mica screens in front of the window. The principle is that the three charged particles from the reaction, as well as scattered deuterons, give in general different amounts of ionization in the counter materials and absorbers, because of their difference of energy and charge. the results to be expected are discussed in detail. The results are conveniently expressed in terms of the 'asymmetry' coefficients A and B in the expression for the angular distribution of the yields: Y α 1 + Acos 4 Ρ + Bcos 4 Ρ There is a significant difference in the values of A and B for reactions (a) and (b), which is in agreement with the results of other workers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} assumptions about human brain evolution is that it involved relative enlargement of the frontal lobes. We show that this assumption is without foundation.

Recent claims for relative enlargement of human frontal white matter volume, and for relative enlargement shared by all great apes, seem to be mistaken. Furthermore, using a recently developed method for detecting shifts in evolutionary rates, we find that the rate of change in relative frontal cortex volume along the phylogenetic branch leading to humans was unremarkable and that other branches showed significantly faster rates of change. Although absolute and <b>proportional</b> frontal <b>region</b> size increased rapidly in humans, this change was tightly correlated with corresponding size increases in other areas andwhole brain size, and with decreases in frontal neuron densities.

The epitaxial graphene films grown on vicinal SiC comprise two distinct regions of terrace and step; and typically exhibit anisotropic electron transport behavior, although limited {{areas in the}} graphene film showed ballistic transport. To evaluate the role of terraces and steps in electron transport properties, we compared graphene samples with terrace and step regions grown on 4 H-SiC(0001). Arrays of field effect transistors were fabricated on comparable graphene samples with their channels parallel or perpendicular to the nanofacets to identify the source of measured reduced mobility. Minimum conductivity and electron mobility increased with the larger <b>proportional</b> terrace <b>region</b> area; therefore, the terrace region has superior transport properties to step regions. The measured electron mobility in the terrace region, ∼ 1000 cm 2 /Vs, is 10 times larger than that in the step region, ∼ 100 cm 2 /Vs.

40|$|The {{saturation}} {{of the two}} Weinberg sum {{rules is}} studied at finite temperature, using recent independent QCD sum rule results for the thermal behaviour of hadronic parameters in the vector and axial-vector channels. Both sum rules are very well satisfied from T= 0 up to T/T_c ≃ 0. 7 - 0. 8. At higher temperatures close to T_c a hadronic, pion-loop contribution in the space-like <b>region</b> <b>proportional</b> to T^ 2, present at leading order in the vector {{but not in the}} axial-vector channel, induces an asymmetry leading to a small deviation. In this region, though, QCD sum rules for the hadronic parameters begin to have no solutions, as the hadronic widths of the ρ and the a_ 1 mesons diverge signalling deconfinement. Close to, and at T=T_c there are no pions left in the medium and chiral symmetry is restored, so that the sum rules are trivially satisfied. Comment: A few clarifying remarks and additional references have been added. No change to results or conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Statistical data {{associated}} with geographic regions is nowadays globally available in large amounts and hence automated methods to visually display {{these data are}} in high demand. There are several well-established thematic map types for quantitative data on the ratio-scale {{associated with}} regions: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps. However, all these maps suffer from limitations, especially if large data values are associated with small regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel type of quantitative thematic map, the necklace map. In a necklace map, the regions of the underlying two-dimensional map are projected onto intervals on a one-dimensional curve (the necklace) that surrounds the map regions. Symbols are scaled such that their area corresponds to the data of their region and placed without overlap inside the corresponding interval on the necklace. Necklace maps appear clear and uncluttered and allow for comparatively large symbol sizes. They visualize data sets well which are not <b>proportional</b> to <b>region</b> sizes. The linear ordering of the symbols along the necklace facilitates an easy comparison of symbol sizes. One map can contain several nested or disjoint necklaces to visualize clustered data. The advantages of necklace maps come at a price: the association between a symbol and its region is weaker than {{with other types of}} maps. Interactivity can help to strengthen this association if necessary. We present an automated approach to generate necklace maps which allows the user to interactively control the final symbol placement. We validate our approach with experiments using various data sets and maps...|$|R
40|$|If two {{disjoint}} country service networks {{involving a}} small and large country are connected as part of inter-national liberalization {{in the presence of}} network externalities, the per capita gain for the small country from access to a large network will be large, and the per capita gain for the large country will be small. In contrast to goods, the benefits of liberalization in network-related services {{are more likely to be}} approxi-mately equally divided between large and small countries than is true of trade in goods, where benefits accrue disproportionately to the small country. We also argue that non-cooperation in network-related ser-vices trade may involve more extreme retaliation than suggested for trade in goods by the optimal tariff literature, so that relative to a non-cooperative outcome, gains from liberalization in network-related services become larger than from liberalization in goods. We develop simple models which we use for numerical examples showing these points, along with an empirical implementation for global telecoms liberalization for the US, Europe, Canada, and the rest of the world using the framework developed in the paper. This shows similar <b>proportional</b> gains to <b>regions,</b> consistent with the theme of the paper that goods and services liberalization differ. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform the}} first self-consistent {{measurement}} of the rate of interactions between stellar tidal streams created by disrupting satellites and dark subhalos in a cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-mass galaxy. Using a retagged version of the Aquarius A dark-matter-only simulation, we selected 18 streams of tagged star particles that appear thin at the present day and followed them from the point their progenitors accrete onto the main halo, recording in each snapshot the characteristics of all dark-matter subhalos passing within several distance thresholds of any tagged star particle in each stream. We considered distance thresholds corresponding to constant impact parameters (1, 2, and 5 kpc), {{as well as those}} <b>proportional</b> to the <b>region</b> of influence of each subhalo (one and two times its half-mass radius r_ 1 / 2). We then measured the age and present-day, phase-unwrapped length of each stream in order to compute the interaction rate in different mass bins and for different thresholds, and compared these to analytic predictions from the literature. We measure a median rate of 1. 5 ^+ 3. 0 _- 1. 1 (9. 1 ^+ 17. 5 _- 7. 1, 61. 8 ^+ 211 _- 40. 6) interactions within 1 (2, 5) kpc of the stream per 10 kpc of stream length per 10 Gyr. Resolution effects (both time and particle number) affect these estimated rates by lowering them. Comment: A&A sub...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{structural}} aspects of goat and ovine livestock farming systems located in the Norwest of Dominican Republic. The sample (94 farms) was randomly selected with <b>proportional</b> allocation by <b>region.</b> Forty-four variables related to structural and productive aspects were analyzed. The average size of farms was 96 ha and 165 animals. Their facilities are simple, nonspecific and barely functional, with a mean of 2 pens per farm. Farms generally do not have perimeter fences, facilities for breeding, feeding or watering points. The reproductive strategy is the natural breeding throughout the year on most farms, with a ratio of one sire for every 36 females, and there are no breeding records. The first mating takes place with an average weight of 17 kg at 6. 5 months of age. Feeding is based on grazing of natural pastures and forests (94 %), reaching a stocking density of 0. 83 LU/ha. Food supplementation is used in 37 % of farms, mainly in sheep and mixed farms. The lambs and goats are sold when they reach 23 kg in weight, around 7 months of age. The farms do not receive technical advice, although 94 % of them apply preventive treatments on a regular basis. The mortality rate reached 12 %. In general, farms are very heterogeneous in their production structure, management, nutrition and health. Thus, a group of farms developed a traditional system (goats), while the most efficient and technified correspond to sheep and mixed farms...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{capacity}} at constant pressure of fullerite C 60 {{has been investigated}} using an adiabatic calorimeter in a temperature range from 1. 2 to 120 K. Our results and literature data have been analyzed in a temperature interval from 0. 2 to 300 K. The contributions of the intramolecular and lattice vibrations into the {{heat capacity}} of C 60 have been separated. The contribution of the intramolecular vibration becomes significant above 50 K. Below 2. 3 K the experimental temperature dependence of the heat capacity of C 60 is described by the linear and cubic terms. The limiting Debye temperature at T → 0 K has been estimated (Θ 0 = 84. 4 K). In the interval from 1. 2 to 30 K the experimental curve of the heat capacity of C 60 describes the contributions of rotational tunnel levels, translational vibrations (in the Debye model with Θ 0 = 84. 4 K), and librations (in the Einstein model with ΘE,lib= 32. 5 K). It is shown that the experimental temperature dependences of heat capacity and thermal expansion are <b>proportional</b> in the <b>region</b> from 5 to 60 K. The contribution of the cooperative processes of orientational disordering becomes appreciable above 180 K. In the high-temperature phase the lattice heat capacity at constant volume is close to 4. 5 R, which corresponds to the high-temperature limit of translational vibrations (3 R) and the near-free rotational motion of C 60 molecules (1. 5 R).

3000|$|As mentioned, {{the tick}} unit is an {{arbitrary}} Netlogo time unit; however, I {{associate it with}} a rough measure in our time units as follows. For the first two cycles, I equate a time period of ≈ 22 years with 146 tick s (from 12 to 158). Hence, I associate a tick interval as approximately 55 days, or ≈two Carrington solar rotations (low latitude rotations as seen from Earth). Equivalently, this is ≈ 6.6 tick s per terrestrial year. The compression is not an “exact” time unit, for as we shall see, the modeled cycles have varying periodicities (owing to non-linear effects), just as our Sun does, depending upon cycle amplitude. The amplitude - timescale variation is inherent in Babcock’s, Spoerer’s, and Waldmeier’s work. For example, Babcock said it took ≈three years for the field to wind up sufficiently to yield the cycle’s early sunspots, with a latitude variation given by: sin λ = ± 1.5 /(n + 3) where λ is the latitude and n {{is the number of}} rotations for the solar cycle to reach sufficient amplitude for the magnetic fields to “erupt.” This essentially illustrates the Waldmeier effect wherein larger cycles peak sooner. I have used the term percolation rather than eruption, but, for this model, they are equivalent – some process below active-regions that allows magnetic field to be amplified into sunspots which appear in the photosphere[*]–[*]the existence of magnetic field on the Sun’s surface and its motions and disappearance are all this article cares about. How or why magnetic field appears on the Sun’s disk is not a question this model considers. The entire physics of field generation within the Sun is subsumed by simply generating bipolar magnetic <b>regions</b> <b>proportional</b> the previous minimum's dipole moment. Thus if we simply define a process, called [...] "interior field mechanism" [...] and that this mechanism does two things: 1) it creates random bipoles in the photosphere proportional to the solar dipole moment at the last solar minimum, and 2) it attracts magnetic entities towards opposite signed polar regions, then this seems sufficient to simulate solar cycles, in accordance with this model.|$|R
