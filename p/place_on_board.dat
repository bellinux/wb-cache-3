25|$|Prince Andrew's <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the {{possibility}} of the Queen's son being killed in action made the British Government apprehensive, and the Cabinet desired that Prince Andrew be moved to a desk job {{for the duration of the}} conflict. The Queen, though, insisted that her son be allowed to remain with his ship. Prince Andrew remained on board Invincible to serve as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, flying on missions that included anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare, Exocet missile decoy, casualty evacuation, transport, and search and air rescue. He witnessed the Argentinian attack on the SS Atlantic Conveyor.|$|E
25|$|Naval {{training}} {{at this time}} took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ship, and having obtained a nomination and passing the modest exams, he was posted to HMS Wellesley in spring 1848. Wellesley (Captain George Goldsmith under Admiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a two-decker sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was {{how to handle a}} sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster at the rate of Â£5 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. Wellesley sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, much alike with others on board, never became ill or died.|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{goes into}} hiding, Scully is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Reyes becomes Doggett's new FBI {{partner at the}} X-Files office. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes {{discover}} a conspiracy to place Chloramine in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating [...] "Super Soldiers". This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> with connections to Scully's child, William. The X-Files office's investigation is hampered by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) and Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes). Hopeful about reuniting with Mulder, a complete stranger, [...] "Shadow Man" [...] (Terry O'Quinn), offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but near gets herself and Mulder killed when it is revealed {{the man is a}} Super Soldier. Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has found a spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa two years ago. The cult kidnaps William, but is destroyed when the baby's crying activates the ship, killing everyone in the cult, sans William.|$|E

500|$|After {{the eighth}} season finale [...] "Existence", Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) goes into hiding. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) becomes John Doggett's [...] (Robert Patrick) new FBI {{partner in the}} X-Files office. Doggett asks Scully for help on a case {{involving}} an EPA official, Carl Wormus (Nicholas Walker), who died after his car was forced off a bridge by a woman he picked up. Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) travel to a reclamation plant, looking for links between Wormus' work and death. After doing an illegal autopsy on Wormus, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) sends Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) to locate Doggett. The investigation at the reclamation plant leads to an unknown woman, whose identity is later revealed to be Shannon McMahon (Lucy Lawless), one of Doggett's former Marine associates. She reveals to Doggett {{that she is a}} [...] "Super Soldier". This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> on a naval ship. They later find connections between the experiments on the ship and Scully's child, William.|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2007, in Beaumont, Texas, Richardson's {{body was}} exhumed for reburial {{in a more}} fitting part of the local Forest Lawn cemetery. The musician's son, Jay Perry, took the {{opportunity}} to have his father's body re-examined to verify the original findings, and asked forensic anthropologist William Bass to carry out the procedure. [...] Among the rumors surrounding the accident that this second examination sought to verify was that an accidental firearm discharge took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the aircraft and caused the crash, since two months after the event, a farmer had found at the crash site a [...]22 (5.6mm) pistol known to have belonged to Buddy Holly. Another rumor had Richardson surviving the initial impact and crawling out of the aircraft in search for help, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the wreckage than the other three. [...] Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, nonsurvivable fractures to almost all of his bones; no traces of lead were found from any bullet. Coroner Smiley's original report was, therefore, confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Ellen Austin {{supposedly}} {{came across}} a derelict ship, <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a prize crew, and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of Meta, built in 1854, and that in 1880, Meta was renamed Ellen Austin. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest {{a large number of}} missing men were <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a derelict that later disappeared.|$|R
2500|$|Ship of Fools (1965) {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "floating Grand Hotel," [...] an earlier film which also had an all-star cast. Its story is about personal relationships among passengers, rather than any clear plot. It takes <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a passenger liner returning to Germany in 1933, during the rise of Nazism. Spoto describes its theme as one of [...] "conscious social and psychological significance." [...] It won two Academy Awards and was nominated for six others.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} of Falcon, his officers and {{men for the}} loss of Cyane took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Akbar at Halifax on 28 June 1815.

The court also praised the crew who, with the exception of three men, resisted the American attempts to [...] "wean them from their allegiance, under circumstances of unprecedented severity exercised towards them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, a {{group of}} Polish MPs, mostly from the Law and Justice party, formed the [...] "Parliamentary Committee for the {{investigation}} of the Tu-154M crash in Smolensk", chaired by the party's deputy leader Antoni Macierewicz. Later in November, Macierewicz called for the United States to lead an independent international commission on the accident. Some US Republican congressmen supported this idea but the U.S. has never acted upon it. In March 2015 the Polish committee published a report in which it claimed that two separate explosions took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Tupolev in the last few seconds of its flight, bringing the aircraft down; a third explosion allegedly occurred after the impact with the ground.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1890s, about 45 {{percent of}} Taiwan was under {{standard}} Chinese administration while the remaining lightly populated {{regions of the}} interior were under aboriginal control. The First Sino-Japanese War broke out between Qing dynasty China and Japan in 1894 following a dispute over the sovereignty of Korea. Following its defeat, China ceded the islands of Taiwan and Penghu to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895. According {{to the terms of}} the treaty, Taiwan and Penghu (isles between 119ËE-120ËE and 23ËN-24ËN) were to be ceded to Japan in perpetuity. Both governments were to send representatives to Taiwan immediately after signing to begin the transition process, which was to be completed in no more than two months. Because Taiwan was ceded by treaty, the period that followed is referred to by some as the [...] "colonial period", while others who focus on {{the fact that it was}} the culmination of a war refer to it as the [...] "occupation period". [...] The cession ceremony took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a Japanese vessel because the Chinese delegate feared reprisal from the residents of Taiwan.|$|E
2500|$|Hong Kong {{became the}} point of departure. The ship was {{scheduled}} to leave in March, but Singh was arrested for selling tickets for an illegal voyage. After several months he was released on bail and given permission by Francis Henry May, the Governor of Hong Kong, to set sail. The ship departed on April 4 with 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai on April 8, and the ship arrived at Yokohama on April 14. It left Yokohama on May 3 with its complement of 376 passengers and sailed into Burrard Inlet, near Vancouver, on May 23. The Indian Nationalist revolutionaries Barkatullah and Bhagwaan Singh Giani [...] met with the ship en route. Bhagwaan Singh Giani was head priest of the Gurdwara in Vancouver and {{had been one of}} three delegates sent to London and India to represent the case of Indians in Canada. Ghadarite literature was disseminated on board and political meetings took <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> A passenger told a British officer: [...] "This ship belongs to the whole of India, this is a symbol of the honour of India and if this was detained, there would be mutiny in the armies".|$|E
