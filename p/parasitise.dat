5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can <b>parasitise</b> the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis have been recovered from the smooth muscles of adult American white ibis, and another species, Haemoproteus plataleae, has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, Phalacrodectes whartoni and Neoattialges eudocimae, have been recovered from under the skin. Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, Plegadiphilus eudocimus and Ardeicola robusta, also <b>parasitise</b> the bird.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by smell and vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, <b>parasitise</b> horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|E
30|$|Solo females <b>parasitised</b> 92 out of 134 eggs (69  %) {{in total}} (4.7 [*]±[*] 0.4 eggs <b>parasitised</b> per female). Solo females spent 11.3 [*]±[*] 0.6  min per egg {{on the four}} parasitism-related behaviours: drum, probe, hostfeed and oviposit. The time {{required}} to complete parasitism of one egg varied between females with some spending extended periods on a single egg and others <b>parasitising</b> multiple eggs in rapid succession (range[*]=[*] 26.8  min per egg). Every individual <b>parasitised</b> at least one egg in the batch, and six females <b>parasitised</b> the entire egg batch in less than 30  min. Four solo females self-superparasitised only five eggs.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{parasitism}} of braconid wasp, Apanteles obliquae Wilkinson (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on the developmental stages and food consumption of larva of Spilosoma obliqua (Walker) were {{studied in the}} laboratory. The differences in growth and development of host larvae were marked with regard to ecdysis (moult) and size in <b>parasitised</b> larvae. The reduction in host size due to parasitism was observed in <b>parasitised</b> larvae. S. obliqua larvae that were <b>parasitised</b> consumed significantly less leaf area than the non-parasitised larvae. The greater portion (96. 95 sq. cm. of jute leaf) of feeding by non-parasitised larva occurred after the host larva reached the 5 th instar stage, whereas feeding by <b>parasitised</b> larva of same age remained at low level (32. 54 sq. cm. of jute leaf). Results indicated that larva <b>parasitised</b> at 3 rd instar stage cause considerably less damage (one third of healthy larva) to the host plant than non- <b>parasitised</b> larva...|$|R
50|$|The {{eggs are}} <b>parasitised</b> by species of Chalcidoidea and the larvae are <b>parasitised</b> by Braconidae. Ants, lizards and birds eat the larvae and pupae and in monsoon the larvae suffer 30% mortality.|$|R
5|$|The {{young of}} a clutch hatch over {{two or three}} days and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes <b>parasitise</b> nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may <b>parasitise</b> C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} <b>parasitise</b> common {{starlings}} include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the length-weight {{relationship}} and the condition factor of Astyanax intermedius <b>parasitised</b> {{and not by}} Paracymothoa astyanaxi were analysed in the Grande River. The length-weight relationship was estimated for females, males and immatures, and seasonally for the fishes and the parasites through the expression W = aLb. The condition factor of non-parasitised specimens differed seasonally and between sexes, contrasting with the results for <b>parasitised</b> fishes which showed no differences between sexes and season. The condition factor of non-parasitised specimens was {{higher than that of}} the <b>parasitised</b> fishes. Specimens of Astyanax intermedius <b>parasitised</b> {{do not have the same}} biotic conditions compared to non-parasitised individuals, in which the condition factor was similar over the years. In conclusion, parasitism by P. astyanaxi has deleterious effects on this host population which may cause changes in the reproductive and food dynamics of <b>parasitised</b> specimens due to low body conditions...|$|R

5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only <b>parasitise</b> species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit {{is in the form of}} a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others <b>parasitise</b> the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae <b>parasitise</b> the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} wasp, {{including}} especially the cuckoo or jewel wasps (Chrysididae), are kleptoparasites, laying their {{eggs in the}} nests of other wasp species to exploit their parental care. Most such species attack hosts that provide provisions for their immature stages (such as paralyzed prey items), and they either consume the provisions intended for the host larva, or wait for the host to develop and then consume it before it reaches adulthood. An example of a true brood parasite is the paper wasp Polistes sulcifer, which lays its eggs in the nests of other paper wasps (specifically Polistes dominula), and whose larvae are then fed directly by the host. Sand wasps Ammophila often save time and energy by parasitising the nests of other females of their own species, either kleptoparasitically stealing prey, or as brood parasites, removing the other female's egg from the prey and laying their own in its place. According to Emery's rule, social parasites, especially among insects, tend to <b>parasitise</b> species or genera {{to which they are}} closely related. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitises other members of its genus such as D. norwegica and D. arenaria.|$|E
25|$|Tongue worms {{occasionally}} <b>parasitise</b> humans. While {{there is}} a report of Sebekia inducing dermatitis, the two genera responsible for most internal human infestation are Linguatula and Armillifer. Visceral pentastomiasis {{can be caused by}} Linguatula serrata, Armillifer armillatus, Armillifer moniliformis, Armillifer grandis, and Porocephalus crotali.|$|E
25|$|The newly moulted male seeks a host. Male ticks do not engorge {{from the}} host, they wander over the host searching for unfertilised females {{with which to}} mate. The male dies after {{fertilising}} the female although some males can endure for longer if they <b>parasitise</b> the engorging female.|$|E

25|$|Slugs are {{parasitised}} {{by several}} organisms, including acari {{and a wide}} variety of nematodes. The slug mite, Riccardoella limacum, is known to <b>parasitise</b> several dozen species of mollusks, including many slugs, such as Agriolimax agrestis, Arianta arbustrum, Arion ater, Arion hortensis, Limax maximus, Milax budapestensis, Milax gagates, and Milax sowerbyi. R. limacum can often be seen swarming about their host's body, and live in its respiratory cavity.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} {{nematodes}} {{are known to}} <b>parasitise</b> slugs. The nematode worms Agfa flexilis and Angiostoma limacis respectively live in the salivary glands and rectum of Limax maximus. Species of widely known medical importance pertaining to the genus Angiostrongylus are also parasites of slugs. Both Angiostrongylus costaricensis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a meningitis-causing nematode, have larval stages that can only live in mollusks, including slugs, such as Limax maximus.|$|E
25|$|Some ichneumonid species {{lay their}} eggs in the ground, but most inject them either {{directly}} into their host's body or on its surface. After hatching, the ichneumonid larva eats its host alive. The most common hosts are larvae or pupae of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, but some species also <b>parasitise</b> spiders. Hyperparasitoids such as Mesochorinae oviposit inside the larvae of other ichneumonids. The hosts of many species are unknown; host information has been summed up by e.g. Aubert, Perkins. and Townes.|$|E

25|$|Female fig wasps arrive {{carrying}} pollen {{from their}} natal tree and squeeze {{their way through}} the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. The syncomium bears 500–600 female flowers arranged in multiple layers - those that are closer to the outer wall of the fig have short pedicels and long styles, while those that are located closer to the interior of the chamber have long pedicels and short styles. Female wasps generally lay their eggs in the short-styled flowers, while longer-styled flowers {{were more likely to be}} pollinated. The eggs hatch and the larvae <b>parasitise</b> the flowers in which they were laid. Pollinated flowers which have not been parasitised give rise to seeds.|$|E
25|$|Both {{female and}} male ticks quest for a host, but for {{different}} reasons. The female quests for a blood meal, the male to search the host for a female tick in order to mate and feed from her. Males may <b>parasitise</b> the female ticks by piercing their cuticle with their mouth parts to feed on the haemolymph (up to 3-4 males have been found feeding on one female tick). Adult male ticks rarely blood-feed on a host. The outside surface, or cuticle, of hard ticks actually grows to accommodate the large volume of blood ingested, which, in adult ticks, may be anywhere from 200 to 600 times their unfed body weight. When a tick is fully engorged {{it is said to}} be replete.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Ixodes holocyclus {{consists}} of four (4) stages- egg, larva, nymph, adult. Ticks hatch as six-legged larvae after an incubation period of 40 to 60 days. Larvae search for a blood meal from a host, feed for four to six days, then drop from the host and moult to become an eight-legged nymph. Nymphs require a second blood meal before they can moult again to become an adult. Female adults then require a further blood meal of up to ten days before dropping off to lay up to 3000 eggs in leaf litter. Male adults will search for females on the host for mating, and to <b>parasitise</b> the females for blood meals. This life cycle takes around a year to complete (average 365 days, minimum 135 days, maximum 437 days).|$|E
