In each lot, 1 ha was marked off, in which the evaluations were carried out by randomly throwing a 0. 2 x 0. 2 m sampling-square 5 times. Samples were taken before the first <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application,</b> after the first <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application,</b> after the second <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application,</b> and once the post-emergence applications were finished. The evaluated variables included density and cover of the weeds and the crops. The IVI of each species was calculated and the control program was analyzed in terms of decreases in the number of individuals for the 15 more encountered species. Before the applications, higher density values were found. The first and second post-emergence applications reduced the average density by 41 % and 12 %, respectively, throughout the department. Between the first and fourth evaluations, the density of the weeds and crops decreased throughout the department by 51. 7 % and 39 %, respectively.

A field experiment was conducted in 2010 and repeated in 2011 in Greece to study the efficacy of herbicides flumioxazin and sulfosulfuron, applied pre- or post-emergence, on field bindweed and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), as well as their phytotoxicity on potato. Gas chromatography-mass spectrography (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were conducted for possible herbicide residues in potato tubers. Also, the efficacy of these herbicides on field bindweed generated from root fragments was investigated in greenhouse pot experiments. In pots, both herbicides provided 78 % to 100 % control of field bindweed generated from root fragments. In field, both herbicides when applied pre-emergence at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1 provided 65 % to 100 % field bindweed control. However, the corresponding <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> did not provide satisfactory weed control. All treatments provided excellent control of redroot pigweed. Potato growth was not significantly affected by herbicide application in 2010. However, in 2011, <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of flumioxazin caused significant crop injury and yield reduction. The results of this study indicate that satisfactory control of field bindweed and redroot pigweed, as well as high potato yield can be obtained by the pre-emergence application of flumioxazin or sulfosulfuron at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1, without herbicide residues on potato tubers...|$|R

On the other hand, if bromacil was applied in late November, December, or January on nearly saturated soil with weeds that had grown {{for one or two}} months, weed control was quite noticeably reduced. Field and greenhouse studies were conducted at Corvallis, Oregon, to determine the influence of soil moisture and time of herbicide application on bromacil movement and performance. In one field trial, two or six acre-inches of water were applied by sprinkler irrigation at intervals following herbicide treatment. Intervals used were one day, two, four, or eight weeks following herbicide application on dry soil. Field bioassay with rape, wheat, oats, annual bluegrass, sugar beets, and winter field peas indicated that the performance of bromacil applied to dry soil was not affected by differences in irrigation levels or by the time interval between application and irrigation. Bioassay of core segments taken from the top six inches of soil showed no difference due to treatment and indicated that bromacil was not leached below three inches regardless of irrigation treatment. Of the bromacil found in the top three inches, approximately half of it was in the 0 - 1 inch segment. Difficulty in duplicating fall conditions appeared to have a definite effect on results of field studies. Extensive loss of soil moisture due to evaporation was probably the main factor causing deviation from the desired conditions. Another field trial included 0 -, 1. 5 -, 3 -, and 6 -inch sprinkler irrigation rates on an annual bluegrass stand which had been treated with either pre- or <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of bromacil. Irrigations were applied immediately after the post-emergence treatment. Both pre- and <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of bromacil gave good control of annual bluegrass regardless of subsequent post-emergence irrigation. However, total precipitation during the first month was only 0. 25 inches and where there was no irrigation, bromacil did not give adequate control. Greenhouse leaching studies with soil columns did not give satisfactory results. Consistent patterns of leaching throughout replications could not be accomplished. When bromacil movement was determined by the use of soil columns and subirrigation with 1. 5 inches of water, {{there was no difference in}} movement whether it was applied to water-saturated or dry soil. A preliminary experiment with a shorter subirrigation period, however, resulted in less movement of the bromacil applied to dry soil.

Results: Application of Propanil 80 % DF @ 4 kg a. i. /ha and twice hand weeded check at 30 and 45 days after sowing found significantly (p= 0. 05) superior over the application of Propanil 80 % DF @ 3 kg a. i. /ha and rest of the treatments in controlling the weeds in direct seeded rice and increases the grain yield of rice without any phytotoxic effect. Conclusion: Propanil 80 % DF @ 3 kg a. i. /ha could be recommended for <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application</b> at 10 to 15 days after sowing of paddy crop to achieve effective control of weeds...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on field}} trials {{initiated}} by FCS and experiences and recommendations {{from the official}} Plant Protection Service, the herbicidal efficacy of FOXÂ® in winter oilseed rape is demonstrated by comparing two different <b>application</b> practices. The <b>post-emergence</b> splitting <b>application</b> of 0. 3 l/ha in BBCH 14, followed by 0. 7 l/ha in BBCH 16 in winter oilseed rape results in a significantly improved efficacy on different problem weeds. Most relevant are Anchusa spp., Sisymbrium spp., Capsella bursa-pastoris, Thlaspi arvense and Geranium spp [...] Besides the advantageous direct weed control at post-emergence, the prevailing distance restrictions allow the application of FOXÂ® up to the field boundaries...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, {{a hybrid}} seed corn {{production}} field was confirmed to be infested {{with a population}} of Amaranthus tuberculatus that was not controlled by postemergence applications of all tested commercially available HPPDinhibitor herbicides. In glasshouse and field studies, resistance to <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of mesotrione, tembotrione and topramezone was confirmed. In addition, this population was identified to be resistant to ALSinhibitors and to triazines. A. tuberculatus is a very competitive weed, which can appear in high population density and can emerge even very late during the season. A. tuberculatus is dioecious and therefore an obligate outcrosser, which is leading to high genetic variability within a population. All these biological features increase the risk of developing resistance to herbicides. Therefore, the field history explains clearly that this resistance developed under specific conditions. In this field, inbred corn was grown for at least seven consecutive years. Inbred corn is much less competitive with weeds compared to hybrid field corn and herbicide options are reduced vs. hybrid field corn production. In addition due to the resistance to triazines, only one effective mode of action (HPPD) has been used post-emergence to control A. tuberculatus for over seven consecutive years. The resistance development in this A. tuberculatus population is clearly a result of the lack of diversity in the weed management plan which should include crop and herbicide rotation. Field testing showed pre-emergence applications of mesotrione combinations (LumaxÂ®, LexarÂ®) provided good control of this A. tuberculatus population. In addition alternative herbicides to control this population have been identified: Glyphosate, glufosinate, paraquat, PPGO-inhibitors, auxins, and triazinones were very effective...|$|R
40|$|Thiencarbazone-methyl {{is a new}} {{herbicide}} for {{the selective}} control of grasses and broadleaf weeds primarily in corn. The active ingredient belongs to the chemical class of sulfonly-amino-carbonyl-triazolinones (SACT) and acts as an inhibitor of the ALS-enzyme. The compound offers cross spectrum activity against grasses and broadleaf weeds and can be applied at the pre-emergence and the post-emergence timing. The use rate depends on the application timing and may vary from 22 â 45 g a. i. /ha in pre-emergence applications and 10 â 15 g a. i. /ha in <b>post-emergence</b> <b>applications.</b> Sequential treatments are possible {{as long as the}} maximum seasonal dose of 45 g a. i. /ha is not exceeded. In commercial corn herbicides, TCM is always combined with safener technology such as the novel safener cyprosulfamide and with other herbicidal active ingredients. In pre-emergence applications, the primary herbicidal mixpartner is isoxaflutole. In herbicides designed for postemergence use, TCM is co-formulated with foramsulfuron, iodosulfuron or tembotrione. The commercial herbicides composed of TCM and CSA plus sulfonylurea or triketone partners have demonstrated high weed control success in conventional and herbicide-tolerant corn production systems. Depending on the product, the potential for one pass weed control has been confirmed. Control of perennial grasses like Sorghum halapense and Elymus repens together with control of problem weeds like Polygonum convolvulus and suppression of Cirsium arvense and Convolvulus arvensis appear to be among the most attractive features of TCM-based herbicides under European conditions. High crop tolerance of herbicides combining two or three highly active ingredients in one commercial product is ensured by the novel safener cyprosulfamide which can protect corn via root uptake and via leaf uptake from herbicide damage...|$|R
40|$|Trinity {{is a new}} {{herbicide}} for {{the control}} of silky-bent grass, annual meadow grass and annual dicotyledonous weeds in cereals in autumn. The registration covers the use in winter barley, winter wheat, winter rye and winter triticale at a maximum dose rate of 2. 0 l/ha Trinity as a <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application</b> (autumn, GS 10 - 13). Trinity is the first registered three-way mixture of the three established ingredients diflufenican (40 g/l), pendimethalin (300 g/l) and chlortoluron (250 g/l). All ingredients have a different mode of action according to HRAC classification: F 1 (diflufenican), K 1 (pendimethalin) and C 2 (chlortoluron). This unique three-way mixture in Trinity leads to a very high efficacy against Apera spica-venti and Poa annua and against {{a broad spectrum of}} dicotyledonous weeds including less sensitive weeds like Papaver rhoeas, Centaurea cyanus und Geranium spp [...] Due to the optimal balanced amount of ingredients, Trinity has also a very good selectivity in all registered cereals. Furthermore, the advantageous regulatory restrictions of Trinity increase the attractiveness for practical use. Based on the results of multi-annual German field trials, this paper shows the efficacy and the selectivity of Trinity...|$|E
40|$|SYD 11720 H is a new, {{selective}} herbicide developed by Syngenta agro for grass weed and dicot control in winter cereals. It is formulated as suspoemulsion with 604, 5 g active ingredient per liter and contains the active ingredients Prosulfocarb (600 g/L) and Pyroxsulam (4, 5 g/L), {{as well as}} the safener Cloquintocet-mexyl (4, 5 g/L). SYD applied 11720 H with a rate of 4. 0 L/ha in combination with an additive in order to stabilize the efficacy under adverse conditions. The essential innovation of SYD 11720 H is the combination of a primarily soil-active (Prosulfocarb) and leaf-active (Pyroxsulam) active ingredient. This allows a longer application window or a previous application regardless of weather conditions. The product has no carry over limitations and allows the full flexibility in recropping. The major benefit which is of particular importance is the good efficacy against winter annual grass weeds and dicotyledonous species. The registration is requested for the <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application</b> use in autumn in winter wheat, winter rye, and winter triticale from the 1 -leaf growth stage (BBCH 11) to beginning of tillering (BBCH 21) of the crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was aimed to study effectiveness of weed management practices using herbicide mixture of atrazine and mesotrione and hand weeding on maize grown in field with one season of organic compost residues. The {{research was}} conducted in Bengkulu, Indonesia, from November 2014 until February 2015. Research was arranged in split plot design. Residue of organic compost was a main plot which consists of residue of manure compost, residue of empty fruit bunches (EFB) of oil palm compost, and non-residual field. Weed management practices was a sub-plot which consists of pre- and <b>post-emergence</b> <b>application</b> of herbicide mixtures at 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1, hand weeding, and untreated plot. Twelve treatment combinations were replicated three times. Results showed significant interactions between weed management practices and residue of organic compost on plant height, leaf area, yield, dry weight of 100 grains, and total weed biomass. The best weed management practice on maize field with organic compost residues {{is the use of}} herbicide mixtures applied preemergence, which increased maize yield by 52 percent. Interaction of the trials also suppressed weeds significantly, which was observed in the reduction of total weed biomass, where the strongest suppression was observed on postemergence trials of herbicide mixture of atrazine and mesotrione in the non-residual plot...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Agronomy Field Laboratory, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh to evaluate the efficacy, rice selectivity and cost-effectiveness of some integrated weed control methods on the productivity of aromatic rice under randomized complete block design with three replications. The experiment consisted of five aromatic rice varieties; Kalijira, BRRI dhan 34, BRRI dhan 37, BRRI dhan 38 and Binadhan- 13, and six different weed management practices comprising no weeding, weed free, mechanical + manual weeding, preâemergence herbicide + manual weeding, postâemergence herbicide + manual weeding, preâ + postâemergence herbicide. Ten weed species belonging to five families infested the experimental plots. Herbicide treatments provided excellent weed control efficiency and produced much higher net benefit and cost benefit ratio than weedy plot. Among the herbicidal and mechanical treatments, sequential application of Bensulfuran methyl + Acetachlor at early growth stage (pre-emergence herbicide) followed by Pyrazosulfuran ethyl at mid growth stage (post-emergence herbicide) provided the highest weed control efficiency, productivity and net benefit. Single application of Pyrazosulfuran ethyl at mid growth stage followed by one hand weeding performed {{very close to the}} preâ + <b>postâemergence</b> herbicide <b>application</b> in terms of productivity and net benefit but in terms of weed control efficiency at 45 days after transplanting application of Bensulfuran methyl + Acetachlor at early growth stage followed by one hand weeding performed very close to preâ + <b>postâemergence</b> herbicide <b>application.</b> Mechanical weeding followed by one hand weeding and application of Bensulfuran methyl + Acetachlor at early growth stage followed by one hand weeding also provided satisfactory results in terms of productivity and economic return. Since manual weeding was less economic, sequential application of pre- and post-emergence herbicides may be recommended for effective weed management in aromatic rice...|$|R
40|$|Cotton {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to the interference imposed by weed community, being therefore essential to adopt control measures ensuring the crop yield. Herbicides are the primary method of weed control in large-scale areas of production, and usually more than one herbicide application is necessary due to the extensive crop cycle. This study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of different chemical weed control systems for conventional cotton. The experiment {{took place in the}} field in a randomized block design, with twenty nine treatments and four replications in a split plot layout (adjacent double check). Results showed that triple mixtures in pre-emergence increased the chance of observing reductions in the cotton yield. To avoid reductions in crop yield, users should proceed to a maximum mixture of two herbicides in pre-emergence, followed by S-metolachlor over the top, followed by one <b>post-emergence</b> mixture <b>application</b> of pyrithiobac-sodium + trifloxysulfuron-sodium...|$|R
40|$|Exploiting the {{competitive}} ability of crops {{is essential to}} develop cost-effective and sustainable weed management practices. Reduced row spacing, increased seeding rates, and selection of competitive cultivars can potentially manage crop-weed competition in cotton, soybean, wheat, and corn. These cultural weed management practices facilitate a more rapid development of crop canopy that adversely affect the emergence, density, growth, biomass, and subsequently the seed production of weeds during a growing season. These cultural practices can also favour the weed suppressive ability of the crop by influencing the canopy architecture traits (plant height, canopy density, leaf area index, rate of leaf area development, and leaf distribution). These crop-competition attributes can potentially {{reduce the risk of}} crop yield losses due to interference from weed cohorts that escape an early- or a late-season <b>post-emergence</b> herbicide <b>application.</b> Furthermore, reduced row spacing, increased seeding rates, and weed-competitive cultivars are effective in reducing reliance on a single site-of-action herbicides, thereby reducing the selection pressure for development of herbicide-resistant weed populations in a cropping system...|$|R
