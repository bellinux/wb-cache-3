5|$|Characters of Shakespear's <b>Plays</b> is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's <b>plays,</b> written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt.

40|$|An {{observational}} {{study was conducted}} examining the social and cognitive <b>play</b> of young children with hearing-impairment <b>playing</b> in small groups composed of both hearing and hearing-impaired peers. The questions addressed {{the effects of the}} hearing status of the <b>play</b> partner upon the social/cognitive <b>play</b> patterns of children with hearing-impairment, and the relationship between their <b>play</b> patterns and their communicative competence, social competence and speech intelligibility. Forty-eight hearing-impaired subjects ranging in age from 3 - 6 to 6 - 1 were observed <b>playing</b> with partners of same and different hearing status during integrated <b>play</b> sessions at 13 school sites. The social <b>play</b> categories included solitary, parallel and group <b>play,</b> while the cognitive <b>play</b> categories included functional, constructive and dramatic <b>play.</b> Results of the study showed that the <b>play</b> patterns of the hearing-impaired children differed significantly for each group of partners. When <b>playing</b> with hearing-impaired partners, subjects engaged in group functional and constructive <b>play</b> more frequently than parallel functional and constructive <b>play,</b> and with equal frequency in parallel dramatic and group dramatic <b>play.</b> When <b>playing</b> with hearing partners, subjects engaged with equal frequency in group and parallel <b>play.</b> When <b>playing</b> with mixed groups of hearing and hearing-impaired partners, subjects engaged in group dramatic <b>play</b> more frequently than parallel dramatic <b>play,</b> and with equal frequency in group functional and constructive <b>play,</b> and parallel functional and constructive <b>play.</b> Communicative competence was negatively correlated to functional <b>play.</b> A positive correlation was found between social competence and constructive <b>play,</b> and between speech intelligibility and dramatic <b>play.</b> These correlations remained significant when age was partialed out. The hearing-impaired subjects spent similar percentages of time in social/cognitive <b>play</b> as those reported for hearing children. The study supports the premise that the <b>play</b> of young hearing-impaired children varies according to the hearing status of the <b>play</b> partner and is neither delayed nor deficient...|$|R
