Though alcohol sale and consumption was legalized, in many areas it was still substantially restricted and, even today, some counties in the state remain dry or retain significant restrictions. Most other activities went underground and have remained largely hidden. In 1969, major legislation was enacted directed at alcohol and narcotics. The Implied Consent law was passed requiring that drivers agree to breath tests when arrested for suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Statutes against narcotics were strengthened giving <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>prosecutors</b> more ability to target offenders.|$|E

This paper is based on an extensive online survey collected from traffic (N = 129) and local (N = 100) <b>police</b> officers <b>and</b> <b>prosecutors</b> (N = 96) in the context of Finnish traffic law, which forbids driving while fatigued in an article relating to a driver's fitness to drive. While encountering fatigued drivers is very common for police officers, only a small proportion has received training about how to recognize and deal with fatigued drivers. Driving while extremely fatigued is considered rather or extremely negligent behavior by almost all respondents. Although agreement between these three groups exists regarding several issues, they disagree about whether the current law is specific enough, and whether experts might be valuable in court when discussing the possible contribution of fatigue to the cause of a crash. We discuss the application of the law and opinions about the current law formulation, experience and education, as well as general awareness and attitudes, taking into consideration the different nature of <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>prosecutor</b> work...|$|R

Dr. Hugh Owens, who had performed the autopsy, argued that he had recovered one of the presumed three bullets present in the body, and that because the body had been [...] "prepared" [...] by an undertaker prior to autopsy, any chemical tests on stomach contents would have been useless. Owens did add when asked {{that he had not}} seen any food apparent in the stomach at autopsy. The body of Patricia Jones was exhumed on June 17 in order to collect the bullets that had been left behind at the original autopsy, as well as to gather what samples of tissue and stomach contents were possible.|$|E
