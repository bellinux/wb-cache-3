50|$|Use {{oriented}} services {{differ from}} product oriented services {{as the focus}} is not put on selling products. Like for example in classical renting systems the physical good stays in the provider’s ownership and is only {{made available to the}} consumer in different forms. Sometimes usage is even shared by several users. Car sharing is a typical example. However, while the consumers obtain the product’s function the responsibility for maintenance and disposal remains with the provider. The eco-efficiency impact of these services is due to the product’s high use intensity. This reduces the total number of needed products and consequently also lowers the material and energy input required for production. Further the payment system in which customers only <b>pay</b> <b>per</b> unit of <b>used</b> service leads to an additional economic incentive for producers to decrease the amount of processed resources.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cloud Operators, {{in order}} to respond {{effectively}} to the QoS requirements of cloud applications, are obliged to apply over-provisioning policies. In general, this tactic leads to severe waste of the available cloud computing resources. Similarly, both Service/Platform Providers and End-Users wish to avoid the extra cost of this over-provisioning tactic and <b>pay</b> only <b>per</b> <b>use,</b> without having to statically reserve extra resources in advance. As a consequence, the cloud community urgently asks for flexible and intelligent management solutions, towards enhanced and efficient utilization of the cloud. The ultimate target of any intelligent cloud management scheme should be the provision of a service at an adequate quality level, creating the need to introduce the notion of Quality of Experience (QoE). In this context, this paper proposes a unified QoE-aware management framework, directly targeting to cloud computing environments. The proposed management system suggests the optimization of cloud resources usage and offered services in terms of QoE, satisfying the different service and resource requirements of all the involved cloud entities. In addition, the proposed novel approach merges together various QoS aspects in a multidimensional framework, referred to as QoE 4 CLOUD, which considers the perceived quality as the key metric for the management and performance optimization of the cloud environment...|$|R

Virgin Mobile never charged for received messages, and this practice remains effective to this day. Long distance calls to Canada or the United States were charged at double the local airtime rate.

The most popular voucher option for <b>Pay</b> <b>Per</b> <b>Use</b> members is the $100 voucher which is valid for 365 days.

For example, Virgin Mobile eliminated talk time discounts previously available for customers who talked for more than five minutes in a day.
