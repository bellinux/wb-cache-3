40|$|AbstractPipe {{internal}} recirculation (PIR) is an undesired phenomenon {{which may}} lead to significant additional heat losses. Although different research institutes already measured singular PIR effects, {{there is still a}} lack of wide-ranging evaluations and practical solutions. This paper describes a test and evaluation method and reports on results regarding the influence of the pipe’ slope, the material (copper, stainless steel) and diameter on the PIR caused heat loss coefficient. For combined <b>pipe</b> <b>path</b> arrangements a new method is presented, which allows to calculate the heat losses from basic investigations on horizontal and vertical pipe orientations. This method has been experimentally validated. Finally, the effectiveness of different measures for the reduction of PIR induced heat losses is presented...|$|E

The objective of this project is to design a pipe hanger system that could be installed during initial fabrication while still allowing adjustment when the <b>pipe</b> <b>path</b> deviates from the initial drawings. The design must be cheap and utilize already existing parts. One key constraint is to hold a load of 250 pounds and withstand a velocity between 100 - 120 inches per second. The original design created utilizes a C-channel track attached to the ceiling and a spring locking mechanism to provide flexibility. This final design eliminated the spring device with a nut and rod locking mechanism and a threaded rod between the C-channel track and the marine style pipe hanger. This design was tested against the constraints given by NNS, using the program ANSYs workbench. The design {{was found to be}} able to withstand 100 - 120 inches per second velocity without faltering. The design was found to be able to withstand up to 6014 psi. Once the computer testing was complete, the total cost was calculated. This was estimated originally at a range of $ 50 - $ 60. The end price was calculated at $ 90, this was without the track. For the constraint of a cheap product to be achieved, the design will need to be altered to use either cheaper materials, cheaper tools, or cheaper components. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Backward erosion piping is an {{internal}} erosion mechanism during which shallow pipes are {{formed in the}} direction opposite to the flow underneath water-retaining structures {{as a result of}} the gradual removal of sandy material by the action of water. It is an important failure mechanism in both dikes and dams where sandy layers are covered by a cohesive layer. Sand boils can indicate that backward erosion is present and they are observed regularly during high water and floods. Although failure resulting from backward erosion piping is not common, several dike failures in the US, China and the Netherlands have been attributed to this mechanism. Given the impact that climate change is expected to have, prediction models for backward erosion piping are becoming increasingly important in flood-risk assessment. The prediction models available until now, such as Bligh’s rule and the Sellmeijer model, were validated in the research programme ‘Strength and loads on flood defence structures’ (SBW: Sterkte en Belastingen Waterkeringen) in the period 2008 - 2010 using small-, medium- and large-scale experiments. These experiments showed that an empirical adjustment of the Sellmeijer model was required to take the effect of the sand type into account and that validation was not possible for loose sand types because the erosion mode is different in those conditions. However, the absence of a theoretical basis makes this proposed empirical adjustment unsatisfactory because it lacks robustness. The main question addressed by this dissertation is how to explain and predict the pipe-forming erosion processes in uniform sands. A review of the literature, in conjunction with additional experiments, showed that the critical head in pipe formation leading to dike failure depends on either pipe initiation or pipe progression. In some experiments, the critical head for pipe initiation exceeds that of pipe progression and equilibrium is therefore prevented. The experiments in which no equilibrium was observed allowed for the development of a model for pipe initiation. It was possible to relate the observed differences in critical gradient caused by scale, sand type and configuration to the fluidisation of sand very close to the exit, where the local gradients are high. In the field, pipe progression is likely to determine the critical gradient. The Sellmeijer model predicts the progression of the pipe on the basis of the equilibrium of particles on the bottom of the pipe. The literature, and an analysis of the pipe width, depth, gradient and erosion process in experiments, indicate that pipe progression relies on two processes: primary erosion, which causes the removal of particles at the pipe tip, and secondary erosion, which causes the erosion of the pipe walls and bottom. Although the Sellmeijer model does not include primary erosion, it does function well for sand layers with a 2 D exit configuration in which there is no variation in the grain size along the <b>pipe</b> <b>path.</b> The adaptation of the Sellmeijer model that was found necessary to account for the effect of sand type can be replaced by using the original model in combination with a variable bedding angle based on incipient motion experiments from the literature. The Sellmeijer model does not predict the critical gradient well for 3 D configurations such as flow towards a single point, or for heterogeneous soils. Variations in the grain size in the <b>pipe</b> <b>path</b> were found to result in significantly higher critical gradients than expected, whereas a strong concentration of the flow towards the exit led to a fall in the critical gradient. 3 D numerical calculations and the inclusion of primary erosion in the Sellmeijer model are needed to predict piping under these conditions.

40|$|Why is {{understanding}} hydraulics important? The {{science of}} hydraulics {{is as old}} as civilization itself. For centuries, engineers have succeeded in making water flow {{from one place to another}} with as few hitches as possible. When problems do occur, they are usually related to the hydraulics involved in pipe flow. Liquids in motion produce forces and pressure whenever the velocity, flow direction, or elevation changes. Knowing pipe pressure and flow at certain points along the <b>pipe’s</b> <b>path</b> can help determine pipe size and capac-ity. It also can help in determining what pipe material would work best in given situations. Further, having an understanding of hydraulics can help system managers decide if pressure reducers or pumps are necessary to transport water in an efficient manner. Most small water and wastewater systems do not have an engineer on staff, or even one they can consult, who might be able to answer simple or basic questions about hydraulics. And the cost of engineering advice can quickly add up. Because many small systems are on tight budgets, understanding hydraulics can save money. Units and Variables First of all, understanding that water has a unit weight is important. System designers need this information to calculate other variables. The physical and hydraulic behavior of wastewater is so similar to that of clean water that there is generally no difference in the design or analysis of systems involving these two liquids. For practical purposes, water and wastewater are considered to be incompressible liquids because their volume does not change significantly with changing pressure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} laminar flow in serpentine channels with periodically repeating elements, with application to heat transfer passages within complex compact heat exchangers. A methodology has been developed to determine the fully-developed flow and heat transfer behaviour in such channels with a constant wall heat flux using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

40|$|Conventional cooling techniques, {{such as the}} use of heat pIpes {{and forced}} {{convective}} cooling can be inadequate for many high performance electronic chips or when the operating ambient temperature is high. In such cases, there is a need for active cooling of the chip to keep its operating temperature below the design point. Thermo-Electric coolers (TEC) provide an attractive option in such instances and have been developed and used for thermal management in electronic packaging systems. Such systems, however, can have a low overall coefficient of performance since the TEC needs to be kept on even at low heat load conditions.

In recent decades a number of high performance insulation materials have been developed. This paper presents an investigation of high performance insulation materials in district heating <b>pipes.</b> Three different <b>paths</b> were chosen as the most promising; mixing aerogel granulates in polyurethane foam, hybrid insulation with layers of aerogel blankets within the polyurethane, or hybrid insulation with vacuum insulation panels. The thermal conductivity of aerogel have been measured to as low as 13 mW/(m∙K) and the thermal conductivity through the center of a vacuum insulation panel can be as low as 4 mW/(m∙K). These can be compared to polyurethane which has a thermal conductivity around 25 - 26 mW/(m∙K). Prototypes of district heating pipes were produced in laboratory and the thermal conductivity of the pipes was investigated. The effective thermal conductivity of the hybrid insulation of the district heating pipes by aerogel blankets or vacuum insulation panels were 15 - 20 % less than pipes insulated with pure polyurethane.
