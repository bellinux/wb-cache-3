40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a transport system with two road links in a series that describes traffic patterns under various pricing regimes. We consider various mixes of road operation including private-public toll roads, free-private toll roads, and free- <b>public</b> <b>toll</b> roads. We derive the pricing rules and evaluate the economic welfare under alternative regimes. Inter-regional distribution of welfare is also discussed. It is shown that pricing rules applied by a public operator differ from those in a parallel network, and the relative efficiency of alternative regimes depends on the presence of road congestion. A mix of private and <b>public</b> <b>toll</b> roads attains higher economic welfare and lower disparity, especially in the presence of heavy congestion. © 2008 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R

50|$|Class 4 toll access {{switches}} provide {{long distance}} (<b>toll)</b> <b>telephone</b> service including intrastate calling and inter-state calling. Intrastate calls {{are generally more}} expensive than inter-state calls due to favorable tariffs with price plans approved by the Public Utilities Commission or Public Service Commission for each state. Inter-state calls are generally less expensive than intrastate calls since tariffs are filed with the Federal Communications Commission because of the inter-state commerce aspect of the service. Class 4 switches provide access to long distance service in rural areas. In addition, Class 4 switches traditionally provided operator assisted calls such as person-to-person, collect, and calls billed to third parties. However, many operator services are now automated with minimum human intervention.|$|R

40|$|Interest {{is growing}} in private toll roads as an {{alternative}} to public free-access road infrastructure. Private toll roads have gained favour for various reasons, including a dearth of public funds for road construction and maintenance, increasing traffic congestion, and growing acceptance of the user-pay principle in general, and road pricing in particular. This paper focuses on allocative efficiency of private toll roads. The model features one origin and one destination linked by two parallel routes that can differ in capacity and free-flow travel time. Congestion takes the form of queueing. Prospective travellers decide whether to drive, and if so on which route and at what time. Three private ownership regimes are considered: (1) a private road on one route and free access on the other, (2) a private roads duopoly, and (3) a mixed duopoly with a private road competing with a <b>public</b> <b>toll</b> road. Private toll roads are generally found to enhance allocative efficiency (measured by social surplus) relative to free access. The efficiency gain is greater when both routes are tolled, tolls are varied over time to eliminate queueing, and when no private road has a dominant fraction of total capacity. Paradoxically, mixed duopoly can be less efficient than a private duopoly. Price leadership by a <b>public</b> <b>toll</b> road avoids this possibility, although leadership typically yields little additional efficiency gain. ...|$|R

The efficiency gain (measuredby social surplus) in each regime is measured relative to the efficiency gain derived from applying first-best optimal tolls on both routes. Private toll roads are generally found to enhance efficiency. The efficiency gain is greater when tollsare varied over time to eliminate queueing, when competing routes are also tolled, when no private roadhas a dominant fraction of total capacity, and when a private road does not suffer a significant traveltime disadvantage.

40|$|When {{analysing}} {{the effects}} of transport policies {{it is important to}} adequately control for heterogeneity: previous studies note that ignoring heterogeneity biases the estimated welfare effects of tolling. This paper examines {{the effects of}} tolling, in a bottleneck model, with a continuously distributed value of time. With homogeneous users, first-best <b>public</b> <b>tolling</b> has no effect on prices. With heterogeneity it does: low values of time lose, and high values of time gain. The average congestion externality decreases with the heterogeneity in the value of time. Consequently, the welfare gain of first-best tolling also decreases. The more heterogeneous the value of time is, the lower the relative efficiency of a public pay-lane. This finding contrasts with the previous literature. Earlier studies, using static flow congestion, conclude that the relative efficiency increases with this type of heterogeneity. With more heterogeneity in the value of time, the relative efficiency of a private pay-lane is also lower, while that of a <b>public</b> time-invariant <b>toll</b> is higher. Our results suggest that the welfare gains of different tolling schemes are affected differently by heterogeneity. Further, the impact of heterogeneity on the effects of a policy also depends on the type of congestion considered. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
