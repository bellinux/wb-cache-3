5|$|The Main Stand is {{the oldest}} in Prenton Park, having been opened in December 1968. It is also the largest, with a {{capacity}} of 5,957. A two tier stand, it is generally divided into three main sections. The lower tier consists of the Bebington End <b>paddock</b> (capacity 1,150) and the Town End <b>paddock</b> (capacity 1,209), {{either side of the}} halfway line. The upper tier is simply referred to as the Main Stand (capacity 3,598).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Paddock</b> is {{a smaller}} camping field, {{directly}} connected to the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre. The field houses Mallinson's toilet block, and holds 30 campers.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{systems support}} areas of Coolibah, Gum and Box Trees that extend into Wattle. The {{property}} {{is divided into}} 10 main <b>paddocks,</b> 6 smaller <b>paddocks</b> and numerous holding <b>paddocks.</b> The main house at the homestead was built in 2005.|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} fertiliser, {{consisting of}} a poorly soluble barium selenate core with a coating of highly soluble sodium selenite, was evaluated in 2 trials {{for the provision of}} selenium (Se) to grazing sheep. The fertiliser was administered at a level of 1 kg per hectare to 3 of 6 kikuyu <b>paddocks</b> during 1995 and 1996 in Trial 1, while the other <b>paddocks</b> were left untreated. The Se status of SA mutton merino ram lambs, as reflected by whole blood, liver and kidney Se concentrations, was elevated (P&lt; 0. 01) for at least 5 months after application of the fertiliser. Whole blood and liver Se concentrations of animals grazing unfertilised control <b>paddocks</b> were indicative of a subclinical Se deficiency at times (&lt; 100 ng Se/mℓ whole blood and &lt; 300 mg Se/kg liver dry matter). In Trial 2, 4 of 7 <b>paddocks</b> on which an oat fodder crop was established were treated with the Se fertiliser during 1995 and 1997. The remaining 3 <b>paddocks</b> were left unfertilised as controls. Groups of 10 - 15 pregnant SA mutton merino ewes were introduced to these <b>paddocks</b> within 2 weeks of parturition. These ewes and their progeny utilised these <b>paddocks</b> for a mean (+SD) period of 41 + 8 days after parturition. The whole blood Se concentrations of these ewes and their offspring were elevated (P &lt; 0. 01) relative to their contemporaries utilising control <b>paddocks.</b> No suggestion of a subclinical Se deficiency was discernible in animals grazing control <b>paddocks,</b> although whole blood Se levels approached 100 ng Se/mℓ during 1997. The application of Se fertiliser did not result in improvements in ewe reproduction or lamb growth. There was a suggestion of an improvement (P = 0. 21) in mean (+SE) lamb survival on <b>paddocks</b> receiving Se fertiliser compared to control <b>paddocks</b> (71. 5 + 4. 6 % vs 62. 2 + 5. 3 % respectively) ...|$|R

5|$|Following a {{satisfactory}} inspection {{carried out by}} Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 September 1892, the line between <b>Paddock</b> Wood and Hope Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst was opened to passenger and goods traffic nine days later. The first service drawn by Cudworth E1 class 2-4-0 No. 112 left Hope Mill at 08:25 and free travel was offered throughout the day. The official opening took place on 1 October 1892, and services were extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893. The line was worked by the SER (soon to become the SECR) which formally absorbed the Cranbrook and <b>Paddock</b> Wood Railway on 29 January 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, {{situated}} across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep <b>paddock</b> and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer <b>Paddock,</b> located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|The two-tier {{steel frame}} and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, {{a part of the}} ground called The <b>Paddock.</b> Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the <b>Paddock</b> was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} {{is divided into}} 30 <b>paddocks</b> with seven holding <b>paddocks</b> with a carrying capacity estimated at 9,000 cattle. The property has a homestead, guest accommodation, a dry-weather airstrip, staff quarters and steel stockyards.|$|R
50|$|Camfield {{is broken}} into 22 <b>paddocks,</b> seven holding <b>paddocks</b> and {{three sets of}} steel yards. About half of the {{property}} lies within 4 km of permanent water with another 37 watering points available for stock.|$|R
50|$|Gerard sold Moulton <b>Paddocks</b> to George Alexander Baird in 1892 {{who moved}} his stud from Kentford. It {{was thought that}} he would also move his Bedford Lodge {{operation}} to Moulton <b>Paddocks,</b> but he died the following year. Lillie Langtry the actress was {{in a relationship with}} Baird at this time and she would have stayed at Moulton <b>Paddocks.</b> Langtry had a small number of horses in training at Baird's stable and after his death moved them to Kentford - about 3 miles from Moulton <b>Paddocks.</b> She gradually became more interested in racing, purchased additional horses, and in 1895 bought a house in Kentford called Regal Lodge.|$|R
5|$|Training was {{undertaken}} {{on a voluntary}} and unpaid basis with weekly parades being undertaken at Kelvin Grove, while field training took place at Fraser's <b>Paddock</b> in Enoggera and Redbank. By July 1939, the battalion's strength was 550 officers and other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Bus {{services}} are operated chiefly by Arriva Kent & Sussex, providing local town and rural services to Tonbridge, <b>Paddock</b> Wood and Sevenoaks, {{as well as}} express services to locations such as Bromley and Maidstone. Eastbourne and Brighton on the south coast are accessible on services run by Stagecoach in Eastbourne and Brighton & Hove respectively, and Metrobus operates hourly services to Crawley.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from <b>Paddock</b> Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at <b>Paddock</b> Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{many ways to}} {{practice}} sustainable animal husbandry. Some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called <b>paddocks,</b> lowering stock density, and moving the stock between <b>paddocks</b> frequently.|$|R
50|$|The park also {{contains}} several lodges and cottages, Bushy House, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at the Teddington end, the Royal <b>Paddocks,</b> and two areas of allotments: the Royal <b>Paddocks</b> Allotments at Hampton Wick and the Bushy Park Allotments at Hampton Hill.|$|R

5|$|Hagley's cricket {{team was}} formed in the 1890s and was playing by 1896. Similarly to the {{football}} club they played on a <b>paddock,</b> adjacent to the current recreation ground, moving to the new ground in 1902. The ground remains open for cricket though Hagley no longer fields a team.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{was born}} in <b>Paddock</b> Wood, Kent on 5 February 1894, the eldest son among nine {{children}} of Frederick Beverley Morgan, a timber importer, and his wife Clare Elizabeth née Horrocks. He was raised at Mascall's Manor. <b>Paddock</b> Wood. He commenced his education at Hurstleigh, a private school in Tunbridge Wells in 1902. At an early age {{it was decided that}} Frederick would become a British Army officer, and in 1907 he entered Clifton College, a school noted for its connections with the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. At Clifton he played rugby and cricket, and served in the School Cadet Corps, which became the Officers' Training Corps (OTC) in 1908. As a cadet sergeant, he was one of many who lined the route to Buckingham Palace for the Coronation of George V of the United Kingdom in 1911. He eventually rose to the rank of second lieutenant. Morgan duly passed the entrance examination for Woolwich, which he entered in 1912.|$|E
