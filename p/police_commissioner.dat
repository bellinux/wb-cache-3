5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, {{and the next morning}} the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan <b>Police</b> <b>Commissioner</b> appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of <b>Police</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|The city of Mumbai's <b>police</b> <b>commissioner</b> {{called for}} {{censoring}} of the fast-paced rash driving {{scenes in the}} film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting {{in an increase in}} the number of road accidents. Unlike the original, the robberies depicted in Dhoom 2 were not inspired by any real-life crimes. Dhoom 2, however, inspired the robbery of a man by his nephew, who wore clothing similar to Hrithik's in the film while committing the crime.|$|E

5|$|As <b>Police</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan <b>Police</b> <b>commissioner</b> from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential no-go areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E
5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's <b>police</b> <b>commissioner</b> wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Do {{individuals}} {{trained in}} law enforcement punish or rewards differently from typical student subjects? We analyze norm enforcement behavior of newly appointed <b>police</b> <b>commissioners</b> in both a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism game and a Common Pool Resource game. Our experimental design includes treatments where a reward or sanction institution is exogenously imposed, as well as treatments with endogenous selection of the norm enforcement institution. Compared to a standard student-subject pool, <b>police</b> <b>commissioners</b> cooperate significantly more in both games. With exogenous institutions, <b>police</b> <b>commissioners</b> bear a higher burden of punishment costs than non-police subjects. When the norm enforcement institution is endogenous, all subjects vote more in favor of rewards over sanctions, but police subjects with some work experience {{are more likely to}} vote for sanctions. Police subjects also reward and sanction more than the others when the institution results from a majority vote...|$|R
