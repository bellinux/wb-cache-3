25|$|The {{same day}} the Kingpin Act was made public, the PGR seized Hotelito Desconocido and closed it down. This action by the PGR stemmed from suspicions that the hotel was a money {{laundering}} front for the CJNG drug cartel; the Mexican government had leads that Hotelito Desconocido {{was used as a}} legal entity by the CJNG in an attempt to invest money in economy and hide the illegal origins of their drug proceeds. They also added that the CJNG may have used the hotel as a meeting spot for its members. The seizure was done following a formal request done through the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and by the exchange of information with U.S. officials. The National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) also froze several Mexican-based bank accounts from a <b>previous</b> <b>investigation</b> they had open. Torres González's assets were temporarily frozen in Mexico. The 14 other businesses sanctioned through the Kingpin Act were not confiscated by the Mexican government that day.|$|E

[...] A competent authority claimed that the contractor had already been paid in full {{and there was no}} need for further reward. [...] Robeson was also charged with awarding contracts to ship builder John Roach without public bidding. The latter charge proved to be unfounded. The close friendship with Daniel Ammen, Grant's longtime friend growing up in Georgetown, Ohio, helped Robeson keep his cabinet position.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{became the}} focus of debate in the United States, {{generating}} [...] "a great deal of interest and scrutiny among military professionals and from outside observers" [...] mainly due to the relatively [...] "significant number of coalition casualties". Several investigations were launched into events leading up to the battle. The initial investigation was completed in August 2008. In July 2009, Senator James Webb requested that the U.S. Army formally investigate the battle and <b>previous</b> <b>investigation.</b> Lieutenant General Richard F. Natonski conducted another investigation in late 2009 which led to orders of reprimand for the chain of command. In June 2010, the U.S. Army revoked the reprimands. They stated that no negligence was involved and said of the soldiers that [...] "by their valor and their skill, they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined, skillful, and adaptable enemy".|$|E

He said [...] "I am sorry to have to say to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the hon.
