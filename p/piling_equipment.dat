40|$|Drilled {{displacement}} piles {{have been}} used {{around the world for}} decades as foundation elements for structures and embankments. Typically the pile toes are designed to penetrate into stiff or dense soil formations to achieve sufficient base resistance. Recent research at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia has discovered that the in situ stress conditions in stiff to hard clays is directly related to pile installation rates, which in turn are a function of the piling rig capacity and ground conditions. With adequate and constant pile penetration rates in situ stress conditions in the stiff to hard clay are increased by about 40 %, resulting in significantly higher pile capacities. If pile penetration rates are too slow the in situ stress conditions are reduced considerably by remoulding and shearing of the clay. The paper presents the results of full-scale test piles at a stiff to hard clay site installed using different full-scale <b>piling</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractUse {{of steel}} piles in general has {{continuously}} {{increased in the}} Nordic countries {{as well as in}} the harbour structures of the Baltics and Western Europe. The main reasons are the innovative, easy-to-handle but rigid and durable pile joints, application of steel material technology and higher steel strength. The importance of the resistance and stiffness of mechanical joints of slender steel piles is accentuated in soft soil conditions. The wide product range and different installation methods enable versatile applications from light- weight to heavily loaded structures in all soil conditions. In harbour structures bending resistance of the pile is often the dimensioning factor. The latest innovations are the highly rigid retaining wall structure, the RD pile wall installed by drilling in all possible soil conditions and steel piles serving as energy piles that exploit renewable ground source energy both for heating and cooling. There has been wide co-operation in Finland between steel pile manufacturers, contractors, designers, manufacturers of <b>piling</b> <b>equipment,</b> researchers and authorities in developing steel pile technology for almost thirty years...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss through the main aspects and {{principles}} of successful platform-based product family development and management. For example car industry and car manufacturers take advantage of platform-based product families while solving the conflict of balancing between wide product variety and operational efficiency. This is a common dilemma also in some other manufacturing companies operating on versatile markets; how to serve individual customer needs with minimum development, manufacturing and service efforts? Product families are in this paper seen as an answer. Thus, the aim of this paper is to promote the adoption of often complex and risky product family development especially in technology and manufacturing focused companies. To be able to minimize risks and maximize the advantages companies need to understand the dynamics of the product family thinking presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: After a literature survey the main aspects and principles of the product family thinking are illustrated through a case example from a company designing and manufacturing hydraulic <b>piling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Findings: The case study shows that as universal practices are missing the “best practice” in product family development is always dependent on the nature of the company and its products. It is also evident that gaining long-term competitive advantage through product family thinking will not happen without continuous learning and investments in both time and resources. Originality/value: This paper presents the main aspects and principles of the platform-based product family thinking in a systematic and hierarchical manner by connecting together platforming, architecture design, strategic aspects and management perspectives. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{made for}} the purpose of completing the at hand dissertation is directed towards the second stage of the construction of a near shore jetty, namely the positioning and installation of the inclined piles that will support the whole structure. A number of printed books, articles in journals and reliable internet sources were assessed prior to conducting the methodology analysis for the dissertation. As the literature research grew, it became more and more clear that experts on the field were focusing their studies on the different types of piles, the various items of <b>piling</b> <b>equipment</b> and later the possible installation methods of general application. Moreover, noise control in construction sites is nowadays a matter of increasing importance due to the global turn towards the environmental safety and {{the health and safety of}} the people. Whereas most would find the subject complete from a Civil Engineer point of view, a Surveyor would object; an essential aspect of the installation process is to come up with a way to accurately position the piling frame that will guide the pile to the correct position. The greater the magnitude of the project and the more piling work at sea, the greater the challenge. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of the project in positional tolerances, one would consider a new model of piling frame, one with the element of flexibility in micro – movements, rather than trying to achieve the aforementioned accuracy by positioning the marine barge. In that sense, a need arose for trying to explain the positioning scheme of a piling frame with GPS technology, as well as to explain the mechanics of this new piling frame model, in order to bring a steel pile to the correct place and orientation. The research initiated in the context of fulfilling the requirements for the Master of Science degree of “MSc Hydrography” programme at Plymouth University, Devon, UK. The proposal is an essential part of the “Vassilikos Jetty Marine Works” project that took place in Vassilikos area, Cyprus and was completed under the efforts of the engineers and land/ marine crew of ARCHIMEDES S.

40|$|An {{irradiation}} facility, more of {{a capsule}} than a loop, has been developed to test rod type fuel elements under pressurized boiling water conditions. An arrangement of small discs inside the in-pile pressure vessel maintain surface boiling conditions along the fuel rod and the nuclear heat is transported to the surrounding wall of the vessel.

A complete experimental procedure, i. e., hammering system, measurements, and test procedures, has been developed to test on centrifuge lateral impact on piles. In {{the first part of the}} paper following the test procedure, {{the experimental}} set-up is detailed from the soil preparation and <b>piles</b> <b>equipment</b> to the horizontal hammering or impact system. Innovative parts of the system such as the impact system and its monitoring are described.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} general {{framework}} {{to study and}} improve {{the effectiveness of a}} production system with respect to its expected life-cycle cost rate. The model that we propose considers that the system is protected against demand fluctuations and failure occurrence with elements like stock <b>piles,</b> line and <b>equipment</b> redundancy, and the use of alternative production methods. These design elements allow us to keep or minimize the effect of equipment downtime on the nominal throughput, while palliative measures are taken. The system is also subjected to an aging process which depends on the frequency and quality of preventive actions. Decisions are difficult because there exist discontinu-ities in direct and downtime costs and there is a limited budget.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a procedure to determine resistance factors for newly developed pile products through an example of the rotational intrusion steel pile (RI pile). RI pile is a newly developed steel pile product which has the vane type tip structure to resist reliably against vertical load and to intrude easily by rotating itself. Moreover, the RI pile is environment-friendly, i. e. reduce waste soil and less construction noise, because of the rotating intrusion method. The construction can be done with the small <b>pile</b> driving <b>equipment</b> and the <b>pile</b> can be reliably founded into the bearing ground by monitoring and controlling the torque value during installation. For these reasons, the RI-pile is expected to have the superior bearing capacity against vertical loads. However, the RI-pile has not been adopted in many construction projects yet because the current design method requires applying the same safety factor neglecting the level of the uncertainty of each pile type. In this study, 64 loading test data are gathered to quantify the model error of the RI-pile assisted by Public Works Research Institute (PWRI). Then, Reliability analysis is conducted based on our proposed reliability analysis scheme (GRASP) to specify the reliability level of the current design. Furthermore, the partial factor updating procedure according to the newly developed the RI pile is formulated based on the design value method. From the results, the partial factor is determined and applied to compare the RI steel pile to the traditional piles, i. e. cast in pile and driven steel pile. The difference in construction cost among the three piles has become less, and the RI pile is less expensive when the rate of the pile tip resistance is high...|$|R

Rapidly. ” Eventually, the engineers’ plan saves the day, and the astronauts make it home. State and federal agency biologists generally do not face life-or-death decisions of this magnitude, but many do face day-to-day decisions that share traits with the Apollo 13 crisis. Biologists and managers have deadlines, uncertainty, and a limited tool set. The critical need, and the missing part of the analogy, is the team of engineers—trained problem solvers who are intimately familiar with the decision environment and the tools available to create a solution. Structured decision making (SDM) is a formal process that problem solvers can use to document and weigh alternative management scenarios {{in terms of their}} respective benefits, costs, and likelihood of success or failure (Clemen 1996). SDM serves as a vital complement to Adaptive Resource Management (ARM), which—through an iterative cycle of planning, doing, monitoring, and evaluating— provides a learning-based framework for making conservation decisions (Knutson et al. 2010, Williams et al. 2007). Although natural resource professionals are increasingly relying on SDM and ARM to make decisions about complex management situations, university programs in wildlife management rarely teach undergraduate or graduate students about decision-making strategies (Boyles et al. 2008). We believe that university and college faculty must respond to the need for student training in ARM. Here, we describe ways that existing undergraduate and graduate curricula can be modified to produce graduates who are ready to tackle today’s complex wildlife management problems...|$|R

The bored <b>piles</b> foundation supports <b>equipment</b> of the power plant consisting of the gas turbine, the steam turbine and the generator. The piling solution was adopted for the following reasons: i) the insufficient capacity of the soil to support great stresses over it; ii) high requirements of slab settlements and bearing capacity with regard to the main equipment in power plant.). For settlement calculation five methods were employed, such as Bowles [1] and Schmertmann methods [2, 3], the method described in EN 1997 - 2 [4 – 6] and NEN 6743 [7], and finite element method applied in Plaxis 3 D Foundation package. The results obtained by applying these methods where compared with experimental results on construction site. The experiment results were acquired from static load test of one test pile and four reaction piles. Piled foundation was evaluated through immediate settlement analysis and included analysis of the soil data from cone and dynamic penetration tests, boreholes and laboratory tests. Soil properties were estimated from site investigation of the Elektrenai power plant and soil exploration program according to Lithuanian standards. Pile settlement analysis showed that settlement value was 13. 5 mm (pile toe settlement), and settlement value of elastic deformation of pile from vertical compressive loads was 2. 1 mm, for the most conservative situation. For such structure, foundation settlement should not exceed 16 mm.
