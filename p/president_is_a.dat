5|$|The Federal Council {{constitutes}} the federal government, directs the federal administration {{and serves as}} collective Head of State. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises oversight over the Council. The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> primus inter pares with no additional powers, and remains {{the head of a}} department within the administration.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{government}} systems in European politics: in a presidential system, the president {{is the head of}} state and the head of government; in a semi-presidential system, the president and the prime minister share a number of competences; finally, in a parliamentary republic, the <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> ceremonial figurehead who has few political competences. As with the definition of constitutional monarchies, sometimes the president does have non-ceremonial competences, but does not use them by constitutional convention; this is the case in Austria, for instance.|$|E

[...] He observed, [...] "A veteran of four presidential campaigns, Taibbi knows how the game works. Or at least he knew until Trump came."

[...] San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign". The New York Times criticized the work for its lack of moderation. The Daily Beast characterized it as [...] "raucous, trenchant, knee-slapping". Adelaide Review said it was, [...] "one of the finest exponents of polemic journalism". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette criticized the book for not delving deeply into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

[...] LaGambina concluded, [...] "Insane Clown President might not be the book he intended to write, but for anyone looking to get out of the maze we’ve stormed into blindly, Taibbi's dispatches might prove to be a good map." [...] San Francisco Chronicle book reviewer John Diaz said the work contained, [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign." [...] Diaz wrote that Insane Clown President, [...] "evokes a distinct aura of the gunslinging, spare-no-niceties outsider approach that Hunter S. Thompson brought to the 1972 Nixon-McGovern campaign in his seminal work, 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.'" [...] Diaz concluded, [...] "Insane Clown <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> breezy read and will bring knowing chuckles among liberals who will savor its wickedly clever shots at all the jesters in the clown car who constituted the Republican primary field." ...|$|E
500|$|On the [...] "EC" [...] set {{the next}} morning a {{reluctant}} Wendy joins a gray side-burned Cartman who promises he will stick to school-related questions and go easy on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm doing the best I can!" ...|$|E
