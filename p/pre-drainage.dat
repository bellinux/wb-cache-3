Five vegetation zones, separated by distinct ecotones, included freshwater swamp forest, freshwater marsh, and dwarf, transitional and fringing mangrove forest. Vegetation composition, soil depth and organic matter content, porewater salinity and the contemporary mollusk community were determined at 226 sites to establish the salinity preferences of the mollusk fauna. Calibration models allowed accurate inference of salinity and vegetation type from fossil mollusk assemblages in chronologically calibrated sediments. Most sediments were shallow (20 – 130 cm) permitting coarse-scale temporal inferences for three zones: an upper peat layer (zone 1) representing the last 30 – 70 years, a mixed peat-marl layer (zone 2) representing the previous ca. 150 – 250 years and a basal section (zone 3) of ranging from 310 to 2990 YBP. Modern peat accretion rates averaged 3. 1 mm yr) 1 while subsurface marl accreted more slowly at 0. 8 mm yr) 1. Salinity and vegetation type for zone 1 show a steep gradient with freshwater communities being confined west of a north–south drainage canal constructed in 1960. Inferences for zone 2 (<b>pre-drainage)</b> suggest that freshwater marshes and associated forest units covered 90 % of the area, with mangrove forests only present along the peripheral coastline.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is to recover {{historical}} (<b>pre-drainage)</b> wading bird rookeries and reverse marked decreases in wading bird nesting success in Everglades National Park. To assess efforts to restore wading birds, a trophic hypothesis was developed that proposes seasonal concentrations of small-fish and crustaceans (i. e., wading bird prey) were a key factor to historical wading bird success. Drainage of the Everglades has diminished these seasonal concentrations, leading {{to a decline in}} wading bird nesting and displacing them from their historical nesting locations. The trophic hypothesis predicts that restoring historical hydrological patterns to <b>pre-drainage</b> conditions will recover the timing and location of seasonally concentrated prey, ultimately restoring wading bird nesting and foraging to the southern Everglades. We identified a set of indicators using small-fish and crustaceans that can be predicted from hydrological targets and used to assess management success in regaining suitable wading bird foraging habitat. Small-fish and crustaceans are key components of the Everglades food web and are sensitive to hydrological management, track hydrological history with little time lag, and can be studied at the landscape scale. The seasonal hydrological variation of the Everglades that creates prey concentrations presents a challenge to interpreting monitoring data. To account for the variable hydrology of the Everglades in our assessment, we developed dynamic hydrological targets that respond to changes in prevailing regional rainfall. We also derived statistical relationships between density and hydrological drivers for species representing four different life-history responses to drought. Finally, we use these statistical relationships and hydrological targets to set restoration targets for prey density. We also describe a report-card methodology to communicate the results of model-based assessments for communication to a broad audience...|$|E

This study aims to investigate the effects of artificial drainage on soil physico-chemical properties and to determine whether the observed plant decline is directly related to artificial drainage. Results show groundwater levels have fallen both with a decline in annual rainfall and the implementation of artificial drainage; facilitating the leaching of salts. Comparison with 1950 (<b>pre-drainage)</b> data confirms that a change in soil physico-chemical properties has occurred. The combination of high pH, extreme salinity and strong sodicity has led to soils that are both chemically hostile and structurally unstable; hence, plant growth is affected. Soil type and mineralogy were found to vary both across and within study sites; the un-drained smectite dominant soils exhibit the most hostile chemical conditions for plant growth. Nevertheless, the mineralogy of the soil governs the level of structural degradation when the soils are sodic, such that the illite/kaolinite-dominant soils are particularly degraded, resulting in the highly compacted form observed.

This paper describes work carried out to review longwall productivity and gas management at one European mine extracting multiple seams 900 - 1000 metres below the surface. The longwall panel {{that is the subject}} of this paper is extracting a 215 metre wide face in the 1. 5 metre thick B seam, which is extracted prior to the main 3. 0 metre thick A seam to assist with degassing. Gateroads developed to access the B seam longwall are single entry, developed using road headers and supported with steel arches. Additional timber cog support is installed in an attempt to reduce roadway closure due to abutment loading. Due in part to statutory limits on gas concentration and air velocity, longwall production at this mine is presently restricted to an average rate of approximately 700 t/d. Mine management were reluctant to consider significant mine design changes, such as two heading gateroads, therefore the investigation focused on determining the extent to which ventilation and gas emission impacted on longwall production performance and recommending actions to improve ventilation and gas management to support increased longwall production.

Current system-scale restoration efforts aim to restore natural hydrologic regimes to reestablish <b>pre-drainage</b> ecosystem functioning through increased water availability, quality and timing. Aquatic transport of carbon in this ecosystem, primarily as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plays {{a critical role in}} biogeochemical cycling and food-web dynamics, and will be affected both by water management policies and climate change. To better understand DOC dynamics in South Florida estuaries and how hydrology, climate and water management may affect them, 14 years of monthly data collected in the Shark River estuary were used to examine DOC flux dynamics in a broader environmental context. Multivariate statistical methods were applied to long-term datasets for hydrology, water quality and climate to untangle the interconnected environmental drivers that control DOC export at monthly and annual scales. DOC fluxes were determined to be primarily controlled by hydrology but also by seasonality and long-term climate patterns and episodic weather events. A four-component model (salinity, rainfall, inflow, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) capable of predicting DOC fluxes (R 2 = 0. 84, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, n = 155) was established and applied to potential climate change scenarios for the Everglades to assess DOC flux response to climate and restoration variables.

40|$|Status {{and history}} of the Ridge-Slough Mosaic The Florida Everglades is a large {{subtropical}} wetland with diverse hydrologic, edaphic, and vegetative characteristics. Historically, a significant portion of this system was a slow moving river originating from the Kissimmee River floodplain, flowing into the vast but shallow Lake Okeechobee, and draining south-southwest over extensive peatlands into Florida Bay (McVoy 2011). Human-induced alterations to the hydrologic regime, including reduction, stabilization, and impoundment of water flow through diversion and compartmentalization of water via canals and levees have degraded <b>pre-drainage</b> vegetation patterns and microtopographic structure (Davis and Ogden 1994, Ogden 2005, McVoy 2011). The Everglades peatland emerged 5, 000 years ago with the stabilization of sea level at approximately current elevations (Loveless 1959, Gleason and Stone 1994). This, combined with subtropical rainfalls, allowed a vast mass of water to slowly flow over a limestone bedrock platform 160 km long and 50 km wide at a near uniform descent totaling about 6 m, ultimately reaching Florida Bay (Stephens 1956, Gleason and Stone 1994, McVoy 2011). Vegetation quickly colonized the area, and peat, in the absence of adequate respiration, accumulated on the limestone bedrock to a depth of 3 - 3. 7 m (Gleason and Stone 1994, McVoy et al. 2011). The “River of Grass” referenced by Douglas (1947) alludes to the dually intertwined processes of the historic riverine nature of the Everglades and the vast sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) communities that have dominated the landscape for about the last 1, 000 years (Bernhardt and Willard 2009) ...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{depth of}} cover, control of gas emissions {{and prevention of}} gas outbursts has become a more and more important issue in mine design and mine operation. Long term experience in these fields exists, especially in Australia, Germany, China, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Based on local conditions including geology, market conditions and mining regulations, different approaches have been developed in these countries. Changes in these parameters have however exposed the limitations of traditional solutions. While the Australian approach {{is based on the}} premise that gas content will be reduced below specific threshold values ahead of mining, opportunities of <b>pre-drainage</b> are limited in low permeability coal such as that encountered e. g. in Germany and China. In the case of multi seam mining, a highly effective increase in permeability can however be achieved through pressure relief by unconventional mining sequences. Although practiced at several mines in Europe and Asia, realising this in open market conditions requires a high quality of planning in regard to mine layout, mine development and gas drainage as well as the appropriate geotechnical assessments. A key factor is access and extraction of the first seam at or near to virgin gas contents. Mining at high gas contents by applying local exploration and pressure relief drilling has been practiced in a successful and safe way in several European mines. This has to be connected with a proper management system and safety system, allowing efficient reactions to identified hazards. Apart from international experience and development, the paper will also discuss current and future approaches of technology transfer. Merging the future development in gas drainage with unconventional approaches is therefore an opportunity for accessing deep and difficult deposits...|$|E
40|$|During the 1960 s, water {{management}} practices {{resulted in the}} conversion of the wetlands that fringe northeastern Florida Bay (USA) from freshwater/oligohaline herbaceous marshes to dwarf red mangrove forests. Coincident with this conversion were several ecological changes to Florida Bay’s fauna, including reductions in the abundances of top trophic-level consumers: piscivorous fishes, alligators, crocodiles, and wading birds. Because these taxa rely on a common forage base of small demersal fishes, food stress has been implicated as playing a role in their respective declines. In the present study, we monitored the demersal fishes seasonally at six sites over an 8 -year time period. During monitoring, extremely high rainfall conditions occurred over a 3. 5 -year period leading to salinity regimes that can be viewed as “windows” to the area’s natural past and future restored states. In this paper, we: (1) examine the changes in fish communities over the 8 -year study period and relate them to measured changes in salinity; (2) make comparisons among marine, brackish and freshwater demersal fish communities in terms of species composition, density, and biomass; and (3) discuss several implications of our findings in light of the intended and unintended {{water management}} changes that are planned or underway as part of Everglades restoration. Results suggest the reduction in freshwater flow to Florida Bay over the last several decades has reduced demersal fish populations, and thus prey availability for apex consumers in the coastal wetlands compared to the <b>pre-drainage</b> inferred standard. Furthermore, greater discharge of freshwater toward Florida Bay may result in the re-establishment of pre- 1960 s fauna, including a more robust demersal-fish community that should prompt increases in populations of several important predatory species...|$|E
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{structural dynamics}} of drained peatland forests {{may result in}} a great variation in various wood and fi ber properties. We examined variation in fi ber and pulp properties i) among stands, ii) among trees within stands, and iii) within trees in young stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The stands, selected to cover a maximal range of the potential variation, were all at a stage of development where the fi rst commercial thinnings would be feasible. Differences in the processability of the thinning removals were small. In similar kraft cooking conditions, a 5 -unit variation in the kappa number of unbleached pulp was observed among the stands. Stand origin had no effect on pulp bleaching. The wood formed prior to drainage had a higher density, shorter fi bers, was slightly slower delignifi ed by cooking, and its yield was slightly lower than that of post-drainage wood. These properties, except for high density, are typical for juvenile wood in general, and at stand level they did not correlate with the proportion of <b>pre-drainage</b> wood. When the variation in fi ber and pulp properties was broken down into its components, most of it was derived from tree-level in all the cases. On average, the fi ber and pulp properties did not differ from those observed for fi rst-thinning pulpwood from upland sites. Consequently, peatland-grown pulpwood may be mixed with other pulpwood in industrial processes. It would probably be best suited as the raw material for pulps with high bonding requirements, e. g. in the top ply of multi-ply board grades or in some specialty grades...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pleural {{effusion}} is {{a common}} clinical problem that can complicate many medical conditions. Breathlessness {{is the most common}} symptom of pleural effusion of any cause and the most common reason for pleural drainage. However, improvement in breathlessness following drainage of an effusion is variable; some patients experience either no benefit or a worsening of their breathlessness. The physiological mechanisms underlying breathlessness in patients with a pleural effusion are unclear and likely to be multifactorial with patient-related and effusion-related factors contributing. A comprehensive study of the physiological and symptom responses to drainage of pleural effusions may provide a clearer understanding of these mechanisms, and may identify predictors of benefit from drainage. The ability to identify those patients whose breathlessness will (or will not) improve after pleural fluid drainage can help avoid unnecessary pleural drainage procedures, their associated morbidities and costs. The PLeural Effusion And Symptom Evaluation (PLEASE) study is a prospective study to comprehensively evaluate factors contributing to pleural effusion-related breathlessness. Methods and analysis: The PLEASE study is a single-centre prospective study of 150 patients with symptomatic pleural effusions that require therapeutic drainage. The study aims to identify key factors that underlie breathlessness in patients with pleural effusions and develop predictors of improvement in breathlessness following effusion drainage. Participants will undergo evaluation pre-effusion and post-effusion drainage to assess their level of breathlessness at rest and during exercise, respiratory and other physiological responses as well as respiratory muscle mechanics. <b>Pre-drainage</b> and post-drainage parameters will be collected and compared to identify the key factors and mechanisms that correlate with improvement in breathlessness.

40|$|Land cover {{changes can}} impact the climate by {{influencing}} the surface {{energy and water}} balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over {{the second half of}} 20 th century. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18 -year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on <b>pre-drainage</b> (1920 s) and post-drainage (2000 s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0. 43 K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2 m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0. 1 K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change...|$|E
40|$|As {{anorexia}} {{is common}} in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) particularly in diabetic patients, we conducted this study to investigate gastric motility {{and the effect of}} 2 L of intraperitoneal dialysate in diabetic (DM) and non-diabetic (NDM) CAPD patients. A standard test meal labeled with technetium- 99 m was given after an overnight fast to 11 DM and 10 asymptomatic NDM CAPD patients (matched for age and sex) on two occasions, each 1 week apart, with an empty (postdrainage) and 2 L dialysate- filled (<b>pre-drainage)</b> peritoneal cavity. Serial anterior images of the abdomen were taken in a standard manner for up to 2 h. The percentage of radioactivity retained at the end of 2 h (% 2 h), half emptying time (ET(1 / 4)), and emptying rate (ER) were determined. These three parameters were also obtained from six normal individuals matched for age and sex. The mean age was 53. 9 for NDM and 54 for DM patients; the mean dialysis duration was 37. 9 and 22. 3 months, respectively. The mean age in the control group was 49. 5. Comparing the DM and NDM groups individually and with the control group, there were no statistical differences in the three gastric emptying parameters, but the latter were slightly more often abnormal in DM (8) than in NDM (6) patients. There was also {{a significant difference in the}} fractional changes of all three parameters pre- and postdrainage in the DM group, but not in the NDM group. We conclude that gastric emptying is impaired in the presence of peritoneal dialysate in DM but not in NDM patients. These findings may explain the higher prevalence of anorexia among DM CAPD patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Successfully rehabilitating drained {{wetlands}} through hydrologic restoration {{is dependent}} on defining restoration targets, {{a process that is}} informed by <b>pre-drainage</b> conditions, as well as understanding linkages between hydrology and ecosystem structure. Paleoecological records can inform restoration goals by revealing long-term patterns of change, but are dependent on preservation of biomarkers that provide meaningful interpretations of environmental change. In the Florida Everglades, paleohydrological hind-casting could improve restoration forecasting, but frequent drying of marsh soils leads to poor preservation of many biomarkers. To determine the effectiveness of employing siliceous subfossils in paleohydrological reconstructions, we examined diatoms, plant and sponge silico-sclerids from three soil cores in the central Everglades marshes. Subfossil quality varied among cores, but the abundance of recognizable specimens was sufficient to infer 1, 000 – 3, 000 years of hydrologic change at decadal to centennial resolution. Phytolith morphotypes were linked to key marsh plant species to indirectly measure fluctuations in water depth. A modern dataset was used to derive diatom-based inferences of water depth and hydroperiod (R 2 = 0. 63, 0. 47; RMSE = 14 cm, 120 days, respectively). Changes in subfossil quality and abundances at centennial time-scales were associated with mid-Holocene climate events including the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period, while decadal-scale fluctuations in assemblage structure during the twentieth century suggested co-regulation of hydrology by cyclical climate drivers (particularly the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) and water management changes. The successful reconstructions based on siliceous subfossils shown here at a coarse temporal scale (i. e., decadal to centennial) advocate for their application in more highly resolved (i. e., subdecadal) records, which should improve the ability of water managers to target the quantity and variability of water flows appropriate for hydrologic restoration...|$|E
