40|$|In {{the recent}} years sweet sorghum is {{emerging}} as an important feedstock for bioethanol production. It was observed that total soluble sugar yield (TSSY) increases with time in the post-anthesis phase depending {{on the length of}} crop cycle. The qualitative and quantitative sugar loss of up to 50 % or more occurs due to delay in harvest during post-physiological maturity stage depending on the genotype, weather and soil conditions, and the time lag between harvest and crushing of the stalks. Hence, a desk study was conducted to identify suitable cultivars and/or explore the use of chemicals that sustain sugars in the post-harvest phase. In case of delayed harvest beyond physiological maturity stage, growing of cultivars such as SPSSV 30, ICSV 25275, ICSV 25280 and SPV 422 that sustain sugar yield at post-physiological maturity, is recommended. As there are no published reports on sweet sorghum, the literature from sugarcane and wine industries were analyzed and inferences drawn from these industries suggest the evaluation of chemicals like sodium benzoate, <b>potassium</b> metabisulphate, sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> ammonia, SO 2, vanillin and acetic acid (vinegar) which may arrest the post-harvest deterioration of sweet sorghum stalks before juice extraction...|$|R

40|$|Several {{microbial}} species {{associated with}} wine were challenged against increasing concentrations of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC). The concentration inducing complete cell death upon addition to red wine {{was regarded as}} the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In dry red wines with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, the inactivation depended on the initial cell concentration. For an initial inoculum of 500 CFU/ml, the MIC of the yeasts species Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia guilliermondii was 100 mg/l. The most sensitive strains belong to Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygoascus hellenicus and Lachancea thermotolerans, with MIC of 25 mg/l DMDC. For inoculation rates of about 106 CFU/ml, the maximum dose of DMDC legally authorised (200 mg/l) was not effective against the most resistant species.

The range of values for properties of sweet potato flour were: moisture (8. 06 – 12. 86 ± 1. 13 %), starch (55. 76 – 83. 65 ± 6. 82 %), amylose (10. 06 – 21. 26 ± 3. 92 %), total sugar (22. 39 – 125. 46 ± 24. 68 μg/mg), water absorption capacity (140 – 280 ± 26), water solubility (6. 89 – 26. 18 ± 3. 80), swelling power (1. 66 – 5. 00 ± 0. 50), peak viscosity (24. 50 – 260. 92 ± 52. 61 RVU), trough (7. 08 – 145. 83 ± 34. 48 RVU), breakdown viscosity (11. 00 – 125. 33 RVU), final viscosity (10. 21 – 225. 50 ± 60. 55 RVU), setback viscosity (3. 04 – 92. 21 RVU), peak time (6. 07 – 9. 06 min) and pasting temperature (69. 8 – 81. 3 °C). Variety had a significant (P 0. 05) affect moisture, fat and lightness (L*). Drying method did not significantly (P > 0. 05) affect fiber and L*. The interactive effect of variety, pretreatment and drying method had a significant (P < 0. 001) effect on all the attributes except fat and fiber. Total sugar correlated significantly (P < 0. 01) with water solubility (r = 0. 88) of the flour samples. Variety was a dominant factor influencing attributes of sweet potato flour and so should be targeted at specific end uses...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential use of lacticin 3147 to control growth of wine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) aiming to develop new approaches for reducing the content of sulphites in wine. Lacticin 3147, <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and eucalyptus extract interactions were also evaluated. Inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin demonstrated to be strain-dependent and the highest antimicrobial effect was established at the exponential growth phase. Low lacticin 3147 IC 50 values (10. 46 - 57. 97 UA/mL) were measured {{for most of the}} strains, except for Lactobacillus casei CIAL- 51 which were remarkably resistant (IC 50 = 141. 70 UA/mL); Oenococcus oeni CIAL- 117 were the most sensitive strain (IC 50 = 10. 46 UA/mL). A synergistic effect of either lacticin 3147 or eucalyptus extract in combination with metabisulphite in inhibiting LAB growth was measured. Addition of lacticin 3147 to growing cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum CIAL- 92 caused effective cell lysis, decrease of cell viability and extensive membrane damage, differing from the effects detected after addition of eucalyptus extract. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the inhibitory activity of this bacteriocin against oenological LAB and its potential role in the wine industry. The potential of eucalyptus extract as antimicrobial agent in winemaking is also highlighted. A combination of these two antimicrobials with metabisulphite could represent a promising approach to preserve LAB spoilage in wine and, consequently, eliminate or reduce the addition of SO 2. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Laboratory mashing {{experiments}} {{were used to}} investigate and optimise protocols for mashing with unmalted sorghum using a novel low-temperature (Tmax = 78 °C) enzyme blend and mash schedule. Results are compared with equivalent data for a traditional high-temperature mash schedule (Tmax = 95 °C). An experimental design approach was used to model wort quality (Extract, FAN content, filtration rate, fermentable sugars contents, colour and turbidity) produced by each mash schedule across a full factorial design space. The factors varied were 1. Mash-in pH (5. 5 ± 0. 25) 2. Calcium chloride addition (2 g/kg ± 1) 3. <b>Potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (KMS) addition (1 g/kg ± 1) and 4. The amount of enzyme blend added to each system (recommended dosage ± 50 %). Wort quality was particularly sensitive to mash-in pH with best results achieved close to pH 5. 5 (hence selected as the design centre point). At pH values below 5. 5 wort extract decreased with either schedule, whereas the impacts of elevated pH at mash-in were slightly higher wort FAN levels, but increased wort turbidity and colour and reduced filterability of the laboratory wort. The novel low temperature mash schedule was able to produce wort of comparable quality with that from the high-temperature schedule. Design space models for the high- and low-temperature mash systems were used to suggest optimal conditions for each varied factor, {{with the objective of}} maximising wort extract and FAN, whilst minimising enzyme addition rates (hence cost). Optimised extracts of 10. 6 and 10. 8 °P were achieved for the low and high-temperature mash systems, with FAN levels of 60 and 57. 2 mg/L respectively. Optimal conditions required a mash-in pH of 5. 75 and around 2 g/kg KMS in each case. The high-temperature system required around 3 g/kg CaCl 2 addition for optimal performance whereas the low-temperature mash performed well with just 1 g/kg added CaCl 2. Use of the novel low-temperature mash schedule should facilitate substantial energy savings in the brewery, because it operates at lower maximum temperatures for a shorter overall process time and also because the mash schedule features only increases in process temperatures with time. This saves on the energy required to cool the mash in the traditional process from 95 °C (for starch gelatinisation) to the saccharification enzyme stand (60 °C) ...|$|E
40|$|Although sorghum malt is {{relatively}} rich in {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN), the 150 mg FAN/L threshold recommended for brewing is difficult to obtain. The vitreous nature of the sorghum endosperm hinders proteolysis during brewing. Hence, exogenous proteolytic enzymes are often required to increase hydrolysis of sorghum malt protein to produce sufficient FAN {{in order to support}} rapid yeast growth during fermentation. Ten exogenous proteases were examined for their production of FAN in sorghum malt mashing. Mashing was done at 550 C for 45 minutes. Levels of FAN, as determined by the ninhydrin method, showed great variation among the proteolytic enzymes, ranging from 96 in control to 182 mg/ 100 g malt with possibly of most effective proteolytic enzyme. The variation in FAN level was possibly due to different optimal mashing conditions of exogenous proteases used and perhaps due to low ratios of exopeptidase/endopeptidase in the enzyme preparations. Low temperature (400 C) and long duration mashing for (7 hours) gave good FAN production during mashing to a total of 113 and 138 mg/ 100 g malt in control and the treatment with exogenous proteolytic enzyme Flavourzyme plus malt, respectively. The exogenous enzyme (Flavourzyme) plus <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (PMB) increased FAN production during mashing in the ratio of 2 to 1 in a treatment where PMB was added compared to one without. Similarly, hot wort extract (HWE) increased by 8 % during mashing with exogenous enzyme plus PMB compared to one without PMB, respectively. PMB was involved in destabilizing the disulphide bonds in the sorghum protein polypeptide chains allowing proteolytic enzymes better accessibility to proteins. The increase in HWE was possibly due to the starch being freed from the sorghum protein matrix. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed some oligomeric and polymeric kafirins after mashing. With transmission electron microcopy (TEM), protein bodies of varying sizes with partially degraded peripheral edges and some holes were seen after mashing. SDS-PAGE and TEM results suggest insufficient proteolysis. High protein digestibility sorghum’s potential for brewing was examined with reference to FAN production. Although during mashing FAN increased by approx. 82 and 115 % for unmalted normal and high digestibility sorghums, respectively, the 150 mg FAN/L threshold, recommended for brewing was not achieved. FAN production to levels above 150 mg/L may only be realized if normal sorghum malt or high protein digestibility sorghum malt is mashed with exogenous enzymes containing sufficient exopeptidases coupled with appropriate mashing conditions.

40|$|Sour rot is {{characterized}} by increased volatile acidity (VA) in ripe grapes. VA is associated with spoilage organisms and wineries may reject grape crops based on their concentration of acetic acid. Our research associated Hanseniaspora uvarum, Gluconobacter oxydans, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Gluconobacter cerinus and Acetobacter malorum with sour rotted grapes in the Niagara Peninsula, designated viticultural area, Ontario, Canada, and the pathogenicity of these organisms was confirmed by laboratory assays. Only G. oxydans was shown to penetrate around the site of pedicel attachment to the grape. The yeasts required further wounding. Candida zemplinina was also associated with the sour rot microbial community. This species showed variable pathogenicity by strain and most strains were not highly pathogenic. C. zemplinina gained dominance in the microbial population of grapes only after sour rot symptoms were observed, indicating a succession which was studied in laboratory assays. There was a correlation between temperature, moisture, and berry ripeness and the development of sour rot when conditions were monitored in a Vitis vinifera cv. Riesling vineyard over four years, and this was confirmed in laboratory assays. Disease management options are limited since sour rot is caused by a complex of yeasts and bacteria, with symptoms developing just as grapes approach maturity. Post-veraison treatments for sour rot were investigated. Wineries routinely add <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (KMS) to the surface of fruit in bins and to grape juice to kill spoilage organisms. Replicated field trials were conducted in V. vinifera cv. Riesling in 2010 and 2011 to determine the efficacy of KMS at different concentrations and pre-harvest timings as a fruiting-zone spray. Potassium bicarbonate (Milstop) was also evaluated for its efficacy against sour rot. Plots were rated for incidence and severity of sour rot and VA (g acetic acid/L juice). KMS treatments at concentrations above 5 kg/ 1000 L and Milstop sprayed at the label concentration of 5. 6 kg/ 1000 L were able to reduce the severity of sour rot compared to untreated control plots which had a severity above 50 % (2011). KMS was able to reduce VA to below the winery rejection threshold of 0. 24 g acetic acid/L when sour rot severity reached 12 % in untreated plots (2010). When tested in the laboratory in disk diffusion assays conducted on yeast peptone dextrose agar, KMS at a concentration of 10 g/L had the greatest efficacy against G. oxydans and H. uvarum. Grape incubation assays showed the potential of KMS acidified with tartaric acid to reduce sour rot symptoms. Acidification did not show as much potential in field trials, calling for further research...|$|E
40|$|The endemic New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} species. Although this mussel is extensively cultivated in New Zealand, {{very little is}} known about its early larval behaviour. After a brief planktonic stage, the young mussels settle onto specific substrates before undergoing metamorphosis into their adult form. However, the timing of this settlement, and preference for substrata is poorly understood. Chemical stimuli of biological origin that modulate neuronal signalling are thought to mediate this process. Exposure of marine invertebrate larvae to neurotransmitters, their precursors or similar molecules that have the ability to induce larval settlement, have been used in numerous studies to give important insights into the biochemical mechanisms underlying settlement behaviour. In the present study, 16 pharmacologically active compounds were assessed for their effectiveness at inducing larval settlement in P. canaliculus. In the laboratory, mussel larvae were exposed to the chemicals for 48 hours. Among the chemicals tested, potassium chloride, acetylcholine, atropine, epinephrine, L-DOPA, hydrogen peroxide and cyclic adenosine monophosphate induced larvae to settle with minimal acute toxic effects. Exposure of larvae to <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite,</b> sodium metabisulphite, ascorbic acid, caffeine, L-Tryptophan, L-Phenylalanine, and L-Tyrosine induced high levels of larval settlement but were acutely toxic to the mussels. Exposure of larvae to gamma aminobutyric acid had inhibitive effects on the settlement process. These results suggest that such compounds, many of which are present endogenously, are naturally involved in the biochemical signalling pathways of larval settlement. An exploratory meta-analysis was performed on larval settlement responses to various inductive compounds among nine marine invertebrate species, clustering the organisms by similarity of response. This investigation may have identified a novel approach to species clustering; illuminating currently concealed relationships based on the biochemical mechanisms involved in larval settlement behaviours. There also may be considerable applications for using these compounds in aquaculture to provide routine, inexpensive, and effective techniques for inducing synchronous settlement of hatchery-reared larvae. A major concern for the green-lipped mussel aquaculture industry in New Zealand is the limited supply of larvae or juvenile mussel spat for cultivation. To stock farms, the primary source of juvenile mussels comes from ‘beach cast spat’, attached to drifting macroalgae washed up on the foreshore. Considerable effort also is made to catch planktonic larvae on ‘spat catching ropes' suspended in the ocean. In the present study, weakly surface-bound acetylcholine was tested as a spat attractant to determine if the compound has commercial applications in areas other than larval settlement. Results showed no apparent capacity for acetylcholine to modulate chemotaxis in P. canaliculus. The effect of substrate surface charge on the ability of spat to attach showed that mussels have a significant preference for positively charged surfaces. Charged surfaces in the marine environment may modulate the colonisations of particular substrata, and may have commercial applications in promoting or inhibiting biofouling. Another problem suffered in the mussel aquaculture industry is poor retention of mussels on growing ropes. Acetylcholine showed no ability to enhance spat retention in a practical capacity, and neither did alterations of surface charge...|$|E
40|$|Kafirin is a prolamin protein {{unique to}} sorghum grain. To make kafirin viable for {{commercial}} development {{there needs to}} be an optimised extraction process. For this purpose insight is needed into how the process is affected by the extraction temperature, grain/solvent ratio, grain/solvent contact time, and various amounts and types of reducing agents and extraction aids. Such insights are currently unavailable. Significant insights into the extraction of kafirin were gained by performing extractions under various conditions to determine how extraction parameters affected the extraction process. Extraction temperature, grain/solvent ratio, grain/solvent contact time and various amounts and types of reducing agents/extraction aids were tested to determine the optimum extraction conditions. The extraction aids tested were acids (glacial acetic acid, citric acid and phosphoric acid) and metal bisulphite complexes (sodium metabisulphite and <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite)</b> were tested as reducing agents. Using a bench-scale extraction setup, the following important results were obtained. ? With regard to the commercialization of the process aqueous ethanol is the most promising solvent and was used throughout the study. ? The maximum amount of protein after extraction was roughly 45 g of protein for 1 000 g of grain out of a total kafirin content of roughly 62 g. This is an extraction efficiency of 70 - 75 % based on the total amount of kafirin available in the grain. Acids were found to have a limited role in the extraction process and can be excluded. ? The quantity of metalbisulphite complex used played a large role in the extraction process, reducing the yield by about 50 % when absent. The type of metalbisulphite used, however, did not play a role. ? The grain/solvent contact time was deemed {{to be the most important}} factor, with the highest yield occurring somewhere between 10 and 20 min. ? After 20 min the yield decreased due to increased solvent retention. The solvent retention and increased filtering time associated with the drop in yield were investigated. The weakened hydrogen bonding in the starchy endosperm made it possible for the starchy material to bond to other starchy particles or less likely the solvent, and was most likely the mechanism of solvent retention and thickening of the slurry. This increased solvent retention resulted in approximately 50 % of the total solvent being retained; which was discarded with spent grain. At 20 min the solvent retained was roughly 12 % of the total original solvent used. Further study is recommended with regard to: ? The mechanism of thickening to determine whether there are chemical or mechanical methods which would overcome the thickening and increased solvent retention ? The recovery, purification and subsequent reuse of ethanol ? Investigation into the mechanism that is responsible for the increased filtration time and whether this is related to the tannin-protein complex formation as the literature suggests ?

40|$|Free amino {{nitrogen}} (FAN) levels in sorghum grain brewing are characteristically low {{as a direct}} consequence of the very low levels of FAN in unmalted sorghum grain. During fermentation, FAN provides nutritional support to the yeast, enabling optimal yeast growth and efficient fermentation. Exogenous proteolytic enzymes are required to hydrolyse sorghum grain protein into FAN. Eight commercial proteolytic enzymes were studied in terms of their efficacy to produce FAN levels during mashing considered adequate (150 mg/L) to support optimal yeast functionality and their effect on extract levels. FAN as determined by the ninhydrin assay, ranged between 25 - 72 mg/ 100 g sorghum grist (representing 0 %- 185 % increase) when mashing was carried out at 55 °C over 45 mins with the 8 different enzymes. The proteolytic enzymes varied greatly in terms of their efficacy, possibly as a result of having different optimal operating conditions. It is also suggested that the proteolytic enzymes differed in terms of their classification and exopeptidase/endopeptidase ratio. In an attempt to further increase FAN levels, the effects of the reducing agent <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (KMS) and different mashing temperatures (50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C) were also studied. Three enzymes (Flavourzyme, Neutrase, Papain) were selected for this part of the study. The addition of KMS caused {{a significant increase in the}} FAN in mashing systems that utilized Flavourzyme (22 % when mashing at 55 °C) and Neutrase (14 % when mashing at 55 °C), but not with Papain. It is suggested that KMS reduced the stabilizing disulphide bonds present in the sorghum kafirin, thus making the kafirin more digestible. The KMS could have reduced the effectiveness of Papain because it is a sulphydryl protease which possesses stabilizing disulphide bonds which were reduced by the KMS. Flavourzyme and Papain were more active at 55 °C, while Neutrase displayed maximum activity at 50 °C. The effect of mashing at a low temperature (40 °C) over an extended time period (7 hr) on FAN was studied using Flavourzyme. Samples treated with Flavourzyme and KMS showed a five-fold increase in FAN, while those treated with Flavourzyme only showed a four-fold increase. It is proposed that the low temperature was able to suppress the rate at which disulphide bonds were formed in kafirin, therefore improving its digestibility. The lower temperature also retarded the enzyme denaturation rate, while the long time period allowed the enzyme more contact time with the substrate. Microstructure analysis of sorghum protein bodies using transmission electron microscopy and of sorghum endosperm using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the relative indigestibility of kafirin makes a significant contribution to the relatively low FAN levels. Although the action of the proteolytic enzyme and KMS on the sorghum endosperm protein matrix showed notable degradation, large fragments of undigested protein bodies were observed. This once again suggested that disulphide bond cross-linking played a major role in reducing the digestibility of sorghum protein. The addition of Flavourzyme to a complete mashing cycle was also found to result in a significant increase (9 %) in extract. The ncrease in extract is attributed to the increased availability of starch to amylase hydrolysis as a result of the degradation of the protein matrix which envelopes the starch granules. The addition of KMS to the sorghum grain mashing system and the utilisation of a low temperature protein rest are effective methods of improving FAN in sorghum grain brewing.

Diante disso, este trabalho teve como objetivos estudar o efeito do substrato e das condições de tratamento do fermento sobre as fermentações contaminadas com ambos os micro-organismos, leveduras S. cerevisiae selvagens (três linhagens apresentando colônias rugosas e células dispostas em pseudohifas) e Lactobacillus fermentum, tendo a linhagem {{industrial}} de S. cerevisiae PE- 2 como levedura do processo. Foram realizadas fermentações em batelada em mosto de caldo e de melaço, sem reciclo e com reciclo celular, utilizando tanto a cultura pura da linhagem PE- 2 quanto as culturas mistas com as linhagens rugosas e ou L. fermentum. Foram avaliadas modificações no tratamento ácido do fermento, visando o controle do crescimento dos contaminantes sem afetar a levedura do processo. Em seguida, foram conduzidas fermentações contaminadas e não contaminadas submetidas ao tratamento ácido combinado com adição de etanol, tanto em caldo quanto em melaço, utilizando-se PE- 2, uma das linhagens rugosas e L. fermentum. A atividade da invertase extracelular foi também avaliada em ambos os substratos para os micro-organismos estudados, em condições de crescimento. Concluiu-se que o tipo de substrato de fermentação, caldo de cana ou melaço, influenciou o desempenho da linhagem industrial PE- 2 assim como afetou o desenvolvimento das contaminações com as leveduras rugosas S. cerevisiae na presença ou ausência da bactéria L. fermentum, em fermentações sem reciclo celular. O efeito da contaminação foi mais evidente quando se utilizou caldo de cana do que melaço como substrato, no caso da contaminação com leveduras rugosas, e o inverso no caso da contaminação com L. fermentum. O efeito da contaminação sobre a eficiência fermentativa foi maior na presença da levedura rugosa do que com a bactéria, e a contaminação dupla (tanto com a levedura rugosa quanto com a bactéria) não teve efeito maior sobre a eficiência fermentativa do que a contaminação simples, por um ou por outro micro-organismo isoladamente, especialmente na fermentação em batelada com reciclo celular, independentemente do substrato. Nas fermentações com reciclo de células, o efeito do substrato foi menos evidente. O controle do crescimento das linhagens rugosas pode ser realizado modificando o tratamento ácido normalmente realizado na indústria, seja pela adição de etanol à solução ácida ou pelo abaixamento do pH, dependendo da linhagem rugosa. O tratamento combinado baixo pH (2, 0) + 13 % etanol afetou a fisiologia da linhagem industrial, trazendo prejuízos à fermentação com reciclo celular, com pequeno controle sobre o crescimento da levedura rugosa e causando morte celular à L. fermentum. A diferença na atividade invertásica entre as linhagens rugosas e industrial de S. cerevisiae pode ser a responsável pela fermentação lenta apresentada pelas linhagens rugosas quando presentes na fermentação, sendo não significativa a influência do substrato sobre a atividade dessa enzima. A {{little is}} known about the effect of the substrate and the interaction among wild yeast strains and bacteria Lactobacillus in the alcoholic fermentation, because the studies have been concentrated in the evaluation of the contamination effects by one or another contaminant, separately. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of the substrate and the cell treatment conditions over the batch fermentations contaminated with both microorganisms, yeast wild strains of S. cerevisiae (three strains displaying rough colonies and pseudohyphal cell growth) and Lactobacillus fermentum, being the S. cerevisiae strain PE- 2 as the starter yeast. Fermentations using sugarcane juice and molasses, without and with cell recycle, utilizing both the pure culture of PE- 2 as the mixed cultures with rough yeast strains and or L. fermentum were carried out. Modifications in the acid cell treatment by the addition of ethanol to the acid solution and the lowering of pH of the acid solution or a treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> were evaluated, aiming the growth control of the contaminants without affecting the starter yeast. An acid treatment with the addition of 13 % ethanol was applied in fermentation with cell recycle, both in sugarcane juice and molasses, utilizing PE- 2, one of the rough yeast strains and L. fermentum. The extracellular invertase activity was also evaluated in both substrates for the microorganisms studied, in growing conditions. The type of substrate, sugarcane juice or molasses, influenced the performance of the PE- 2 strain as well as affected the development of the contaminations with rough S. cerevisiae yeast strains with or without L. fermentum, in fermentations without cell recycle. The effect of the contamination was more remarkable when sugarcane juice was utilized, in fermentations contaminated with rough yeast strains, but the inverse was observed when L. fermentum was the contaminant. The contamination effect was more harmful with the rough yeast strain than with the bacteria, and the double contamination (with both rough yeast strain and bacteria) did not have a higher effect over the fermentative efficiency than the single contamination, by one or another microorganism in isolation, especially in the batch fermentation with cell recycle, regardless the substrate. In cell-recycled fermentations the effect of the substrate was less evident. The growth control of the rough yeast strains may be done by modifying the acid cell treatment carried out in the industry, both by the addition of ethanol to the acid solution or by the pH lowering, depending on the rough yeast strain., The combined treatment (pH 2. 0 + 13 % ethanol) affected PE- 2 physiology, bringing about loss in the cell-recycled fermentation, with low growth control of the rough yeast strain but causing cell death of L. fermentum. The difference in the invertase activity between the rough yeast strains and the starter yeast PE- 2 may be responsible for the low fermentation rate displayed by the rough yeast strains, but a non significant effect of the substrate on the enzyme activity was observed...|$|E
40|$|The mango fruit {{not only}} has {{wonderful}} taste, flavor and nutritional values but also has anticancer and anti-viral activities. It is therefore, very popular and is recognized as king of the fruits. Mango fruit {{is also one of}} the cash crops of Pakistan that stands at 5 th position among the main mango producing countries. However, its pre and postharvest wastage is quiet high due to short shelf life and vulnerable to various microorganism. Therefore, the objective of this work was to prolong the shelf life and to improve the quality of the fruit by applying various strategies. For the purpose two commercial varieties of mango namely, Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa were selected for the study. The impact of controlled atmosphere ripening was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage and stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. The results obtained for various quality parameters (QP) as well as shelf life of the fruit were compared with the fruit ripened at the tree (under normal conditions). It was observed that the tree ripened fruit was better in quality than the fruit ripened at different storage temperature after harvesting. The fruit took longer time for its ripening at the tree compared to storage at 30 and 40 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. The shelf life was longest for the mangoes stored at 20 â€žaC compared to others, including tree ripened fruit. However, the waste percent was highest at tree ripened fruit as compared to stored fruit, irrespective of temperature and variety. These parameters were significantly different in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The results obtained for various quality parameters of the fruit harvested at hard green stage of maturity from different (orientation) side of the tree East, West, North and South showed that the quality was best and waste percent was lowest for the fruit harvested from south (sun exposure time for the fruit was maximum) orientation of tree; the shelf life was longer and weight loss percent was lower for North direction compared to others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The values of QP for the fruit harvested from South were significantly different from other treatments in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The fruit was harvested three (6. 30 am, 1. 30 pm and 8. 30 pm) times a day and was stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. It was concluded that the quality of the ripened fruit was highest for 8. 30 pm harvest time and stored at 40 â€žaC. The fruit harvested at 6. 30 am and stored at 20 â€žaC had lowest quality and weight loss but longest shelf life, whereas the fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and stored at 40 â€žaC had shortest shelf life and highest weight loss, irrespective of the variety. On the other hand, the waste percent was highest for fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and 20 â€žaC storage temperature and lowest for 6. 30 am harvest time and stored at 30 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. However, the quality and the shelf life were improved by coating the fruit with calcium chloride, respective of harvest time plus storage temperature and irrespective of the variety. The impact of harvest stages and storage conditions over the postharvest quality and shelf life of mango fruit was explored by measuring the QP for the fruit harvested at 80 (early stage), 95 (mid stage) and 110 (late stage) days after the fruit setting and stored at three different storage temperature showed a significant impact over the quality characteristics. The waste percentage, weight loss, pH, total soluble solids, carotenoids and total sugar were increased with the storage time/ ripening process, irrespective of maturity stages; while the percentage of acidity and vitamin-C was decreased with storage time. The total sugar contents were highest in later stage whereas, vitamin C and acidity were highest in fruit harvested at early stage whereas; the waste percentage was lowest for mid stage harvest. The weight loss was higher and shelf life was longer for early stage harvest. The ripening rate increased and the shelf life decreased with rise in storage temperature. The total soluble solids, sugar contents and carotenoids had positive correlation with the skin color, irrespective of stage, variety and temperature. The contribution of cooling of the fruit towards the enhancement of quality and prolonging the shelf life was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage of maturity and maintaining at 15 Â¡Â³C (by keeping in cold water and/ or in cold air) for different time periods. The fruit was then stored at 20, 30 and 40 oC till ripening. The quality parameters obtained were correlated with pre-storage cooling treatment. It was concluded that the impact of heat removed of the fruit was significantly different in most of the cases under the limit of P Æ’Â¬ 0. 05. It was also observed that the removal of heat from the fruit enhanced the quality, prolongs shelf life and minimize wastage, irrespective of the variety and storage temperatures. The quality of mango fruit was investigated as related with pedicle (stalk) lengths of the fruit. The fruit was harvested at hard green stage of maturity with 0. 5, 2. 5, 4. 5 and 6. 5 cm pedicle (stalk) lengths and stored at 30 Â¡Â³C till ripening. The result showed that the fruit harvested with 4. 5 cm stalk length was better among the investigated treatment for quality and shelf life. The weight loss and waste percent during ripening process of mango fruit was higher for 0. 5 cm stalks and lower for 4. 5 cm stalk, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The impact of coating over the quality and shelf life of mango (Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa) fruit was investigated in detail. For this purpose, several coating materials like starch, olive oil, beeswax, sodium benzoate, coconut oil, natural ghee (clarified butter) and <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> were evaluated.

Shelf life was longest with minimum weight loss and waste percent in natural ghee (clarified butter) and beeswax. Quality was higher in case of natural ghee and starch based coating than others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. Overall the shelf life was longest and waste percent was lowest in Samar Bahisht Chaunsa as compared to Langra mango variety, irrespective of the treatment...|$|E
