5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

5|$|The {{impact of}} glacier retreat on the park's {{ecosystems}} {{is not fully}} known, but <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that are dependent on cold water could suffer due {{to a loss of}} habitat.

50|$|Characteristically, Ammophila arenaria invades the {{historically}} flat Californian foredunes transforming {{the ecology of}} the dune system.

5|$|Glacier National Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, {{as well as}} rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest fires are uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E
5|$|These {{ecological}} systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic {{features such as}} the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, {{and the frequency of}} storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> and the system cycles and pulses with each change.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E
50|$|The dam is {{a popular}} day trip {{destination}} for both locals and tourists for barbecues and picnics, taking about 45 minutes to reach by car from Gosford.

50|$|The Florida Keys have {{distinctive}} <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> <b>species,</b> some found {{nowhere else}} in the United States, as the Keys define the northern extent of their ranges.

25|$|Wet {{tropical}} forests {{are the most}} species-rich biome, and {{tropical forests}} in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.

This constitutes the largest collection of living <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> in the world.|$|R
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
