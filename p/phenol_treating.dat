However, compared to Bombyx mori silk, commonly known as mulberry silk, the other non-mulberry silks have some drawbacks like coarseness, low draping, wash and wear characteristics etc. which can be changed using chemical treatment. In this study, effects of some highly polar, non-polar and bipolar solvents on fibre of muga silk have been studied in terms of tensile strength. Methanol and <b>Phenol</b> <b>treated</b> fiber showed higher tensile strength than DMSO, Formaldehyde, Toluene, DMF, Benzene, Ethanol and THF treated fibres respectively.

The maximum catalytic activity was observed at pH 7; however, significant activity was observed at pHs ranging from 5 to 8. Tyrosinase was unstable under acidic conditions and at elevated temperatures. The activation energy for thermal inactivation of tyrosinase was determined to be 1. 85 kJ mol- 1 at pH 7. The transformation of phenols catalysed, by tyrosinase was investigated as a function of pH, initial phenol concentration, and additives. Phenol was transformed successfully with tyrosinase, over a wide range of pH (pH 5 [...] 8) and a wide range of initial concentrations (0. 5 mM [...] 10 mM). Some chlorinated phenols were also successfully transformed with tyrosinase. Polyethylene glycol and chitosan did not improve the transformation efficiency of phenol. However, chitosan was successfully used to remove coloured, products resulting from treatment Since coagulation with aluminium sulfate failed, the colour removal induced by chitosan addition appeared {{to be the result of}} simultaneous coagulation and adsorption mechanisms. Minimum doses of chitosan required to achieve 90 % of colour removal were logarithmically related to the quantity of <b>phenol</b> <b>treated.</b> All solutions of <b>phenol</b> and chlorophenols <b>treated</b> with tyrosinase, had substantially lower toxicities, than their corresponding initial toxicities.

Chronic sympathetic and parasympathetic denervation was provoked by topical application of phenol to the proximal LAD in 20 pigs through a lateral thoracotomy. Two weeks later, we performed an midsternal thoracotomy. Heart rate, aortic and ventricular (LV) pressure, LV dP/dt, coronary blood flow (CBF) at the LAD, and 32 –channel epicardial ST segment mapping were monitored during every MCH application. Phenol-induced coronary adrenergic and cholinergic denervation was confirmed by histofluorescence and cholinesterase staining, Isolated LAD rings of 5 phenol-denervated pigs were studied to confirm smooth muscle integrity, Application of MCH to control pigs (n= 10) induced an statistically significant fall in CBF (75 ± 19 %) accompanied by electrical and mechanical signs of ischemia: mean ST segment elevation on the epicardial electrograms of 9, 7 ± 4. 7 mV, a drop in systolic LV pressure (- 20 ± 8. 4 mmHg) and a decrease in LV dP/dt (- 404 ± 203 mmHg/s). There were no changes in heart rate. The parameters returned to normal values after 5 to 8 min. As compared to controls, <b>phenol</b> <b>treated</b> pigs showed a significant attenuation ofthe fall in CBF (25 ± 17 %), lesser ST segment elevation (2. 4 ± 2. 1 mV), a lower drop in LV pressure (- 8 ± 2. 3 mmHg), and a smaller decrease in LV dP/dt (- 167 ± 104 mmHg/s).

The solvent extraction method is based on the polarity property of phenol, which will be the developing direction of extraction phenol from coal tar, and it has many advantages, such as low price, nontoxic extraction agent, corrosion-free, moderate operation conditions, no waste water and no exhaust gas in the course of production (Tiwari and Sen 1991; Wu et al. 2001; Liu and Xie 2014). The extraction method has been used in industry (Zong et al. 2013), yet the most adopted solvent extraction equipment is the mixer-settler, which have obvious disadvantages of large liquid holdup, significant solvent loss, long mixing and refining time, large land occupied and only intermittent operation. In contrast, centrifugal extractor has many advantages, such as compact structure, high treatment capacity, low liquid holdup, high mass transfer effect, convenient for starting and stopping, remote automatic control (Leonard et al. 1997; Fu 2004; Li and Yuan 2007). With the above advantages, some chemical plants have begun to <b>treat</b> <b>phenol</b> waste water with the centrifugal extractor (Xu et al. 1999; Yu et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2001; Tang et al. 2012; Mishra et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} oxidation of an aqueous phenol solution was studied via a novel process. Experiments {{were conducted by}} recirculating a slurry electrode made of the product to be <b>treated</b> (<b>phenol)</b> and a catalyst (carbon black) through a flow-by electrolyser with a vertical stack of perforated Ti/Pt electrodes. Both the capacity of high adsorption of organic compounds and gases and the conductivity properties of Carbon Black allowed the acceleration of the degradation. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{analysis was used to}} follow phenol loss and the formation of by-products. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis revealed the presence of two gases: oxygen-electrogenerated by the oxidation of water- and carbon dioxide produced by both phenol and CB oxidation. Other experiments under nitrogen and oxygen flow were performed in a closed reactor cell and proved that oxygen generated by Ti/Pt electrodes is sufficient to obtain the full degradation of phenol. The effects of CB concentration (ranging from 0 to 4 g l− 1), of the nature of CB and of the applied current (from 0 to 20 A) were investigated. An increase of CB concentration and applied current was found to shift product distribution to favour the formation of carbon dioxide. A removal efficiency of 100 % was obtained in a reaction time of 15 min under the following conditions: an initial phenol concentration of 1 mmol l− 1, 4 g l− 1 of CB, an applied current of 10 A, a flow rate of 10 ml s− 1 and a temperature of 30 °C...|$|R
40|$|Phenol is {{a stable}} and {{hazardous}} compound that is commonly found as an industrial effluent. <b>Phenol</b> can be <b>treated</b> by photocatalysis using zinc oxide (ZnO) as a photocatalyst. Unfortunately, the use of ZnO in photocatalysis is limited due to the poor response to the visible light. On the other hand, carbon nitride (C 3 N 4) is able to absorb visible light. In the present study, a series of ZnO-C 3 N 4 was prepared by impregnation method. The effect of zinc to carbon mol ratio (Zn/C) on the properties and photocatalytic activity was examined. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples revealed that as the Zn mol ratio increased, the intensity of diffraction peaks for ZnO also increased but the intensity for C 3 N 4 decreased. All prepared composite materials have an extended absorption band in the visible light region due {{to the presence of}} C 3 N 4, as supported by DR UV-Vis spectra. The prepared ZnO-C 3 N 4 composites were further investigated in the photocatalytic removal of phenol under visible light for 5 hours. All ZnO-C 3 N 4 samples showed higher activity than the bare ZnO with Zn/C mol ratio of 1 % showed the highest photocatalytic activity for removal of phenol among all the samples. The high activity observed on the ZnO-C 3 N 4 would be due to role of ZnO tosuppress electron-hole recombination and C 3 N 4 to extend the absorption of ZnO in the visible light region...|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used in industrial sector and contamination of water by such compounds is a major environmental problem. Presence of phenolic compounds in wastewater cause serious discharge problems due to their toxicity and poor biodegradability. Adsorption is proven {{to be an effective}} method of removing contaminants from wastewater. This work investigates adsorption of <b>phenol</b> onto thermally <b>treated</b> rice husk from aqueous solutions. Rice husk was washed and thermally treated at 700 DCfor 1 h. Batch experiments were conducted to determine the factors affecting adsorption and kinetics of the process. Thermally treated rice husk is capable of adsorbing appreciable amounts of phenol from aqueous solutions. No significant effect of initial solution pH on adsorption was observed. Experiments on effect of adsorbent particle size on adsorption shows high percentage removal and high rate of adsorption for fine particle size compared to coarse particle size fractions. The adsorbent to solution ratio affects the degree of phenol removal and percentage removal capacities of 40 and 95 were observed with 1 g and 15 g of adsorbent dose per liter of wastewater respectively. The equilibrium data were satisfactorily fitted to Freundlich isotherm and the parameters showed favourable adsorption. Phenol uptake of 16 mg per gram of adsorbent was observed when the waste water containing 100 mg of phenol/L is treated with an adsorbent dose of 15 g/L. Tests on phenol removal as a function of time show rapid initial adsorption rate followed by a slower rate. Kinetic data were fitted to the Pseudo second order model and initial adsorption rates and rate constants were determined...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} efficiency of activated carbon produced from fermented cassava peels (CPB), unfermented cassava peels (CPA) and commercial grade activated carbon (CAC) {{in the treatment of}} refinery wastewater was carried out. CPB was found to be 8 % and 18 % more efficient when compared to CPA and CAC in the removal of COD, and 14 % and 3 % better than CAC and CPA respectively in the removal of BOD 5. The removal efficiency of Pb 2 + by CPB was 100 % compared to 95 % and 57 % by CPA and CAC while 96 % of phenol was removed by CPB against 93 % and 83 % by CPA and CAC respectively. This better performance of CPB over CPA and CAC is not unconnected with its higher pH resulting from the removal of cyanide from the peels during the fermentation process. However, despite the high phenol removal efficiency by CPB, the concentration of <b>phenol</b> in the <b>treated</b> effluent does not meet the environmental guidelines for disposal. It is therefore, recommended that a two-stage CPB adsorption column arranged in series is necessary to treat refinery wastewater efficiently if it is desired to totally remove phenol from the effluent or reduce the concentration to 0. 005 mg/l allowed by the Federal environmental protection agency (FEPA). The equilibrium adsorption test conducted showed that the Freundlich isotherm is a better fit for the adsorption of phenol by the three activated carbons with correlation coefficients (R 2) of 0. 9364, 0. 9383 and 0. 9541 for CAC, CPA and CPB respectively. CPB was found to be a better adsorbent as it has the highest adsorptive capacity as evidenced from its better Freundlich exponent...|$|R
40|$|Contamination of the {{environment}} due to heavy metals and organic waste {{is a serious problem}} nowadays. These types of contaminants are toxic and can be dangerous to human health. Heavy metal contaminants include copper, lead and hexavalent chromium while phenol, benzene and toluene are examples of organic pollutants. A treatment of these contaminated waste chemicals must be carried out before they can be released into {{the environment}}. Conventional techniques for the treatment of these contaminants are not cost - effective as they are chemical and energy - intensive. Thus, the emerging biological methods for treating these wastes i. e. bioremediation, is more favorable. In this study, a locally isolated bacterium, Acinetobacter haemolyticus was chosen for the removal of Cr (VI) and phenol using batch and column systems. Cr (VI) and phenol removal studies were carried out separately and simultaneously using batch and column systems. When treated separately, about 90 % and 95 % of Cr (VI) could be removed using the batch and column system, respectively. However, for phenol, 30 - 65 % and 50 - 80 % of the organic compound could be removed using the batch and column system, respectively. In the simultaneous treatment process, the mixed waste effluent of Cr (VI) and <b>phenol</b> was also <b>treated</b> using the same system. About 70 % and 85 % of Cr (VI) could be removed in the batch and column system respectively while for phenol, about 30 - 40 % was removed using the batch system and 50 - 60 % for the column system. The batch system also required a longer retention time compared to the column system. This study has demonstrated the ability of Acinetobacter haemolitycus to remove Cr (VI) and phenol both from separate and mixed effluent, thus offering a promising alternative method for the detoxification of both pollutants prior to releasing the effluent into the environment...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{industrial}} waste water (e. g. textile waste water, phenol waste water, pharmaceutical etc) faces limitation in conventional treatment procedures. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) do not suffer from the limits of conventional treatment processes and consequently degrade toxic pollutants more efficiently. Complexity is faced in eradicating the restrictions of AOPs such as sludge formation, toxic intermediates formation and high requirement for oxidants. Increased mass-transfer in AOPs is an alternate solution to this problem. AOPs combined with Fluidized bed reactor (FBR) can be a potential choice compared to fixed bed or moving bed reactor, as AOP catalysts life-span last for only maximum of 5 - 10 cycles. Hence, FBR-AOPs require lesser operational and maintenance cost by reducing material resources. The time required for AOP can be minimized using FBR and also treatable working volume can be increased. FBR-AOP can process from 1 to 10 L of volume which is 10 times more than simple batch reaction. The mass transfer is higher thus the reaction time is lesser. For having increased mass transfer sludge production can be successfully avoided. The review study suggests that, optimum particle size, catalyst to reactor volume ratio, catalyst diameter and liquid or gas velocity is required for efficient FBR-AOP systems. However, FBR-AOPs are still under lab-scale investigation and for industrial application cost study is needed. Cost of FBR-AOPs highly depends on energy density needed and the mechanism of degradation of the pollutant. The cost of waste water treatment containing azo dyes {{was found to be}} US$ 50 to US$ 500 per 1000 gallons where, the cost for <b>treating</b> <b>phenol</b> water was US$ 50 to US$ 800 per 1000 gallons. The analysis for FBR-AOP costs has been found to depend on the targeted pollutant, degradation mechanism (zero order, 1 st order and 2 nd order) and energy consumptions by the AOPs.
