40|$|Collateral {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widespread credit risk mitigation techniques used by practitioners. This paper studies the effect of mark-to-market (MTM) timing in collateral agreements on the contingent credit risk exposure. We measure contingent credit risk exposure using <b>Potential</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Exposure</b> (PFE), the maximum amount of exposure expected to occur at a specified confidence during the remaining duration of the underlying contract. The parameters of a collateral agreement that can affect the contingent credit risk exposure include the frequency and timing of marking-to-market, trigger level for margin calls and the level of collateralization. However, these decisions are often made in an ad-hoc manner, without reference to an analytical framework. While the frequency of mark-to-market and collateral level has been studied, very little academic research has addressed the quantitative analysis of mark-to-market timing. The goal of this research is to fill this theoretical gap and propose a framework for optimizing the timing of mark-to-market in collateral agreements to minimize <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> <b>exposure.</b> Our framework computes the probability of maximum risk exposure of the underlying contract above a specified level during its remaining time until maturity using one or two MTMs whose timing is decided simultaneously at the contract initiation, or in a sequential manner. This probability is expressed as a function of the parameters of the underlying contract which is assumed to follow a Brownian motion and the decision variables in collateralization, including initial margin, trigger level and variation margin. Numerical examples are investigated with different values of volatility and duration of the underlying contract. Sensitivity analysis and numerical results reveal the optimal timing of MTM that minimizes PFE. Simulations are used to test preliminary conclusions from numerical analysisMark-to-Market. <b>Potential</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Exposure,</b> Contingent Credit Risk...|$|E

30|$|Sediments {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sink and buffer reservoir for metals, metalloids, and other contaminants that reduces their bioavailability but which also retains contaminants for <b>future</b> <b>potential</b> <b>exposure.</b> The sediment metal concentration and sediment-water chemistry (metal binding phases in sediments, pH, Eh, ligands, etc.) control free metal ion activity in aqueous solutions by the processes of formation-dissolution of the solid phases and the reactions of complex formation. Metal binding phases in sediments reduce metals’ availability and hence exposure. In contrast, complexation by ligands may enhance metal mobilization but often lowers bioavailability. The lack of information about the metal buffer properties of ecosystems can be explained by the absence of the quantitative theory that may predict their buffer behavior. The low buffer capacity of ecosystems, that are unable to preserve a constant pM, can lead to disastrous environmental consequences.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{modelling}} of landslide hazard, {{as opposed}} to landslide susceptibility, {{as a function of}} the earthquake trigger is vital in understanding and assessing <b>future</b> <b>potential</b> <b>exposure</b> to landsliding. Logistic regression analysis is a method commonly used to assess susceptibility to landsliding; however, estimating probability of landslide hazard as a result of an earthquake trigger is rarely undertaken. This paper utilises a very detailed landslide inventory map and a comprehensive dataset on peak ground acceleration for the 1994 Mw 6. 7 Northridge earthquake event to fit a landslide hazard logistic regression model. The model demonstrates a high success rate for estimating probability of landslides as a result of earthquake shaking. Seven earthquake magnitude scenarios were simulated using the Open Source Seismic Hazard Analysis (OpenSHA) application to simulate peak ground acceleration, a covariate of landsliding, for each event. The exposure of assets such as population, housing and roads to high levels of shaking and high probabilities of landsliding was estimated for each scenario. There has been urban development in the Northridge region since 1994, leading to an increase in prospective exposure of assets to the earthquake and landslide hazards in the event of a <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> earthquake. As the earthquake scenario magnitude increases, the impact from earthquake shaking initially increases then quickly levels out, but potential losses from landslides increase at a rapid rate. The modelling approach, as well as the specific model, developed in this paper can be used to estimate landslide probabilities as a result of an earthquake event for any scenario where the peak ground acceleration variable is available...|$|R

Located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, CAU 254 is comprised of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 23 - 06, Decontamination Facility. A corrective action investigation for this CAS as conducted in January 2000 as {{set forth in the}} related Corrective Action Investigation Plan. Samples were collected from various media throughout the CAS and sent to an off-site laboratory for analysis. The laboratory results indicated the following: radiation dose rates inside the Decontamination Facility, Building 3126, and in the storage yard exceeded the average general dose rate; scanning and static total surface contamination surveys indicated that portions of the locker and shower room floor, decontamination bay floor, loft floor, east and west decon pads, north and south decontamination bay interior walls, exterior west and south walls, and loft walls were above preliminary action levels (PALs). The investigation-derived contaminants of concern (COCs) included: polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides (strontium- 90, niobium- 94, cesium- 137, uranium- 234 and - 235), total volatile and semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Metals). During the investigation, two corrective action objectives (CAOs) were identified to prevent or mitigate human exposure to COCs.

40|$|<b>Potential</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Exposure</b> (PFE) is a {{standard}} risk metric for managing business unit counterparty credit risk but there is debate on {{how it should be}} calculated. The debate has been whether to use one of many historical ("physical") measures (one per calibration setup), or one of many risk-neutral measures (one per numeraire). However, we argue that limits should be based on the bank's own risk appetite provided that this is consistent with regulatory backtesting and that whichever measure is used it should behave (in a sense made precise) like a historical measure. Backtesting is only required by regulators for banks with IMM approval but we expect that similar methods are part of limit maintenance generally. We provide three methods for computing the bank price of risk from readily available business unit data, i. e. business unit budgets (rate of return) and limits (e. g. exposure percentiles). Hence we define and propose a Risk Appetite Measure, A, for PFE and suggest that this is uniquely consistent with the bank's Risk Appetite Framework as required by sound governance.

Located on the NTS approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, CAU 271 consists of fifteen Corrective Action Sites (CASs). The CASs consist of 13 septic systems, a radioactive leachfield, and a contaminated reservoir. The purpose of this CADD is to identify and provide a rationale for {{the selection of a}} recommended CAA for each CAS within CAU 271. Corrective action investigation (CAI) activities were performed from October 29, 2001, through February 22, 2002, and April 29, 2002, through June 25, 2002. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against preliminary action levels and regulatory disposal limits to determine contaminants of concern (COC) for each CAS. It was determined that contaminants of concern included hydrocarbon-contaminated media, polychlorinated biphenyls, and radiologically-contaminated media. Three corrective action objectives were identified for these CASs, and subsequently three CAAs developed for consideration based on a review of existing data, future use, and current operations in Areas 25, 26, and 27 of the NTS. These CAAs were: Alternative 1 - No Further Action, Alternative 2 - Clean Closure, and Alternative 3 - Closure in Place with Administrative Controls. Alternative 2, Clean Closure, was chosen as the preferred CAA for all but two of the CASs (25 - 04 - 04 and 27 - 05 - 02) because Nevada Administrative Control 444. 818 requires clean closure of the septic tanks involved with these CASs. Alternative 3, Closure in Place, was chosen for the final two CASs because the short-term risks of transportation were eliminated; long-term health risks were minimized by preventing public and worker access to contaminated media through physical and administrative controls; all waste will be managed in accordance with federal, state, and local requirements; and a cost-effective method for achieving protection and meeting closure requirements is provided. All CAAs were evaluated on technical merit focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety.

An understanding of past exposure is not only important to place our current body burdens in perspective, but is useful in assessing our <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> <b>exposure.</b> Unfortunately, very few direct measurements of our main source of exposure (i. e., food) over the past decades are available. This study attempts to reconstruct the historical exposure of the UK population to PCDD/Fs using a combination of emission estimates, information on environmental temporal trends derived from sediment cores and archived materials, and environmental/human fate modelling. Predicted adipose and blood lipid concentrations for a typical cross section of the population are derived over time (1920 – 2000), which is compared with measured data. The approach has been tested with two PCDDs and two PCDFs and showed encouraging agreement with measured data. Certain parts of the modelling methodology have been highlighted where there is still poor understanding of the processes governing fate and behaviour. These areas are discussed and recommendations for future improvements are made.

The open IR 01 of FVA, however, is {{a sure sign of}} risk not being fully hedged, a theoretical no-arbitrage pricing concern, and a bait to lure market risk capital, a practical business concern. By dynamically trading the CCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure hedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully replicated, leaving out no IR 01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a liability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is redefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation adjustment, coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz style least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the recursive fair value and adjustments.

40|$|The {{credit risk}} of a {{portfolio}} is often managed via measures of counter-party exposure, such as <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> <b>exposure</b> (PFE) and expected exposure (EE), with these measures playing {{an important role in}} setting economic and regulatory capital levels. For the sake of risk measurement and risk management these exposure measures should be computed under the real-world probability measure. However, due to the similarity of these exposure calculations to those used in calculating credit valuation adjustments, some have begun to compute them under the risk-neutral measure instead. This is problematic, as the magnitudes of PFEs and EEs differ under different equivalent martingale measures and their associated numéraires. Working with the Hull-White (HW) model of the short rate, the effect of a change of measure on the PFE and EE profiles of vanilla interest rate swaps and European swaptions is shown under three common measures: the money-market account measure, the T-forward measure and the Linear Gaussian Markovian (LGM) measure. A modified Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm, which allows for substantial computational savings, is then introduced in order to approximate contract level exposures under each of the aforementioned probability measures. Finally, a change of measure is implemented within the modified LSM algorithm in order to approximate exposure profiles under the real-world measure. The modified LSM algorithm is particularly useful for computing exposure profiles of contracts without closed-form valuation formulae, which would otherwise take significantly longer to compute via a standard Monte Carlo approach...|$|E

Alternative 1 was the preferred CAA for three CASs, Alternative 2 was the preferred CAA for six CASs (and nearly all of one other CAS), and Alternative 3 was the preferred CAA for two CASs (and a portion of one other CAS) to complete the closure at the CAU 168 sites. These alternatives were judged to meet all requirements for the technical components evaluated as well as all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the sites and elimination of <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> <b>exposure</b> pathways to the contaminated soils at CAU 168...|$|E
