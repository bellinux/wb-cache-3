China originally had close ties with the anti-apartheid and liberation movement, African National Congress (ANC), in South Africa, but as China's relations with the Soviet Union worsened and the ANC {{moved closer to the}} Soviet Union, China shifted away from the ANC towards the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress.</b> China adopted several principles, among them supporting the independence of African countries while investing in infrastructure projects. The Somali Democratic Republic established good relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War era. When Somalia sought to create a Greater Somalia, it declared war on Ethiopia, with the aid of the Soviet Union, Somalia took the Ogaden region in three months, but the Soviet Union shifted its support from Somalia to Ethiopia, and Ethiopia retook the Ogaden region. This angered Siad Barre, and expelled all Soviets advisors and citizens from Somalia, but Somalia maintained good relations with China, which segrated with the traditional Russian Communism. During the Cold War a few smaller nations also entered in alliances with China, such as Burundi under Michel Micombero.|$|E

2500|$|The {{national}} liberation movement was divided {{in the early}} 1960s when an [...] "Africanist" [...] faction within the ANC objected to an alliance between the ANC and the Communist Party of South Africa. Leaders of the Communist Party of South Africa were mostly white. The Africanists {{broke away from the}} ANC to form the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> and its military wing named Poqo, which became active mainly in the Cape provinces. During the early-1990s, Poqo was renamed Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA). Its underground cells conducted armed robberies to raise funds and obtain weapons and vehicles. Civilians were killed or injured in many of these robberies. In 1993, attacks on white civilian targets in public places increased. APLA denied the attacks were racist in character, claiming that the attacks were directed against the apartheid government as all whites, according to the PAC, were complicit in the policy of apartheid. An attack on a Christian church in Cape Town in 1993, left eleven people dead and 58 injured.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, anti-apartheid {{resistance}} {{within the}} country took the form mainly of passive resistance, influenced {{in part by the}} pacifist ideology of Mahatma Gandhi.

The armed wing of the ANC, Umkhonto weSizwe (abbreviation MK, meaning Spear of the Nation) claimed moral legitimacy for the resort to violence on the grounds of necessary defence and just war. From the 1960s onwards until 1989, MK carried out numerous acts of sabotage and attacks on military and police personnel. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission noted in 2003 that, despite the ANC's stated policy of attacking only military and police targets, [...] "the majority of casualties of MK operations were civilians." ...|$|E

They had served Lekhanya as a Lesotho Paramilitary Force Major in 1977 under a false identity. The hoax had resulted in Lekhanya financing the Lesotho Liberation Army against himself.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it {{was common}} for anti-apartheid {{political}} movements to form military wings, such as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which {{was created by the}} African National Congress, and the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress.</b> These functioned as de facto guerrilla armies, carrying out acts of sabotage and waging a limited rural insurgency. The guerrillas occasionally clashed with each other as their respective political organs jockeyed for internal influence.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1960s, the African National Congress (ANC) and its ally, the South African Communist Party (SACP) and <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> (PAC), began a {{campaign}} to topple South Africa's NP-controlled Government.

50|$|Despite {{opposition}} {{both within}} and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the African National Congress, the Azanian People's Organisation, and the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage. The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence. Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors.|$|E

DPSA did however contest the provincial elections in the Free State, where it got 9,806 votes (0.97% of the votes in that province), again failing to win a seat. In the municipality of Maluti a Phofung (formerly the QwaQwa state) the party got 8,493 votes (6.7%). The party also has some small base of support in the central parts of the Free State and is the largest opposition party in the Maluti a Phofung council.|$|E

The new guerrilla movement was closely connected to the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> (PAC), a South African militant opposition group. Potlako Leballo, a co-founder of the BCP back in 1952, was a prominent leader to the PAC and its armed wing, and largely responsible for its turn towards Maoism.|$|E
50|$|Prime Minister Jonathan, {{previously}} a close {{ally of the}} Apartheid {{government in}} South Africa, gradually started straying from its fold, eventually going as far as aiding the African National Congress. In response, P. W. Botha {{is said to have}} funded the LLA, despite the massive ideological differences, and allowed the guerrillas to pass through South African territory. Despite this association, the connection to the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> wasn't cut. A brother of the leading ANC member Thabo Mbeki, Jama (who was involved with the PAC), was killed in Lesotho in 1982 while attempting to assist the LLA. After increased conflict between Lesotho and South Africa, Jonathan was overthrown in a military coup led by Justin Lekhanya, who is alleged to have accidentally funded the LLA after being subjected to a scam.|$|E

The basic political documents of the movement were drafted by Christopher Phatshswe and Thomson Proctor. Branches of the movement were formed at different educational institutions, such as the University of Botswana, Senior Secondary Schools and teacher training colleges. According to Joina, the group had contacts with the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania (BCM(A)) and the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> of Azania (PAC) in neighbouring South Africa and MELS activists received political trainings from these groups. The MELS group constituting itself as a political party in 1994. Following Phatshwe's death, Mosalage Ditshoto became the new {{general secretary of the}} party.

5000|$|Passive {{resistance}} to apartheid was {{initiated by the}} African National Congress (ANC) with its Defiance Campaign in the early 1950s. Subsequent civil disobedience protests targeted curfews, pass laws, and [...] "petty apartheid" [...] segregation in public facilities. Some anti-apartheid demonstrations resulted in widespread rioting in Port Elizabeth and East London in 1952, but organised destruction of property was not deliberately employed until 1959. That year, anger over pass laws and environmental regulations perceived as unjust by black farmers resulted {{in a series of}} arsons targeting sugarcane plantations. Organisations such as the ANC, the South African Communist Party, and the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> (PAC) remained preoccupied with organising student strikes and work boycotts between 1959 and 1960. The Sharpeville Massacre marked a shift in the tactics of some anti-apartheid movements, including the ANC and PAC, from peaceful non-cooperation to the formation of armed resistance wings.|$|E

The Prime Minister wanted to separate the British nation, but also inspire the black nationalists there to pursue their freedom and equality subtly. The other hidden motive is that during this period there was much dissent amongst the powerful western nations over the level of involvement and the continued interference of Britain in her colonies. By separating themselves from the archaic practices that were condemned by their powerful allies they opened themselves up to more political opportunity. This was a bold attempt to address multiple parties and interests at once.|$|E
40|$|Book synopsis: There {{has been}} a recent outpouring of memoirs and biographies of the ‘great men’ of the {{southern}} African liberation movements. But the writing of critical reflective histories of these movements by non-partisan, independent scholars {{is still in its}} infancy. This collection of essays illustrates the intertwined histories of southern African liberation struggles and those of regional and international solidarity movements from the 1960 s to the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa in 1994, reflecting the new directions currently taken by ‘indigenous’ southern–African based scholars, and those writing from abroad. Distinct from the polemical, hagiographic, justificatory or partisan accounts that have flowed since the inception of the liberation struggles, the essays probe beyond the heroic portrayals of armed struggles and nationalist resistance to examine the fissures and tensions that existed within them. The essays also provide insights into the more troubling and darker aspects of the movements’ histories: human rights abuses perpetrated by the ‘liberators’; the important, if ambiguous, roles played by other southern African states which hosted, and provided succour for, the ANC and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in exile; the support provided to the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> (PAC) by the Lesotho government {{and the ways in which}} the fractious and personality-dominated politics of the organisation contributed to its weakness and ultimate eclipse by the ANC; the relationship between Muslims in Northern Mozambique and that country’s liberation movements. These essays also seek to present more nuanced accounts of the solidarity movements that flourished alongside the liberation and exile movements, such as the British-based Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), which in the 1970 s found itself at odds both with international interest groups pursuing constructive engagement with the South African government and with elements in the country’s grassroots movements. Even this organisation, committed to the downfall of systemic racial domination in South Africa, was beset by its own tensions of race, and had a difficult relationship with Black Britons. The collection’s uniqueness lies in drawing together internal and external struggles in exile. And it provides new insights into the relationships that exiles and guerrillas developed with host societies and solidarity organisations, both within the southern African region, and in the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the history of}} a black South African political organisation, the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>Congress</b> during the brief period of its effective influence inside South Africa: from 1959 to the mid- 1960 s. The PAC is identified as a populist movement, that is a movement of people who {{in one way or another}} were attempting to resist the impulses of an industrialising society. Its ideology therefore tended to stress communal as opposed to class-bound social identities. Beginning as a small dissident group within the dominant African political organisation, the African National Congress, the PAC was born after a decade of mass-based campaigning had distanced the ANC from its earlier nationalist position. The PAC acquired a following in only a few places, normally where its rival, the ANC, was weak and badly organised. It only approached the dimensions of a mass movement in the Western Cape where its militant, racially assertive rhetoric attracted migrant workers who were affected by a twin set of pressures: the efforts by the authorities to exclude them from urban society and the restructuring of their home communities in the Transkei. After the PAC's banning in March 1960 these people began to play a crucial role in transforming the organisation from a cluster of conspiritorial nuclei drawn mainly from the middle class into the popular movement Pogo, in the process injecting it with their own material and ideological preoccupations. In 1963 the PAC's exile leadership attempted to mobilise this following in a nation-wide insurrection but most of their preparations were known to the police who anticipated their plans with thousands of arrests PAC-inspired violence was therefore localised and confined mainly to the Transkei and the Western Cape. Two chapters examine the local social tensions which underlay PAC/Pogo violence in Paarl and the Tembu districts of the Southern Transkei. By way of contrast the development of the movement amongst a non-migrant constituency is examined in a chapter on the PAC's progress in East London and Pretoria. The thesis concludes with an examination of the PAC in exile: here divorced from its popular base and from the political environment which gave rise to its ideological concerns the movement lost its vigour and integrity: a classic instance of the tragedy of exile politics...|$|E
