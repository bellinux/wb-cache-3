60|$|Although I believe, {{for reasons}} {{which will be}} given further on, that some amount of {{variability}} is a constant and necessary property of all organisms, yet {{there appears to be}} good evidence to show that changed conditions of life tend to increase it, both by a direct action on the organisation and by indirectly affecting the reproductive system. Hence the extension of civilisation, by favouring domestication under altered conditions, facilitates the process of modification. Yet this change {{does not seem to be}} an essential condition, for nowhere has the production of extreme varieties of plants and flowers been carried farther than in Japan, where careful selection continued for many generations must have been the chief factor. The effect of occasional crosses often results in a great amount of variation, but it also leads to instability of character, and is therefore very little employed in the production of fixed and well-marked races. For this purpose, in fact, it has to be carefully avoided, as it is only by isolation and <b>pure</b> <b>breeding</b> that any specially desired qualities can be increased by selection. It is for this reason that among savage peoples, whose animals run half wild, little improvement takes place; and the difficulty of isolation also explains why distinct and pure breeds of cats are so rarely met with. The wide distribution of useful animals and plants from a very remote epoch has, no doubt, been a powerful cause of modification, because the particular breed first introduced into each country has often been kept pure for many years, and has also been subjected to slight differences of conditions. It will also usually have been selected for a somewhat different purpose in each locality, and thus very distinct races would soon originate.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{storage is}} an {{important}} component of life-history variation. A distinction is recognized between species that provision offspring using energy gained concurrently (income breeders) and those that provision offspring using energy stores accumulated at an earlier time (capital breeders). Although this distinction has been recognized for some time, surprisingly little {{attention has been paid to}} the general adaptive value of the 2 strategies. Here, we present a simple, general framework for modeling female reproductive strategies. We show that our framework can be applicable either to annual breeders that aim to maximize the energy delivered to their offspring before independence, or to species with shorter reproductive cycles that aim to maximize reproductive rate, given that their offspring must build up a given level of reserves before independence. For both scenarios, we show that the costs of accumulating capital can lead to <b>pure</b> income <b>breeding,</b> <b>pure</b> capital <b>breeding,</b> or a mixture of the 2 strategies. Our model allows the effects of a variety of parameters to be assessed. Length of gestation, offspring metabolism, efficiency of energy transfer from mother to offspring, and the relative rates of energy gain by females with and without offspring are all important factors. The cost associated with accumulated capital is a particularly critical determinant of the strategy adopted. More detailed approaches to specific systems may provide a greater understanding of the factors promoting different maternal strategies for offspring provisioning.
