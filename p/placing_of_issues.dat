50|$|Typically catalogs of tokens are {{organized}} by location, time period and/or type of item. Historically {{the need for}} tokens {{grew out of the}} need for currency.

5000|$|The {{language}} {{used in the}} inscriptions is Sanskrit, which {{appears to have been}} the dynasty's official language. Prakrit influence can be noticed in some stray cases. The inscriptions begin with a symbol representing the word siddham (translated as [...] "success" [...] or [...] "hail!"), followed by the word svasti. Next, the records mention the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> the ruling monarch and the land grant order. Finally, the inscription exhorts the future kings to uphold the grant, followed by imprecatory verses (to curse those who dishonour the grant) and benedictory verses (to bless those who honour the grant). The inscriptions end with the date {{and the name of the}} scribe.|$|R
5000|$|The next known {{king of the}} dynasty is Bhavadatta, whose copper-plate {{inscription}} {{was found}} at Rithpur (also Rithapur or Ridhapur) in Amravati district, Maharashtra. The inscription was engraved by one Boppadeva. It mentions the king's name as [...] "Bhavattavarman", which is probably a mistake or a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit name [...] "Bhavadattavarman". It names Arthapati as the king's aryaka, which is variously interpreted to mean [...] "father" [...] or [...] "grandfather"; according to another interpretation, aryaka is an epithet of Bhavadatta. The inscription names the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> as Nandivardhana, and states that the king and the queen were staying at Prayaga as pilgrims. Like Arthapati's inscription, it mentions Maheshvara, Mahasena and the Nala family.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{settlement was}} named Vila, from the Latin villa, which meant [...] "estate, manor" [...] and in late antiquity came to mean [...] "small town". This evolved into Weil. Later the suffix [...] "die Stadt" [...] (the town) {{was added to}} distinguish the town from villages of the same name, such as Weil im Dorf and Weil im Schönbuch. The current name is unusual in that it contains the German dative case (the word Stadt is feminine). It arose because the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> in official documents was usually given as [...] "gegeben zu Weil, der Stadt" [...] ("issued in Weil, the town"). The Roman origins of the city are immortalized in the coat-of-arms which feature the SPQR motto ("Senatus Populusque Romanus", i. e. Senate and People of Rome).|$|R

5000|$|The {{principal}} currency was {{the silver}} penny, {{some of which}} had a stylised portrait of the king.

The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> is not shown, but in Æthelstan's reign the location was shown, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in Bath, Canterbury, Chester, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Hereford, London, Oxford, Shaftesbury, Shrewsbury, Southampton, Stafford, Wallingford, Wareham, Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of Æthelred or Æthelflæd, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents Æthelflæd's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, with less than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around 5 in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the re-conquered Danelaw.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is bill {{formalism}} {{and development of}} its concept in the judicature. The thesis deals mainly with requirements of a bill of exchange, which are set by law, {{as well as with}} the effect of the failure to meet the correct form of these requirements on validity of bills <b>of</b> exchange. This <b>issue</b> is analysed especially with regard to its concept in the Czech judicature. The first chapter deals with theoretical aspects of the topic, namely with description of the basic legal regulation of exchange law, the characteristics of a bill of exchange and defining the kinds of bills and special types of them. The second chapter focuses on basic requirements of a bill of exchange set by law, which are analysed in particular with regard to their impact on the validity of the bill of exchange. Individual parts of the chapter deal with the following requirements of bills of exchange: 1. indication that it is a bill of exchange, included in the text of the instrument, expressed in the language in which the instrument is drawn up, 2. unconditional order (promise) to pay a certain financial sum, 3. the name of who is to pay, 4. information on maturity, 5. information on the place where payment is to be, 6. the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be, 7. date and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> bill of exchange, 8. signature of the drawer. The third chapter contains issue that is closely connected with the introduction of the above-mentioned requirements on a bill of exchange and which also reflects the formal character of a bill of exchange. The first part of this chapter concentrates on the bill forms, with whose character certain specific problems are related. The second part of this chapter deals with <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> graphic layout of a bill, which has also significant importance in terms of bill formalism...|$|R
