5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid <b>plummet,</b> before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|Ratings {{continued}} to <b>plummet,</b> {{due to the}} continuing success of SMTV Live. In March 2001, the BBC made an unprecedented move and extended the series over the summer, like SMTV was broadcast, but announced {{it would be the}} final series. Hill was replaced by Heather Suttie as the show was moved to BBC Scotland on 21 April until 15 September 2001 when the final show aired. It was replaced by The Saturday Show, which {{continued to}} be broadcast all year round.|$|E

The Boeing did not break up, explode or <b>plummet</b> immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then leveled off at 16,424feet (5,006 m) (18:30–18:31UTC), rather than continue descending to 10,000 (3,000 m) as previously reported to Tokyo Area Control Center, continuing at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35UTC).|$|E
5000|$|Like Twisters, ProSlide <b>Plummets</b> are body flumes. However, they {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} drop only, followed by a long, flat segment to help riders decelerate. Often over 70 feet tall, <b>Plummets</b> are frequently the tallest ProSlide slides in a water park. The first <b>Plummets</b> opened in 1987 at Aquapar Magog in Quebec and Six Flags America, respectively; as of 2007, ProSlide has installed 227 <b>Plummets.</b>|$|R

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a <b>plummet.</b> At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched {{an assault on}} the grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues them as they attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling the tailplanes. In a struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly <b>plummet</b> off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the transport of the jewelery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart <b>plummet</b> into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to <b>plummet</b> to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to <b>plummet</b> to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E
