5000|$|Canavesite {{occurs as}} a milky rosette-like {{aggregates}} of very thin 010 elongated fibers on surfaces and along fractures of ludwigite and magnetite skarns. [...] Canavesite is an exceptionally rare secondary mineral that forms {{on the walls}} of the abandoned mine of Brosso, Italy and has formed since the mine was abandoned due to weathering of these ludwigite and magnetite skarns. Canvesite has a monoclinic P 2/m crystal structure and does not fluoresce under an ultraviolent light. It also has thin and slightly flexible vitreous fibers that are elongated parallel to 010. Some crystal may show pseudohexagonal prismatic habit, but these cases are rare. The X-ray <b>powder</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> strongest lines are 9.54(100)202, 8.12(40)(201), 7.80(18)(102,301), 4.56(21)(501,503), and 3.11(19)(407).|$|E

50|$|The {{structures}} of clearcreekite and peterbaylissite {{are very different}} but they still are chemically identical. One unique property about them is that the mercury ion does not occur as the mercury(I) ion Hg22+, but as an Hg1+ ion in an oxysalt. Clearcreekite and peterbaylissite are classified as pure carbonate-bearing minerals with H2O and OH. The carbonates consist of one central carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms and the molecule easily adheres to hydrogen. The structure of clearcreekite presents hydrogen bonding between the carbonate and the hydroxyl. The unit cell parameters are: a 6.760(4), b 9.580(4), c 10.931(4) Ǻ (angstroms), β 105.53(5)º, V 682.1(6) Ǻ³(cubic angstroms), a:b:c= 0.7056:1:1.1410. The X-ray <b>powder</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> is very distinctive and unlike any other mineral.|$|E
50|$|The Le Bail method {{extracts}} intensities (Ihkl) from powder diffraction data. This is done {{in order}} to find intensities that are suitable to determine the atomic structure of a crystalline material and to refine the unit cell. Generally, the intensities of powder diffraction data are complicated by overlapping diffraction peaks with similar d-spacings. For the Le Bail method, the unit cell and the approximate space group of the sample must be predetermined because they are included {{as a part of the}} fitting technique. The algorithm involves refining the unit cell, the profile parameters, and the peak intensities to match the measured <b>powder</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is not necessary to know the structural factor and associated structural parameters, since they are not considered in this type of analysis. Le Bail can be used to find phase transitions in high pressure and temperature experiments. It generally provides a quick method to refine the unit cell, which allows better experimental planning. Le Bail analysis provides a more reliable estimate for the intensities of allowed reflections for different crystal symmetries.|$|E
50|$|George-ericksenite is {{a mineral}} with the {{chemical}} formula Na6CaMg(IO3)6(CrO4)2(H2O)12. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular crystal habit along 001 and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, Chile had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an X-ray <b>powder</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> {{that did not}} match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the Canadian Museum of Nature. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research economic geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA). The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Ontario.|$|E
