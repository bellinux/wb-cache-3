[...] Lesser reports that approximately 10-15 percent of the CTW's initial two-year budget of $8 million was spent on research. [...] He relates the priorities for pre-production research, which he called [...] "summative evaluation". [...] Using outside research groups like the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the Workshop wanted to ascertain if watching the show made any difference.

We were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> differences in mean density of trees from 5.0 cm to 22.5 cm dbh as trees {{of this size}} {{are likely to be}} affected by surface fire (Harrington 1993, Sackett et al. 1996) and trees 45.0 cm or larger (large diameter trees are important for wildlife species and of interest to managers) among fire treatments. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance procedures and Tukey’s test for honest significant differences. Diagnostic plots of the residuals against fitted values for tree density suggested a lack of homoskedasticity. Data were transformed on a logarithmic scale for testing.|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is cosmopolitly living {{parasite}} which prevalence {{in human}} extends {{to tens of}} percent. In its life cycle it uses any homoiothermic vertebrate as an intermediate host. The definitive host are felines from Felidae family. The acute phase of infection is medically important in immunocompromised pacients and by its risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in pregnant women who never suffered from this illness before. Infection could have serious and rarely even lethal consequences in both cases. This thesis focuses on experimental verification of theory of sexual transmission of toxoplasmosis from male to female on laboratory mice. Possible transmission was tested in acute phase and latent phase of infection. The result was negative in both cases. Moreover, we observed the parasite's affinity to tissue of organs in male mice by PCR technique. <b>Particularly,</b> our <b>interest</b> was <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> genital organs with others. It was discovered that lungs and spleen are the most infected organs in acute phase of infection. Toxoplasma was also present in genital organs (especially in epididymis) but not more frequently than in others. We observed statistically significant difference between sexual and non-sexual organs in acute and latent toxoplasmosis - non-sexual organs were more infected in both phases [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A dissimilarity {{coefficient}} for estimating the dissimilarity between two bird atlas distributions is developed. This coefficient {{is based on}} the Euclidean distance concept. The atlas distributions are compared over all quarter degree grid cells. Existing coefficients are not suitable for the comparison of distributions with different total areas and species with different mean reporting rates. In each grid cell the reliability of the reporting rates depends on the number of checklists collected for the grid cell. Weights are used to solve this problem. To solve the problem of different levels of abundance and conspicuousness of species, the reporting rates are sorted into percentiles, using five or 10 categories for the strictly positive reporting rates. Each grid cell is weighted by a function of the number of checklists collected for the grid cell. The coefficient is scaled by the maximum possible sum of the differences which would occur if there is no overlap between the two distributions, so that the dissimilarity coefficient lies between zero (a perfect match) and one (no overlap). A variety of these coefficients are investigated and compared. The continuity of observed reporting rates in a spatial cellular map is an indication of spatial autocorrelation present, especially between observations which are in close vicinity. We are <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> measuring and <b>comparing</b> the continuity of the reporting rates in the bird distributions from The Atlas of Southern African Birds. The variogram, developed in geostatistics, estimates this spatial autocorrelation. The classical variogram estimator, however, is dependent on the scale of measurement and assumes that the data are intrinsically stationary. The bird atlas distribution maps contain trend and the variance of each observation (reporting rate) {{is a function of the}} number of checklists collected for the grid cell and the underlying probability of encountering the species in the grid cell. The approach of removing this binomial measurement error from the variogram developed by McNeill (1991) is investigated but not found satisfactory. A weighted variogram, where each squared difference is weighted by a function of the smaller number of checklists, is developed. To make the variogram values comparable between species a function of the mean reporting rates is used to scale the variogram. We were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the first variogram value of each species distribution, 2 y(1). The bird distribution maps in The Atlas of Southern African Birds show the raw observed reporting rates. Each of these reporting rates is a random variable dependent on sampling error due to binomial variation based on the number of checklists collected for the grid cell and on the underlying probability of encountering the species. The distribution maps show this measurement error. It is believed that a smoothed version of the bird distribution maps will to some extent improve the statement these observed distributions are aiming to make. Single-step regression methods are investigated for a fast approach to this problem. These cause problems because of frequent 'zero' observed reporting rates and because they smooth the maps too heavily. Generalized Linear Models are investigated and this iterative procedure is applied to model the reporting rates with a binomial distribution on square blocks of nine grid cells where a value for the central cell is 'predicted' in each regression. This approach is especially suited to accommodate the binomial distribution characteristics and is found to smooth the bird atlas distributions well. Because only a local window is taken for each regression, the spatial autocorrelation is adequately included in the spatial explanatory variables...|$|R

Following this strand of investigation in language testing, the present study aimed to use keystroke logging to investigate test takers’ reading-into-writing processes (including, but not limited to, revisions). We were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> how test takers at different score levels transformed ideas from the sources.

40|$|This simple note {{lays out}} a few {{observations}} which are well known in many ways but {{may not have been}} said in quite this way before. The basic idea is that when comparing two different Markov chains it is useful to couple them is {{such a way that they}} agree as often as possible. We construct such a coupling and analyze it by a simple dominating chain which registers if the two processes agree or disagree. We find that this imagery is useful when thinking about such problems. We are <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> the invariant measures and long time averages of the processes. However, since the paths agree for long runs, it also provides estimates on various stopping times such as hitting or exit times. We also show that certain bounds are tight. Finally, we provide a simple application to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and show numerically that the results of the paper show a good level of approximation at considerable speed up by using an approximating chain rather than the original sampling chain...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an {{important}} pathogen in swine and is also a frequently reported zoonotic agent. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize isolates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium associated with septicemia in swine and to compare them to isolates recovered from clinically healthy pigs. We were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> the two groups of isolates for their ability to adhere to and invade host cells, to be phagocytized and survive in monocyte cells, to induce apoptosis, and to adhere to intestinal mucus. Their surface properties were also evaluated by interactions with solvents. The isolates recovered from diseased animals were shown to invade intestinal epithelial cell lines at a higher rate (P = 0. 003) than isolates from healthy pigs. Septicemic isolates were phagocytized by human monocytes at a higher rate than isolates from healthy pigs (P = 0. 009). The mean percentages of phagocytosis were significantly lower for human monocytes than for porcine monocytes (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 008, respectively) for isolates from both diseased and healthy animals. Healthy animal isolates were phagocytized more by porcine monocytes at 15 min (P = 0. 02) than septicemic isolates. No difference between isolates from septicemic pigs and isolates from healthy pigs was detected for other tested parameters. These results suggest that septicemic isolates have a particular pattern of invasion...|$|E

Freshwater Science, 34 (4), 1510 - 1526. doi: 10. 1086 / 683391 Climate {{change and}} fire suppression have altered fire regimes globally, leading to larger, more frequent, and more severe wildfires. Responses of coldwater stream biota to single wildfires are well studied, but measured responses to consecutive wildfires in warmwater systems that often include mixed assemblages of native and nonnative taxa are lacking. We quantified changes in physical habitat, resource availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects, crayfish, fishes, and tadpoles following consecutive megafires (covering > 100 km(2)) {{in the upper}} Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> responses of native and nonnative fishes that might have evolved under different disturbance regimes. Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative fire effects, fire size, and postfire precipitation. The 2 nd of 2 consecutive wildfires in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate postfire discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these fires with reduced biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaffected. Biomass of 6 of 7 native fish species decreased after the fires, and decreases were associated with site proximity to fire. Nonnative fish decreases after fire were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater nonnative fishes exhibited limited responses. All crayfish and tadpoles collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to fire disturbance. More pronounced responses of native insects and fishes to fires indicate that increasing fire size and frequency threatens the persistence of native fauna and suggests that management activities promoting ecosystem resilience might help ameliorate wildfire effects...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performances}} of four different stochastic optimisation methods using four analytic objective functions and two highly non-linear geophysical optimisation problems: 1 D elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI) and residual static computation. The four methods we consider, namely, adaptive simulated annealing (ASA), genetic algorithm (GA), neighbourhood algorithm (NA), and particle swarm optimisation (PSO), are frequently employed for solving geophysical inverse problems. Because geophysical optimisations typically involve many unknown model parameters, we are <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> {{the performances of}} these stochastic methods {{as the number of}} unknown parameters increases. The four analytic functions we choose simulate common types of objective functions encountered in solving geophysical optimisations: a convex function, two multi-minima functions that differ in the distribution of minima, and a nearly flat function. Similar to the analytic tests, the two seismic optimisation problems we analyse are characterized by very different objective functions. The first problem is a 1 D elastic FWI, which is strongly ill-conditioned and exhibits a nearly flat objective function, with a valley of minima extended along the density direction. The second problem is the residual static computation, which is characterized by a multi-minima objective function produced by the so-called cycle-skipping phenomenon. According to the tests on the analytic functions and on the seismic data, GA generally displays the best scaling with the number of parameters. It encounters problems only in the case of irregular distribution of minima, that is, when the global minimum is at the border of the search space and a number of important local minima are distant from the global minimum. The ASA method is often the best-performing method for low-dimensional model spaces, but its performance worsens as the number of unknowns increases. The PSO is effective in finding the global minimum in the case of low-dimensional model spaces with few local minima {{or in the case of}} a narrow flat valley. Finally, the NA method is competitive with the other methods only for low-dimensional model spaces; its performance stability sensibly worsens in the case of multi-minima objective functions...|$|E
