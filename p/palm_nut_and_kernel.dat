None is more important than the oils obtained fr m the <b>palm</b> <b>nut.</b> Coconut <b>and</b> <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> oils were recognized as health oils in Ayurvedic medicine almost 4000 years ago. The same health effects were also found in Sanskrit medicine for mother’s milk. Mention was made that freshly expressed human milk was adopted as an "antibiotic " after eye surgery. Modern research has now found a common link between these two natural health products [...] their fat or lipid content. For over thirty years our lipid laboratory has pioneered finding relationships between natural and synthetic lipids and their biological activity. Our studies indicated that the fatty acids and monoglycerides found in these two natural products had extraordinary antimicrobial. properties. Over a period of 30 years my colleagues and I screened other lipids hoping too improve on nature. During this period we screened some 300 lipids and other structures for antimicrobial activity. We failed and so I returned to nature for clues. The medium chain fatty acids and monoglycerides found primarily in these two tropical oils and mothers milk have miraculous healing power. It is rare in the history of medicine to find substances that have such useful properties and still be without toxicity or even harmful side effects. My students and I then vigorously pursued the industrial and medical application of the most active species, monolaurin. The highly purified monoglyceride is better known as Lauricidin® rather than simply monolaurin since the usual commercial monolaurin is only 45 - 55 % pure and has no antimicrobial properties.

40|$|Pistachio has {{a special}} ranking among Iranian {{agricultural}} products. Iran {{is known as the}} largest producer and exporter of pistachio in the world. Agricultural products are imposed under different thermal treatments during storage and processing. Designing all these processes requires thermal parameters of the products such as specific heat capacity. Regarding the importance of pistachio processing as an exportable product, in this study the specific heat capacity of <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>kernel</b> of two varieties of Iranian pistachio (Kalle-Ghochi and Badami) were investigated at four levels of moisture content (initial moisture content (5 %), 15 %, 25 % and 40 % w. b.) and three levels of temperature (40, 50 and 60 °C). In both varieties, the differences between the data were significant at the 1 % of probability; however, the effect of moisture content was greater than that of temperature. The results indicated that the specific heat capacity of both <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>kernels</b> increase logarithmically with increase of moisture content and also increase linearly with increase of temperature. This parameter has altered for <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>kernel</b> of Kalle-Ghochi <b>and</b> Badami varieties within the range of 1. 039 - 2. 936 kJ kg- 1 K- 1, 1. 236 - 3. 320 kJ kg- 1 K- 1, 0. 887 - 2. 773 kJ kg- 1 K- 1 and 0. 811 - 2. 914 kJ kg- 1 K- 1, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impinging}} velocitythat gives that maximum cracking {{efficiency of}} a vertical shaft centrifugal <b>palm</b> <b>nut</b> cracking machine was determined in this study. A nut cracking energy instrument {{which consists of}} a hammering mass falling vertically on <b>palm</b> <b>nuts</b> placed on a base {{was used to determine}} potential energy required to crack the nuts. This energy was equated to the kinetic energy required to crack the nuts in a centrifugal <b>palm</b> <b>nut</b> cracking machine, from which the average impinging velocity was determined.
