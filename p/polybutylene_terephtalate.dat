A large molecular weight increase is observed in blends of Poly(ethylene terephtalate) and <b>Poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> after triphenyl phosphite addition. The formation of links containing phosphorus atoms between the polyester chain ends has been established. The weakness of this bond makes the observations difficult.

40|$|Molecularmechanics/dynamics {{computer}} simulations {{are used to}} explore the atomic scale structure and to predict binding energy values for polymer/clay nanocomposites based on random <b>poly(butylene</b> terephtalate-co-thio-diethylene <b>terephtalate)</b> copolyesters, montmorillonite and several, different organic surfactant. Our results reveal that the energy of binding between the polymeric matrix and the montmorillonite platelet shows a decreas-ing trend with increasing molecular volume, V, of the organic compounds used as surfactant, and that the substitution of hydrogen atoms with a –SHmoiety in the organic molecules results in progressively increasing interaction of the surfactant with the copolymer, as the sulfur-containing comonomer concentration is increased. Finally, under {{the hypothesis that the}} clay platelets are uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, the pristine clay still yields a high interfacial strength between MMTand copolymers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{biodegradable}} {{material was}} prepared by blending sodium caseinate (NaCAS) with <b>poly(butylene</b> adipate [...] <b>terephtalate)</b> (PBAT). The best composition was selected from mechanical testing of PBAT/NaCAS blends for further manufacture of a partially biobased film {{able to deliver}} a bioactive compound. From stress-strain testing, {{it was determined that}} the best mechanical properties while keeping maximum NaCAS content were obtained for 80 / 20 w/w PBAT/NaCAS blends plasticized with 10 % Glycerol (Gly). The surfactant octyl-beta [...] galactofuranoside was used as an antitubercular agent and directly incorporated in the blend during hot mixing. The biodegradable films containing 1 - 5 % by weight of galactofuranoside were observed by SEM and showed crystalline structures on their surface. From X-ray diffraction studies, it was demonstrated that on the surface, the octyl galactofuranoside crystallized orthorhombic with space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1). The molecular packing calculated from X-ray data showed bilayer structures with interdigitated octyl chains. Finally, the mycobacteriostatic properties of Gly-plasticized PBAT/NaCAS films were evaluated from a modified Kirby-Bauer test...|$|R
40|$|While {{polypropylene}} {{already is}} a technically interesting plastic material, <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> as a thermoplastic component gains in importance. In this contribution, the author investigates {{the strength of}} adhesive joints of surfaces of polypropylene joints and <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> joints with epoxy and polyurethane adhesives. The physical and chemical influrences on the compound stability are determined and possibilities are evaluated {{in order to get}} optimal adhesion properties and gluing ability of plastics. Low-pressure plasma technology is used in order to pretreat surfaces. The low-pressure plasma pretareatment enables a specific and reproducible modification of the surfaces of polypropylene (PP) a <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> (PBT) material. The efficiency of low-pressure plasma is determined by four internal process parameters (time of treatment, power performance, process pressure, process gas for use in chemical reactions) and some external influencing parameters (degree of loading, of the process chamber, time between plasma treatment and bonding and other). With respect to the process parameter of low-pressure plasma pretreatment, no optimal conditions economically can be determined by a separate variation of single internal parameter. Therefore, a strategy of optimization is developed. This strategy allows the determination of an optimal combination of process parameters according to surface energy and polarity. The success of plasma pretreatment can be recognized by the free surface energy. The polarity of polymer surfaces {{can be used as a}} control parameter according to the accessible quality of adhesive bondings. The relation between strength of adhesive joints and surface energy/polarity is examined. The optimal strength of adhesive joints not always coincide with the highest polarity. Im Mittelpunkt der Dissertation steht der Zusammenhang zwischen Oberflaechenenergie und Adhaesionsvermoegen von Polymerwerkstoffen. Die Untersuchung der erreichbaren Klebfestigkeit erfolgt am Beispiel von PP und PBT. Zur reproduzierbaren Modifikation der Fuegeteiloberflaechen wird systematisch die Niederdruck-Plasmatechnologie eingesetzt und eine neue Optimierungsstrategie zur schnellen Findung erfolgreicher Prozessparameter entwickelt und beschrieben. Fuer die untersuchten Klebstoff-/Substrat-Systeme wird eine Korrelation zwischen Oberflaechenenergie - insbesondere der Polaritaet - und der Verbundfestigkeit nachgewiesen. Diese Korrelation erlaubt ein Scale up der im Labormassstab erreichten Ergebnisse in Produktionsprozesse.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the interfacial tension from the <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PBT/SAN) interface region using the drop retraction method. SAN filaments were sandwiched between two PBT films; the whole system was heated up to 240 °C, in a hot stage coupled to an optical microscope. The rheological parameters of the PBT/SAN system were obtained by parallel plates rheometry. An increase of the interfacial tension with the PBT molecular weight was observed with values between 0. 57 and 1. 06 mN/m, depending on the molecular weight. Theoretical values were calculated using the geometric-mean and harmonic-mean equations and {{were found to be}} similar to the experimental results. Viscosity measurements showed that the higher the SAN/PBT viscosity ratio, the lower the interfacial tension of these blends...|$|E
40|$|As the {{nanocomposite}} properties dramatically {{depend on}} the dispersion state of the filler in the matrix, {{it is essential to}} develop technical methods to characterise the nanodispersion both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this study, complete characterisations of the nanodispersion of organomodified clays in polyamide 6, polypropylene and <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> are presented and discussed using different analytical tools. All four characterisation methods have been evaluated experimentally. TEM has been used to qualitatively characterise the dispersion. As TEM picture might be not fully representative of the whole sample, many pictures have to be analysed to mirror the global repartition. XRD is particularly adapted to the study of intercalated morphology of nanocomposite since the distance between two platelets can be calculated but needs TEM to provide more complete conclusions. Melt rheology and solid-state NMR are bulk analyses. During the measurement the sample is representative of the material. Rheology is relatively simple to make measurements and to get semi-quantitative data. In connection with NMR, we can get quantitative measurements on the degree of nanodispersion in the nanocomposit...|$|E
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for making dense hydroxyapatite-polymer composites. Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{is a type of}} calcium phosphate, which is a bioactive material. The polymer used in this work was Polyactive™ 60 / 40, a block copolymer from polyethylene oxide (PEO) and <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> (PBT) in a weight ratio of 60 / 40. It is a biodegradable polymer with bone bonding properties. In this study the submicron HA starting powders were coated {{in such a way that}} a chemical bonding existed with the polymer. Polymer composites with a high fraction of HA (70 - 80 wt %) are of interest as a temporary replacement for bone, but are hard to densify by conventional means. Here it is shown that they can be densified up to about 87 - 88 % of the theoretical maximum density. When this is followed by a heat treatment in which the polymer chains are allowed to entangle, a sound compact will result. The compact thus obtained is stable in water, contrary to those samples that do not receive a heat treatment. Furthermore, the limitations in strength that can be obtained for such composites are being addressed here. These findings can be generalized for the densification of polymer (composites) by shock densification means...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a compatibilized polymer blend based on poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) (PPE) and <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> (PBT). Blending of PBT with PPE, with PBT as the continuous phase, could yield materials which are mutually incompatible, and the phase morphologies obtained during blending of these polymers are generally unstable. When PPE is functionalized selectively, in situ compatibilization during processing is feasible. Due to the formation of segmented copolymers, which act as compatibilizing agents, stabilization of the morphology obtained during blending is feasible. Different types of reactive PPE polymers were investigated, e. g. PPE with hydroxyalkyl, carboxylic acid, methyl ester, amino and t-BOC protected amino endgroups. These groups are positioned either {{in the middle of the}} chain or as the endgroup. All these reactive PPE polymers result in better compatibilization after mixing with PBT versus unfunctionalized PPE. PPEs with carboxylic acid endgroups proved to be the most efficiently compatibilized with PBT, for the PBT type employed in this study. Promoters, which catalyze or take part in the coupling between PBT and/or functionalized PPEs, such as triphenyl phosphite (TPP), sodium stearate, titanium (IV) isopropoxide and epoxy resins, were used in order to improve compatibilization of the PPE/PBT blends. The use of these promoters proved to give synergetic compatibilization in combination with functionalized PPEs...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of surface {{topography}} and biomaterial wettability on protein absorption, cell attachment, proliferation and morphology and reveals important insights in the complexity of cell-material interactions. We use various materials, i. e. poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), a co-polymer of poly(ethylene oxide) and <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> (PEOT/PBT) and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as a reference. These materials are used extensively in biomedical applications and tissue engineering and have differences in hydrophobicity. Patterning of PDMS, PLLA and PEOT/PBT with a micropattern array of pillars with variable pillar spacing and pillar height induces changes in the wettability of their surfaces without changes in their surface chemistry. The cell study is performed using C 2 C 12 pre-myoblasts cells. Our results reveal a clear effect of surface topography, {{and to a lesser}} extent of material hydrophobicity, on cell attachment, morphology and proliferation. Generally, surface topography on high hydrophobicity materials improves initial C 2 C 12 cell attachment, whereas less hydrophobic and nonpatterned materials seem to support higher cell proliferation and spreading. With respect to cell morphology, surface topography seems dominant over material wettability; although the transition where cells change from growing on top of the pillars to growing on the underlying surface appears to be determined by the material wettability. These findings are important in the design of biomaterials in various applications including implants, bio-artificial organs and tissue engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The plastic {{deformation}} behaviour of a material in a fracture {{process can be}} described by a {{plastic deformation}} function (H function), which is established by the load separation criterion. H function {{is the basis of}} single-specimen methodologies for the construction of the material crack growth resistance (JR) curve, but it can be given further significant roles {{in the study of the}} fracture behaviour of materials. This work describes further applications of H function in fracture characterization of ductile polymers. By referring to results obtained from single edge notched in bending, SE(B), specimen tests on different polymeric materials, H function is shown as an effective tool for: i. guiding specimen preparation for fracture testing, through its character of local property and the capability to reflect directly the geometry constraint degree; ii. studying the effects of the testing conditions on the plastic deformational mechanisms involved in the fracture process. Industrial grades of both amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers were examined [acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene resin, high-impact polystyrene, polycarbonate, rubber toughened poly(methylmethacrylate), rubber toughened poly(lactic acid); linear low-density polyethylene, rubber toughened polyamide 66, rubber toughened <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> ]. It is worth noting, with reference to point ii., that the approach here employed for the evaluation of the H function, which is based on the execution of stationary crack experiments on blunt notched specimens, does not require the measurement of the crack extension produced in the test. This makes the approach suitable to be used at different testing conditions (temperature and loading rate) and, in particular, in impact tests...|$|E
