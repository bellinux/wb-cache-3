40|$|The {{electrical}} Hall conductivities of any anisotropic interacting {{system with}} reflection symmetry obey sigma_{xy} = - sigma_{yx}. In contrast, {{we show that}} the analogous relation between the transverse thermoelectric <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients,</b> alpha_{xy}= - alpha_{yx}, does not generally hold in the same system. This fact may be traced to interaction contributions to the heat current operator and the mixed nature of the thermoelectric response functions. Remarkably, however, it appears that emergence of quasiparticles at low temperatures forces alpha_{xy} = - alpha_{yx}. This suggests that quasiparticle-free groundstates (so-called non-Fermi liquids) may be detected by examining the relationship between alpha_{xy} and alpha_{yx} {{in the presence of}} reflection symmetry and microscopic anisotropy. These conclusions are based on the following results: (i) The relation between the <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients</b> is exact for elastically scattered noninteracting particles; (ii) It holds approximately within Boltzmann theory for interacting particles when elastic scattering dominates over inelastic processes. In a disordered Fermi liquid the latter lead to deviations that vanish as T^ 3. (iii) We calculate the thermoelectric response in a model of weakly-coupled spin-gapped Luttinger liquids and obtain strong breakdown of antisymmetry between the off-diagonal components of alpha.

Changes to one off-diagonal element $L_{ 12 }$ of the thermoelectric matrix $L$ have previously been studied via the thermopower, but the remaining coefficient $L_{ 21 }$ {{which is responsible for}} the Peltier effect has received less attention. We discuss symmetry relations between $L_{ 21 }$ and $L_{ 12 }$ in addition to the Onsager reciprocity, and calculate <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a specific structure. Similarly as for the thermopower, for finite phase differences of the superconducting order parameter, the {{proximity effect}} creates a Peltier effect significantly larger than the one present in purely normal-metal structures.

Due {{to the lack of}} complete electron energy relaxation inside the device, the Joule heat dissipation over-estimates the power dissipated in small nanotransistors. This over-estimation is larger for large cross sections due to the weaker phonon scattering. On the other hand, in narrow wires, the power dissipation inside the device can be large, therefore, mitigating against fabrication of very narrow nanowire transistors.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{spintronics}} is to improve transport of information carriers and to achieve new functionalities with ultra-low dissipation. A most promising strategy for this holy grail is to use pure magnon currents created and transported in insulating magnets, in the complete absence of any conducting metallic elements. Here we propose a realistic solution to this fundamental challenge by analyzing magnon and heat transport in insulating ferromagnetic junctions. We calculate all transport coefficients for magnon transport and establish Onsager relations between them. We theoretically discover that magnon transport in junctions has a universal behavior, i. e. is independent of material parameters, and establish a magnon analog of the celebrated Wiedemann-Franz law which governs charge transport at low temperatures. We calculate the Seebeck and <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients</b> which are crucial quantities for spin caloritronics and demonstrate that they assume universal values in the low temperature limit.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} disordered {{systems have been}} the subject of intense study for several decades. Thermoelectric properties, such as thermopower and thermal conductivity, have been relatively neglected. A long standing problem is represented by the sign of the thermoelectric power. In crystalline semiconductors this is related to the sign of the majority carriers, but in non-crystalline systems it is commonly observed to change sign at low temperatures. In spite of its apparent universality this change has been interpreted in a variety of ways in different systems. We have developed a Green's function recursion algorithm based on the Chester-Thelling-Kubo-Greenwood formula for calculating the kinetic coefficients on long strips or bars. From these we can deduce the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck and <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the thermal conductivity, as well as the Lorenz number.

The Nambu-Goldstone bosons in insulating magnets {{are called}} magnons or spin-waves {{and play a}} key role in magnetization transport. We review here our past works on magnetization transport in insulating magnets and also add new insights, with a particular focus on magnon transport. We summarize in detail the magnon counterparts of electron transport, such as the Wiedemann-Franz law, the Onsager reciprocal relation between the Seebeck and <b>Peltier</b> <b>coefficients,</b> the Hall effects, the superconducting state, the Josephson effects, and the persistent quantized current in a ring to list a few. Focusing on the electromagnetism of moving magnons, i. e., magnetic dipoles, we theoretically propose a way to directly measure magnon currents. As a consequence of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem, spin transport is drastically altered in one-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) spin- 1 / 2 chains; where the Néel order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations and a quasiparticle magnon-like picture breaks down. Instead, the low-energy collective excitations of the AF spin chain are described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) which provides the spin transport properties in such antiferromagnets some universal features at low enough temperature.
