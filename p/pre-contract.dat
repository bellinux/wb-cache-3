40|$|The {{effects of}} the K+ channel opener levcromakalim, the {{guanylate}} cyclase stimulant nitroprusside and the dual drug nicorandil (K+ channel opener and guanylate cyclase stimulant) were analysed in piglet isolated endothelium-denuded pulmonary (PA) and mesenteric (MA) arteries stimulated by noradrenaline (NA) or by the thromboxane A 2 mimetic U 46619. Nicorandil, levcromakalim and verapamil were less potent in PA than in MA, the efficacy of levcromakalim was also reduced in PA. The effects of nicorandil and levcromakalim were similar in arteries <b>pre-contracted</b> by NA and U 46619, whereas verapamil was more potent in arteries <b>pre-contracted</b> by NA. Nitroprusside was equipotent in MA <b>pre-contracted</b> by either NA or U 46619 and in PA <b>pre-contracted</b> by NA whereas in PA <b>pre-contracted</b> by U 46619, nitroprusside showed lower potency and efficacy. The relaxant effects of levcromakalim and nitroprusside were inhibited by 10 − 5 [*]M glibenclamide and 10 − 6 [*]M ODQ, respectively. Nicorandil-induced relaxation was inhibited by ODQ in all experimental conditions, whereas glibenclamide had inhibitory effects in PA and MA <b>pre-contracted</b> by U 46619, had no effect in PA <b>pre-contracted</b> by NA and in MA <b>pre-contracted</b> by NA it was only inhibitory {{in the presence of}} ODQ. No apparent interactions were found between nitroprusside and levcromakalim as indicated by the lack of effects of pretreatment with one of them (producing 20 – 35 % relaxation) on the potency of the relaxant response to the other. However, in PA <b>pre-contracted</b> by U 46619, where nitroprusside or levcromakalim induced only partial relaxation, the combination of both mechanisms (either by combining nitroprusside plus levcromakalim or by nicorandil) was able to induce full vasodilatation. In conclusion, K+ channel opening and guanylate cyclase stimulation are independent pathways that induce additive vasorelaxation in piglet PA and MA. The mechanism of action of nicorandil is dependent on the artery and {{on the nature of the}} agonist employed to precontract the artery. The relative efficacy of K+ channel opening vs guanylate cyclase stimulation may partially explain the preferential contribution of each mechanism to the relaxant effects of nicorandil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays an {{important}} role in ocular physiology. Anti-VEGF agents are now used for treatment of common retinal diseases. This study characterises the vasoactive properties of VEGF in isolated perfused pig retinal arterioles under normal tone or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) <b>pre-contracted</b> conditions and determines the influence of an anti VEGF agent on VEGF induced vasoactivity. Methods An isolated perfused retinal arteriole preparation was used. The outer diameter of retinal vessels was monitored at 2 [*]second intervals in response to VEGF and the anti VEGF agent, bevacizumab. The effect of intraluminal delivery of VEGF was determined over a wide concentration range (10 - 16 to 10 - 7 M) both with and without pre-contraction with ET- 1 (3 x 10 - 9 M). Bevacizumab (0. 35 mg mL - 1) was applied extraluminally to determine the influence of bevacizumab on VEGF induced vasoactive changes on ET- 1 <b>pre-contracted</b> vessels. Results In retinal arterioles with normal tone, VEGF induced a concentration dependent contraction at low concentrations, reaching 93. 5 % at 10 - 11 M and then contraction was reduced at higher concentrations, recovering to 98. 1 % at 10 - 7 M. VEGF produced a potent concentration dependent vasodilatation in arterioles <b>pre-contracted</b> with ET- 1. VEGF induced vasodilatation in arterioles <b>pre-contracted</b> with ET- 1 was significantly inhibited by bevacizumab. Conclusions VEGF induced vasoactive changes in pig retinal arterioles are dependent on concentration and vascular tone. Bevacizumab inhibits VEGF-induced vasodilatation in <b>pre-contracted</b> arterioles. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective(s) : Angiotensin Ⅱ type 1 {{receptor}} blockers (ARBs) represent one of {{the widely}} used antihypertensive agents. In addition to anti-hypertension effect, some ARBs also show other molecular effects such as activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and so on. Here we studied the effects of telmisartan on the rat isolated mesenteric artery rings <b>pre-contracted</b> by phenylephrine (PE). Materials and Methods:Rat mesenteric artery rings were <b>pre-contracted</b> with 10 μM PE, and cumulative concentration-response curves to telmisartan were obtained. The endothelium-dependent mechanisms were investigated by mechanical removal of the endothelium. K+ channels were investigated by pretreatment of the artery rings with various K+ channel blockers. Results:Telmisartan produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the artery rings <b>pre-contracted</b> by 10 μM PE. Denudation of the endothelium {{did not affect the}} relaxant effect of telmisartan. Pretreatment with BaCl 2 nearly inhibited the relaxation induced by the 0. 5, 1, 5 and 10 μM telmisartan, but did not affect the relaxation induced by the 50 and 100 μM telmisartan. While the relaxation induced by telmisartan was not affected by pretreatment with TEA, 4 -AP and glibenclamide. Conclusion:These findings demonstrated that telmisartan produces concentration dependent vasodilation in isolated rat mesenteric artery rings with or without endothelium <b>pre-contracted</b> by PE. KIR channel may be involved in such a relaxant effect of telmisartan...|$|R
40|$|Phymatodes scolopendria (Burm.) Ching (Polypodiaceae) {{is widely}} used in the Eastern coast of Madagascar to treat {{respiratory}} disorders. Bioassay-guided fractionation using guinea pig trachea <b>pre-contracted</b> with histamine to monitor the activity led to the isolation of 1, 2 -benzopyrone (coumarin) as the main active constituent. Effectively, it induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the histamine with a median effective concentration (EC 50) of 35. 03 g/ml, or carbachol (EC 50 = 33. 41 g/ml) <b>pre-contracted</b> guinea pig trachea, and also provoked 100 % relaxation at 72. 10 g/ml. It was less active either on KCl <b>pre-contracted</b> trachea (EC 50 = 130. 78 g/ml) or endothelium denuded trachea (153. 4 ± 22 g/ml). It inhibited, in a non-competitive manner, the histamine and the external calcium spasm effect on the isolated trachea {{but it did not}} significantly modify the broncho-constrictive activity of KCl. When combined with theophylline, coumarin produced a significant additive relaxing effect on <b>pre-contracted</b> trachea. Furthermore, its bronchodilator effect was not blocked by propranolol. In vivo, pre-treated guinea pig with coumarin showed significant resistance to histamine inhalation, with an adequate dose protecting 50 % of the tested animals (AD 50) of 75 mg/kg. These results indicate that the bronchodilator effect of coumarin is partly due to the endothelium-dependent tracheal relaxation, and may be mediated through a non-specific tracheal relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Urocortin is an {{endogenous}} vasodilator {{although the}} mechanism of vasorelaxation is not completely understood. The hypothesis that an alteration of smooth muscle calcium concentration is involved was tested using isometric tension recording and calcium fluorimetry. The relationship between contraction and intracellular calcium was also estimated. Urocortin produced a concentration dependent relaxation (pD 2 8. 59 ± 0. 06, n= 6) of vessels <b>pre-contracted</b> with a physiological salt solution containing 42 [*]mM KCl (42 [*]mM K-PSS). Removal of the endothelium did not alter the effect of urocortin, pD 2 was 8. 49 ± 0. 11, n= 5. Corticotropin-releasing factor relaxed 42 [*]mM K-PSS <b>pre-contracted</b> vessels with less potency compared to urocortin (pD 2 6. 99 ± 0. 28, n= 5). Urocortin at 100 [*]nM relaxed vessels <b>pre-contracted</b> with 42 [*]mM K-PSS by 59. 6 ± 4. 6 % (n= 8) and vessels <b>pre-contracted</b> with 500 [*]nM noradrenaline by 25. 2 ± 6. 8 % (n= 6). Both effects were not accompanied by {{a change in the}} intracellular calcium concentration. Urocortin at 100 [*]nM produced a significant rightward shift of 0. 33 ± 0. 07 units of normalized intracellular calcium (n= 5) of the relationship between tension and intracellular calcium. The urocortin-induced relaxation was considerably reduced in the presence of 0. 3 [*]mM Rp- 8 -CPT-cAMPS, a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor. The PKA-activator Sp- 5, 6 -DCl-cBIMPS relaxed 42 [*]mM K-PSS <b>pre-contracted</b> vessels (pD 2 4. 98 ± 0. 07, n= 6). Sp- 5, 6 -DCl-cBIMPS at 0. 1 [*]mM relaxed vessels by 85. 3 ± 2. 5 % (n= 5), but did not change the intracellular calcium concentration. In conclusion, the data show that urocortin is a potent, endothelium-independent dilator of rat tail arteries and suggest that this effect is mediated by PKA causing a reduction of the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus for calcium...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the {{mechanism by which}} extracellular acidification promotes relaxation in rat thoracic aorta. The relaxation response to HCl-induced extracellular acidification (7. 4 to 6. 5) was measured in aortic rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine (Phe, 10 − 6 M) or KCl (45 mM). The vascular reactivity experiments were performed in endothelium-intact and denuded rings, in {{the presence or absence}} of indomethacin (10 − 5 M), L-NAME (10 − 4 M), apamin (10 − 6 M), and glibenclamide (10 − 5 M). The effect of extracellular acidosis (pH 7. 0 and 6. 5) on nitric oxide (NO) production was evaluated in isolated endothelial cells loaded with diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate (DAF-FM DA, 5 μM). The extracellular acidosis failed to induce any changes in the vascular tone of aortic rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with KCl, however, it caused endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation in rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with Phe. This acidosis induced-relaxation was inhibited by L-NAME, apamin, and glibenclamide, but not by indomethacin. The acidosis (pH 7. 0 and 6. 5) also promoted a time-dependent increase in the NO production by the isolated endothelial cells.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} histamine 10 - 2 M on longitudinal preparations of rat portal vein. It was observed that histamine 10 - 2 M induced relaxation of rat portal vein preparations <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine 10 - 4 M. On the other hand, no pharmacological effects were observed in preparations not <b>pre-contracted.</b> The observed histamine-induced relaxing effect was absent in preparations <b>pre-contracted</b> with KCl (120 mM) or {{in the presence of}} depolarizing nutritive solution. However, the histamine-induced relaxation was still present in the endothelium-removed preparations. The histamine-induced relaxation also was not prevented by astemizole (10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M), cimetidine (10 - 5 M, 10 - 4 M and 10 - 3 M) or thioperamide (10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M), selective antagonists H 1, H 2 and H 3, respectively. The presence of L-NAME 10 - 4 M or L-NAME 10 - 4 M plus indomethacin 10 - 5 M also did not prevent the histamine-induced relaxation observed in rat portal vein. Thus, the histamine-induced relaxation observed in rat portal vein appears to involve a non-endothelial hyperpolarizing mechanism independent of H 1, H 2 and H 3 receptors...|$|R

These non-adrenergic inhibitory responses were concentration-dependently inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) within a concentration range of 30 - 300 microM but not D-NAME (up to 300 microM), although a component remained at 4 - 16 Hz even with 300 microM L-NAME. The inhibition by L-NAME (300 microM) was completely prevented when L-arginine (L-Arg; 15 mM) but not D-Arg (up to 15 mM) was applied simultaneously with L-NAME (300 microM). Increasing the L-NAME concentration to 1 mM had no additional inhibitory effect.

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by HSE was strongly reduced by L-NAME (100 mM), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, but neither by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist (1 mM), nor by indomethacin (10 mM), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. In rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with 80 mM KCl, the vasodilator effect of HSE was shifted {{to the right and}} was completely abolished in the presence of L-NAME (100 mM).

In addition, BaCl 2 (1 mM) dramatically reduced the vasodilation induced by HSE. Together, these findings led usv to conclude that HSE induces an endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat mesenteric artery, by a mechanism dependent on NO, on the activation of potassium channels and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor release. Rutin, identified as a major peak in the HPLC fingerprint obtained for HSE, might contribute for the observed vasodilator effect, since it was able to induce an endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat superior mesenteric arteries...|$|R

Three drone planes were successfully intercepted and shot down by the SPADA 2000 Plus Missile System.|$|E
25|$|Matthias had Czech King George of Poděbrady (declared a heretic by Pius) and the Hussite {{mercenary}} leader John Jiskra on his side. Matthias {{allied with}} Albert VI, Frederick's brother, {{with whom he}} brought war at the time. The Pope mediated between the parties with less success. With the odds against him, Matthias was forced to secretly engage in negotiations. He sent János Vitéz to Frederick in Graz {{in the beginning of}} 1462, helped by papal observer Hieronymus Landus. They partially agreed on the status of the Holy Crown and the cities of Fraknó, Kabold, Kismarton, Kőszeg, Sopron, and Rohonc. They fixed the terms of the inheritance of the Hungarian throne after Matthias, overruling the alliance between Matthias and Albert and forbade him to remarry {{after the death of his}} wife, Catherine of Poděbrady. The negotiations ended in May. This is considered a <b>pre-contract</b> for the Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt though most of the conditions were kept secret. In Sopron, the representatives of the Hungarian ecclesiastical and secular classes accepted all terms of these negotiations.|$|E
25|$|In early June, {{the club}} agreed the signings of Cardiff City winger Chris Burke, Coventry City striker Marlon King (who was accused by his former club of having reneged on a verbal {{agreement}} {{to remain with}} them), Dundee United midfielder Morgaro Gomis, and PSV forward Danny Koevermans, {{all of whom were}} out of contract and thus available as free agents under the Bosman ruling. When McLeish resigned on 12 June, Burke and King had already signed <b>pre-contract</b> agreements, but the moves for Gomis and Koevermans had not reached that stage. The Gomis deal was completed, but Koevermans pulled out, reluctant to join a club whose future manager might not want him. Hughton's first signing was Inverness Caledonian Thistle striker Adam Rooney, also a free transfer under the Bosman ruling, soon followed by Scotland international defender Steven Caldwell, recently released by Wigan Athletic. United States international defender Jonathan Spector, who was released by West Ham United after their relegation, joined four days before the league season opened, and West Bromwich Albion's New Zealand international striker Chris Wood arrived three days later on a month's loan, later extended for a further month.|$|E
40|$|Cymbopogon citratus DC. Stapf, Poaceae, {{is used in}} {{the folk}} {{medicine}} for hypertension treatment. This work investigated the chemical composition and cardiovascular effects in rats of C. citratus essential oil (EOCC). A phytochemical screening demonstrated the presence of eight constituents, being geranial the major compound (43. 08 %). In rats, EOCC (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i. v.) induced transient hypotension and bradycardia that were attenuated by atropine and sodium thiopental, but not by L-NAME or indomethacin. In rings of rat superior mesenteric artery <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine, EOCC (1 to 3000 µg/mL) induced relaxation that was not affected after removal of the endothelium, after TEA or in rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with KCl (80 mM). Furthermore, EOCC (1000 µg/mL) was not able to induce additional effect on maximal relaxation of nifedipine (10 µM). In conclusions, EOCC induces hypotension, possibly by reduction in vascular resistance caused by inhibition of the Ca 2 + influx, and bradycardia probably due to an activation of cardiac muscarinic receptors...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the potential of alcoholic extract of anti-inflammatory plants viz. Achillea millefolium, Rubia cordifolia and Saussurea lappa for spasmolytic activity in rat model using radnoti organ bath. The relaxant effect of all extracts on <b>pre-contracted</b> rat tracheal chain by carbachol (30 µM) had been screened. Isometric contractions of isolated rat tracheas were recorded at 1. 4 g resting tension and carbachol dose-response curves were performed. EC 50 values (27. 12, 13. 13 and 7. 32 µM, respectively) were identified by plotting cumulative concentration response curve and pD 2 values (4. 48 ± 0. 99, 6. 06 ± 1. 03 and 7. 41 ± 0. 97, respectively) were calculated for individual alcoholic extract of plant. All extracts were able to relax carbachol <b>pre-contracted</b> tracheas significantly in a concentration dependent manner. Our results suggested potential role of Achillea millefolium, Rubia cordifolia and Saussurea lappa in asthma for further potential therapeutic and clinical uses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Levobupivacaine (LEVO) {{can replace}} {{analgesia}} because it exhibits low toxicity and causes minor vasoconstriction, enabling {{its use in}} patients in whom vasoconstrictors are contraindicated. Objective We aimed to evaluate the effects of LEVO in isolated rat superior mesenteric artery by using the vascular reactivity technique and compare its effect to that of lidocaine. Material and method Arterial rings {{were obtained from the}} mesenteric artery of male Wistar rats and kept in organ baths. For recording isometric contractions, each ring was suspended by cotton threads from a force transducer, which was connected to a data acquisition system. Result Both lidocaine and LEVO did not show a vasoconstrictor effect on the basal tone of the arterial rings with functional endothelium. However, when the rings were <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine, both drugs were able to induce concentration-dependent vasodilatation. The vasodilator effect induced by LEVO did not change after removal of the endothelium, or with the addition of tetraethylammonium (1 mM), a non-selective K+ channel blocker. In the rings without functional endothelium, which were <b>pre-contracted</b> with depolarizing Tyrode&# 8217;s solution (KCl 80 mM), LEVO-induced vasodilatation was not significantly different from that observed in the rings <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine. Moreover, it did not show a significant additional vasodilator effect compared to the maximal vasodilator effect of nifedipine. Conclusion This study demonstrated that LEVO produces a vasodilator effect in the rat superior mesenteric artery in an endothelium-independent manner. This effect seems to be mediated via Ca 2 + channel blockade in the vascular smooth muscle cells...|$|R
