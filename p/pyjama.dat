5|$|The <b>pyjama</b> shark was {{originally}} described as Squalus africanus by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, in the thirteenth edition of Systema Naturae. He did not designate a type specimen. In 1837, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith created the new genus Poroderma for this species {{and the related}} leopard catshark (P. pantherinum, at the time believed to be multiple species). In 1908, the <b>pyjama</b> shark was made the type species of the genus by American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} <b>pyjama</b> shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the <b>pyjama</b> shark, which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Rather slow-swimming, the <b>pyjama</b> shark {{spends most}} of the day resting in caves or crevices or amongst kelp, {{emerging}} at night to actively forage for food. Many individuals may congregate at a single spot, particularly in summer. This species falls prey to larger sharks, {{and is one of the}} cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head, in a similar fashion to the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within. Like other sharks, the <b>pyjama</b> shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes. Experiments have shown that the shark's capacity for osmoregulation is dependent on how well it has fed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pyjama</b> shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>pyjama</b> shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its highly}} {{variable}} color pattern, the leopard catshark {{has historically been}} known under a multitude of names. In an 1837 issue of Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith listed without descriptions the new genus Poroderma, containing the species P.africanum (the <b>pyjama</b> shark), P.pantherinum, P.submaculatum, and P.variegatum. German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle assigned these sharks to the genus Scyllium, and in their 18381841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen furnished descriptions for S.pantherinum and S.variegatum, and listed two more names without description, S.leopardinum and S.maeandrinum. In 1934, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler described P.marleyi, characterized by large black spots.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a <b>pyjama,</b> known as a suthan.|$|E
5|$|The slow-swimming leopard {{catshark}} generally {{spends the}} day resting inside caves or crevices, either {{alone or in}} groups. At night, it moves towards the shore to actively forage for small bony fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In False Bay, fishes {{are the most important}} prey type, followed by cephalopods and then the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii). This shark has been observed attacking octopus and cuttlefish by seizing and tearing off tentacles with a twisting motion. Like its close relative the <b>pyjama</b> shark, it will temporarily abandon its nocturnal habits {{to take advantage of the}} daytime mass spawnings of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round with a peak from October to December. The sharks lie motionless amongst the squids' egg masses with their heads hidden, and make sudden lunges at female squid that have descended to the sea floor to attach their eggs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of her friend, Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Pandora (Lisa Backwell) tells Effy's mother, Anthea (Morwenna Banks), that she misses Thomas, who {{recently}} returned to his country of origin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a <b>pyjama</b> party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her neurotic mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed {{by the lack of}} boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they make with MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily to admit that she is gay, but Emily denies it. All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother's behaviour grow increasingly erratic. After Angela is carried into a bedroom to sleep, Pandora locks herself in the bathroom, upset about Thomas's departure and angry with Effy, who she believes spiked the brownies.|$|E

25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{presented by the}} prosecution included {{a piece of a}} man's <b>pyjama</b> top supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The <b>pyjama</b> bottoms were found in Crippen's bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer's label, Jones Bros. Curlers, with bleached hair consistent with Cora's were found with the remains. Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative, the store that the <b>pyjama</b> top fragment came from, stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the date of manufacture well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Bengali women {{commonly}} wear saris (shaŗi) and the salwar kameez, {{which are}} distinctly designed as per local customs. However, Western-style attire is also quite popular, especially amongst youngsters. Men wear traditional costumes {{such as the}} kurta with dhoti or <b>pyjama,</b> often on religious occasions.|$|E
25|$|Trestrail has {{hypothesized}} that the police planted the body parts and particularly the fragment of the <b>pyjama</b> top at the scene to incriminate Crippen. He suggests that Scotland Yard was under tremendous public pressure to find and bring to trial a suspect for this heinous crime. An independent observer {{points out that the}} case did not become public until after the remains were found.|$|E
25|$|Temple {{was back}} with a D'Oyly Carte touring company briefly the {{following}} year, playing <b>Pyjama</b> in The Nautch Girl. He then left the company again, making occasional appearances in London in L' Impresario at the Olympic Theatre in 1892, The Golden Web at the Lyric Theatre in 1893, Miami at Princess's Theatre in 1893, Morocco Bound, with music by Osmond Carr, at the Shaftesbury Theatre and then the Trafalgar Theatre in 189394, and Wapping Old Stairs at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1894, which he also directed.|$|E
500|$|A bottom-dwelling {{inhabitant}} of temperate inshore waters, the <b>pyjama</b> shark {{is found}} off South Africa, from Table Bay off Cape Town to north of East London. It is most abundant off the Western Cape, and may venture {{as far as}} Saldanha Bay {{in the west and}} KwaZulu-Natal in the east; old records from Mauritius, Madagascar, and Zaire are almost certainly erroneous. The <b>pyjama</b> shark is commonly encountered in very shallow intertidal and littoral waters no more than [...] deep, though in and around Algoa Bay it occurs at depths of [...] and has been reported to [...] It favors rocky reefs and beds of Ecklonia kelp.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pyjama</b> shark or striped {{catshark}} (Poroderma africanum) is {{a species}} of catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, endemic to the coastal waters of South Africa. This abundant, bottom-dwelling species can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of around , particularly over rocky reefs and kelp beds. With a series of thick, parallel, dark stripes running along its stout body, the <b>pyjama</b> shark has an unmistakable appearance. It is additionally characterized by a short head and snout with a pair of slender barbels that do not reach the mouth, and two dorsal fins that are placed far back on the body. It can grow up to a length of [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pyjama</b> shark {{feeds on}} a wide variety of small animals, {{including}} bony fishes such as anchovies, gurnards, and hakes, hagfishes, smaller sharks and rays and their egg cases, crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, and polychaete worms; it has also been known to scavenge on fish offal. Although it has a predilection for cephalopods, the dietary composition of this opportunistic predator generally reflects the locally available prey types. For example, in False Bay the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) is the most important food source, followed by cephalopods and then fish. <b>Pyjama</b> sharks have been observed seizing and tearing off tentacles from octopus and cuttlefish with a twisting motion; on one occasion three sharks were seen attacking an octopus simultaneously in this manner. During mass spawnings of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round but peak from October to December, <b>pyjama</b> sharks deviate from their nocturnal habits and gather in substantial numbers inside the squids' [...] "egg beds" [...] during daytime. The sharks conceal their heads amongst the egg masses, while their stripes break up the outlines of their bodies. As the female squid descend to the sea floor to attach their eggs, guarded by the males, they become vulnerable to the sharks' ambush attacks.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} common South African catsharks, the <b>pyjama</b> shark is {{harmless}} to humans and difficult to approach underwater. Because of its small size, attractive appearance, and hardiness, it is popularly exhibited by public aquariums. The aquarium trade supports a small fishery targeting this species and the similar leopard catshark. Large numbers of <b>pyjama</b> sharks are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries using longlines, gillnets, beach-seines, and bottom trawls; they are also readily hooked by recreational anglers, especially during the summer when they aggregate. Although edible, most are discarded while some are used for lobster bait. The toll taken by fishery bycatch is likely greatly underestimated, as many fishers who use line gear regard pajama sharks as pests that [...] "steal" [...] bait, and kill them before discarding them.|$|E

[...] After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's <b>pyjama</b> top.|$|E
500|$|An oviparous species, {{both male}} and female <b>pyjama</b> sharks seem to be reproductively active {{throughout}} the year. Adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts, with a single egg maturing in each at a time. The egg is contained in a tough, rectangular, dark brown capsule [...] long and [...] across, with long tendrils at the corners that enable the female to fasten the capsule to underwater structures such as algae stipes or gorgonians. Eggs maintained in aquariums hatch in approximately five and a half months, with the hatching shark measuring [...] long. Males and females begin to mature sexually at [...] and [...] long respectively, and all sharks are adult by a length of [...]|$|E

The episode was written by Bryan Elsley and Georgia Lester, and was {{directed}} by Simon Massey. The episode focuses {{on the character of}} Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell), who is miserable after her boyfriend, Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), recently returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She holds a small <b>pyjama</b> party for her friends, but it descends into chaos when uninvited guests arrive and the food is spiked with drugs. Pandora and Effy get into an argument after both girls have sex with James Cook (Jack O'Connell), but the argument is interrupted when Thomas unexpectedly returns.|$|E
500|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is oviparous {{and apparently}} reproduces throughout the year. Females produce two eggs at a time, one within each oviduct. Each egg {{is protected by}} a rectangular capsule [...] long and [...] across, which is light brown to olive in color and thinner-walled {{than those of the}} <b>pyjama</b> shark. The corners of the capsule bear long tendrils that enable the female to secure them to underwater structures. In the aquarium, the eggs hatch in approximately five and a half months. The hatchling shark measures [...] long; males and females begin to mature sexually at [...] and [...] long respectively, corresponding to an age of around 10 years. One source reports the maximum lifespan as at least 15 years, while another source gives at least 19 years.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pyjama</b> shark is {{the larger}} and thicker-bodied {{of the two}} Poroderma species, growing to [...] long and [...] or more in weight. Both sexes grow to roughly the same maximum size. The head and snout are short and {{slightly}} flattened, with a narrowly parabolic outline when viewed from above or below. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a flap of skin in front; the flap has a three-lobed shape with the central lobe forming a long, conical barbel. The barbels are thicker than in the leopard catshark, and do not reach the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed rather high on the head, with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and a thick ridge running underneath. The sizable mouth forms a broad arch, with short furrows extending from the corners onto both {{the upper and lower}} jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1825 and 1424 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively. The teeth have a slender central cusp flanked by a pair of small cusplets; those of adult males are slightly thicker than those of females.|$|E

The dark lashes of his closed eyes lay on deathly yellow cheeks; his thick hair grew rather low on his broad forehead. The lips were just open and showed strong white teeth. He had a little clipped moustache, and hair had grown on his {{clean-cut}} jaw. His <b>pyjama</b> jacket had fallen open. Gratian drew it close. It was curiously still, for a London day, though the window was wide open. Anything to break this heavy stupor, which was not only George's, but her own, and the very world's!

6000|$|DEAR, long neglected, {{though never}} {{forgotten}} Custodian, I write you from fairyland, {{where we are}} living in a fairy story, the guests of a beautiful brown princess. We came to stay a week, five weeks have passed, and we are still indefinite as to our time of leaving. It was chance brought us here, for no one in Papeete could tell us a word about this part of the island except that it was very fine to look at, and inhabited by wild people--"almost as wild as the people of Anaho!" [...] That touch about the people of Anaho inclined our hearts this way, so we finally concluded {{to take a look at}} the other side of Tahiti. The place of our landing was windy, uninhabited except by mosquitoes, and Louis was ill. The first day Lloyd and the Captain made an exploration, but came back disgusted. They had found a Chinaman, a long way off, who seemed to have some horses, but no desire to hire them to strangers, and they had found nothing else whatever. The next morning I took Valentine and went on a prospecting tour of my own. I found the Chinaman, persuaded him to let me have two horses and a wagon, and went back for the rest of my family. When asked where I wished to go, I could only say to the largest native village and the most wild. Ill as Louis was, I brought him the next day, and shall never cease to be thankful for my courage, for he has gained health and strength every day. He takes sea baths and swims, and lives almost entirely in the open air as nearly without clothes as possible, a simple <b>pyjama</b> suit of striped light flannel his only dress. As to shoes and stockings we all have scorned them for months except Mrs. Stevenson, who often goes barefoot and never, I believe, wears stockings. Lloyd's costume, in which he looks remarkably well, consists of a striped flannel shirt and a pareu. The pareu is no more or less than a large figured blue and white cotton window curtain twisted about the waist, and hanging a little below the bare knees. Both Louis and Lloyd wear wreaths of artificial flowers, made of the dried pandanus leaf, on their hats.|$|E
