30|$|In polymer <b>protection</b> <b>pieces,</b> {{polycarbonate}} {{is often}} used for its transparency and its high impact resistance. However, when dew appears it degrades light transmission and thus transparency. To solve this problem, anti-fogging surfaces are developed.To further understand the dew formation in natural environment in order to design high efficiency anti-fogging surfaces on polycarbonate, a recently designed dew tracking setup giving dew pictures and a digital imaging procedure allowing reliable and highly accurate droplet measurements were developed. Thanks to this setup, dew formation conditions such as relative humidity level and air temperature can be chosen and studied. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the evolution of the number of droplets according to the relative humidity and how it explains the droplet growth rate. The influence of the relative humidity (RH) on the growth rate of non-coalescing dropwise condensation has already been observed. This paper is based on these existing results as a comparison to validate the experimental setup and the post-processing analysis. We shall also use the number of droplets to further explain the role of the RH on condensation dynamics.Moreover, by applying a light subcooling, the growth kinetics were slowed down in order to observe every characteristic phase in detail and even particular intermediate phases.|$|R

50|$|Unlike most {{climbing}} equipment, dynamic ropes do {{not have}} a rated tensile breaking strength. Instead, the strength of a rope is tested by the number of standard test falls a rope can sustain before breaking. The test falls use an 80 kg weight for single ropes (55 kg for half ropes), and a fall factor of 1.7 (4 meter fall on 2.3 meters of rope). This tests simulates a very hard fall that would rarely occur. When climbing, it is possible to produce a fall factor as high as 2, however, real-world climbing situations include additional shock absorbing elements which are not included in the test standard, such as the body of both the climber and belayer, elasticity of their harnesses and anchor materials, and friction between the rope and the belay device, and any <b>protection</b> <b>pieces.</b> Single ropes must sustain at least 5 such falls before breaking, and a rope that can sustain more than 9 falls is considered a 'multifall' rope. In practice, climbing ropes rarely if ever break due to a fall alone- all documented rope failures involve the rope being cut or damaged, for example by abrasion against a sharp rock edge. Ropes are especially vulnerable to being cut while they are weighted with the body of the climber, and moving over a sharp edge (for example if a following climber is resting his weight on the rope, or using the rope for assistance, while swinging or traversing under a roof, while being belayed from above). In general, thicker ropes will be stronger and more durable, and have a higher fall rating.|$|R

40|$|Created by the {{interactions}} of living organisms with their environment, ecosystem services support our society in many critical ways, from providing clean air and water, decomposing waste, and pollinating flowers, to regulating climate, and pacifying floodwaters. Interest in ecosystem service markets has recently exploded, with a cover article in The Economist {{just a few months}} ago. Scholarship in the field, though, is still quite young. Despite their immense practical value, with rare exception, ecosystem services are neither prized by markets nor explicitly protected by the law. In recent years, an increasing number of initiatives around the world have sought to create markets for services, some dependent on government intervention and some created by entirely private ventures. These experiences have demonstrated that investing in natural capital rather than built capital can make both economic and policy sense.

5000|$|The first routes {{put up on}} new cliffs {{almost always}} follow cracks, due to the ease of placing <b>protection,</b> or <b>pieces</b> of {{equipment}} which arrest a fall, while on lead. Slab climbs rarely have cracks or other features that can be protected. Therefore, slab climbs are usually discovered well after the cracks are all climbed, since easier routes to the summit exist. Slab climbs can be dangerous to lead climb using traditional protection, or removable gear that fits into rock features, since the scarcity of natural features where protection can be placed results in long sections where the climber is exposed to long falls - over 150 ft on some routes. As a result, {{it was not until}} the introduction of bolting routes that hard slab lines could be climbed. In 1927, Laurent Grivel designed the first rock drill and expansion bolt, which paved the way for protecting climbs such as slab. The next advancement for slab climbing did not come until 1980 when Boreal marketed the first [...] "sticky rubber" [...] shoe, allowing friction climbing to be more feasible. Before this, most climbing was done in boots or thick soled shoes, which prevents the climber from making the balance dependent moves required on slab walls. Slab climbing saw a dramatic increase in the number of new routes with the introduction of lightweight, electric drills in the 1980s, but slowed down as criticism of permanent bolting grew, and electric drills became illegal in many National Parks and Wilderness Areas. A new generation of climbers has begun to revive slab climbing, putting up some of the hardest routes in the world.|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{protection}} {{is designed to}} promote and protect interests of consumers. As consumers always have a weak bargaining power, there is every need to protect them through adequate and effective laws (Yusoff, Ismail, Markom, & Zakuan, 2015). In today's challenging environment, consumers {{have to deal with}} current technology, mass-marketing tactics, high-pressure salesmanship and sharp advertising (Sabri, 2014). Malaysian market is not free from these challenges. Consumer {{protection is}} aimed at upholding justice and fairness in all commercial transactions between purchaser consumers and sellers or manufacturers. Consumer protection seems to alleviate the sufferings of consumers who are at a disadvantage in the market place. In view of the importance of protecting the basic rights of a consumer, the United Nations Assembly adopted the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection on 9 April 1985 (Wan Jusoh, Othman, Nuruddin, & Ahmad, 2001). Since then, United Nations member countries have used these guidelines as their reference and have passed consumer protection or related legislations. In Malaysia, the main legislations governing the supply of goods are the Sale of Goods Act 1957 (SOGA) and the Consumer Protection Act 1999 (CPA). Despite the availability of such protection, nevertheless in the area of supply of goods, freedom of contract and caveat emptor still remain predominantly the underlying concepts in consumer contracts in Malaysia. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the existing Malaysian laws dealing with the sale of goods mainly SOGA and CPA, especially in terms of their adequacy in protecting consumers. The paper argues that the existing Malaysian laws, especially SOGA is not a consumer <b>protection</b> oriented <b>piece</b> of legislation. Many of its principles are based on the common law principles during the 1 8 th and 19 th centuries during which freedom of contract and laissez faire were widely practiced (Yusoff et al., 2015). Hence, this Act contains provisions which defeat consumer protection expectations and interests. On the other hand, the CPA being supplemental and without prejudice to any other law regulating contractual relations has indeed reduced the effectiveness of this long awaited legislation (Yusoff, Ismail, Aziz, Isa & Talib, 201 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{research}} {{focus of}} this thesis is {{on the development of}} the next generation of solid lubricants for high temperature forming of steel. These lubricants are based on ceramic nanoparticles which are more resistant to temperature and oxidation than traditional lubricants. Nowadays, the most common products are aqueous suspensions of graphite, molybdenum disulfide or polytetrafluoroethylene (TeflonTM). Nevertheless, some problems are associated to their use, for instance pitting corrosion on the steel surface caused by partial decomposition of the lubricants at high temperature, and, more in general, a dirty working environment. Advanced inorganic solid lubricants were developed to overcome these problems. The performance of solid lubricants in forging processes is correlated with their plastic behavior. This means that when a force is applied, needed to shape the metal piece, the lubricants should absorb part of the force, transforming it into a physical deformation or a chemical change. The role of the lubricant is to decrease the necessary forces to form the metal <b>pieces,</b> <b>protection</b> of the metal surface, and/or participation in the process of releasing the piece from the mold. It is straightforward to think that the plasticity (softness) of solid lubricants originates from naturally soft networks. At first glance, a common lubrication mechanism can be inferred from the mechanical behavior of the different materials. The plastic deformability of the networks seems to be connected to the ease of dislocation propagation in the network. In this thesis, this property was explored by studying three different classes of materials: (1) soft structured networks, i. e. layered oxides; (2) soft atomic networks, i. e. bismuth metal and (3) soft amorphous networks, i. e. organosilicas. Control over the synthesis and chemical modification is an important factor to obtain materials that can be part of the new generation of solid lubricants. Some of the tested materials were able to outperform graphite in terms of a decrease of friction force. The results of this research are the input for the achievement of the next generation of solid lubricants for high temperature applications...|$|R

40|$|Information is a {{vital part}} for most organizations, not least for state {{agencies}} as they handle personal data for every citizen, such as medical records, social security numbers and other sensitive information. It is therefore critical to protect the information assets at a sufficient level according to its value. Information security aims to do this by preserving the properties of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. This means that accurate and complete information shall be accessible and usable by an authorized entity upon demand. Swedish state agencies are obliged to manage their information security by the implementation of an information security management system (ISMS). The ISMS has {{to be set up}} and operated in compliance with the international standards ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, but these standards are somewhat vague in describing how to perform certain procedures. One part of the ISMS consists of the process of classifying the information, a process that according to the result from a survey by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) is troublesome (MSB, 2014), especially for smaller-sized agencies. In this classification process, a classification scheme is used to determine the consequences to the organisation if the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information is jeopardized. The result of this process determines the level of <b>protection</b> that each <b>piece</b> of information asset will receive at a later stage. It is vital to classify the assets at a suitable level to avoid over or under classification, as the former can lead to unnecessary costs and difficulties in using the assets, and the latter can put the asset at risk of unauthorized access. The interest from the academic world have however been low regarding research focused on the 27000 series of standards, compared to the more mature ISO/IEC 9000 and ISO/IEC 14000 series. This thesis project aims to investigate how the classification scheme has been simplified and to identify enabling factors from the development and use of simplified classification schemes. The research questions for this thesis project are: In which ways have a number of Swedish state agencies simplified their information classification schemes? Which factors have influenced the development and use of a simplified classification scheme? A mixed method, an embedded case study, was used, including both a review of existing information security policies for the state agencies to gather information about current information classification models and schemes, as well as interviews with the chiefs of information security for the state agencies regarding the development and usage of a simplified information classification scheme. In total, 120 documents from 81 agencies were reviewed and 7 interviews were completed. The results from the study shows that the state agencies that have simplified their classification scheme do so by focusing on one aspect: confidentiality. The agencies motivate this by a number of reasons: The aspects integrity and availability are regarded complex and difficult for the end user to relate to and classify. In order to simplify for the end user these aspects are handled by the IT department and the IT environment The integrity and availability aspects are more or less built into the IT environment and thus handled automatically as long as the end user correctly classifies the information asset according to the confidentiality aspect and handles the information according to the handling guidelines The study also shows the need for a national, common set of handling guidelines and consequence levels for the classification scheme as this would simplify and improve the security in communication between the state agencie...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} project proceeds {{through three}} papers, analyzing {{issues related to}} software interoperability and respectively pertaining {{to one of the}} three following interdependent levels of analysis. The first level addresses the legal status of software interoperability information under current intellectual property law (focusing on copyright law, which is the main legal tool for the <b>protection</b> of these <b>pieces</b> of code), trying to clarify if, how and to what extent theses pieces of code (and the associated pieces of information) are protected erga omnes by the law. The second level complements the first one, analyzing legal and economic issues related to the technical possibility of actually accessing this interoperability information through reverse engineering (and software decompilation in particular). Once a de facto standard gains the favor of the market, reverse engineering is the main self-help tool available to competitors in order to achieve interoperability and compete "inside this standard". The third step consists in recognizing that - in a limited number of cases, but which are potentially of great economic relevance - market failures could arise, despite any care taken in devising checks and balances in the legal setting concerning both the legal status of interoperability information and the legal rules governing software reverse engineering. When this is the case, some undertakings may stably gain a dominant position in software markets, and possibly abuse it. Hence, at this level of analysis, competition policy intervention is taken into account. The first paper of the present dissertation shows that interoperability specifications are not protected by copyright. In the paper, I argue that existing doubts and uncertainty are typically related to a poor understanding of the technical nature of software interfaces. To remedy such misunderstanding, the paper focuses on the distinction between interface specifications and implementations and stresses the difference between the steps needed to access to the ideas and principle constituting an interfaces specification and the re-implementation of a functionally equivalent interface through new software code. At the normative level, the paper shows that no major modifications to the existing model of legal protection of software (and software interfaces) are needed; however, it suggests that policymakers could reduce the Fear of legal actions, other forms of legal Uncertainty and several residual Doubts (FUD) by explicitly stating that interface specifications are unprotectable and freely appropriable. In the second paper, I offer a critique of legal restraints on software reverse engineering, focusing in particular on Europe, but considering also similar restraints in the US, in particular {{in the context of the}} Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Through an analysis of entry conditions for late comers and of the comparative costs of developing programs in the first place or reverse engineering them, the paper shows that limitations on decompilation imposed by article 6 of the Software Directive were mostly superfluous and basically non-binding at the time of drafting. What is more, the paper shows that nowadays new - and largely unanticipated - developments in software development models (e. g. open source) make these restraints an obstacle to competition against dominant incumbent controlling software platforms. In fact, limitations on the freedom to decompile obstacle major reverse engineering projects performed in a decentralized way, as in the context of an open source community. Hence, since open source projects are the most credible tools to recreate some competitive pressure in a number of crucial software markets, the paper recommends creating a simpler and clear-cut safe harbor for software reverse engineering. The third paper claims that, in software markets, refusal-to-deal (or "information-withholding") strategies are normally complementary with tying (or "predatory-innovation") strategies, and that this complementarity is so relevant that dominant platform controllers need to couple both in order to create significant anti- competitive effects. Hence, the paper argues that mandatory unbundling (i. e. mandating a certain degree of modularity in software development) could be an appropriate - and frequently preferable - alternative to mandatory disclosure of interoperability information. However, considering the critiques moved from part of the literature to the Commission's Decision in the recent European Microsoft antitrust case, an objection to the previous argument could be that - also in the case of mandatory unbundling - one should still determine the minimum price for the unbundled product. The last part of the paper applies some intuitions coming from the literature concerning complementary oligopoly to demonstrate that this objection is not well grounded and that - in software markets - mandatory unbundling (modularity) may be a useful policy even if the only constraint on the price of the unbundled good is the one of non-negativit...|$|R
