5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in {{point-to-point}} rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A <b>progress</b> <b>indicator</b> is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E

However, Maryland {{has been using}} Genuine <b>Progress</b> <b>Indicator,</b> an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2013 median household income of $72,483 which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively. Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the second and eleventh wealthiest counties in the nation respectively. Maryland ranked No. 1 with the most millionaires per capita in 2013, with a ratio of 7.7 percent. Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8 percent is {{the lowest in the}} country. per capita personal income in 2006 was $43,500, fifth in the nation. As of May 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 5.5 percent.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of his}} {{investigation}} into why economic policies so frequently worsened the ecological situation, in the 1980s Cobb decided to re-evaluate Gross National Product (GNP) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as measures of economic progress. [...] Together with his son, Clifford Cobb, he developed an alternative model, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), [...] which sought to [...] "consolidate economic, environmental, and social elements into a common framework to show net progress." [...] The name of the metric would later change to Genuine <b>Progress</b> <b>Indicator</b> (GPI). [...] A recent (2013) article has shown that global GPI per capita peaked in 1978, meaning that the social and environmental costs of economic growth have outweighed the benefits since that time.|$|E
2500|$|... 2006 – The Genuine <b>Progress</b> <b>Indicator</b> was {{updated from}} a green {{measurement}} {{system to a}} broader concept that included quantitative measurement of well-being and happiness. The new measure is motivated by {{the philosophy of the}} GNH and the same notion of that subjective measures like well-being are more relevant and important than more objective measures like consumption. It is not measured directly, but only the factors which are believed to lead to it.|$|E
2500|$|... 2005 – Med Jones of the International Institute of Management {{introduced}} the first GNH Index and Global GNH Index Survey. The GNH Index, {{also known as}} Gross National Well-being (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic development framework. Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon {{the gross domestic product}} (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the Genuine <b>Progress</b> <b>Indicator</b> was focused on the environmental cost of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the Human Development Index (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness. The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall knowledge level (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it [...] is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year). [...] To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year). [...] They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that [...] "the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.|$|E
40|$|Timely and {{appropriate}} feedback and <b>indicators</b> of <b>progress</b> can motivate learners. Mobile learning poses {{a challenge to}} established instructional strategies with respect to delivering feedback and monitoring learner progress, particularly in informal and incidental learning occurring outside of formal structured learning environments. We argue that well-designed and managed feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> can offer guidance {{and a sense of}} structure to learners {{in the absence of a}} formal curriculum, accreditation or set outcomes. Furthermore, they can encourage casual users of mobile applications to move from fragmented learning episodes towards a more long term and reflective learning journey. In this paper we describe how we are developing feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> for the EU-funded MASELTOV project, which explores how smartphones can support language learning and social inclusion for recent immigrants to Europe. Presenting educational services and materials on mobile devices allows learning episodes to be incorporated into daily activities and schedules, to be accessed at times and in places that suit learners best. Feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> embedded into these services may motivate such an audience to reconceptualise fragmentary, ephemeral educational experiences into a more coherent, sustained learning journey. We describe how feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> have been used successfully in web-based and games-based learning, and our assessment of which types may best support incidental mobile learning and the challenges we face...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} a minimum set of abiotic and biotic threshold <b>indicators</b> and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> for forest landscape restoration (FLR), then also briefly discusses <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> of pressures and project outputs. FLR aims to restore multiple functions of forests at a landscape scale. It {{is predicated on}} the hypothesis that restoration produces enabling conditions for ecosystem services, including regulating services such as carbon sequestration and pollination, and provisioning services such as food and energy. As FLR gains greater uptake, it is increasingly important to monitor progress. The types of indicators required {{are influenced by the}} degree of forest loss and degradation. To measure the status of land under restoration, one or more abiotic and biotic threshold indicators are required, measuring the return of enabling conditions for restoration (soil quality, water, etc.), along with <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> measuring the reemergence of the ecosystem services. Although all elements of the proposed monitoring framework are well known, compiling them into a coherent system, suitable for application {{in a wide range of}} conditions, will take much further development...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{explores the}} range of feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> (FPIs) {{that can be used}} to support incidental, mobile learning for the target MASELTOV audience, recent immigrants to the EU. We propose that feedback, and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> (we differentiate between the two) should play an instrumental role in helping learners reflect upon individual, often isolated learning episodes mediated by single MASELTOV services, and enable them to reconceive them as constituting elements of a coherent, larger learning journey. The goal of feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> is to support the motivation for learning and from this the social inclusion of recent immigrants. Our underpinning assumption is that the MASELTOV software designers’ goal should be to encourage not just resolution of immediate challenges (e. g. finding a doctor, translating a sign) but a user’s reflection on their continuing progress towards integration into the host country, including improving their language skills. We define feedback as responses to a learner’s performance against criteria of quality and as a means of directing and encouraging the learner; and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> as responses indicating the current position of a learner within a larger activity or journey (often related to time). Drawing partly from the worlds of web-based language learning and video games, we identify which feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> may best support incidental mobile learning, and the major challenges faced. For some MASELTOV services, feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators</b> for large scale learning journeys are less apparent (e. g. TextLens, the MASELTOV tool that enables a user to take a photo of a sign and convert the image into text, potentially for future viewing or translation), while some services are explicitly educational (e. g. language lessons). However we see all of these as potentially part of an ecology of services that can support social inclusion, so all tools should include FPIs that encourage broader learning goals. In this document we draw on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages as appropriate, and also reflect on learner perspectives (derived from WP 2 and WP 9 findings) to identify suitable FPIs, as well as being informed by academic literature. Furthermore, we recommend FPIs that would be suitable for the MASELTOV tools and services. The remainder of the deliverable handles the four identified key areas where mobile incidental learning particularly requires FPIs: 1. 	encouraging reflection 2. 	future goal setting 3. 	planning 4. 	social learning It should be noted that this document is a high level review, identifying significant literature and key examples of FPIs in practice. This document offers recommendations therefore in general terms. Decisions about specific FPIs to be implemented will be made in coordination with technical partners to identify which MASELTOV services and tools will support which specific feedback and <b>progress</b> <b>indicators,</b> and how they will be implemented within the system. ...|$|R
