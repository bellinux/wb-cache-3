40|$|To {{evaluate}} the <b>pre-stress</b> in the menisci {{of a human}} knee joint, the technique of microindentation was adopted. Five specimens each for lateral and medial menisci attached to the tibia were prepared from the knee joints of Korean cadavers to represent the <b>pre-stress</b> state of the meniscus. To create test specimens for the stress-free state of the meniscus, each meniscus was resected from the tibia and cut into three parts, which were subsequently attached to a metal plate. Indentations were carried out in each meniscus in both the <b>pre-stress</b> state and the stress-free state. The <b>pre-stresses</b> in the menisci were evaluated using the load-versus-depth curves. Compressive <b>pre-stresses</b> {{were found in the}} menisci. For each indentation region, the <b>pre-stresses</b> in the medial meniscus were higher than in the lateral meniscus. The highest <b>pre-stress</b> in both the lateral and medial meniscus was found in the posterior regions, while the anterior regions experienced the lowest <b>pre-stress.</b> The obtained <b>pre-stresses</b> can be used for the accurate numerical analysis, the fabrication of artificial menisci, and the diagnosis of meniscal disease progression for human knee joints. ope...|$|R

Waves in the <b>pre-stressed</b> medium are bent around the cloaked region by inducing inhomogeneous stress fields via <b>pre-stress.</b> The equation governing antiplane waves in the <b>pre-stressed</b> medium is equivalent to the antiplane equation in an unstressed medium with inhomogeneous and anisotropic shear modulus and isotropic scalar mass density. Note however that these properties are induced naturally by the <b>pre-stress.</b> Since the magnitude of <b>pre-stress</b> can be altered at will, this enables objects of varying size and shape to be cloaked by placing them inside the fluid-filled deformed cavity region.

40|$|Abstract. The bonded {{particle}} model (BPM) {{of granite}} for <b>pre-stressed</b> machining is build {{by using the}} discrete element method (DEM). This model can not only descript the intergranular fracture behavior but also the transgranular fracture behavior of the granite. The processes of crack propaga-tion under different <b>pre-stressed</b> machining conditions are studied by means of DEM simulation. Damages and cracks of surface/subsurface are also observed. The simulation results show that, while the magnitude of <b>pre-stress</b> is controlled in a certatin range, the number of radial cracks reduce as the increasing of <b>pre-stress</b> magnitude, contray to the transverse cracks. It could be seen that maching damage is decreased and surface quality is improved by applying the <b>pre-stressed</b> machining method, and the discrete element method is {{an effective way to}} simulate the machining process of granite...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pre-stressed</b> beams are broadly {{applied in}} the highway, urban and railway bridges. In design process of these beams, the <b>pre-stress</b> forces are {{determined}} according to the current standards and theoretical formulas but, during the serviceability service life of a bridge, many factors such as relaxation of steel, shrinkage, creep of concrete and ambient temperature {{can lead to the}} change of the applied <b>pre-stress</b> forces. Therefore, in order to effectively control the operating state and the bearing capacity of bridges, {{it is very important to}} identify the <b>pre-stress</b> losses. The proposed method is the extension of the Simplified Formula of Galef [Galef, 1968] to generic <b>pre-stressed</b> bridge beams for the identification of their <b>pre-stress</b> forces. The procedure is suitable for any slender simply-supported beam of any bridge. Making use of the first natural frequencies of the unloaded and loaded beam under investigation, the Simplified Formula is able to estimate the <b>pre-stress</b> force, knowing the respective buckling load. Most of the existing dynamic methods are particularly sensitive to experimental and model errors in which it is also difficult to select a-priori the best natural frequency that will estimate the <b>pre-stress</b> force. In fact, different natural frequencies values lead different precisions in the estimations. The proposed procedure does not require any selection of the best mode shape to be used in the identification process. Numerical tests on two post-tensioned concrete and steel beams confirm the robustness of the non-destructive method even in the presence of moderate parameter errors...|$|R
40|$|Cold drawn AISI 4140 beams were LASER surface {{hardened}} with a 2 kW CO 2 LASER. Specimens {{were treated}} {{in the free state}} and while restrained in a bending fixture inducing surface tensile stresses of 94 and 230 MPa. Knoop hardness indentation was used to evaluate the through thickness hardness distribution, and a layer removal methodology was used to evaluate the residual stress distribution. Results showed the maximum surface hardness attained was not affected by <b>pre-stress</b> during hardening, and ranged from 513 to 676 kg/mm 2. The depth of effective hardening varied at different magnitudes of <b>pre-stress,</b> but did not vary proportionately to the <b>pre-stress.</b> The surface residual stress, coinciding with the maximum compressive residual stress, increased as <b>pre-stress</b> was increased, from 1040 MPa for the nominally treated specimens to 1270 MPa for specimens <b>pre-stressed</b> to 230 MPa. The maximum tensile residual stress observed in the specimens decreased from 1060 MPa in the nominally treated specimens to 760 MPa for specimens <b>pre-stressed</b> to 230 MPa. Similarly, thickness of the compressive residual stress region increased and the depth at which maximum tensile residual stress occurred increased as the <b>pre-stress</b> during treatment was increased Overall, application of tensile elastic <b>pre-stress</b> during LASER hardening is beneficial to the development of compressive residual stress in AISI 4140, with minimal impact to the hardness attained from the treatment. The newly developed approach for LASER hardening may support efforts to increase both the wear and fatigue resistance of parts made from hardenable steels...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pre-stress</b> {{degradation}} or looseness of rock bolts in mining or tunnel engineering {{threatens the}} stability and reliability of the structures. In this paper, an innovative piezoelectric device named a “smart washer” with the impedance method is proposed {{with the aim of}} developing a real-time device to monitor the <b>pre-stress</b> level of rock bolts. The proposed method was verified through tests on a rock bolt specimen. By applying high-frequency sweep excitations (typically > 30 kHz) to the smart washer that was installed on the rock bolt specimen, we observed that the variation in impedance signatures indicated the rock bolt <b>pre-stress</b> status. With the degradation of rock bolt <b>pre-stress,</b> the frequency in the dominating peak of the real part of the electrical impedance signature increased. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a normalized root mean square deviation (RMSD) index was developed to evaluate the degradation level of the rock bolt <b>pre-stress.</b> The experimental results demonstrated that the normalized RMSD-based looseness index, which was computed from the impedance value detected by the “smart washer”, increased with loss of the <b>pre-stress</b> of the rock bolt. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively detect the degradation of rock bolt <b>pre-stress,</b> as demonstrated by experiments...|$|R

40|$|This work investigates {{theoretically}} the phonon {{property and}} thermal conductivity of rectangular silicon nanowires under <b>pre-stress</b> and surface stress. In {{the framework of}} elasticity theory, the effects of spatial confinement are considered in the phonon dispersion relation of a stressed nanowire. The surface energy, which brings about the variation of the elastic modulus of nanowire and the influence on the phonon property, is then involved. Under a <b>pre-stress</b> field, the acoustoelastic effect {{gives rise to the}} change of phonon properties and thermal conductivity. Our numerical results demonstrate that the applied surface stress and <b>pre-stress</b> field can alter the phonon dispersion relation of a silicon nanowire significantly. The phonon energy increases if the surface stress is negative and the <b>pre-stress</b> is positive, and vice versa. The changes of phonon dispersion relation as well as the various phonon scattering rates lead to the variation of phonon thermal conductivity, which is the consequence of the surface stress and <b>pre-stress</b> fields.
