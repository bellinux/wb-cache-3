5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E

50|$|By the 18th century, the {{ceremony}} had {{changed to a}} glorified flag day. Salt was no longer scattered on scholars; instead, <b>pinches</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> and little blue tickets were sold to passers-by (the blue ticket - inscribed on alternate celebrations with 'Mos Pro Lege' or 'Pro More et Monte' - acted as a ticket of exemption from further contributions) for 'salt' - money that went towards the anticipated expenses of the Captain of the School (the senior Colleger) at King's College, Cambridge. Collecting was restricted to two 'salt-bearers' (also senior boys at the college) and ten or twelve 'servitors' or 'runners' who between them covered all the roads around Eton and Windsor.|$|R
25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (A Jug of Punch, A <b>Pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salt</b> and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E

2500|$|For all his unorthodox stances, Pogor was {{regarded}} by all his colleagues as a towering intellect, {{and referred to}} as [...] "the contemporary library".

Vianu describes his [...] "merciless gibes" [...] as stemming from a conviction that the others were too uptight, and in general from a rejection of [...] "dogmatism"; Pogor, he writes, would [...] "embrace in turn all sorts of attitudes". Another scholar, Șerban Cioculescu, describes Pogor as by character [...] "a free, unambitious, spirit, an epicurean of intelligence". Similarly, Ornea cautions: [...] "If Maiorescu has conferred a consistent substance to Junimea, then Pogor gave it a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> wit, humor and—an essential element—skepticism, that is to say a sense of relativity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wrangel and Cochrane visited Zashiversk {{after the}} {{population}} was hit by the first outbreak of smallpox in 1816. The second outbreak, in 1840, killed all the remaining settlers (or, according to different accounts, spared just one girl). Depopulation of Zashiversk spawned a Siberian legend: when local traders found a chest abandoned at the fairground, a shaman prohibited opening the chest while an Orthodox priest agreed to open it. Traders opened the chest ... and released the grim reaper. According to George Kennan, in 1879 the bureaucracy believed that the deserted town still existed, and dispatched Hermann Schiller, a political exile from Poltava, on a 3,700 mile march on foot to Zashiversk. Only then did {{the news of the}} town's demise reach the government, and Schiller was taken on another year's journey to Srednekolymsk. A similar fictional story was retold by Adam Szymansky in A <b>Pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salt.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} use of the Bird-Meertens Formalism as a vehicle for the {{construction}} of programs with massive implicit parallelism. We show that a simple result from the theory, concerning the expression of list homomorphisms, can help us in our search for parallel algorithms and demonstrate its application to some simple problems including the maximum segment sum problem. Our main purpose is to show that an understanding of the homomorphism lemma can be helpful in producing programs for problems which are "not quite" list homomorphisms themselves. A more general goal is to illustrate the benefits which can arise from taking a little theory with a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>salt.</b> 1 Introduction The use of bulk operations on aggregate data sets as a means of generating programs {{with a high degree of}} implicit parallelism has a long history (e. g. see [4] for a recent presentation).

5000|$|Cau cau is a meal {{consisting}} of mondongo or tripe stew {{and accompanied by}} rice. There {{are a number of}} versions of Cau-Cau. In general cau-cau is a style of cooking being there seafood cau-cau, shellfish cau-cau, etc. Two noteworthy styles are the creole style simply called Tripe Cau-Cau, and the Italo-Peruvian style. The creole is made with strips of previously cooked tripe, seasoned by a mixture of sauteed onions, garlic, yellow aji, a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> turmeric, <b>salt</b> and pepper and chunks of boiled potatoes. The mixed is allowed to cook together to blend the tastes and acquire consistency. It is then sprinkled with spearmint or mint.Some add vinegar for added flavour before eating.

It is {{commonly}} sold around March and April.Murici: Nominally a tropical tree native to the Amazon, scientific name Byrsonima verbascifolia. The fruit it bears is small and yellow, with a slightly acid but very good flavor, used in juices and ice cream.Piquia: More appreciated by low-income populations that consume it cooked, by extracting its pulp straight from the seed, along with cassava flour, or adding the peeled fruit to beans broth, beef stew or rice. Can also be added to black coffee.Pupunha: Cooked with <b>pinches</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> it is sold mainly in the city's popular markets like Ver-o-Peso. However, for some time now, {{there has been an}} interest in broadening and enriching the fruit's possibilities by attempting, through handicraft or otherwise, the confection of liquors, ice cream, candy in syrup or in paste, all with excellent results. Rich in nutrients, it is also part of the local economy. It has been used in typical restaurants as a side order for beef dishes, caramelized or mashed.Tapereba: Very appreciated as a flavor of ice cream, juices, popsicles or any other form of sweets, the high point of tapereba is the famous drink found anywhere from back-alley bars to high-class receptions.Tucuma: Contains an exceptional supply of vitamins, being a source of pro-vitamins A and B1, and vitamin C. The people, mainly the stateside and riverside, which certainly consume the fruit often, benefits greatly from it.Tucuma-açu: Also called jabarana, is a larger variant of the tucuma fruit (açu being the Tupi-Guarani word for “large”).Umari: Native and exclusive of Pará. It is often enjoyed naturally or with cassava flour.Uxi: Consumed naturally or with cassava flour, it is certainly an important complement to the caboclo people's meals, as well as among the low-income population, in the capital and major cities.

Here De Hory appears as an aggressive and persistent con man, who suckers Legros into the belief that he is a needy impoverished aristocrat deserving of Legros charity, whereas in reality he is a person wanted by Interpol under a multitude of different aliases and convicted of a variety of crimes, forgery and fraud not being the least of them.

It bore evidence of the intense heat in cracked fissures and the crumbling debris that lay at its feet. Key picked up some of the still warm fragments, and was not surprised that they easily broke in a gritty, grayish powder in his hands. In spite of his preoccupation with the human interest, the instinct of the prospector was still strong upon him, and he almost mechanically put some of the pieces in his pockets. Then after another careful survey of the locality for any further record of its vanished tenants, he returned to his horse. Here he took from his saddle-bags, half listlessly, a precious phial encased in wood, and, opening it, poured into another thick glass vessel part of a smoking fluid; he then crumbled some of the calcined fragments into the glass, and watched the ebullition that followed with mechanical gravity. When it had almost ceased he drained off the contents into another glass, which he set down, and then proceeded to pour some water from his drinking-flask into the ordinary tin cup which formed part of his culinary traveling-kit. Into this he put three or four <b>pinches</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> from his provision store. Then dipping his fingers into the salt and water, he allowed a drop to fall into the glass. A white cloud instantly gathered in the colorless fluid, and then fell in a fine film {{to the bottom of the}} glass. Key's eyes concentrated suddenly, the listless look left his face. His fingers trembled lightly as he again let the salt water fall into the solution, with exactly the same result! Again and again he repeated it, until the bottom of the glass was quite gray with the fallen precipitate. And his own face grew as gray.|$|R
