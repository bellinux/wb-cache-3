5|$|After {{working through}} their post launch checklists, the crew opened the <b>payload</b> bay doors, {{deployed}} the Ku band antenna, {{and moved into}} the robotic activities portion of the day, which included {{a survey of the}} <b>payload</b> bay and crew cabin survey with the orbiter's robotic arm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, flying aboard Atlantis was the GPP <b>payload</b> which {{consisted}} of two experiments – the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The <b>payload</b> was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and Mir glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the <b>payload</b> adaptor, and encapsulated in the <b>payload</b> fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{technology}} requirements {{associated with}} sensing and {{data acquisition system}}s were assessed for future space missions.

5|$|The RFC 6520 Heartbeat Extension tests TLS/DTLS secure {{communication}} links by allowing a computer {{at one end}} of a connection to send a Heartbeat Request message, consisting of a <b>payload,</b> typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same <b>payload</b> back to the sender.|$|E
5|$|The {{affected}} {{versions of}} OpenSSL allocate a memory buffer for {{the message to}} be returned based on the length field in the requesting message, {{without regard to the}} actual size of that message's <b>payload.</b> Because of this failure to do proper bounds checking, the message returned consists of the <b>payload,</b> possibly followed by whatever else {{happened to be in the}} allocated memory buffer.|$|E
5|$|The orbiter {{carried the}} Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) pallet in its forward <b>payload</b> bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry test equipment. The pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments.

5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission <b>payload</b> was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's <b>payload</b> bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a <b>Payload</b> Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E

By this time, the company had moved to Burscough Bridge, Ormskirk.|$|R
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle <b>Payload</b> Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The <b>payload</b> integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|CryptoWall 3.0 used a <b>payload</b> {{written in}} JavaScript {{as part of}} an email attachment, which {{downloads}} executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs spyware that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the <b>payload</b> bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the <b>payload</b> bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E

5|$|Originally, PSLV-C37 was set {{to launch}} on 27 January 2017 with 83 satellites. With the {{addition}} of twenty more satellites to the <b>payload,</b> the schedule was changed to 15 February 2017.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives <b>payload</b> data; LOI 2 receives <b>payload</b> data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 set many records {{over the}} next few years.

5|$|While the 747-100 {{powered by}} Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough <b>payload</b> and range for US {{domestic}} operations, it was marginal for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased <b>payload</b> quickly {{led to the}} improved -200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. A few early -200s retained the three-window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side. The 747-200 was produced in passenger (-200B), freighter (-200F), convertible (-200C), and combi (-200M) versions.|$|E
