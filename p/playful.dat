5|$|Although sea otters can be <b>playful</b> and sociable, {{they are}} not {{considered}} to be truly social animals. They spend much time alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller became {{well known}} in his later life for the {{practice}} of giving dimes to adults and nickels to children wherever he went. He even gave dimes as a <b>playful</b> gesture to wealthy men, such as tire mogul Harvey Firestone.|$|E
5|$|The Singapura is {{described}} by the CFA as active, curious and <b>playful.</b> They are affectionate and desire human interaction. They {{have a tendency to}} perch on high places, to allow them a better view of their surrounding.|$|E
5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his <b>playful</b> flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This {{is reflected in the}} origin of the name, which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally <b>playful</b> approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E
5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} curious and <b>playful.</b> The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately {{this can lead to}} health issues as they may ingest the items.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as <b>playful</b> synonyms of the name. In common parlance and in historical documents, the term daffodil may refer specifically to populations or specimens of the wild daffodil, N. pseudonarcissus. H. N. Ellacombe suggests this may be from Saffon Lilly, citing Prior in support, though admittedly conjectural.|$|E
5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males {{may have a}} black patch {{on the head and}} the neck. Young are precocial - they can stand on their own soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and <b>playful</b> throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|In another temple ritual, the pharaoh {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} game {{in honor of}} the Eye goddesses Hathor, Sekhmet, or Tefnut, in which he struck a ball symbolizing the Eye of Apep with a club made from a type of wood that was said to have sprung from the Eye of Ra. The ritual represents, in a <b>playful</b> form, the battle of Ra's Eye with its greatest foe.|$|E
5|$|Lynx, a cruel {{agent of}} the {{supercomputer}} FATE, is bent on finding Serge and using his body {{as part of a}} greater plan involving the Frozen Flame. Lynx travels with Harle, a mysterious, <b>playful</b> girl dressed like a harlequin. Harle was sent by the Dragon God to shadow Lynx and one day steal the Frozen Flame from Chronopolis, a task she painfully fulfills despite being smitten with Serge.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes <b>playful</b> postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing <b>playful</b> mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Other legends {{describe}} him as an enchanter and <b>playful</b> lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially Radha. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the Rasa lila and were romanticised in the poetry of Jayadeva, author of the Gita Govinda. They are also central {{to the development of}} the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna.|$|E
5|$|Powell, his wife, and Brown {{were killed}} in a car crash when {{traveling}} overnight from Philadelphia to Chicago. Powell was beginning to achieve recognition {{at the time of his}} death, but he never had the chance to record as a leader. He had a <b>playful</b> piano style, and was fond of using musical quotations. His relatively heavy touch and use of left-hand fourths influenced fellow pianist McCoy Tyner.|$|E
5|$|River otters are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. River otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting. However, <b>playful</b> behavior was found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature otters.|$|E
5|$|Rollins {{also has}} toured {{all over the}} world doing spoken word {{performances}} and his shows frequently last for over three hours. His spoken word style encompasses stand up comedy, accounts of experiences he's had in the world of music and during his extensive travels around the globe, self-deprecating stories about his own shortcomings, introspective recollections from his own life (such as the death of his friend, Joe Cole), commentaries on society and <b>playful,</b> sometimes vulgar, anecdotes.|$|E
5|$|The Orb's next studio album, The Dream, was {{released}} in Japan in 2007 and the following year in the United States and United Kingdom. Fehlmann is absent on The Dream and Paterson was instead reunited with Martin Glover and joined by Tim Bran of Dreadzone. The album saw {{a return to the}} Orb's sounds of the early 1990s, with peculiar vocals and <b>playful</b> samples. The Orb also brought in jazz and house music singer Juliet Roberts and guitarist Steve Hillage.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is active, loyal, and affectionate. They may meet strangers barking when {{in their}} territory, or act aloof, {{cautious}} or wary. The breed {{is well known}} for being friendly and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, <b>playful</b> attitude.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{theme for}} the film celebrates the {{relationship}} between a small girl named Emily (voiced by Emily Osborne), and her kindly but ailing grandfather (voiced by Peter Ustinov). Emily's <b>playful</b> innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be around for much longer, he shares his memories of adventures and days gone by.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most <b>playful</b> of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E
5|$|They can be <b>playful</b> {{with other}} dogs, and {{get along with}} horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as a}} fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, <b>playful</b> figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his <b>playful</b> demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as <b>playful,</b> and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Developments in the New York {{new school}} {{continuum}} {{in this climate}} were represented by the Native Tongues groups—The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah and Monie Love—along with fellow travellers like Leaders of the New School, KMD and Brand Nubian. They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, fun and Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors. De La Soul's debut sampled everyone from The Turtles to Steely Dan, while A Tribe Called Quest matched tough beats to mellow jazz samples and <b>playful,</b> thoughtful raps.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Hari {{gets his}} son Sankarshan (Saksham Kulkarni) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside {{the room of}} the newly married couple, {{listening}} to their <b>playful</b> banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him {{to find out the}} reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti (Manava Naik) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, <b>playful</b> and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Dave Polsky for Disney Channel. The series centers on an ambitious and expressive tween fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a dump. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a <b>playful</b> aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. The Buzz on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, <b>playful</b> and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} include iconic {{aspects of the}} Batman mythos, and decided early on in production to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin reprise their roles in Dini's Batman: The Animated Series as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, respectively. Hamill has thousands of lines of dialogue in the game, and Conroy has relatively few in comparison. After seeing character models of the Joker's Arkham Asylum appearance, Hamill decided to portray the character as dark and gritty while retaining a clownish and <b>playful</b> nature. Although the game features references to plot events in both The Animated Series and Batman comics, the story does not directly follow any singular story or depiction of the character.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more <b>playful</b> side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the <b>playful</b> spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|Bordering to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, <b>playful</b> but shy of human contact.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a <b>playful</b> leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a <b>playful</b> and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
