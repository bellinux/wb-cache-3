40|$|International audienceObjective : Patient-reported {{outcomes}} (<b>PROs)</b> reflect treatment efficacy {{from the}} patients’ perspective. The {{objective was to}} assess <b>PROs</b> improvement with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods : Patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis received rituximab 1000 mg twice at 2 weeks interval, and were assessed over 6 months. <b>PROs</b> including physical <b>PROs</b> (pain, functional assessment, physical quality of life) and mental or mixed aspects (fatigue, sleep and mental quality of life) were assessed. Standardized response means were calculated. Early improvement in <b>PROs</b> was used to predict EULAR response at 6 months. Results : For the 175 patients (mean age 54. 6 ± 10. 6 years, mean disease duration 12. 9 ± 9. 3 years), the plateau of efficacy of rituximab on <b>PROs</b> was reached at week 12, and the effect was more prominent on physical <b>PROs</b> (e. g., pain standardized response means − 0. 75 [95 % confidence interval − 0. 91; − 0. 60]), than on sleep (− 0. 43; [− 0. 56; − 0. 29]). It {{was not possible to}} accurately predict 6 -month EULAR response by early improvement in <b>PROs.</b> Conclusion : Rituximab was effective on <b>PROs</b> with an early effect. <b>PROs</b> reflecting physical aspects were more modulated by this biologic than other <b>PROs</b> (fatigue, sleep or mental quality of life). Links between sleep difficulties, fatigue and RA should be further studied...|$|R

40|$|Using the {{previously}} cloned proteasome α-type subunit gene <b>Pros</b> 28. 1, we screened a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library using reduced stringency conditions to identify closely related genes. Two new genes, <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 A (map position 92 F) and <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 B (map position 60 D 7), showing high sequence similarity to <b>Pros</b> 28. 1, {{were identified and}} characterized. <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 A encodes a protein with 74 % amino acid identity to PROS 28. 1, while the <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 B gene product is 58 % identical. The <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 B gene has two introns, located in exactly analogous positions as the two introns in <b>Pros</b> 28. 1, while the <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 A gene lacks introns. Northern blot analysis reveals that the two new genes are expressed only in males, during the pupal and adult stages. Tissue-specific patterns of expression were examined using transgenic flies carrying lacz-fusion reporter genes. This analysis revealed that both genes are expressed in germiline cells during spermatogenesis, although their expression patterns differed. <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 A expression is first detected at the primary spermatocyte stage and persists into the spermatid elongation phase of spermiogenesis, while <b>Pros</b> 28. 1 B expression is prominent only during spermatid elongation.

40|$|National {{innovation}} {{systems and}} policies are confronted by many interrelated factors, including large socio-economic structural problems, globalisation, pressure to provide public research funding {{and changes in}} research communities driven by the Mode 2 paradigm. These changes challenge sectoral public research organisations (<b>PROs).</b> The role of universities and other policy organisations in innov-ation policy has been studied at length {{but there has been}} little investigation of <b>PROs,</b> despite their signifi cance in developed and developing economies. This article fi lls this gap by exploring <b>PROs</b> in Finland, an open, industrialised and export-dependent economy. It draws several conclusions about the current state and future prospects of <b>PROs</b> in Finland. <b>PROs</b> are in transition in terms of their organisational, managerial and funding structures and their role in the internationalising national innovation system. Their rationale, legitimacy and strategies are also changing due to national innovation driven missions and internationalisation strategies. All <b>PROs</b> in Finland now engage in international cooperation.

40|$|AbstractAdaptive animal {{behaviors}} {{depend upon}} the precise development {{of the nervous system}} that underlies them. In Drosophila melanogaster, the pan-neural prospero gene (<b>pros),</b> is involved in various aspects of neurogenesis including cell cycle control, axonal outgrowth, neuronal and glial cell differentiation. As these results have been generally obtained with null <b>pros</b> mutants inducing embryonic lethality, the role of <b>pros</b> during later development remains poorly known. Using several pros-Voila (prosV) alleles, that induce multiple developmental and behavioral anomalies in the larva and in adult, we explored the relationship between these phenotypes and the variation of <b>pros</b> expression in 5 different neural regions during pre-imaginal development. We found that the quantity of <b>pros</b> mRNA spliced variants and of <b>Pros</b> protein varied between these alleles in a tissue-specific and developmental way. Moreover, in prosV 1 and prosV 13 alleles, the respective decrease or increase of <b>pros</b> expression, affected (i) neuronal and glial cell composition, (ii) cell proliferation and death and (iii) axonal-dendritic outgrowth in a stage and cellular context dependant way. The various phenotypic consequences induced during development, related to more or less subtle differences in gene expression, indicate that <b>Pros</b> level needs a precise and specific adjustment in each neural organ to allow its proper function...|$|R
