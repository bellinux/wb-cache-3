50|$|The {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} Pinhook Bog is the tree-covered mat of sphagnum moss. Sphagnum moss is a stringy, delicate moss of a light-green color. The mat floats {{on top of}} the water and can become 3 to 6 ft thick, yet it can have a pocket only a few inches thick in the middle. As the mat thickens, larger and larger plants take root and grow. Under the mat a <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> develops. The acidic water slows the decay of the sphagnum moss and other plants. With time, the peat may fill the bog from the mat to the bottom. As the moisture becomes less acidic, typical land plants take root and the bog disappears.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of a}} <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> {{to treat}} the H- 12 Outfall discharge {{to bring it to}} new compliance limits was previously investigated and reported utilizing a 7 hour retention time. The influence of retention time (contact time) of water with peat moss on the removal of copper from the water was investigated under laboratory conditions using vertical flow peat moss columns. Reduction of the necessary retention time has a large influence on the design sizing of any <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> that would be constructed to treat the H- 12 discharge on a full scale basis. Retention times of 5 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour were tested to determine the copper removal by the peat columns using vertical flow. Water samples were collected after 4, 8, 12, and 16 water volumes had passed through the columns and analyzed for a suite of metals, with quantitative emphasis on copper. Laboratory results indicated that copper removal was very high at each of the 3 retention times tested, ranging from 99. 6 % removal at 5 and 3 hours to 98. 8 % removal at 1 hour. All these values are much lower that the new compliance limit for the outfall. The results also indicated that most divalent metals were removed to their normal reporting detection limit for the analytical methods used, including zinc. Lead levels in the H- 12 discharge used in this study were below PQL in all samples analyzed. While each of the retention times studied removed copper very well, there were indications that 1 hour is probably too short for an operational, long-term facility. At that retention time, there was about 6 % compaction of the peat in the column due to the water velocity, and this may affect long term hydraulic conductivity of the <b>peat</b> <b>bed.</b> At that retention time, copper concentration in the effluent was higher than the other times tested, although still very low. Because of the potential compacting and somewhat reduced removal efficiency at a 1 hour retention time, it would be prudent to design to at least a 3 hour retention time for water in any <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> system that is proposed for the H- 12 Outfall. A scope to design and install a pilot level study at H- 12 is currently under development.

40|$|A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit {{was issued}} to the Savannah River Site (SRS) by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) and became {{effective}} on December 1, 2003. The new permit contained revised limits for copper and zinc derived {{by adjusting the}} South Carolina aquatic life water quality standards in accordance with dissolved metals criteria. The new copper and zinc limits are very low {{and may not be}} met consistently at Outfall H- 12. The outfall has periodically exceeded the new 6 {micro}g/l (0. 006 mg/L) monthly average limit and the 8 {micro}g/l (0. 008 mg/L) maximum limit for copper and recently has begun exceeding the 100 {micro}g/l (0. 100 mg/L) limit for zinc. The compliance date for Outfall H- 12 is November 1, 2008. A study was conducted on this outfall and other outfalls to evaluate possible alternatives for meeting the new permit limits (Shipman and Bugher 2004). The study team recommended construction of a <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> for treatment of the Outfall H- 12 effluent. This recommendation was repeated by a second alternatives study team in 2007 (WSRC 2007). A bench-scale laboratory study demonstrated the feasibility of peat-bed treatment for Outfall H- 12 effluent, with the peat demonstrating excellent removal of copper (Nelson and Specht 2005). An additional study was performed in 2006 and early 2007 using vertical-flow peat columns to investigate the influence of water retention time (contact time) on the removal of copper and zinc from the water (Nelson 2007 c). Analytical results indicated that copper removal was very high at each of the three retention times tested, ranging from 99. 6 % removal at five and three hours to 98. 8 % removal at one hour. Effluent copper levels from these studies were much lower than the new compliance limit for the outfall. Most divalent metals, including zinc, were removed to below their normal reporting detection limit. The H-Area Material Disposition organization requested a larger-scale study to investigate key design and operation parameters/issues, such as the possibility of rapid plugging of the piping or clogging of the <b>peat</b> <b>bed,</b> the effectiveness of the treatment, hydraulic conductivity, etc. The resulting pilot-scale facility was constructed adjacent to Outfall H- 12 with SCDHEC approval (Mullinax 2007).

40|$|When {{chrysanthemum}} growers change {{soil for}} a soilless growing system they aim for labour cost reduction, quality and yield improvement and reduced emissions of nutrients. Because many attempts {{to come up}} with a viable soilless system failed, improvements and systemizations of the design process were examined. The design methodology chosen uses goal setting based on stakeholder engagement, systemised quantification of a set of conditions for the final system, and a systemised choice of competing systems and quantification of the properties of the competing systems. The set of conditions is assembled upon consultation of a wide variety of growers and experts in fields of plant protection, plant physiology, water management, substrate characteristics, economics and nutrition. The conditions and properties correspond to each other to the extent that both are based on the same measuring methods and expressed in the same units. Thus matches between conditions and properties can be scored. After the complete set of conditions and matching properties is scored, the average of the scores is taken as a measure for the suitability of the whole system. Because properties are quantified, the process is based on knowledge, and gaps in knowledge are identified. Favourable combinations of properties may be applied to systems lacking these properties in order to improve them. This design methodology was used to select and improve a set of 11 competing systems. The resulting 4 improved systems were built and used for growing in experiments. Systems included a soil bed, a sand bed, a <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> and a cassette bed. The soil bed was a 70 cm deep bed of the original soil on a water impermeable foil with a drainage system. The sand bed was a 15 cm layer of coarse sand with a 5 - 10 cm under layer of coarse clay pellets including a drainage system which also supplied irrigation water i. e. sub irrigation. The <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> was a 25 cm peat layer on a sub irrigation bench. The cassette bed was a 130 × 3 × 15 cm (length × width × height) container filled with peat. The cassettes were hung on a sub irrigation bench. Chrysanthemum press pot plants were planted on soil and sand beds and bare chrysanthemum cuttings were planted in the peat based systems. Chrysanthemums were grown for the first of 6 crop cycles. Results showed a 5 - 15 % increase in dry matter production and 3 - 5 days shorter growing period in the peat beds and cassette beds. However, the economic performance is still marginally poor. Nevertheless, the systems tested are environmentally sound and comply with plant requirements for optimal growth.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation of late Holocene deposits on the Belgian coastal plain. The upper clastic deposits overlying the uppermost intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> were studied on the basis of lithology, radiocarbon dates and foraminiferal assemblages to determine why silting-up phases or peat beds are lacking, and to establish the evolution of the sedimentary environments as well as the age of the deposits. Two contrasting sites, in quite different locations and showing a different stratigraphy, were studied. It appears that the coastal evolution was not gradual and continuous, but characterised by short periods with high-energy conditions alternating with long periods where low-energy conditions and little sedimentation prevailed. The evolution is determined mainly by tidal channel activity. At about 3400 cal. yr BP, the peat was eroded in narrow zones by the main tidal channels and this until the landward limit of the plain. The peat was only partly flooded and mudflats fringed the channels. With time, new tributaries formed and the channel network progressively enlarged. The channels were rapidly filled, followed by a period of little sedimentation, which lasted at least until 1400 - 1200 cal. yr BP. The following channel activity is characterised by lateral sedimentation, rather than vertical erosion, together with increased sediment reworking. The mechanisms of coastal change in the late Holocene might be similar over the entire plain, but the timing of the changes is certainly not...|$|E

Because of the many controversies relating to these topics, the Belgian litera­ture has been reviewed. An initial rapid sea-level rise prior to ca. 7800 cal BP resulted in a rapid shift of the facies belts across the palaeovalley and was associated with rapid filling with no formation of intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>beds.</b> A deceleration in the rate of the sea-level rise with sufficient sediment supply produced rapid facies changes registered as frequent alternations of mud, peat and gyttja in the sedimentary sequence deposited between ca. 7800 and 6000 cal BP. The facies changes are determined by a sedimentological control related to the tidal channel and creek network, and not by sea-level fluctuations. Periods of peat growth lasted longer and the lateral extension became more wide­spread as deceleration of the sea-level rise and filling of the plain continued. This was associated with progradation of the shoreface from ca. 6000 cal BP onwards. Tidal conditions returned to the area from ca. 4000 cal BP onwards. This return was accompanied by erosion and landward migration of the shoreface and channel network.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} peat compaction as a driving mechanism behind the widespread inundation of a late Holocene coastal wetland in southeast England, UK. Detailed stratigraphic and dating evidence (lithology, grain size, foraminifera, pollen and radiocarbon dates) from a sample site in Romney Marsh documents the gradual inundation of a coastal wetland after 1263 âââ 1085 cal. yr BP (c. 700 âââ 850 AD) {{and the establishment of}} a saltmarsh. Shortly thereafter there was a rapid increase in water depth that was associated with the deposition of nearly 4 m of laminated intertidal mudflat and tidal channel sediments, prior to site reclamation from the sea by AD 1460. Grain-size data and statistical analysis of sand and mud laminae thicknesses suggest the laminated sediments accumulated rapidly (c. 0. 2 m per year) as heterolithic tidal rhythmites. Rapid compaction of the thick <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> that underlies the study site provided the accommodation space for their deposition. This process began with the gradual tidal inundation of the site, but accelerated following the widening of a breach in a coastal barrier in the 13 th century. Compaction lowered the peat surface by at least 3 m and was associated with widespread landscape change. The study demonstrates the powerful influence that compaction had on the evolution of the late Holocene landscape at this site and, we believe, at many other coastal lowlands in northwest Europe. This process is likely to have been a key driving mechanism behind rapid late Holocene coastal change, far exceeding the longer-term effects of either eustatic change or crustal uplift/subsidence. ...|$|E
40|$|Deposit {{modelling}} {{based on}} archived borehole logs supplemented {{by a small}} number of dedicated boreholes is used to reconstruct the main boundary surfaces and the thickness of the main sediment units within the succession of Holocene alluvial deposits underlying the floodplain in the Barking Reach of the Lower Thames Valley. The basis of the modelling exercise is discussed and the models are used to assess the significance of floodplain relief in determining patterns of sedimentation. This evidence is combined with the results of biostratigraphical and geochronological investigations to reconstruct the environmental conditions associated with each successive stage of floodplain aggradation. The two main factors affecting the history and spatial pattern of Holocene sedimentation are shown to be the regional behaviour of relative sea level and the pattern of relief {{on the surface of the}} sub-alluvial, Late Devensian Shepperton Gravel. As is generally the case in the Lower Thames Valley, three main stratigraphic units are recognised, the Lower Alluvium, a <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> broadly equivalent to the Tilbury III peat of Devoy (1979) and an Upper Alluvium. There is no evidence to suggest that the floodplain was substantially re-shaped by erosion during the Holocene. Instead, the relief inherited from the Shepperton Gravel surface was gradually buried either by the accumulation of peat or by deposition of fine-grained sediment from suspension in standing or slow-moving water. The palaeoenvironmental record from Barking confirms important details of the Holocene record observed elsewhere in the Lower Thames Valley, including the presence of Taxus in the valley-floor fen carr woodland between about 5000 and 4000 cal BP, and the subsequent growth of Ulmus on the peat surface...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory {{measured}} the hydraulic conductivity of peat samples using method ASTM D 4511 - 00. Four samples of peat were packed into 73 mm diameter plastic tubes and saturated {{from the bottom}} up with water. The columns were packed with Premier ProMoss III TBK peat to a dry density of approximately 0. 16 gm/cc (10 lb/ft 3). One column was packed using oven dried peat and the other 3 were packed using as delivered peat. The oven dried sample was the most difficult to saturate. All of the peat samples expanded during saturation resulting in a sample length (L) that was longer than when the sample was initially packed. Table 1 contains information related to the column packing. After saturation the hydraulic conductivity test was conducted using the apparatus shown in Figure 1. Three of the samples were tested at 2 different flow conductions, 1 high and 1 low. Table 2 and Figure 2 contain the results of the hydraulic conductivity testing. Each test was run for a minimum of 40 minutes to allow the test conditions to stabilize.

The similarity in results between the dry pack sample and moist pack samples shows the moisture content at the time of packing had a minimal effect on the hydraulic conductivity.

500|$|Sloughs are {{channels}} of free-flowing water {{in between the}} sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about , and may stay flooded for at least 11months {{out of the year}} if not multiple years in a row. The <b>peat</b> <b>beds</b> that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called [...] "ridge-and-slough" [...] landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs and they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida apple snail. Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort (Utricularia), waterlily (Nymphaeaceae), or spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGeomorphic {{footprints}} of past large Himalayan earthquakes are elusive, though {{urgently needed}} for gauging and predicting recovery times of seismically perturbed mountain landscapes. We present evidence of catastrophic valley infill following {{at least three}} medieval earthquakes in the Nepal Himalayas. Radiocarbon dates from <b>peat</b> <b>beds,</b> plant macrofossils, and humic silts in fine-grained tributary sediments near Pokhara, Nepal’s second largest city, match the timing of nearby M > 8 earthquakes in ~ 1100, 1255, and 1344 C. E. The upstream dip of tributary valley fills and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of their provenance rule out local sources. Instead, geomorphic and sedimentary evidence is consistent with catastrophic fluvial aggradation and debris flows that had plugged several tributaries with tens of meters of calcareous sedimentfrom a Higher Himalayan source > 60 km away...|$|R
