5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps <b>people</b> <b>learn</b> to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>learn</b> crime through association. These acts may condone {{criminal}} conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances.

The number of MBA students at Harvard increased quickly, from 80 in 1908, over 300 in 1920 and 1,070 in 1930. At this time, only American universities offered MBAs. Other countries preferred that <b>people</b> <b>learn</b> business on the job.|$|E
25|$|The Europeans also {{suppressed}} use {{of indigenous}} American languages, establishing their own languages for official communications, destroying texts in other languages, and insisting that indigenous <b>people</b> <b>learn</b> European languages in schools. As a result, indigenous American languages suffered from cultural suppression {{and loss of}} speakers. By the 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and Dutch, brought to the Americas by European settlers and administrators, had become the official or national languages of modern nation-states of the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, {{perhaps because it}} admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and cognitive load theory to explain how <b>people</b> <b>learn</b> from multimedia presentations.|$|E
