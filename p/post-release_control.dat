40|$|The {{safety of}} {{biological}} {{control is a}} contentious issue. We suggest that constructing and analyzing food webs may be a valuable addition to standard biological control research techniques, as they oVer a means of assessing the <b>post-release</b> safety of <b>control</b> agents. Using preliminary data to demonstrate the value of food webs in biocontrol programs, we quantiWed {{the extent to which}} a key agent has inWltrated natural communities in Australia and, potentially, impacted on non-target species. Using these data, we also demonstrate how food webs can be used to generate testable hypotheses regarding indirect interactions between introduced agents and non-target species. We developed food webs in communities invaded to varying degrees by an exotic weed, bitou bush, Chrysant-hemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and a key biocontrol agent for this weed in Australia, the tephritid Xy, Mesoclanis polana. Three food webs were constructed during springtime showing the interactions between plants, seed-feeding insects and their parasitoids. One food web was constructed in a plot of native Australian vegetation that was free of bitou bush (‘bitou-free’), another in a plot of Australian vegetation surrounded by an invasion of bitou bush (‘bitou-threatened’) and a third from a plot infested with a monocul-ture of bitou bush (‘bitou-infested’). The bitou-free web contained 36 species, the bitou-threatened plot 9 species and the bitou-infested web contained 6 species. One native Australian herbivore attacked the seeds of bitou bush. M. polana, a seed-feeding Xy, was heavily attacked by native parasitoids, these being more abundant than the parasitoids feeding on the native seed feeders. A surpris-ing result is that none of the three species of native parasitoids reared from M. polana were reared from any of the native herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of larval release, {{dispersal}} {{and settlement}} in sponges are poorly understood despite their significance in explaining adult ecology. Time of release, swimming speeds, phototaxis and vertical migration were quantified for larvae of the dictyoceratid sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi. The influence of cues associated with biofilms and coral rubble on larval settlement and metamorphosis was also measured. C. matthewsi is a brooding sponge and releases tufted parenchymellae larvae during the day. Upon release, larvae (> 90 %) have no phototactic response, maintaining their {{position at the}} water surface for 80 min ± 0 (mean ± SE) regardless of a light cue (natural daylight) before exhibiting negative phototaxis. At 28 h post-release, the majority of larvae (94. 7 % ± 6. 1) exposed to light from the surface migrated {{to the bottom and}} assumed a demersal phase. Without light, larvae occupied the surface for up to 28 h post-release (89. 3 % ± 1. 8) before migrating to the bottom. Larvae did not settle gregariously and began to settle and metamorphose after 28 h post-release without a cue. Settlement and metamorphosis were faster {{in the presence of a}} biofilm (settlement = 15. 0 % ± 8. 7 and metamorphosis = 12. 5 % ± 9. 5 at 28 h post-release), while the addition of coral rubble accelerated metamorphosis further (settlement = 10. 0 % ± 4. 1 and metamorphosis = 27. 5 % ± 10. 3 at 28 h <b>post-release)</b> compared to <b>controls</b> (sterile surfaces) (settlement = 0 % and metamorphosis = 0 % at 28 h post-release).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHigh {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} reported in people released from prison compared with the general population. However, few studies have investigated potential risk factors associated with these high rates, especially psychiatric determinants. We aimed to investigate the association between psychiatric disorders and mortality in people released from prison in Sweden. MethodsWe studied all people who were imprisoned since Jan 1, 2000, and released before Dec 31, 2009, in Sweden for risks of all-cause and external-cause (accidents, suicide, homicide) mortality after prison release. We obtained data for substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders, and criminological and sociodemographic factors from population-based registers. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) by Cox regression, and then used them to calculate population attributable fractions for <b>post-release</b> mortality. To <b>control</b> for potential familial confounding, we compared individuals in the study with siblings who were also released from prison, but without psychiatric disorders. We tested whether any independent risk factors improved the prediction of mortality beyond age, sex, and criminal history. FindingsWe identified 47   326 individuals who were imprisoned. During a median follow-up time of 5 · 1 years (IQR 2 · 6 – 7 · 5), we recorded 2874 (6 %) deaths after release from prison. The overall all-cause mortality rate was 1205 deaths per 100   000 person-years. Substance use disorders significantly increased the rate of all-cause mortality (alcohol use: adjusted HR 1 · 62, 95 % CI 1 · 48 – 1 · 77; drug use: 1 · 67, 1 · 53 – 1 · 83), and the association was independent of sociodemographic, criminological, and familial factors. We identified no strong evidence that other psychiatric disorders increased mortality after we controlled for potential confounders. In people released from prison, 925 (34 %) of all-cause deaths in men and 85 (50 %) in women were potentially attributable to substance use disorders. Substance use disorders were also an independent determinant of external-cause mortality, with population attributable fraction estimates at 42 % in men and 70 % in women. Substance use disorders significantly improved the prediction of external-cause mortality, in addition to sociodemographic and criminological factors. InterpretationInterventions to address substance use disorders could substantially decrease the burden of excess mortality in people released from prison, but might need to be provided beyond the immediate period after release.

40|$|Invasive {{plants have}} a {{significant}} detrimental effect on ecosystems globally, with impacts estimated at millions of dollars per invasive species each year. Biological control has long {{been used as a}} management tool for invasive plants, as it is considered a long–term cost–effective control strategy. Surprisingly, the impact of biological agents is rarely quantified. Any form of impact evaluation is generally conducted soon after agent release and establishment; with few studies examining the impact of the agents on the population dynamics of the invader, particularly once the agents have been established for a long time. The aim of the research in my thesis is to evaluate the biological control program of groundsel bush (Baccharis halimifolia L. Asteraceae) in Australia. The groundsel bush biological control agents were released up to 40 years ago and no quantitative assessment of agent impact has ever been conducted, {{despite the fact that the}} program has cost about $ 9. 6 million. More specifically, the overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the impact of the released biological control agents on individual plants and populations of groundsel bush. In addition, my thesis aims to examine the impacts of climate as a potential confounding factor of the biological control program. My thesis provides a unique example of biological control evaluation by using a combination of observational damage studies, insect exclusion experiments, and statistical, population and climate modelling to assess, a posteriori, the effectiveness of biological control. This is the first time a long term biological control program has ever been evaluated. To assess the efficacy of the agents, I conducted a large field survey to examine whether the agents were distributed throughout the entire range of groundsel bush and if any biotic or abiotic factors influenced their effectiveness. In addition to this, I assessed the effect of the agents on the growth, survival and fecundity of individual plants under field conditions, and subsequently population growth rate. To do this, I used statistical models of observed effects of biological control agent damage and insect exclusion experiments on plant growth and fecundity to parameterise matrix population models. My results indicate that the groundsel bush biological control agents may be patchy in their effectiveness due to factors such as rainfall and plant size. At their current rate of damage, the groundsel bush biological control agents do not reduce plant growth or fecundity significantly. However, simulation models demonstrated that the agents have the potential to reduce individual plant and population growth when damage is at high levels. A reduction in an invader’s population growth rate, following the introduction of biological control agents, does not necessarily signify that the agents were responsible for the reduction. Factors such as land clearing, chemical and mechanical control, ecosystem health and climate may reduce populations of invasive plant species. With this in mind, I developed a series of climate models to examine how the favourability for growth of groundsel bush may change under different climate scenarios. The climate simulations demonstrated that the distribution and abundance of groundsel bush populations may have contracted in the past 50 years (post–biological control agent release) due to changing rainfall and temperature patterns. The results of the research in my thesis clearly show the need for thorough biological control evaluations, and for detailed data to be collected on the target plant’s demography and population sizes pre- and post-agent release. At a minimum, this should enable biological control practitioners to determine some level of agent impact and demonstrate support for further agent releases or integrative management strategies if necessary. Groundsel bush is a significant invader in Europe where biological control has not yet been carried out. Lessons from the evaluation of the Australian biological control program could be applied to new biological control programs elsewhere such as Europe. Overall, my research findings contribute to a better understanding of how to best evaluate a <b>post-release</b> biological <b>control</b> program, using groundsel bush as a case study. This is the first study to demonstrate an effective set of strategies and quantitative tools to evaluate a biological control program, which can be similarly applied to any biological control program and contributes significantly to an area of biological control which has only recently received significant attention...|$|R
40|$|The Australian {{continental}} shelf {{is one of}} the few remaining areas of the world where sea turtle populations have been subject to relatively small levels of direct harvest and where nesting- and feeding-ground habitats remain essentially intact. The area supports six of the world’s seven sea turtle species (i. e., Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Eretmochelys imbricata, Natator depressus, Lepidochelys olivacea and Dermochelys coriacea), contains significant nesting populations of three species (i. e., Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Eretmochelys imbricata), the world’s only nesting populations of N. depressus and is the main feeding-grounds area of Natator depressus. The incidental capture of sea turtles in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia was a significant threat to sea turtle populations of Australia. Trawl by-catch mortality of Caretta caretta is considered to have contributed to the 80 % decline in numbers of nesting sea turtles in eastern Australia, but this speculation is based on limited or unpublished data relating to mortality associated with trawl fisheries. There is limited information on the potential impact of trawl fisheries on other sea turtle species that occur in Australian waters. Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) were legislated for use in trawl fisheries of northern Australia in 1999. TEDs allow sea turtles to escape from trawl nets whilst enabling the trawl fishery to continue to operate and catch prawns. TEDs can be an effective solution to sea turtle by-catch, but the adoption and use of TEDs in a fishery needs to be monitored to ensure that the devices are having the desired outcome i. e., sea turtle exclusion. The scale and geographic extent of Australian trawl fisheries have the potential to result in a poor capacity to monitor the effective use of TEDs by fishers. TED compliance strategies (i. e., monitoring and enforcement) should be focused in areas where the effective use of TEDs would have the greatest benefit to sea turtle conservation i. e., areas where sea turtle by-catch or mortality is greatest. The present study adopted a comprehensive approach to understanding the interaction between trawling and endangered sea turtle species in waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast, by collecting and utilising baseline data on the size and distribution of sea turtle by-catch. Aspects of compliance strategies for TEDs that would contribute to the sustainable management of sea turtle by-catch in trawl fisheries are also considered. In this context, the following objectives are addressed in this thesis: (i) To estimate the number and species composition of sea turtles caught and killed in a multiple sector trawl fishery using spatial stratification; (ii) To examine the behavioural responses of sea turtles to trawl capture in order to investigate the potential for post-trawl mortality; (iii) To investigate the factors that influence the distribution pattern of sea turtles, and from this analysis, predict the relative in-water densities of sea turtles at broad spatial scales; and (iv) To develop a spatially explicit strategy for TED compliance (i. e., monitoring and enforcement), based on an assessment of the interaction between sea turtles and fishing effort. The thesis concentrates on sea turtle by-catch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, but has broader implications for the management of sea turtles in their feeding-grounds. Baseline information on sea turtle by-catch was collected from select commercial fishers who voluntarily reported information on sea turtles caught in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. About 1, 500 sea turtles were reported caught during ~ 24, 000 days of trawling by 105 fishers who participated in a voluntary program to monitor sea turtle by-catch between 1991 and 1996. Stratified, weighted analysis of the data resulted in an annual estimated sea turtle catch of about 5, 900 for the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, given a mean annual total fleet effort of about 85, 000 days fished per year. The catch was comprised of Caretta caretta (~ 50 %), Chelonia mydas (27 %), Natator depressus (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (6) %. The fishery had minimal catches of Eretmochelys imbricata and Dermochelys coriacea. Sea turtle by-catch was dominated by immature individuals, with between 60 and 80 % of individuals caught being immature, based on approximate size-at-maturity for each species. Estimates of total mortality were based on observed rates as well as published mortality rates from USA shrimp trawl fisheries. In general, mortality rates of sea turtles caught in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery were lower than mortality rates reported for other trawl fisheries in northern Australia and the USA. Lower mortality rates were probably a function of the tow duration associated with various sectors of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. However, the combined by-catch of sea turtles in the three major trawl fisheries of northern Australia (i. e., the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, the Northern Prawn Fishery and Torres Strait Prawn Fishery) was estimated to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to the observed declines in nesting numbers of east Australian Caretta caretta. Estimates of the mortality of sea turtles in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia raise concerns about the likely impacts of these fisheries on other species of sea turtle, particularly Australian sub-populations of Natator depressus and Lepidochelys olivacea. These species frequent feeding-ground habitats typical of trawl grounds and are poorly monitored through nesting-ground surveys. The scale of impact estimated in this thesis indicates that the use of TEDs in the trawl fisheries of northern Australia is warranted. Mortality rates of trawl-caught sea turtles could be higher than currently estimated if sea turtles die after release as a consequence of the delayed effects of capture or secondary mortality resulting from changes in diving behaviour. Six trawl-caught sea turtles were monitored post-release using ultrasonic transmitters and Temperature Depth Recorders in order to assess their diving patterns for signs of modified behaviour. Two rodeo-caught sea turtles were monitored <b>post-release</b> as <b>controls</b> to the trawl-caught individuals. All sea turtles swam rapidly away from the point of release and displayed a period of frequent surfacing behaviour that was speculated to represent swimming and hyperventilation. The sea turtles then settled into a steady pattern where dive intervals were long and regular. This was speculated to represent recovery behaviour. ‘Normal’ activity patterns, as documented in the literature, were not apparent in the dive profiles of the trawl-caught sea turtles within the post-release monitoring period (i. e., 66 hours). Rodeo-caught sea turtles displayed ‘normal’ activity patterns at about 85 and 111 hours post-release. There was no evidence of delayed post-release mortality in the limited number of individuals monitored. However, the trawl-caught sea turtles displayed modified diving patterns that potentially made them more susceptible to secondary mortality such as boat strike or predation. Recovering sea turtles did not appear to undertake normal feeding activities, suggesting that sea turtles exposed to non-lethal interactions with human activities on a frequent basis may have lower growth rates. The results suggest that sea turtles are affected by interactions with humans to a much greater extent than previously thought and that the recovery period of such interactions can take several days The relative spatial distribution of sea turtles is poorly known and is insufficient for developing management plans, such as monitoring and enforcement strategies for TEDs. Sea turtle catch per unit effort from trawl captures and sea turtle sightings from aerial surveys were used to estimate the relative density of sea turtles in the waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast. As expected, sea turtles were not evenly distributed, with several areas having exceptionally high relative densities. In trawled areas, the relative density of sea turtles was significantly correlated with the benthic species trawled (e. g., species of prawn) as well as water-depth. Natator depressus and Lepidochelys olivacea had high relative densities in inshore, tropical waters less than 40 m deep, where tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus, P. semisulcatus) and endeavour prawns (Metapenaeus endeavouri, M. ensis) were caught most commonly. Caretta caretta had high relative densities in inshore, sub-tropical waters less than 30 m deep, where banana prawns (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) or bay prawns (Metapenaeus bennettae i. e., Moreton Bay) were caught most commonly. The relative density of sea turtles was predicted for the majority of waters adjacent to the Queensland east coast based on the mean sea turtle CPUE and information on target species caught most commonly and mean-depth trawled. The relative distribution of sea turtle density developed in this thesis provides the first broad scale maps that quantitatively identify areas that appear to be important as sea turtle habitat. This information could be used to assist the conservation management of sea turtles populations of eastern Australia. Sea turtle by-catch in northern Australia has been addressed through the mandatory use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in otter trawl fisheries. However, the use of TEDs in a fishery needs to be supported by monitoring or enforcement to ensure that TEDs are used effectively, but this is difficult in fishery that operates over a large geographic scale. A pragmatic solution would be to target the monitoring and enforcement of TEDs in critical areas where reductions in sea turtle by-catch will make the greatest contribution to recovery of impacted populations of sea turtles. The spatial distribution of effort for the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery in the year 2001 was integrated with the relative density of sea turtles to identify critical areas for sea turtle by-catch. Critical areas for sea turtle by-catch were similar despite the use of qualitative or quantitative methods. The results suggest that effective TED use is most critical in the inshore waters of the Queensland east coast. Monitoring and enforcing TEDs in these critical areas would enable fisheries managers to measure progress towards the stated target of the 95 % reduction in sea turtle by-catch and contribute to the sustainable management of the fishery. The use of TEDs in non-critical areas should also be monitored, but because of the lower contribution of these areas to sea turtle by-catch, monitoring and enforcement could take place with less intensity. Critical areas for monitoring the effective use of TEDs may change if the intensity of fishing effort changes and may become unnecessary should it be demonstrated that most fishers comply fully with TED regulations...|$|R
