[...] The earliest presented to the court was the [...] "Weston", (US patent 480,900 issued August 16, 1892, for which Hubbell had taken out a licence), another (unidentified) type following in 1897. Plugs per se with <b>parallel</b> flat <b>pins,</b> such as the [...] "Fort Wayne" [...] design were in common use by 1886, and flush receptacles, such as the [...] "Bryant Electrical Company" [...] design, by 1902. Hubbell had introduced its own <b>parallel</b> flat <b>pin</b> configuration in 1912. In 1915 there were [...] "...from 15 to 20 different types of blades and from 15 to 30 different types of receptacles. The line of each was not interchangeable with competing lines. ..." [...] The existence of both [...] "tandem" [...] and <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> configurations had led to the introduction in 1914 of some receptacles having both configurations of slots and others having [...] "T" [...] slots. By 1915, Hubbell had sold about 13 million receptacles and plug bases/caps with tandem slots/pins, and about 1.25 million with parallel slots/pins, most of which were then still in active use, meaning that Hubbell's configurations were by far the most widely used.|$|R

30|$|Infection after {{percutaneous}} pinning of supracondylar fractures is a not {{an uncommon}} event, {{as evidenced by}} our study. Our overall incidence of 4.3  % is slightly higher compared to other reports in the literature, {{which may have been}} due to bundling of pin tract irritation, hypergranulation tissue, and pin loosening/migration in the pin tract infection group. Most of these infections were superficial and were treated with oral antibiotics and wound care. However, the procedure is not completely benign, as evident in six of our patients who developed deep infections requiring surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. The recognition and prompt treatment of pin tract infection is of utmost importance. Despite the infections, patients reported excellent functional results at skeletal maturity at a mean 18  years after the index procedure. Five of six (83  %) patients with deep infection had <b>parallel</b> lateral <b>pins.</b> However, two deep infections presented late, and one was lost to follow-up.

40|$|Comfort {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of clothing, especially for next-to-skin garments such as shirts and trousers for summer. Sensorial comfort has a strong relationship with both the mechanical and surface properties of apparel fabric. A comfortable textile material should have properties of softness, smooth surface or texture, be pleasant to touch and very flexible. When assessing fabric handle subjectively, the assessor usually strokes the fabric surface with one or several fingers and squash the fabric gently in hand. Thus, the perception of such handle includes complex parameters of compression, tactile sensation and textural effect. In this work, we attempted to use a simple technique of objectively evaluating fabric softness related properties, by measuring the force required to pull a fabric strip through a series of <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> (the pulling force).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{primarily}} open versus primarily closed surgical treatment of Gartland type III extension supracondylar fractures in children. Also the outcomes of different pinning techniques in open surgery were evaluated retrospectively. Eighty displaced type III extension supracondylar fractures treated consecutively at two different centres were included. The treatment protocol of one institute was primarily closed reduction and percutaneous cross-pinning (n[*]=[*] 43). The treatment protocol of the other institute was primarily open reduction and internal fixation (n[*]=[*] 37) with two lateral <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> (n[*]=[*] 11), cross pins (n[*]=[*] 11) and two lateral and one medial pin (n[*]=[*] 15) according to the stability and configuration of the fracture.

After osteotomy, the pin pairs are inserted into a reduction guide to achieve reduction [10]. Other techniques use drilling and cutting guides to predrill holes for subsequent fixation using standard osteosynthesis material [11], or by using patient-specific fixation plates that provide accurate alignment of the bone segments [4, 12, 13].

30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} variations of recommended pinning techniques. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5], using two pins, inserted medially and laterally through the medial and lateral epicondyles. The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is always a concern during insertion of the medial pin with a reported incidence of 2 – 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Arino et al. [11] recommended inserting the two wires through the lateral epicondyles to avoid ulnar nerve injury. Biomechanically, fixation provided by the two lateral pins is less secure, as it may allow rotation of the fracture, with the medial column rotating posteriorly. It {{was found that the}} torque required to produce 10 ° of rotation is 37 % less with the use of two lateral <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> than with the use of medial and lateral pins [4, 12]. It has been argued that insertion of two lateral cross-pins will provide a biomechanically stable fixation with avoiding the risk of ulnar nerve injury [13]. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the results of percutaneous lateral cross-wiring technique in treatment of unstable or irreducible type II and III supracondylar humeral fractures in children.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To {{examine a}} simple testing method of {{measuring}} the force {{to pull a}} fabric {{through a series of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> to determine the fabric softness property. Design/methodology/approach – A testing system was setup for fabric pulling force measurements and the testing parameters were experimentally determined. The specific pulling forces were compared with the fabric assurance by simple testing (FAST) parameters and subjective softness ranking. Their correlations were also statistically analyzed. Findings – The fabric pulling force reflects the physical and surface properties of the fabrics measured by the FAST instrument and its ability to rank fabric softness appears to be close to the human hand response on fabric softness. The pulling force method can also distinguish the difference of fabrics knitted with different wool fiber contents. Research limitations/implications – Only 21 woven and three knitted fabrics were used for this investigation. More fabrics with different structures and finishes may be evaluated before the testing method can be put in practice. Practical implications – The testing method could be used for objective assessment of fabric softness. Originality/value – The testing method reported in this paper is a new concept in fabric softness measurement. It can provide objective specifications for fabric softness, thus should be valuable to fabric community. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Aim : {{several studies}} have shown that supracondylar {{fractures}} could be treated with two or three lateral pins. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the stability of lateral pinning with two or three pins with two pins bridged with a small non-invasive device, which would allow the operator to use only two pins instead of three. Methods : fifteen synthetic humerus were cut at the level of the center of the olecranon fossea to simulate supracondylar fractures. All the samples were fixed with <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> (Kirschner, diameter 1. 6 mm) with lateral entry. Three different pins configurations were tested : two pins, two bridged pins and three pins. Each sample was tested in internal and external rotations using a MTS 809 axial / torsional Test System to measure the torsional stiffness and the torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees. A statistical analysis using the Student Law was performed. Results : configurations with two pins, bridged with the non-invasive device or not, had identical mechanical properties. The configurations with three pins demonstrated the following change in mechanical properties, respectively over two pins and over two bridged pins : an increase in internal torsional stiffness of 21. 2 % and 25. 3 %, an increase in external torsional stiffness of 15 % and 6. 8 %; concerning the maximum torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees, the increase for internal rotation was 15. 1 % and 16. 4 % and the increase for external rotation was 12. 4 % and 13. 3 %. The bridging device did not provide an increase in mechanical properties, which could have avoided the use of a third pin. However, this study showed that the third pin increased all four mechanical properties measured, increase that is needed to fix unstable reduced supracondylar fracture. Our samples showed a statistically significant result (P< 0. 05) for the torsional stiffness in external rotation between two and three pins. No statistical difference was made between two pins configurations. Clinical relevance : the opportunity to bridge two pins configuration with a small non-invasive device to reach a mechanical stability equivalent to a configuration with three pins would avoid one invasive pinning procedure and its iatrogenic complications...|$|E

Sulcal- and intersulcal- lengths are also considered. The {{sample consisted of}} 220 cadaveric hemispheres; 65 of which were whole brains (control category); and 90 consisting of equal numbers of separate right- and lefthemispheres (case category). Specimens were orientated by examining relevant features of: the lateral fissure; the postcentral sulcus; and the central fissure. Features of the remaining boundary sulci (precentral sulcus / sulci, and inferior frontal sulcus) of F 3 were also considered. The focus was on examining the: frequency of occurrence, shape, and connections of the sulci of the F 3. The sulci of F 3 were designated as: major sulci [anterior ascending (AAR) - and anterior horizontal (AHR) - rami, and stem of the anterior rami when present); and accessory sulci (sulci of the –pars opercularis and –pars triangularis). Sulcal lengths were measured using thread, with needles as anchors. Intersulcal lengths were recorded as straight-line distances between <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> inserted into the sulci of the frontoparietal operculum. Specimens fixed outside the cranial cavity were excluded from measurement. The reliability of the data was monitored, by repeating the observations. The two systems of classification were broadly confirmed. The criteria for the Types of Sulcal Connections were modified {{in view of the}} findings on double precentral sulci and the connections of the opercular sulcus (which occurred as either one or as two sulci). A sulcus of the pars triangularis (which occurred as either one, two, or as three sulci) was found to be a useful landmark. The Chi-square test was applied to the data in the two systems of classification. There were no significant interhemispheric differences with respect to the incidences of: Types 1 - 4 of Sulcal Connections, or Patterns of the Anterior Rami (I, Y, and VU).

30|$|The optimal pin {{configuration}} {{is a subject}} of considerable debate in relation to ulnar nerve injury and biomechanical principles [3]. Randomized clinical trials have shown that lateral-entry pin fixation and crossed-{{pin configuration}} are equally effective {{in the treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures [21, 22]. However, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury following percutaneous fixation using a crossed-pin technique has been well documented [8, 9, 10]. Many authors have concluded that fixation with lateral pins is a safer and more effective method for displaced supracondylar fractures in children [11, 23, 24, 25]. Studies have also demonstrated that the site of pin insertion is less important for fracture stability than the site at which the pins cross the fracture [5, 26, 27]. Kallio et al. [28], who focused on optimal lateral pin placement technique, recommended divergent pin placement for maximum stability and avoidance of joint penetration. In a biomechanical comparison of all three configurations, Lee et al. [29] reported that divergent lateral pin configuration provided greater stability than <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> configuration, and demonstrated similar stability compared with crossed-pin configuration. This was confirmed by another biomechanical study showing that the best torsional, valgus, and extension resistance are associated with the most divergent configuration of the lateral pins, in which the diverging pin crosses the fracture site at the medial edge of the coronoid fossa [30]. Based on the results of our cadaveric study, <b>parallel</b> lateral <b>pin</b> configuration may increase the risk of intracapsular pin placement compared to divergent lateral pin configuration. Thus, of the three configurations, divergent lateral pin placement is most desirable, since it has less potential for nerve injury, ensures optimal fracture stability, and in addition reduces the risk of intracapsular pin placement.|$|R
