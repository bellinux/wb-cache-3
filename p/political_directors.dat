40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that boards are endogenously determined institutions that serve both an oversight and advisory role in a firm. While oversight role of boards has been extensively studied relatively {{few studies have examined}} the advisory role of corporate boards. In this study we examine the participation of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on the boards of natural gas companies between 1930 and 1998.

Using datasets covering the period from 1930 to 1990 and 1978 to 1998, we test whether regulation and deregulation altered the composition of companies' boards as the firms' environment changed. In particular, did regulation cause an increase and deregulation a decrease, in the number of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on corporate boards? We find evidence that the number of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> increases as firms shift from market to political competition.

40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this paper was {{entitled}} “Deregulation and Board Composition: Evidence on the Value of the Revolving Door. ”It is generally agreed that boards are endogenously determined institutions that serve both oversight and advisory roles in a firm. While the oversight role of boards has been extensively studied, relatively few studies have examined the advisory role of corporate boards. We examine the participation of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on the boards of natural gas companies between 1930 and 1998. We focus on the expansion of federal regulation of the natural gas industry in 1938 and 1954 and subsequent partial deregulation in 1986. Using data sets covering the periods from 1930 to 1990 and 1978 to 1998, we test whether regulation and deregulation altered the composition of companies' boards as the firms' environment changed. In particular, did regulation cause an increase and deregulation a {{decrease in the number of}} <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on corporate boards?

40|$|I {{investigate}} whether cross-sectional differences among politically connected directors {{are associated with}} differences in tax avoidance behavior. Recent {{research suggests that the}} presence of politically connected directors impacts firms? tax avoidance. However, {{it is likely that the}} influence of a politically connected director depends on the characteristics of the politically connected director. I extend this line of research and explore instances where the influence of politically connected directors on tax avoidance is likely to vary. First, I examine whether the political profile of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> is related to firms? tax avoidance activities. Second, I examine whether the director?s relationship to the political party in power impacts firms? tax avoidance. Finally, I examine whether the length of a director?s government service influences firms? level of tax avoidance. I find evidence of an association between the characteristics of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> and firms? tax avoidance strategies, but there is variation in the extent of the benefit that some politically connected directors provide. My study is the first study to attempt to empirically identify underlying mechanisms by which <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> influence firms? tax avoidance strategies...|$|E

30|$|A further step is {{to assign}} scores to each {{independent}} director. If there are many accounting-related keywords, the score for “professional director” increases, indicating that {{the likelihood of the}} director being a professional director increases. Scoring <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> is a similar process. Note that this method allows a director to be simultaneously political and professional.|$|E
30|$|To {{see if this}} is true in general, I {{checked the}} {{distribution}} of politically independent directors by rank (see Fig.  5). We can see that most came {{from the middle of the}} bureaucratic order (first, the department level and, second, the division level). The number of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> decreases as the rank goes up to the ministry level or down to the section level.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, and {{interestingly}} enough, {{the institution}} is also constantly redefining independent director candidacies. The party {{may have noticed}} the negative influence of <b>political</b> <b>directors,</b> since in October 2013 the “ 18 th document” restricted the possibility of government officials becoming independent directors by canceling their salaries. Whether this new regulation reshaped the interlocking network and changed the institution of independent directors remains a good research topic for the future.|$|E
