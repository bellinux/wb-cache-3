5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses.

5|$|Soap bubbles {{have very}} large surface areas {{with very little}} mass. Bubbles in <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> are unstable. The {{addition}} of surfactants, however, can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni effect).

5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that <b>pure</b> <b>water,</b> while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E

5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking {{it from the}} surface of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed, {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. labiata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar in water rather than paper soaked with <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom). Jumping spiders can benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11c is an {{exoplanet}} {{discovered in}} the orbit of the Sun-like star Kepler-11 by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA telescope aiming to discover Earth-like planets. It is the second planet from its star, and is most likely a water planet with a thin hydrogen–helium atmosphere. Kepler-11c orbits Kepler-11 every 10 days, and has an estimated density twice that of <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> It is estimated to have a mass thirteen times that of Earth and a radius three times that of Earth. Kepler-11c and its five sister planets form the first discovered system with more than three transiting planets. The Kepler-11 system also holds the record of being the most compact and the flattest system discovered. Kepler-11c and the other Kepler-11 planets were announced to the public on February 2, 2011, and was published in Nature a day later.|$|E

The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
