Madeleine Smithberg was co-creator of The Daily Show as well as the former executive producer. A graduate of Binghamton University, she was an executive producer of Steve Harvey's Big Time and a talent coordinator for Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect.</b> He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin. Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama's victory.|$|E
5|$|In all, {{there were}} 189deaths at the Pentagon site, {{including}} the 125 in the Pentagon building {{in addition to}} the 64 on board the aircraft. Passenger Barbara Olson was en route to a recording of the TV show <b>Politically</b> <b>Incorrect.</b> A group of children, their chaperones, and National Geographic Society staff members were also on board, embarking on an educational trip west to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary near Santa Barbara, California. The fatalities at the Pentagon included 55military personnel and 70civilians. Of those 125 killed, 92 were on the first floor, 31 were on the second floor, and two were on the third.

25|$|Silverman {{said the}} joke satirizes the racist thought process. Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to {{her use of}} the slur. NBC and O'Brien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, {{appearing}} on <b>Politically</b> <b>Incorrect</b> in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aoki's sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, {{saying that it was}} not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an NPR Fresh Air interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on <b>Politically</b> <b>Incorrect,</b> among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.|$|E

25|$|Especially {{during the}} first years of Die Harald Schmidt Show, Schmidt was {{sometimes}} criticised for making fun of minorities like foreigners or gays. He also did some Adolf Hitler imitations in his show (in one of these he as Hitler warned young people not to vote for racist and nationalistic parties). Schmidt's more unorthodox and <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> jokes have garnered the show a reputation as cult television and his supporters accused critics of being incapable of understanding satire.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, per a {{directive}} {{from the new}} Disney ownership, WPVI-TV began carrying the entire ABC network schedule {{for the first time}} in the station's history with the network.

25|$|Gervais {{then came}} to much wider {{national}} attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona {{featured in a}} topical slot that replaced Ali G's segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme The 11 O'Clock Show in early 1999, in which his character used as many expletives as was possible and produced {{an inordinate amount of}} <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was Mackenzie Crook, later a co-star of The Office. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called Meet Ricky Gervais; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{of these}} native art forms largely play to {{tourists}} or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms– including those heavily based {{on the use of}} often risqué and <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> mimicry and parody– have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. Since 1930 when the first Malayalam film Vigathakumaran was released and over the following decade or two, Malayalam cinema had grown {{to become one of the}} popular means of expression for both works of fiction and social issues, and it remains so.|$|E
25|$|Matthew's idea {{on society}} were radical for their times. Although {{he was a}} landowner, he was {{involved}} with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of hereditary nobility were detrimental to society. It {{has been suggested that}} these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would have been interested. Only after Darwin's Origin did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle. Matthew also published a book in 1839, Emigration Fields (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions.|$|E

[...] The theme {{is very similar to}} one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's soundtrack album. Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz.

500|$|The {{nature of}} PewDiePie's video content has been {{described}} by various outlets as goofy, energetic, obnoxious and filled with profanity.

Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet said it contained [...] "off-the-cuff running commentary that's characterised by goofy jokes, profanity and loud outbursts." [...] Walker wrote PewDiePie's [...] "chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> comments and pretty much nonstop profanity." [...] Reed adds that these aspects of PewDiePie's videos are what critics find most abrasive, but what fans love the most. PewDiePie resorts occasionally to gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary; his playthrough of The Last of Us, it was detailed, left the usually vocal gamer speechless at the ending.|$|E
500|$|Note {{that the}} new metric system did not come into effect in France until after the French Revolution, when the new revolutionary {{government}} captured {{the idea of the}} metric system. The decision of the Republican government to name this new unit the [...] "kilogramme" [...] had been mainly politically motivated, because the name [...] "grave" [...] was at that time considered <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> as it resembled the aristocratic German title of the Graf, an alternative name for the title of Count that, like other nobility titles, was inconsistent with the new French Republic notion of equality (égalité). Accordingly, the name of the original, defined unit of mass, [...] "gramme", which was too small to serve as a practical realisation, was adopted and the new prefix [...] "kilo" [...] was appended to it to form the name [...] "kilogramme". Consequently, the kilogram is the only SI base unit that has an SI prefix as part of its unit name.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> moments are funny and well-observed, this episode {{seems to be saying}} that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] and it has been described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E
500|$|Strangers with Candy was {{conceived}} of as a parody of after school specials, following the life of Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old dropout who returns to finish high school after 32 years {{of life on the}} street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, <b>politically</b> <b>incorrect</b> moral lesson. Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, and portrayed Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, Chuck Noblet, seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on The Daily Show and later The Colbert Report, claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying [...] "poorly informed, high-status idiot" [...] characters. Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a closeted homosexual, was having a [...] "secret" [...] affair with fellow teacher Geoffrey Jellineck, despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's Daily Show and Colbert Report character.|$|E

However, viewership has been positive. The [...] "Canton Style" [...] music video– a parody of Korean singer-rapper Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style"– amassed 1.1 million views within three days of its uploading. Another of Tong's uploads, [...] "Chinese Guy Eats Sooo Loud!" [...] has close to 2 million hits. His videos are, as of 2011, the number one and two most watched in Canada. Tong has said, in response to audience comments that his performances are [...] "racist", that everything is [...] "done for comedy. I'm not really racist against anybody. I take stereotypes and I make them outlandish so everybody can laugh." ...|$|E
