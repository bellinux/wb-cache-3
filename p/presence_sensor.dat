40|$|Abstract — Depth and <b>presence</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are used}} to prevent {{collisions}} in environments where human/robot coexistence is relevant. To {{address the problem of}} occluded areas, we extend in this paper a recently introduced efficient approach for preventing collisions using a single depth sensor to multiple depth and/or <b>presence</b> <b>sensors.</b> Their integration is systemat-ically handled by resorting to the concept of image planes, where computations can be suitable carried out on 2 D data without reconstructing obstacles in 3 D. To maximize the on-line collision detection performance by multiple sensor integration, an off-line optimal sensor placement problem is formulated in a probabilistic framework, using a cell decomposition and characterizing the probability of cells being in the shadow of obstacles or unobserved. This approach allows to fit the optimal numerical solution to the most probable operating conditions of a human and a robot sharing the same working area. Three examples of optimal sensor placement are presented. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To achieve {{efficient}} presence sensing within {{home network}} system (HNS), an inexpensive and elastic {{system that can}} be shared by various HNS applications is required. This paper presents <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensor</b> Service Framework, which can uniformly manage presence information in various places using various types of sensors. The framework consists of <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensor</b> Device (PSD), <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensor</b> Terminal (PST) and <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensor</b> Aggregator (PSA). A PST monitors PSDs to detect any changes of presence, and notifies a PSA of the changes. Upon the notifications from PSTs, the PSA estimates human presence around each PSD. The estimation process is deployed as <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensor</b> Service (PSS), which is used by various HNS applications. The proposed framework can dynamically add or change sensing places within a HNS by adding PST and PSD as needed. It can also integrate presences in multiple HNSs by deploying PSA on an external cloud. In this paper, we implement a prototype of the proposed framework by using Phidgets sensors and Java Web service. Moreover, we develop a presence visualization application to conduct a preliminary evaluation.

The precondition of this rule first reads in the variable co 2 _id_val, the value measured by a CO 2 sensor.

The result is stored in the variable pres_val. The performance inserts the resource (pres_id, pres_val) in the Sensors bag of the SoftSensors LINC object.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} track-to-track association in the <b>presence</b> of <b>sensor</b> biases. In some challenging scenarios, it may be infeasible to implement bias estimation and compensation in time due to the computational intractability or weak observability about sensor biases. In this paper, we introduce the structural feature for each local track, which describes the spatial relationship with its neighboring targets. Although the absolute coordinates of local tracks from the same target are severely different in the <b>presence</b> of <b>sensor</b> biases, their structural features may be similar. As a result, instead of using the absolute kinematic states only, we employee the structural similarity to define the association cost. When there are missed detections, the structural similarity between local tracks is evaluated by solving another 2 D assignment subproblem.

Presented technique {{can be used for}} a service that learns daily patterns of the user and proactively detects unusual situations. We have identified several drawbacks of previously presented models such as: just one type of anomaly- inactivity, intricate activity classification into hierarchy, detection only on a daily basis. Our novelty approach desists these weaknesses, provides additional information if the activity is unusually short/long, at unusual location. It is based on a semi-supervised clustering model that utilizes the neural network Self-Organizing Maps.

40|$|Abstract: To have {{buildings}} that {{are able to}} adapt to the user needs {{and at the same time}} to operate efficiently, it is essential to know the activity the people are performing. <b>Presence</b> <b>sensors,</b> which are widely deployed in modern buildings, attempt to regulate lighting to the presence of people in indoor spaces. Though, much more in terms of comfort and energy efficiency can be achieved if more detailed information on the activity of the users is detected. In this paper, we provide an initial investigation on detecting indoor activities by using simple sensors (infrared, pressure and acoustic) deliberately avoiding the use of rich sensors such as cameras. The sensors are low-cost, wireless, and retrofittable in existing structures. Our prototype is able to recognize five activities (working at a desk with or without a PC, having a meeting, and the presence/absence in the office) with accuracy of almost 95 %, while unaffecting user’s behavior and comfort. ...|$|R
40|$|Energy savings is a {{frequently}} discussed {{issue in}} today’s society {{and it is}} desirable to save energy with intelligent solutions that does not cost too much and still are reliable. One way to achieve this in the building sector could be by using smarter control and regulation systems for the indoor climate. The feedback system is a regular solution for control and regulation nowadays, where the investigated parameter is measured and compared with a reference value. An alternative method, called feed-forward, has been evaluated and discussed in this master thesis. The idea of the feed-forward system is to predict the forthcoming indoor climate, to prevent a change before it occurs. This is preferably done by using small measurable variations from existing sensors in the room such as thermometers, carbon dioxide sensors, relative humidity <b>sensors</b> and <b>presence</b> <b>sensors.</b> The aim of this thesis {{is to find a}} way to predict a forthcoming increase of the internal heat load, caused by people entering an office room. To find the most suitable parameter or a combination between them for predicting this, a number of tests measuring the mentioned parameters have been performed. The tests were performed at a very flexible test room, in an HVAC-point of view, at Building Services Engineering’s test facility at Chalmers University of Technology. Due to the limitation of the thesis, to only consider internal heat generated by humans, presence is a crucial factor that needs to be examined. Data achieved from the <b>presences</b> <b>sensors</b> does not give enough information, since they only have the ability to tell if someone enters the room and not the number of present people. The response time (dead time) is an important feature of the sensors, which needs to be tested in order to find the parameter that first indicates that people have entered the room. The performed tests show that the carbon dioxide concentration was the fastest parameter to respond compared to the other measured parameters. This means that there is a potential in predicting a temperature raise, caused by internal heat generated by humans, by measuring the carbon dioxide concentration. The idea is to use this prediction to improve the system and thereby raise the thermal indoor climate and at the same time save energy...|$|R
