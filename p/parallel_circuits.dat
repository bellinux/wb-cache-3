25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and <b>parallel</b> <b>circuits</b> or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of multi-core processors {{in recent years}} has introduced new opportunities and challenges to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) research and development. In this dissertation, a few parallel Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuit analysis and optimization methods which utilize the multi-core computing platform to tackle some of the most difficult contemporary Computer-Aided Design (CAD) problems are presented. The first CAD application that is addressed in this dissertation is analyzing and optimizing mesh-based clock distribution network. Mesh-based clock distribution network (also known as clock mesh) is used in high-performance microprocessor designs as a reliable way of distributing clock signals to the entire chip. The second CAD application addressed in this dissertation is the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) like circuit simulation. SPICE simulation is often regarded as the bottleneck of the design flow. Recently, <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> simulation has attracted a lot of attention. The first part of the dissertation discusses circuit analysis techniques. First, a combination of clock network specific model order reduction algorithm and a port sliding scheme is presented to tackle the challenges in analyzing large clock meshes with a large number of clock drivers. Our techniques run much faster than the standard SPICE simulation and existing model order reduction techniques. They also provide a basis for the clock mesh optimization. Then, a hierarchical multi-algorithm <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> simulation (HMAPS) framework is presented as an novel technique of <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> simulation. The inter-algorithm parallelism approach in HMAPS is completely different from the existing intra-algorithm <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> simulation techniques and achieves superlinear speedup in practice. The second part of the dissertation talks about <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> optimization. A modified asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPS) based method which utilizes the efficient clock mesh simulation techniques for the clock driver size optimization problem is presented. Our modified APPS method runs much faster than a continuous optimization method and effectively reduces the clock skew for all test circuits. The third part of the dissertation describes parallel performance modeling and optimization of the HMAPS framework. The performance models and runtime optimization scheme improve the speed of HMAPS further more. The dynamically adapted HMAPS becomes a complete solution for <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> simulation...|$|R
