5|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{the right}} wing of a devotional and hinged triptych; the lost center <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{recorded}} in sixteenth-century inventories as a Virgin and Child. The panels were commissioned by Tommaso, a member of a prominent Florentine family. Tommaso was an intimate of Charles the Bold and an ambitious manager of the Bruges branch of a bank controlled by Lorenzo de' Medici, and a well known and active patron of Flemish art. Tommaso eventually lost his position due to a series of large and risky unsecured loans given to Charles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three {{question}}s. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E

5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning. Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The DSi XL has a matte surface, and the {{exterior}} of its top <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> coated with a gloss finish. It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region such as white, green, red, yellow, and pink. Two special-edition models were released: those for LovePlus+ and the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros.

30|$|Ten laboratory-scale 10 -ply LVL <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> manufactured. Six <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made of {{eucalypt}} veneer only, choosing {{veneer sheets}} of defined MoE grades {{based on their}} dynamic MoE values. One <b>panel</b> each <b>was</b> made from 12, 14, or 17.5  GPa sheets and three <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made from 16  GPa sheets. Each LVL panel contained veneer from one or two logs only. Another four <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made of five radiata pine and five eucalypt veneer plies. A range of eucalypt grades were used in these panels. The first (14  GPa), third (17  GPa), sixth (14  GPa), eighth (12  GPa) and tenth layers (12  GPa) were eucalypt veneers and the rest were radiata pine. Two <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made from each of G 2 and G 4 radiata-pine grades. A typical phenolic formaldehyde adhesive manufactured by Aica NZ Limited was used {{at a rate of}} 180  g/m 2. <b>Panels</b> <b>were</b> hot-pressed at 160  °C with a pressure of 1.2  MPa.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structural}} behaviour of two connected Sandwiched Precast Lightweight Foamed Concrete Panel (PLFP) {{in term of}} their load bearing capacities and failure modes. Three (3) connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. Each connected <b>panel</b> <b>were</b> cast from two single panels connected using L-bar connection. The <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. The connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> tested under flexural load. A single PLFP <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> cast as a control panel and tested under axial load. The results were analysed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure. Results showed that the two connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to single PLFP panel. Crack at 45 degree angle at top half of panel and small crack at surface between joint of the connection were observed...|$|R

5|$|The father <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{signed and}} dated on both sides, {{in what may be}} the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, a <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{held for}} the office so that audience members can ask them questions. Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who had put her up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} {{the shift in}} religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
30|$|The {{manufactured}} <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> conditioned at 20  °C and 65  % {{relative humidity}} for 2  weeks. The internal bonding (IB) {{strength of the}} <b>panels</b> <b>was</b> determined according to JIS A 5908 [10].|$|R
50|$|Addressable <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> {{usually more}} {{advanced}} than their conventional counterparts, with greater information capacity and control flexibility.

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments {{of male and female}} portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar {{is on the left}} and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E
40|$|Two brazed Rene 41 {{honeycomb}} {{panels that}} would incorporate a frame element were designed, fabricated and tested. The <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> {{representative of the}} lower surface of an advanced space transportation vehicle. The first <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> a two span panel supported by a center frame and on edges parallel to it. The second <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> a two span panel supported by a center frame and on edges parallel to it. The second <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> a three span panel supported on two frames and on edges parallel to the frames. Each panel had its outer skin slotted to reduce the thermal stresses of the panel skins. The first <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> tested under simulated boost conditions that included liquid hydrogen exposure of the frame and inner skin and radiant heat to 478 K on the outer skins. The first <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> tested to investigate the effect of thermal stresses in skins and core caused by the panel being restrained by a cold integral frame and to observe the effects of frost formation and possible liquid air development in and around outer skin slots...|$|R
50|$|Fence <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> {{supported}} with counter-weighted feet, have a {{wide variety}} of accessories including gates, handrails, feet and bracing depending on the application. Fence <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> commonly constructed of either chain link or weld mesh.|$|R
50|$|The {{inscriptions}} on {{the central}} <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> fragments from the Book of Wisdom (7:26 and 7:29), and Ecclesiastes (24: 23-24). Those on the wing <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> taken from texts referring directly to the two saints.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Erwin Panofsky {{established}} that Schöne's dating {{was at least}} twenty years too early. In his view, the girl's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid-1470s. He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c. 1470 portrait by Hans Memling, and her gown to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse of Bruges. Sterling, placing the work as c. 1465, remarks that the hennin in the Berlin <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> of a different type {{to that of the}} New York painting. The New York headdress is far more extended, and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after, and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil. Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus' earlier works. On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist's career.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time {{than those in the}} interior. As with Bosch's Haywain triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, The Last Judgment (around 1482) and The Haywain (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent free will as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.|$|E
5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> one of three surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous {{with the edge of}} the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E

50|$|In 1969 the <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> {{removed for}} {{restoration}} and divided {{into the private}} collections of his heirs. In 1991, the <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> provisionally reassembled in the family home Ascanio Estanga, until the CEPSA Foundation acquired the triptych. Today the <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> held in the Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the triptych {{is considered to be}} one of the most important Flemish paintings.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 2015 Koul was {{an opinion}} {{panelist}} on CBC News alongside Jon Kay and Tasha Kheiriddin. The {{topic of the}} <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> the diversity of Justin Trudeau's cabinet picks. The <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> moderated by CBC presenter Wendy Mesley. While purportedly about gender balance, the <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> attacked in social media for not adequately speaking to racial diversity in government. At Buzzfeed Koul later wrote about the reaction and the resulting harassment she received.|$|R
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand <b>panel,</b> <b>is</b> rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|An artist from Pennsylvania recreated {{the upper}} outside panels {{in the style}} of the carousels of the period around the time of World War I. The carvings on the <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; the mirrors were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> initially some discovered Dentzel company <b>panels,</b> and these <b>were</b> used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> built in the museum's shops.|$|R
