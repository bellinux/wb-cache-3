5000|$|A {{pseudopod}} or <b>pseudopodium</b> (plural: pseudopods or pseudopodia) (from the Greek word ψευδοποδός, ψευδός [...] "false" [...] + ποδός [...] "foot") is {{a temporary}} cytoplasm-filled projection of a eukaryotic cell membrane or a unicellular protist. Pseudopods {{may be used for}} motility, or for ingesting nutrients or other particulate matter. Cells that make pseudopods are generally referred to as amoeboids. Pseudopods extend and contract by the reversible assembly of actin subunits into many microfilaments. Filaments near the cell's end interact with myosin which causes contraction. The pseudopod extends itself until the actin reassembles itself into a network.|$|E

40|$|Initiation of cell {{migration}} requires morphological polarization with {{formation of a}} dominant leading <b>pseudopodium</b> and rear compartment. A molecular understanding of this process has been limited, due to the inability to biochemically separate the leading <b>pseudopodium</b> {{from the rear of}} the cell. Here we examine the spatio-temporal localization and activation of cytoskeletal-associated signals in purified pseudopodia directed to undergo growth or retraction. Pseudopodia growth requires assembly of a p 130 Crk-associated substrate (CAS) /c-CrkII (Crk) scaffold, which facilitates translocation and activation of Rac 1. Interestingly, Rac 1 activation then serves as a positive-feedback loop to maintain CAS/Crk coupling and pseudopodia extension. Conversely, disassembly of this molecular scaffold is critical for export and down regulation of Rac 1 activity and induction of pseudopodia retraction. Surprisingly, the uncoupling of Crk from CAS during <b>pseudopodium</b> retraction is independent of changes in focal adhesion kinase activity and CAS tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings establish CAS/Crk as an essential scaffold for Rac 1 -mediated pseudopodia growth and retraction, and illustrate spatio-temporal segregation of cytoskeletal signals during cell polarization...|$|E

40|$|The {{preparation}} of the laboratory experiments, e. g., sieving, causes physical disturbance to the foraminifera. In Chapter 2 we studied the effects of such disturbance by observing individual living specimens. Observations were made on individuals from three different areas: the Wadden Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Bay ofBiscay. We sieved sediments from which we handpicked individual specimens. We used for the observations an inverted-light microscope with phase-contrast filter to which a video camera was connected to make recordings. Specimens from the intertidal area (Wadden Sea), and especially the epifaunal to shallow infaunal taxa, showed to be very active and able to survive the transport and sieving treatments. The taxa from deeper environments, Adriatic Sea and Bay of Biscay, were less active, and deep infaunal taxa showed no pseudopodial activity. It can well be that a general relation exists between pseudopodia! activity on the one hand, and environment and the vertical depth of the habitat on the other. Taxa living in high-energy environments and occupying shallow infaunal or epifaunal microhabitats, display the highest pseudopodia! activity. More detailed observations were made on the morphology of pseudopodia! networks. Groups of taxa could be distinguished based upon <b>pseudopodium</b> characteristics. Variation between these groups {{was seen in the}} density, shape ofand connections between the pseudopodia. This ranged from taxa with a dense and strongly branched <b>pseudopodium</b> to taxa with only a few thin and long pseudopodia. Part of the observations focussed on locomotion and they showed that different modes existed. Planispiral taxa rotate almost continuously while moving, whereas miliolid, uni-, bi- and triseria! taxa move in a more linear way. Potential important negative effects oflight on the pseudopodia] activity of certain foraminifera ""ere demonstrated by the observation of an allogromiid specimen. This specimen showed a strong sensitivity for intense light, which made the specimen to cease all pseudopodia! activity. Finally, a number of observations dealt with the disturbance of pseudopodial networks of some taxa. Using a brush, parts of the <b>pseudopodium</b> were separated {{from the rest of the}} organism, fonning so-called pseudopodial satellites. These satellites were capable of surviving in a petri dish, depending upon their size for how long. Often the satellites formed a central body from which small pseudopodia were extended. When brought in contact with the <b>pseudopodium</b> of the parent organism, they fused and the satellite formed again part of the organism.

40|$|Polytactic {{cells of}} Amoeba proteus {{were exposed to}} {{localised}} photic stimulation. When a <b>pseudopodium</b> is stimulated to advance, by shading,it, other pseudopodia are retracted. Activation of the shaded front is the primary response, and contraction of other fronts the secondary one. When a <b>pseudopodium</b> is inhibited by illuminating its frontal segment, or when it is allowed to enter the bright zone {{in the course of}} migration, it slows down and stops but its eventual retraction depends on the existence of other possible directions for the endo-plasmic flow. Therefore, if other active pseudopodia are lacking, the front suppressed by light cannot retreat effectively until new fronts arise in other body regions kept in shade. In all experimental situations the development of new fronts or the activation of forward flow in lateral pseudopodia precedes the contraction of the former leading <b>pseudopodium.</b> Also the reversal of direction of the endoplasmic streaming begins at the new front, and then it gradually extends until it reaches the former front. The results confirm the interdependence of different pseudopodia in the same individual and they contradict the concept that pseudopodia behave as separate functional units. On the other hand, they indicate that formation of new pseudopodia should not be explained as a simple secondary effect of contraction of the older ones but, on the contrary, as a phenomenon that initiates the changes in the pattern of flow in amoeba. The general interpretation is based on this variant of the pressure-flow theory of amoeboid movement, which attributes the motive power to the contractile activity of the whole cell cortex and the steering role to events taking place {{in the front of the}} migrating cell...|$|E

40|$|Human lung {{adenocarcinoma}} cells develop bipolar {{shape with}} prominent pseudopodia (greater {{than or equal}} to 200 microns) when cultured in the presence of autocrine motility factor (AMF) -like substance or on fibronectin-coated substrata. AMF was partially purified from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and has a peak biological activity at a molecular mass of 67 kDa. Using time-lapse photography, we observed that during AMF- or fibronectin-induced cell translocation, the nuclei of some bipolar cells are transported to {{the opposite end of the}} cell, while gross cell shape and position remain unchanged. Following this nuclear movement, which we call "nucleokinesis," the posterior <b>pseudopodium</b> is retracted behind the nucleus. Thus, extension of a <b>pseudopodium</b> followed by nucleokinesis in the same direction and retraction of the cell body behind the nucleus is a normal motile sequence in translocating bipolar cells. This suggests that nucleokinesis is a distinct step in whole-cell translocation of bipolar cells on biological substrata and that pseudopodia can be used as nuclear transport organs. In contrast, adenocarcinoma cells cultured on artificial substrata and in the absence of AMF display a fibroblast-like motility pattern with the nucleus centrally located within the migrating cell...|$|E

The basic pattern of cell migration in collagen was similar to that observed previously for these cells on inert material surfaces; i. e., a cycle of cell extension and cytoplasmic flow into the leading extension.

In the region of the uropod, extensive blebbing of the cells often occurred, and when this happened, forward movement of the cells ceased. At the ultrastructural level, both the leading <b>pseudopodium</b> and the blebs at the tail of the cell were found to contain a dense cytoskeletal network from which cell organelles were excluded.

Motility is a fundamental trait that distinguishes living things. The macroscopic motion of plants and animals can ultimately be reduced to motion on the level of single cells [2]. The movement of single cells also play a pivotal role in phenomena not directly related to movement of the whole organism. Thus, the morphogenetic migration of cells is responsible for the appearance of form and structure in embryogenesis. The movement of cells is crucial in the process of wound healing and in the functioning of the immune system and unfortunately in metastasis, where cancer cells spread from the primary tumor to invade other organs of the body [3].

40|$|The leading {{front of}} a cell can either {{protrude}} as an actin-free membrane bleb that is inflated by actomyosin-driven contractile forces, or as an actin-rich <b>pseudopodium,</b> a site where polymerizing actin filaments push out the membrane 1, 2, 3. Pushing filaments can only cause the membrane to protrude if the expanding actin network experiences a retrograde counter-force, which is usually provided by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family 4. Here we show that chemotactic dendritic cells mechanically adapt to the adhesive properties of their substrate by switching between integrin-mediated and integrin-independent locomotion. We found that on engaging the integrin–actin clutch, actin polymerization was entirely turned into protrusion, whereas on disengagement actin underwent slippage and retrograde flow. Remarkably, accelerated retrograde flow was balanced by an increased actin polymerization rate; therefore, cell shape and protrusion velocity remained constant on alternating substrates. Due to this adaptive response in polymerization dynamics, tracks of adhesive substrate did not dictate {{the path of the}} cells.

40|$|SummaryA {{key feature}} of {{angiogenesis}} is directional control of endothelial cell (EC) morphogenesis and movement [1]. During angiogenic sprouting, endothelial “tip cells” directionally branch from existing vessels {{in response to}} biochemical cues such as VEGF or hypoxia and migrate and invade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) {{in a process that}} requires ECM remodeling by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [2 – 4]. Tip EC branching is mediated by directional protrusion of subcellular pseudopodial branches [5, 6]. Here, we seek to understand how EC pseudopodial branching is locally regulated to directionally guide angiogenesis. We develop an in vitro 3 D EC model system in which migrating ECs display branched pseudopodia morphodynamics similar to those in living zebrafish. Using this system, we find that ECM stiffness and ROCK-mediated myosin II activity inhibit EC pseudopodial branch initiation. Myosin II is dynamically localized to the EC cortex and is partially released under conditions that promote branching. Local depletion of cortical myosin II precedes branch initiation, and initiation can be induced by local inhibition of myosin II activity. Thus, local downregulation of myosin II cortical contraction allows <b>pseudopodium</b> initiation to mediate EC branching and hence guide directional migration and angiogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} fromeight nuclear, chloroplast, andmitochondrial genes {{were obtained}} from 30 mosses (plus four outgroup liverworts) in order to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the major clades of division Bryophyta. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference. Inferences were compared from Bayesian analyses using homogeneous and several heterogeneous models. Estimates of clade con dence were based on bootstrap analyses, posterior probabilities (in Bayesian analyses) and novel combined approaches. Most ingroup relationships were congruent among analyses, but support for individual clades depended on the analytical approach. Increasingly parameterized models of nucleotide substitution in the likelihood analyses provided signi cantly higher goodness-of- t to the data. The results suggest that 1) the Bryophyta, including Sphagnum and Takakia, are monophyletic, 2) Andreaea and Andreaeobryum form a monophyletic group, 3) Oedipodium grif thianum is sister to all other operculate taxa, 4) mosses with nematodontous peristomes are paraphyletic and basal to arthrodontous mosses, 5) Diphyscium is sister to all other arthrodontous mosses, 6) Encalypta is sister to the Funariaceae, and 6) mosses with diplolepideousalternate peristomes form a monophyletic group. Implications of the phylogenetic hypothesis formorphological evolution in mosses include 1) a <b>pseudopodium</b> has arisen independently in Sphagnum and Andreaea, 2) the mucilage hairs of Andreaeobryum and Takakia are non-homologous, 3) the stomata found in Sphagnum are not homologous {{to those of other}} mosses, and 4) that stomata were absent in the ancestor of all mosses...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : The FYB gene encodes {{adhesion}} and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP), a hematopoietic-specific protein {{involved in}} platelet activation, cell motility and proliferation, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. No ADAP-related diseases {{have been described}} in humans, but ADAP-deficient mice have mild thrombocytopenia and increased rebleeding from tail wounds. PATIENTS AND METHODS : We studied a previously reported family of five children from two consanguineous sibships of Arab Christian descent affected with a novel autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with small-platelet thrombocytopenia. Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing were used to identify the genetic lesion causing the disease phenotype on chromosome 5. Bone-marrow morphology and platelet function were analyzed. Platelets were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS : We identified a homozygous deleterious nonsense mutation, c. 393 G>A, in FYB. A reduced percentage of mature megakaryocytes {{was found in the}} bone marrow. Patients' platelets showed increased basal expression of P-selectin and PAC- 1, and reduced increments of activation markers after stimulation with ADP, as detected by flow cytometry; they also showed reduced <b>pseudopodium</b> formation and the presence of trapped platelets between the fibrin fibers after thrombin addition, as observed on scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS : This is the first report of a disease caused by an FYB defect in humans, manifested by remarkable small-platelet thrombocytopenia and a significant bleeding tendency. The described phenotype shows ADAP to be important for normal platelet production, morphologic changes, and function. It is suggested that mutation analysis of this gene be included in the diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenia. Academic and Research Committee of Emek Medical Center. [URL]...|$|E
