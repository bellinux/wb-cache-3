50|$|It {{supports}} {{the lives of}} numerous endemic and endangered species, like the Luzon bleeding-heart pigeon (Gallicolumba luzonica), Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> and a rare riverine fish, locally called ludong (Cestreaus plicatilis).|$|R
5000|$|Wildlife Resources: The biologically rich Sierra Madre Mountain {{covers a}} large segment of the land area of the {{municipality}} of San Luis. Various species of birds, including the Philippine Eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>Jefferyi)</b> were observe and identified in the area (Philippine Biodiversity Inventory, 1997). Wild animals such as wild boars, deer’s, monkeys, etc. also thrive in the area.|$|R
50|$|Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) {{is a large}} bird of prey in {{the family}} Accipitridae that lives in coastal northeastern Asia and mainly preys on fish and water birds. On average, it is the {{heaviest}} eagle in the world, at about 5 to 9 kg, but may be below the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> in some standard measurements. It is named after the German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{carries out}} {{activities}} other than breeding {{and sales of}} birds. These include veterinary and quarantine services and aviary and cage construction. [...] The veterinary clinic received attention in 2002 for carrying out surgery on a 2.5 ft-tall Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi),</b> a rare, almost extinct animal, rescued by the authorities after being wounded by a bullet and named [...] "Amianan". The animal eventually died of a fungal infection and was stuffed.|$|R
50|$|Lantapan’s virgin {{forests are}} home to a diverse variety of flora and fauna. There are orchids, berries, pitcher plants, lichens, {{and a host of}} other wild flowers. A number of mammal species also thrive in the dense forests, {{including}} squirrels, monkeys, bats, flying lemurs, deer, tarsiers and wild pigs among others. The Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> along with other bird species such as the serpent eagle and sparrow hawk takes its home within the Mt. Kitanglad Range.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{interesting}} animals that inhabit the area in and around Abaga Falls. The most notable include; the endangered Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> also commonly known as the [...] "monkey-eating eagle", the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax), the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) which can only be found in the Philippines, and the Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans). Many of these animals are either near extinction or in danger of losing their habitats due to human activities.|$|R
40|$|The Philippines {{is among}} the most endemic-rich areas for all global {{biodiversity}} hotspots. Conserving that biodiversity presents multi-scaled challenges including the critical need for habitat and species level documentation as a basis for identifying conservation targets. This paper contributes to that need by describing the use of A Composite Bio-geographic Analysis (CBA) model to model the dynamics and inter-relationships between species distribution, nest, habitat and land use change, population distribution and access to the PA and to synthesize and evaluate data on the status and threats to the Philippine Eagle <b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi</b> in the Mt. Hamiguitan Protected Area, one of the key biodiversity areas in the Eastern Mindanao Biodiversity Corridor (EMBC) ...|$|R
5000|$|Abuan River - Abuan River is the Philippines’ Next Big Whitewater Destination. The sixty-five {{kilometres}} (65 km.) Abuan River is {{the main}} river channels inside the 50,625 hectares Abuan Watershed located in the city. The headwater of the said river is located inside the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park {{which is one of}} the richest and remaining virgin forest in the country and from within it is a verdant vision of plant and animal life - where Philippine eagles (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> soar. Tourists and visitors can also try intense activities like water rafting, kayaking and wall climbing to enjoy the breath taking experience that this place offers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} 31 endemic species of mammals {{on the island of}} Luzon. Sixty-eight percent of all known native non-flying mammals are endemic to the area (23 of 34).The Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> is the second-largest eagle in the world found {{primarily}} in the Sierra Madre mountain range of Luzon. Primary lowland rainforests of the Philippines have been heavily deforested, and the Philippine eagle needs this area to breed, as well as nesting in large trees and hunting within the trees. The eagle is restricted to the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Attempts for captive breeding have been unsuccessful and it is estimated that less than 700 individuals remain.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest of}} Mount Mariveles where the waterfalls are located {{contains}} many dipterocarps, orchids, and vines and other plant species including tsaang gubat. Various species of fungi growing in tree trunks have been documented. There {{are a number}} of interesting animals that inhabit the slopes of Mount Mariveles where the three waterfalls are located. The most notable include: the Japanese sparrowhawk, the endangered Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> commonly known as the “monkey-eating eagle", the Philippine eagle owl, the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax) locally known as kalaw, the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus), which can only be found in the Philippines. Philippine deer (erroneously reported by some as wild goats) and crab-eating macaques were also recently spotted in the area.|$|R
5000|$|While most bones studied {{have been}} {{internal}} ones, some remains of Haast's eagles {{allow people to}} make comparisons to living eagles. The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi),</b> which are {{the largest and most}} powerful living eagles alongside the Steller's sea eagle, also have similarly reduced relative wing-length in adaptation to forest-dwelling. A lower mandible from the Haast's eagle measured 11.4 cm and the tarsus in several Haast's fossils has been measured from 22.7 to 24.9 cm. In comparison, the largest beaks of eagles today (from the Philippine and the Steller's sea eagle) reach a little more than 7 cm; and the longest tarsal measurements (from the Philippine and the Papuan eagle) top out around 14 cm.|$|R
50|$|The Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi),</b> {{also known}} as the monkey-eating eagle or great Philippine eagle, is an eagle of the family Accipitridae endemic to forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-coloured plumage, and a shaggy crest, and {{generally}} measures 86 to 102 cm in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg. It is considered the largest of the extant eagles in {{the world in terms of}} length and wing surface, with the Steller's sea eagle and the harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk. Among the rarest and most powerful birds in the world, it has been declared the Philippine national bird. It is critically endangered, mainly due to massive loss of habitat resulting from deforestation in most of its range. Killing a Philippine eagle is punishable under Philippine law by 12 years in prison and heavy fines.|$|R
5000|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} are hunted {{by almost}} all variety of acciptrids {{when the opportunity}} arises and may be favored over other prey by some eagles, i.e. Spizaetus hawk-eagles and the [...] "eagles" [...] in Buteogallus, and several species of buteonine hawks found in the tropics. Bazas and forest hawks in the genus Accipiter may take reptiles from trees whilst other species may hunt them on the ground. Snakes are the primary prey of the snake-eagles (Circaetus) and serpent-eagles (Spilornis and Dryotriorchis). Apparently, the mammal-hunting, huge and endangered Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> is most {{closely related to the}} snake eagles. Another handsome aberration of the snake-eagle lineage (although, unlike the Philippine, has long been known to be a snake-eagle) is the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), which has evolved unusually bright plumage in adults, with a huge red cere, red feet, bright yellow bill, and boldly contrasting grey-and-white markings over black plumage. The bateleur has specialized to feed extensively on carrion and almost any other feeding opportunity that presents itself.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{predation}} pressure put on primates by diurnal {{birds of}} prey differs greatly between continents. Africa and South America have specialist raptors (e. g. crowned hawk-eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus and harpy eagle Harpia harpyja) whereas in Asia the only such spe-cialist’s (Philippine eagle <b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> distribu-tion is largely allopatric with primates. The almost universal absence of polyspecific groups in Asia (common in Africa and South America) may indicate reduced predation pres-sure. As such there is almost no information on predation pressures on primates in Asia by raptors. Here we report successful predation of a juvenile banded langur Presbytis femoralis (* 2 kg) by a changeable hawk-eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus. The troop that was attacked displayed no signs of being alarmed, and no calls were made before the event. We argue that in insular Southeast Asia, especially, large Spizaetus hawk-eagles (* 2 kg) are significant predators of arboreal colobines. Using data on the relative size of sym-patric Spizaetus hawk-eagles and colobines we make pre-dictions on where geographically we can expect the highest predation pressure (Thai–Malay Peninsula) and which col-obines are least (Nasalis larvatus, Trachypithecus auratus, P. thomasi) and most (P. femoralis, T. cristatus) affected...|$|R
40|$|The Philippine Eagle <b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi</b> is a diurnal raptor {{endemic to}} the Philippines. Its {{distribution}} {{is restricted to}} remaining forests on the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. The Philippine Eagle is classified as a Critically Endangered species under the IUCN Red List, with a high end estimated population of only 500 breeding pairs in the wild. Population decline {{has been attributed to}} continuing deforestation, particularly since the mid- 1900 s, and hunting. This study aimed to identify the effects of population decline on the genetic structure of the present population of the Philippine Eagle by sequencing 1132 bp of the mitochondrial control region from 22 individuals. Control region haplotype diversity (h = 0. 8960 ± 0. 05590) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0. 006194 ± 0. 003372) are comparable with other accipitrid species. Maximum likelihood trees and network analysis show that the Luzon and Samar individuals come from different lineages, but both shared a common ancestral population with the Mindanao population. The genetic diversity, multimodal mismatch distribution for the control region and high frequency of lower class modes all indicate a recent bottleneck for the Philippine Eagle population. Possible strategies for conservation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th Conference of the European Ornithologist's Union, celebrada en Badajoz (España) del 24 al 28 de agosto de 2015. Electrocution is a {{major problem}} for large raptors in open areas. The {{construction}} of safe electrical pole and wire configurations is the primary way of reducing this mortality and has been applied successfully in many regions of the Iberian Peninsula. However, electrocution is still the main cause of mortality for the Spanish Imperial Eagle. We employed an electric fence equipped power pole in a flight cage to train rehabilitated eagles ready for release to not use these poles as perches. To date three eagles were trained and released. Despite being the highest and most attractive perch in the cage avoidance of the power pole was effective after two low power electric shock experiences. Post- release satellite transmitter data is available only for one of the three individuals. This two-year-old eagle has establishes a small home range in an open area, and five months after release is still avoiding power poles as perches. These preliminary results show that similarly to other species such as the Californian Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) or the Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> conditioned learning is effective in the mid-term, as an additional tool to the correction of dangerous power poles.

50|$|The tarsus is of {{a modest}} length for a raptor of its size, at 8.5 - 10.3 cm, and is clearly shorter {{than that of}} martial eagle. However, the feet and legs are visibly thicker and heavier {{than those of the}} martial eagle and the s are {{apparently}} quite massive in both length and width. While no comprehensive measurements of the talon size of wild crowned eagles are known, one female museum specimen reportedly had a hallux-claw (or hind claw, which is the largest talon on accipitrids) of 6.2 cm, while another female was measured at 5 years of age, the age of sexual maturity, 5.74 cm in the hallux-claw and an adult male measured 4.9 cm. These figures put their talon size as around {{the same size as the}} largest golden eagles and close to those of a mid-sized harpy eagle. Some captive crowned eagles have been credited with a hallux-claw length of up to 10 cm, although, much like a single report of captive harpy eagles with a 13 cm hallux-claw, no such outsized talons are known to have been confirmed. In a small sampling of large, forest-dwelling raptors, the front-left talon of the crowned eagle, at 4.74 cm, was around one cm less than that of a harpy eagle or the huge, recently extinct Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei) and slightly smaller than those of the Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi).</b> Considering a big female of these species can weigh up to twice as much as an average crowned eagle may illustrate the relative largeness of the crowned eagle's talons.|$|R
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{is a very}} large eagle. In total length, it can range from 78 to 96 cm, with an average of {{approximately}} 85.5 cm. Its total length - in comparison to its wingspan - is restricted by its relatively short tail. Nonetheless, it appears to be the sixth or seventh longest living eagle species. The wingspan of martial eagles can range from 188 to 260 cm. Average wingspans have been claimed of 205 cm and 207.5 cm for the species, however ten measured martial eagles in the wild were found to average 211.9 cm in wingspan. Thus, the martial eagle appears to average fourth in wingspan among living eagles, behind only the Steller's sea-eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus), the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), in roughly that order. For a species that is fairly homogeneous in its genetic make-up, the body mass of martial eagles is surprisingly variable. To some extent, the variation of body masses in the species is contributable to considerable reverse sexual dimorphism as well as varying environmental conditions of various eagle populations. Unsexed martial eagles from various studies have been found to have weighed an average of 3.93 kg in 17 birds, 3.97 kg in 20 birds and 4.23 kg in 20 birds while the average weight of martial eagles shot by game wardens in the early 20th century in South Africa was listed as 4.71 kg. In weight range, the martial eagle broadly overlaps in size with the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and Verreaux's eagle (and is even exceeded by them in maximum known body mass). Based on numerous studies, the martial eagle appear to average mildly heavier than the Verreaux's eagle but (derived from the globally combined body mass of its various races), the mean body masses of golden and martial eagles are identical at approximately 4.17 kg. The renders the golden and martial eagles as tied as the largest African eagles (by body mass but not in total length or wingspan, in which the martial bests the golden), as well as the heaviest two species of booted eagle in the world and as tied as the sixth heaviest eagles in the world, after the three largest species of sea eagle (Steller's being the heaviest extant, the others ranking 4th and 5th), the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi).</b> The longest African eagle (and second longest booted eagle after the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax)) is the crowned eagle by virtue of its relatively longer tail, as its body weight is slightly less than these three heaviest booted eagle species.|$|R
50|$|An average Philippine flying lemur {{weighs about}} 1.0 to 1.7 kg and its head-body length is 33-38 cm (13-15 inch). Its tail length is 17-27 cm (6.7-10.6 inch). The species does exhibit sexual {{dimorphism}} where females {{are a bit}} larger than males. It has a wide head and rostrum with a robust mandible for increased bite strength, small ears, and big eyes with unique photoreceptor adaptations adapted for its nocturnal lifestyle. The large eyes allow for excellent vision which the colugo uses to accurately jump and glide from tree to tree. It has an avascular retina which is not typical of mammals, suggesting this is a primitive trait; on par with other nocturnal mammals, specifically nocturnal primates, the rod cells in the eye make up about 95-99% of the photoreceptors and cones make up about 1-5%. Its clawed feet are large and sharp with an incredible grip strength, allowing them to skillfully but slowly climb trees, hang from branches, or anchor themselves to {{the trunk of a}} tree. One unique feature of the colugo is the patagium, the weblike membrane that connects its limbs to allow for gliding. Unlike other mammals with patagia, its patagium extends from the neck to the limbs, in between digits, and even behind the hind limbs and the tail. Its keeled sternum, which is also seen in bats, aids in its gliding efficiency. Its patagium is the most extensive membrane used for gliding in mammals and also functions as a hammock-like pouch for its young. This membrane helps it glide distances of 100 m or more, useful for finding food and escaping predators, such as the Philippine eagle (<b>Pithecophaga</b> <b>jefferyi)</b> and tree-climbing snakes that try to attack the colugos when they glide between trees. The dental formula of Philippine flying lemur is 2/3, 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, with a total of 34 teeth. The first two lower procumbant incisors are pectinate with up to 15 tines which are thought to be used for grooming and grating food. The upper incisors are small and have spaces between them, as well. The deciduous teeth are serrated until they are lost and then they are replaced with blade-like teeth, designed to shear along with the molars that also have long shearing crests to help break down the plant matter they ingest. Following mechanical digestion, the digestive tract of the Philippine flying lemur, especially the stomach, is specially adapted to break down and process the large amount of leaves and vegetation they ingest. Colugos also have a brownish grey-and-white pelage they use as camouflage amongst the tree trunks and branches, which allows them to better hide from predators and hunters.|$|R
