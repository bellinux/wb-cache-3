5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} <b>predicted</b> <b>by</b> Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet <b>predicted</b> <b>by</b> Batygin and Brown.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns <b>predicted</b> <b>by</b> the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends <b>predicted</b> <b>by</b> earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E

5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as <b>predicted</b> <b>by</b> Boyle's law.|$|E

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{vibration}} {{is one of}} the main problems of engine damage. When the hydrogen-diesel dual fuel is used, it may affect the engine vibration. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of hydrogen-diesel dual fuel. The regression analysis is used to find the relations between hydrogen percentage and the engine vibration. The results for all cases found that the relation between the Average Peak Acceleration (APA) and hydrogen percentage (%H 2) can <b>predict</b> <b>by</b> using linear equation with average coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0. 8973 or 2 nd polynomial equation with R 2 = 0. 9592. All graphs are the decreasing function. APA can decrease by increasing %H 2.
