A karst fenster is born from a caving in of portions of the roof of subterranean stream, thus making some of the underground stream visible from the surface (Ritter).

Five indicators were selected by reference to the DRAV (D is the depth of water-table, R is the net recharge, A is the aquifer media and V is the impact of the vadose.) and VLDA (V is the lithology of the vadose zone, L is the land use pattern, D is the groundwater depth and A is the aquifer characteristics and.) models, namely, the lithology of the vadose zone (V), the groundwater depth (D), the degree of groundwater exploitation (E), the aquifer characteristics (A) and the land use pattern (L). According to monitoring data from 2003 and 2011, the variations of <b>phreatic</b> <b>water</b> quality in the plain area of the Junggar Basin were divided into three types: the water quality may have deteriorated, be unchanged or improved. Four groups of indicator weights were configured to calculate the vulnerability index using the VDEAL model. The changes of <b>phreatic</b> <b>water</b> quality were then compared against the vulnerability index. The normalized weights of V, D, E, A, and L were respectively 0. 15, 0. 25, 0. 10, 0. 10, and 0. 40; this is according to the principle that the sampling sites of deteriorated water quality are generally distributed in a high-vulnerability region, and the sites of unchanged and improved water quality are distributed in middle vulnerability, low vulnerability and invulnerable regions. The evaluation results of <b>phreatic</b> <b>water</b> vulnerability in the plain area of the Junggar Basin based on the VDEAL model are as follows.

40|$|When {{water from}} the surface, e. g. from a lake, fl ows down through porous {{carbonate}} rocks, through a region with high hydraulic conductivity and encounters the water table of a phreatic aquifer, both waters mix by diffusion along their boundary. In a carbonate aquifer, where both surface and phreatic waters are saturated with respect to calcite, mixing corrosion causes renewed dissolution capacity   Δc eq of the carbonate rock in the diffusion-mixing zone, extending from the boundary separating the <b>phreatic</b> <b>water</b> from the surface water encountering it. A numerical model is presented from which the initial change of porosity in such a diffusion-mixing zone is obtained. The initial change of porosity can be calculated from the local distribution of the mixing ratio, and the second derivative of Δc eq with respect to m. m(x,y) is the spatial distribution of the mixing ratio m= V surf /(V suf + V prh), where the V ’s assign the corresponding volumes of surface and <b>phreatic</b> <b>water.</b> The second derivative has been calculated for three geochemical scenarios with differing CO 2 - concentrations of surface and <b>phreatic</b> <b>water</b> {{by the use of}} PHREEQC- 2.
