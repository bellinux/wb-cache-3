40|$|This study investigates sociolinguistic {{variation}} in the traditional dialect of Sūf, a Hōrāni town in northern Jordan. Two variables are examined: (k) : depalatalization of /k/; and (l) : develarization of /l/, according to internal linguistic constrains and two external social factors: namely age and sex. Conditioned palatlalization of /k/ {{and the presence of}} a dark allophone of /l/ are two of the most salient phonological features of the dialects of Hōrān in general. The present study provides a quantitative analysis within the framework of Variationist Theory, using the multiple logistic regression program Rbrul. Palatalization of /k/ is treated at two levels and thus involves two variables: 1. Phonological variable (k); the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> for this variable includes tokens of /k/ in the stem of the word. 2. Morphophonemic variable (–ik); the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> includes tokens <b>of</b> /k/ in the feminine suffix -ik.
