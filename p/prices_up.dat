5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E
5|$|Wage growth {{beginning}} in 1950 pushed <b>prices</b> <b>up.</b> The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, {{a cut in}} public expenditures, and increases in taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed {{became one of the}} leading causes for Perón's downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955, as the working classes saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Perón from a large part of his popular support.|$|E
5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port {{out of the path}} of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, with little or no damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E

25|$|Debt reached {{unsustainable}} levels. Speculation {{in stocks}} drove <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> to unpresented valuation levels. The stock market crashed in late October 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} the {{municipality}} is to build low-density, spacious homes to preserve the landscape and views from every home. Although real estate prices are low relative to the Tel-Aviv area, its high rate of growth {{in recent years has}} pushed <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> faster than in similar sized cities.|$|E
25|$|However, the 1870s {{brought some}} relief to pastoralists as the {{establishment}} of northern goldfields created a local market for fresh meat. From 1872 buyers from Ravenswood and Charters Towers goldfields provided strong demand on stations in the vicinity. The Palmer River rush in 1873 sent cattle <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> {{to an average of}} £10 a head.|$|E

25|$|A key icon of DB {{is the use}} of golf carts {{to commute}} from one part of DB to another. The number of golf carts is highly {{restricted}} by the Transport Department to a total of 500 vehicles and demand for golf carts can push <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> to around HK$2,200,000 each – as expensive as a brand new luxury car. The DB golf carts are petrol powered.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, {{prices in}} the car market fluctuated greatly. Post-war {{inflation}} pushed <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> {{with the cost of}} some Star cars reaching above £1000, making them effectively unsaleable. However, as the economy entered recession prices dropped dramatically and Star was able to introduce a new range of models at cheaper prices. The 11.9hp model performed well, selling at a rate of 20 a week for the next few years.|$|E
25|$|As of June 2014 Canmore has {{the lowest}} vacancy rate in Canada for rental {{properties}} according to a CMHC Spring report. This in turn is having {{an effect on the}} housing market and pushing <b>prices</b> <b>up.</b> Along with the uptick in the oil industry and second home buyers coming back into the market from Calgary, the housing market is showing signs of not only recovering but becoming very strong as inventory levels are at a 6-year low.|$|E

50|$|In Story mode {{the player}} {{takes on the}} {{position}} of Mexico's Chief of Police with the main aim of tacking the countries drug problems by destroying the various cartels. The game aims to show {{the link between the}} street price of drugs and policing, so as the policing succeeds, so it constricts the supply of drugs and pushes the <b>price</b> <b>up.</b> As the <b>price</b> goes <b>up,</b> so new cartels enter the market as it becomes more profitable.|$|R
25|$|In February 2015, Pfizer and Hospira {{agreed that}} Pfizer would acquire Hospira for $15.2billion, {{a deal in}} which Hospira {{shareholders}} would receive $90 in cash for each share they owned. News of the deal sent Hospira share <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> from $63.43 to $87.43 on a volume of 60.7 million shares. Including debt, the deal is valued at around $17billion. Hospira is the largest producer of generic injectable pharmaceuticals in the world. On {{the final day of}} trading, Hospira shares traded for $89.96 each, giving a market capitalisation of $15.56 billion.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, BHP Billiton {{announced}} a $2.2 billion {{investment in the}} new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico. During the same year, {{as part of their}} plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile, which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> by 4%.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of the use of {{probability}} theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.|$|E
2500|$|To {{reduce this}} volatility, some gold mining {{companies}} hedge the gold <b>price</b> <b>up</b> to 18 months in advance. [...] This provides the mining company and investors with less exposure to short-term gold price fluctuations, but reduces returns when the gold price is rising.|$|R

All the ingredients of a classic disruptive start-up.” ...|$|R
25|$|By the 2000s and 2010s, {{an influx}} of {{residents}} seeking affordable family housing had pushed property <b>prices</b> <b>up.</b> In 2015, houses {{in various parts of}} Windsor Terrace sold for about $1.2 million to $2 million in 2015, and apartments cost from $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to more than $1 million for a three-bedroom apartment. Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|After the 1970s {{peripheral}} lot regulation {{increased and}} infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land <b>prices</b> <b>up.</b> The poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase their lot and build their house, and {{were forced to}} look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared. These housing types were often located closer {{to the center of the}} city: favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization—alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.|$|E
25|$|Commerce, transportation, {{services}} and tourism accounts for 59% of the state's GDP and employs just over 50% {{of the working}} population. The growth of the commerce sector is due to urbanization {{and the growth of}} tourism. The biggest selling point of the state touristically is its location, just south of Mexico City, which has the largest and wealthiest population in the country. Many of these people come to spend the weekend in Cuernavaca's nightclubs and away from Mexico City's traffic and pollution. Many of these visitors have bought second homes here, which has driven property <b>prices</b> <b>up.</b> Those from Mexico City and other cities are also attracted to the states water parks and spas, such as Las Palmas in Tehuixtla, El Rollo and the Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Schumer {{proposed}} that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan ("affordable") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes <b>priced</b> <b>up</b> to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} in the European Union as Alisado brasileiro, which has {{increased}} its popularity {{over the last four}} years, bringing up more beauty salons practicing this technique which has a <b>price</b> <b>up</b> to €400 a session. It is also confused or mistaken for keratina, another hair treatment.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} US$250 million contract - but cost overruns, partly due to unanticipated armed conflict in Shaba Province, pushed the final <b>price</b> <b>up</b> over US$1 billion, with unofficial estimates ranging as high as US$1.3 billion, inclusive of a comprehensive Operations and Maintenance Contract.|$|R
25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, numerous price increases of several products were announced, such as gasoline, cigarettes, soft drinks, and then, on June 30, {{the nation was}} shocked {{to find out that}} a major increase in meat <b>prices</b> (<b>up</b> to 60%) had been announced. The increase also included the so-called meat products, available in canteens in Polish factories. Reaction of the workers was immediate. On the next day, strikes broke out in Warsaw's tractor plant Ursus, in the bus producer Autosan in Sanok, in the Communications Equipment Factory in Mielec, in the car component factory Polmo in Tczew and in the compressor plant Ponar in Tarnów. In the Ursus tractor factory, the workers organised assemblies, composed a list of demands, and elected a strike committee. They resisted the threat of firings and repression and carried on work stoppages throughout {{the following}} period.|$|E
25|$|Between 1890 and 1896, the BSAC granted an area {{encompassing}} 16 million acresabout one-sixth {{the area}} of Southern Rhodesiato European immigrants. By 1913 this had been extended to 21.5 million acres. However, these concessions were strictly regulated, and land was only offered to those individuals able to prove they had the necessary capital to develop it. Exceptions were made during the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against the BSAC in the mid 1890s, when land was promised to any European men willing {{to take up arms}} in defence of the colony, irrespective of their financial status. The settlers of the Pioneer Column were granted tracts of 3150 acres apiece, with an option to purchase more land from the BSAC's holdings at relatively low <b>prices</b> (<b>up</b> to fifteen times cheaper than comparable land on the market in South Africa).|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Harry Potters British publisher, Bloomsbury, and Asda, a British {{supermarket}} chain {{owned by the}} US corporation Wal-Mart. On 15 July, {{a week before the}} release of the final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was [...] "holding children to ransom" [...] and that, [...] "t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a quid-ditch as they have sent their <b>prices</b> <b>up</b> north on the Hogwarts Express. By setting the recommended retail price at this level can only be seen [...] as blatant profiteering on their part." [...] Pritchard {{went on to say that}} Asda was acting to [...] "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was [...] "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller". Asda had planned to sell the book as a loss leader at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's recommended retail price of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).|$|E
50|$|The {{passing of}} the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to £890 in early June. This peak {{encouraged}} people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the <b>price</b> <b>up</b> at around £750.|$|R
50|$|The Bobcat was {{an armored}} {{personnel}} carrier (APC) {{designed and built}} in Canada in the 1950s and early 1960s. A lengthy development period and changing requirements drove the <b>price</b> <b>up</b> while not improving the basic design, and the project was eventually cancelled in late 1963 in favor of purchasing the ubiquitous M113.|$|R
5000|$|The Witness was {{developed}} by Jonathan Blow and his studio Thekla, Inc. Though self-funded and published, the game's development cost around $6 million and was priced at $40, in contrast to most indie games typically <b>priced</b> <b>up</b> to $20. Blow believed this type of game represented something between indie and AAA publishing.|$|R
