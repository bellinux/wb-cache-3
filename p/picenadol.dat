5000|$|<b>Picenadol</b> (LY-97435) is a 4-phenylpiperidine {{derivative}} {{that is an}} {{opioid analgesic}} drug developed by Eli Lilly in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picenadol</b> is an {{effective}} analgesic with similar efficacy to pethidine (meperidine). It has been investigated for some applications such as obstetrics and dentistry, but never commercialised.|$|E
50|$|Ciprefadol is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} isoquinoline derivative most closely related to cyclazocine and <b>picenadol,</b> {{with a number of}} other related compounds known. Ciprefadol is a mixed agonist-antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and can partly block the effects of morphine at low doses, though at higher doses it acts more like a full agonist. It is also a potent κ-opioid agonist, unlike the corresponding N-methyl and N-phenethyl derivatives which are reasonably μ-selective agonists.|$|E
40|$|The mixed-action oploid <b>picenadol</b> (LY 1 50720) is a {{racemic mixture}} whose {{resolution}} {{results in a}} stereoselective separation of agonist and antagonist activity. The effects of <b>picenadol,</b> its dextrorotatory isomer (LY 1 36596) and morphine were studied alone and in combination with naloxone in squirrel monkeys responding under a schedule of electric shock titration. Shock intensity was scheduled to increase at 15 -sec intervals in 30 steps from 0 to 5. 5 mA. Completion of a fixed ratio 5 -response requirement terminated the shock for a 15 -sec time-out period after which shock resumed at the next lower intensity. <b>Picenadol</b> (0. 1 - 17. 5 mg/kg), the d-isomer (0. 3 - 3. 0 mg/kg) and morphine (0. 3 - 5. 6 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the intensity at which monkeys maintained the shock without decreasing responding {{in the presence of}} shock. Shock intensity increases produced by <b>picenadol</b> occurred over a broader dose range tha...|$|E
40|$|The mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, {{pentazocine}} and <b>picenadol</b> {{were compared}} to the prototype mu and kappa agonists morphine and Mr 2033, respectively, in the following tests in rhesus monkeys: overt behavioral effects upon acute administration in drug-naive animals; discriminative stimulus properties in monkeys trained to respond to either etorphine or ethylketazocine; self-administration of the test agent relative to codeine; single dose suppression and precipitation in withdrawn and non-withdrawn morphine-dependent monkeys, respectively; and primary addiction studies in drug-naive animals. Whereas both buprenorphine and nalbuphine precipitate withdrawal in morphine-dependent monkeys, withdrawal following chronic administration of buprenorphine resulted in no observable signs of abstinence, while nalbuphine withdrawal {{was similar to that}} seen in morphine-dependent monkeys. Butorphanol, pentazocine and <b>picenadol</b> all produced mild dependence of the kappa-type; that is, natural withdrawal behavior similar to that seen following chronic Mr 2033 administration...|$|E
