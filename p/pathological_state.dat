2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E

However, all these radiological methods of examination {{do not offer}} the same possibilities, nor {{do they have the}} same importance in diagnostics of <b>pathological</b> <b>states</b> and disorders of the eye. The aim of the paper is to present the diagnostic possibilities of radiological methods of examination in making the diagnosis of <b>pathological</b> <b>states</b> and disorders of the eye. The paper is based on the material collected by the author and coauthors, and comprises a collection of standard roentgenograms, echosonograms, CT and MR of the cranium, orbits etc., histories of diseases, as well as the review of the literature. Also, the paper presents the possibilities and advantages of certain radiological methods of examination during making the diagnosis of <b>pathological</b> <b>states</b> and disorders of the eye, with individual presentation of the method of examination.

50|$|Fibrosis is the {{formation}} of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process. This can be a reactive, benign, or <b>pathological</b> <b>state.</b> In response to injury, this is called scarring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, {{this is called a}} fibroma. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can obliterate the architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing. Defined by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.|$|E

Pressure overload may affect any of the four chambers of the heart, though the term is most commonly applied to one of the two ventricles. Chronic pressure overload leads to concentric hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle, which can in turn lead to heart failure, myocardial ischaemia or, in extreme cases, outflow obstruction.|$|E

50|$|Indeed, some style guides {{recommend}} that the terms homosexual and homosexuality be avoided altogether, lest their use cause confusion or arouse controversy. In particular the description of individuals as homosexual may be offensive, partially because of the negative clinical association of the word stemming from its use in describing same-sex attraction as a <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> before homosexuality {{was removed from the}} American Psychiatric Associations list of mental disorders in 1973. The Associated Press and New York Times style guides restrict usage of the terms.|$|E
50|$|Vascular {{disease is}} a <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> of large and medium muscular arteries and is {{triggered}} by endothelial cell dysfunction. Because of factors like pathogens, oxidized LDL particles and other inflammatory stimuli endothelial cells become active. The process causes thickening of the vessel wall, forming a plaque that consists of proliferating smooth muscle cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. The plaque results in a restricted blood flow which will decrease the amount of oxygen and nutrients that reach certain organs, the plaque might rupture causing the formation of clots.|$|E

He joined Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault, Hippolyte Bernheim and Jules Liégeois to defend the theses of the Nancy School against those of the Salpêtrière School of Jean Martin Charcot. The Nancy School thought that hypnosis was a state similar to sleep produced by suggestion, while the Salpêtrière School {{thought that it was}} a <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> similar to hysteria. In 1887, he published Le somnambulisme provoqué: études physiologiques et psychologiques that he originally wanted to include in Recherches expérimentales sur les conditions de l'activité cérébrale et sur la physiologie des nerfs.

40|$|Abstract During echocardiographic examination, {{respiration}} induces cyclic physiological {{changes of}} intracardiac haemodynamics, causing normal {{variations of the}} right and left ventricle Doppler inflows and outflows and physiological variation of extracardiac flows. The respiration related hemodynamic variation in intra and extracardiac flows may be utilized in the echocardiography laboratory to aid diagnosis in different <b>pathological</b> <b>states.</b> Nevertheless, physiologic respiratory phases can cause excessive translational motion of cardiac structures, lowering 2 D image quality and interfering with optimal Doppler interrogation of flows or tissue motion. This review focuses on the impact of normal respiratory cycle and provocative respiratory maneuvers in echocardiographic examination, both in physiological and <b>pathological</b> <b>states,</b> emphasizing their applications in specific clinical situations. </p...|$|R

50|$|In lipidomic research, a {{vast amount}} of {{information}} quantitatively describing the spatial and temporal alterations in the content and composition of different lipid molecular species is accrued after perturbation of a cell through changes in its physiological or <b>pathological</b> <b>state.</b> Information obtained from these studies facilitates mechanistic insights into changes in cellular function. Therefore, lipidomic studies play an essential role in defining the biochemical mechanisms of lipid-related disease processes through identifying alterations in cellular lipid metabolism, trafficking and homeostasis.

50|$|Osmotic {{diuresis}} is {{the increase}} of urination rate caused {{by the presence of}} certain substances in the small tubes of the kidneys. The excretion occurs when substances such as glucose enter the kidney tubules and cannot be reabsorbed (due to a <b>pathological</b> <b>state</b> or the normal nature of the substance). The substances cause an increase in the osmotic pressure within the tubule, causing retention of water within the lumen, and thus reduces the reabsorption of water, increasing urine output (i.e. diuresis). The same effect can be seen in therapeutics such as mannitol, which is used to increase urine output and decrease extracellular fluid volume.|$|E
