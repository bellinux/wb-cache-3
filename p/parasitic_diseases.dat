25|$|As it {{is almost}} entirely forested, the South {{supports}} many disease-carrying organisms.

25|$|Gordon's major {{contribution}} was in {{laying the foundations}} of modern epidemiological thinking in the control of internal parasites of grazing ruminants, and sheep in particular.

Life expectancy averages about 76 years for men and 83 years for women.|$|E
25|$|Schistosomiasis {{affected}} about 252 {{million people}} worldwide in 2015. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000 people die from it each year.

In tropical countries, schistosomiasis is second only to malaria among <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> with the greatest economic impact. Schistosomiasis is listed as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 1,043,292, or 55% of all {{deaths in}} Russia {{were caused by}} {{cardiovascular}} disease. The second {{leading cause of death}} was cancer which claimed 287,840 lives (15.2%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.5%), road accidents (1.5%), murders (0.8%), accidental alcohol poisoning (0.4%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 202,175 lives in total (10.6%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.6%), respiratory disease (3.6%), infectious and <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> (1.6%), and tuberculosis (0.9%).

25|$|Health {{security}} â€“ Health Security aims {{to guarantee}} a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases,</b> whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater for poor people in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.|$|E
