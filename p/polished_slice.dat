40|$|To {{study the}} micro/mesomechanical {{behaviors}} of heterogeneous geomaterials, a multiscale simulation method that combines molecular simulation at the microscale, a mesoscale analysis of <b>polished</b> <b>slices,</b> and finite element numerical simulation is proposed. By processing the mesostructure images obtained from analyzing the <b>polished</b> <b>slices</b> of heterogeneous geomaterials and mapping them onto finite element meshes, a numerical model that more accurately reflects the mesostructures of heterogeneous geomaterials {{was established by}} combining the results with the microscale mechanical properties of geomaterials obtained from the molecular simulation. This model was then {{used to analyze the}} mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous materials. Because kernstone is a typical heterogeneous material that comprises many types of mineral crystals, it was used for the micro/mesoscale mechanical behavior analysis in this paper using the proposed method. The results suggest that the proposed method can be used to accurately and effectively study the mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous geomaterials at the micro/mesoscales...|$|R

40|$|Circular and {{hexagonal}} defects {{were formed}} in bulk silicon crystals by an-nealing and slow cooling. Some of these circular defects were unusual in possessing spoke-like radial lines in directions. By {{use of the}} rule that the Burgers vector is invariant against displacement of the Burgers circuit through good crystal regions, the radial lines are shown to have zero net Burgers vector and thus are probably dislocation dipoles. A mechanism is presented that accounts for the observed defects {{in terms of the}} formation of Frank sessile loops and half-loops. The principal significance of this interpre-tation is that when the circular defects containing radial l ines appear, pre-cipitates are present in the material.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for thinning localized regions in GaP for examination by means of transmission electron microscopy. A jet of chlorine in methanol was used to chemically <b>polish</b> <b>slices</b> from the P (l l l) face. To thin specimens from the Ga (l l l) face the same reagent and apparatus were used, but a voltage was applied so that the specimen was anodic with respect to an electrode inserted in the jet.

GaP is optically transparent, {{but if it is}} i l luminated only with wavelengths for which it has a sufficiently large absorption coeffi-cient, it can be arranged that significant transmission of light begins only when the material is thin enough for electron transmission.

40|$|Fifty-one {{waste rock}} samples {{collected}} from an abandoned mine in north Queensland, Australia were characterised by routine and advanced geochemical tests {{to aid the}} development of a mineralogical Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) Index. The ARD Index comprises five categories (diameter/size, degree of alteration and morphology of acid generating phase; content of neutralising phases and spatial relationship between acid generating and neutralising phases). <b>Polished</b> rock <b>slices</b> (up to 5 cm diameter) and petrographic thin sections were evaluated by these criteria and scored out of 50, with a higher number representing a greater acid generating potential. Ten mesotextural groups were identified and extensive geochemical testing confirmed there to be four potentially acid forming mesotextures (C, G, H & J). Classification using the mineralogical ARD Index recognised only two mesotextures as significantly acid forming (mesotextures H & J). ARD Index values were cross-checked against paste pH values which confirmed mesotextures C and G as not acid forming which is in agreement with the sulphide mineralogy.

From ten pairs, 592 mechanical assays on the cancellous bone of femoral heads were performed. There was a high variation in the mechanical properties of the specimens from the different donors. However, no statistical difference could be observed within each pair when side-to-side symmetry was tested for the different mechanical characteristics. Ultimate stress at failure and stiffness were also highly correlated for each mirror location of each pair. Provided that an accurate and reproducible method of slicing femoral head can be achieved, an excellent mechanical symmetry is observed using a static compressive test.

The room temperature effective paramagnetic moment of the crystal {{was consistent with the}} Pr^ 3 + ionic configuration and full occupancy of the Pr-sublattice. The crystal showed two distinct anomalies in the specific heat and an overall discontinuity in C/T of more than 1000 mJ/K^ 2 mol.

We observed a shoulder in χ' and two peaks in χ" below T_c 1. However, there were no signatures in χ' of the lower temperature transition. PrOs_ 4 Sb_ 12 is extremely sensitive to grinding, which suppresses the upper superconducting transition in both the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.

This work, which extends the earlier study by Fegley and Treiman, {{is part of a}} long range research program to experimentally measure the rates of thermochemical gas-solid reactions important in the atmospheric-lithospheric sulfur cycle on Venus. The objectives of this research are (1) to measure the kinetics of thermochemical gas-solid reactions responsible for both the production (e. g., anhydrite formation) and destruction (e. g., pyrrhotite oxidation) of sulfur-bearing minerals on the surface of Venus and (2) to incorporate these and other constraints into holistic models of the chemical interactions between the atmosphere and surface of Venus. Experiments were done with single crystal cubes of natural pyrite (Navajun, Logrono, Spain) that were cut and <b>polished</b> into <b>slices</b> of known weight and surface area. The slices were isothermally heated at atmospheric pressure in 99. 99 percent CO 2 (Coleman Instrument Grade) at either 412 C (685 K) or 465 C (738 K) for time periods up to 10 days. These two isotherms correspond to temperatures at about 6 km and 0 km altitude, respectively, on Venus.

On these substrates, a thin Mo layer with thickness {{in the range}} 0.2 – 0.5  nm, as measured by quartz monitored weighing, was sputtered at a deposition rate of 0.01  nm/s from a high-purity Mo source in high vacuum, followed by MoS 2 layer synthesis through sulfurization at 800  °C for 30  min in pure H 2 S at a pressure pH 2 S of 100  mbar (process a) or 10  mbar (process b), according to the chemical reaction Mo[*]+[*] 2 H 2 S[*]→[*]MoS 2 [*]+[*] 2 H 2 (g).

5000|$|Heizer's latest project, Levitated Mass (2012), was for LACMA. He {{tried to}} build it in 1969 with a smaller boulder, but the crane {{attempting}} to lift it snapped. It was not until 2005 that he discovered an appropriate boulder, when a routine blast at Stone Valley Quarry in Riverside County, California, produced the piece he had imagined, and the project started coming together. LACMA's director Michael Govan first visited the site in 1994 as director of Dia:Beacon. Since then, Govan has become Heizer's greatest ally in the art world, raising $10 million from private donors to realize Levitated Mass and serving as {{a spokesman for the}} artist. It took eleven nights, from February 28 to March 10, 2012, to move the 340-ton rock from Jurupa Valley to the museum. The granite boulder (21.5 feet wide and 21.5 feet high) is installed atop a 456-foot-long trench, which allows people to walk under it. The long channel, descending to a depth of 15 feet, is encircled by a lozenge-shaped line of weathering steel embedded in the earth and rusting to a velvety brown. The installation is situated in a field of <b>polished</b> concrete <b>slices,</b> set at a slight angle between the Resnick Pavilion and Sixth Street. Heizer opened the exhibit on June 24, 2012. A feature documentary, also named [...] "Levitated Mass," [...] was directed and edited by the filmmaker Doug Pray.

40|$|Free {{abrasive}} {{machining processes}} such as lapping, <b>polishing,</b> and wiresaw <b>slicing</b> are widely used in industry {{for the purposes of}} material removal. A lot of research efforts [1 - 8] have been carried out to understand the effect of different process parameters such as slurry concentration, abrasive size distribution, applied loads on material removal rate, surface roughness of the workpiece, material removal mechanism etc. Effects of mixed abrasive slurries on material removal rate and surface roughness have hardly been studied in previous research. Material removal mechanisms: The material removal mechanisms involved in free abrasive machining processes can be classified into essentially three categories as illustrated in Figure 1. Free abrasive machining primarily remove material using either rolling indenting or rolling scratching mechanisms while fixed abrasive machining processes primarily involve pure scratching. The mechanisms involved in various free abrasive machining processes have been illustrated graphically in Figure 2. In rolling-scratching process abrasives often get trapped between the plate and the workpiece. Thus, the abrasives are not as uniformly distributed as in rolling-indenting, in which the abrasives are free to move. This can lead to non-uniformity in material removal over different parts of th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A diamond {{from the}} Finsch mine (South Africa) was {{investigated}} by X-ray diffraction topography {{to characterize the}} extended defects and to reconstruct the growth history. The sample was a doubly <b>polished</b> triangular diamond <b>slice</b> with a rounded side in which re-entrant corners could be seen and the specimen exhibited anomalous birefringence. X-ray topographs show that the sample is actually a mosaic crystal that developed through aggregation of sub-individual parts during growth: some slightly rotated relative {{to one another and}} others twinned. The twin law is by reticular merohedry and consists of the well-known 2 -fold rotation around [111]. Micro-Raman spectroscopy data revealed that the main inclusions are pyrope and enstatite trapped in the inner part of the individual. No dislocations nucleated from the silicate inclusions. Growth-sector boundaries, dislocations, grain boundaries and twinning indicate that these features formed during the growth of diamond. Throughout the whole sample and chiefly in the regions showing a lower density of inclusions, packed lamination lines parallel to an octahedral face can be observed. These laminations represent a polysynthetic twinning commonly observed in diamonds which have undergone plastic deformation and are considered to be a post-growth defect. The analysis of the structural defects allows a reconstruction of a complex growth history, characterized by a sequence of alternating episodes of growth and dissolution and, lastly, plastic deformation. This study represents a methodological contribution to the studies on the origin of diamond. Key-words: diamond, inclusions, structural defects, twinning, crystal growth, plastic deformation. 1...|$|R
