Specifically, we examine {{the sign of the}} second variation of a conserved functional for the case of a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (i. e. one with a linear lapse rate) and with a linear profile of zonal wind. Sufficient stability conditions for an infinite atmosphere (i. e. with a temperature lapse rate equal to zero) are satisfied only for an atmosphere in solid body rotation. For a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of finite extent (a lapse rate is not equal zero) the sufficient conditions of stability can be satisfied if a lid is placed below min (Z max, polytropic atmospheric height). The dependence of height Z max on values of the vertical gradient of the zonal wind and the zonal temperature distribution is calculated...|$|E

Here, we employ the concepts of polytropic change of state and polytropic temperature for investigating the problem of scaling potential vorticity. For many applications, it has proven useful to scale P with a dimensionless scale factor to remove its exponential increase with altitude.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a very large aspect ratio (42. 6) {{numerical}} simulation of fully compressible turbulent convection in a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and focus on the properties of large-scale flows. Mesoscale patterns dominate the turbulent energy spectrum. We show that these structures, which had already been observed in Boussinesq simulations by Cattaneo et al. (2001), have a genuine convective origin and do not result directly from collective interactions of the smaller scales of the flow, even though their growth is strongly affected by nonlinear transfers. If this result is relevant to the solar photosphere, it suggests that the dominant convective mode below the Sun's surface may be at mesoscales.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} simulations {{have been}} used to study the scattering of a surface-gravity wave packet by vertical magnetic flux tubes, with radii from 200 km to 3 Mm, embedded in stratified <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The scattered wave was found to consist primarily of m= 0 (axisymmetric) and m= 1 modes. It was found that the ratio of the amplitude of these two modes is strongly dependant on the radius of the flux tube: The kink mode is the dominant mode excited in tubes with a small radius while the sausage mode is dominant for large tubes. Simulations of this type provide a simple, efficient and robust way to start understanding the seismic signature of flux tubes, which have recently began to be observed.

40|$|Shear flows have an {{important}} impact on the dynamics in an assortment of different astrophysical objects including accreditation discs and stellar interiors. Investigating shear flow instabilities in a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> provides a fundamental understanding of the motion in stellar interiors where turbulent motions, mixing processes, as well as magnetic field generation takes place. Here, a linear stability analysis for a fully compressible fluid in a two-dimensional Cartesian geometry is carried out. Our study focuses on determining the critical Richardson number for different Mach numbers and the destabilising effects of high thermal diffusion. We find {{that there is a}} deviation of the predicted stability threshold for moderate Mach number flows along with a significant effect on the growth rate of the linear instability for small Péclet numbers. We show that in addition to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability a Holmboe instability can appear and we discuss the implication of this in stellar interiors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the three-dimensional instability of {{a layer of}} horizontal magnetic field in a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> where, contrary to previous studies, the field lines in the initial state are not unidirectional. We show that if the twist is initially concentrated inside the unstable layer, the modifications of the instability reported by several authors (see e. g. Cattaneo et al. (1990 a)) are only observed when the calculation is restricted to two di-mensions. In three dimensions, the usual interchange instability occurs, in the direction fixed by the field lines at the interface between the layer and the field-free region. We therefore introduce a new configuration: the instability now develops in a weakly mag-netised atmosphere where {{the direction of the}} field can vary with respect to the direction of the strong unstable field below, the twist being now concentrated at the upper inter-face. Both linear stability analysis and non-linear direct numerical simulations are used to study this configuration. We show that from the small-scale interchange instability, large-scale twisted coherent magnetic structures are spontaneously formed, with possi-ble implications to the formation of active regions from a deep-seated solar magnetic field.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} fibril {{structure of}} the magnetic fields at {{the surface of the}} sun (with fibrils compressed to 1, 000 - 2, 000 gauss) lies outside existing statistical theories of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The total energy of the fibril field is enhanced by a factor of more than 100 above the energy for the mean field in a continuum state. The magnetic energy density within a fibril is of the order of 100 times the local kinetic energy density, so that no simple application of equipartition principles is possible. It is pointed out that the total energy of the atmosphere (thermal + gravitational + magnetic) is reduced by the fibril state of the field by avoiding the magnetic inhibition of the convective overturning, suggesting that the formation of the observed intense fibril state may be in response to the associated energy reduction. Calculation of the minimum total energy of a <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> permeated by magnetic fibrils yields theoretical fibril fields of the order of 1 - 5 kilogauss when characteristics appropriate to the solar convective zone are introduced, in rough agreement with the actual fields of 1 - 2 kilogauss.

40|$|Free {{internal}} {{waves in}} polytropic atmospheres are studied (<b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is such {{one that the}} temperature of gas linearly depends on altitude). We suppose gas to be ideal and incompressible. Also, we regard the atmosphere of constant height with the "rigid lid" condition on its top to filter internal waves. If temperature, density and pressure of such undisturbed atmosphere do not depend on latitude and longitude then the internal waves are harmonic with apriori unknown eigenfrequencies, the problem permits separation of variables and reduces to the system of two ODE's. The first ODE (the Laplace's tidal equation) is analyzed by author earlier. The second ODE determines the vertical structure of the waves to be considered and has analytical solution for polytropic atmospheres. There are 6 dimensionless numbers, 2 for the Laplace's tidal equation and 4 for the vertical structure equation. The solution is a countable set of the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the vertical structure equation; every eigenfrequency/eigenfunction corresponds to its own countable set of the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the Laplace's tidal equation. Parametric analysis of {{the problem has been}} done. It shows that there exists the solution weakly depending on altitude-temperature variations and the atmosphere's height for parameters modelling the Earth's troposphere (with the "rigid lid" between the troposphere and the tropopause). The natural periods of internal waves have been obtained for this case. Comment: 7 pages, 1 table, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Shear flows have a {{significant}} impact on the dynamics in various astrophysical objects, including accretion discs and stellar interiors. Due to observational limitations the complex dynamics in stellar interiors that result in turbulent motions, mixing processes, and magnetic field generation, are not entirely understood. It is therefore necessary to investigate the inevitable small-scale dynamics via numerical calculations. In particular a thin region with strong shear at the base of the convection zone in the Sun, the tachocline, is believed to play an important role in the Sun's interior dynamics and magnetic field generation. Velocity measurements suggest a stable tachocline. However, helioseismology can only provide large-scale time-averaged measurements, so small scale turbulent motions can still be present. Therefore, studying the stability of shear flows and their non-linear evolution in a fully compressible <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> provides a fundamental understanding of potential motion in stellar interiors and is the main focus of this thesis. To commence the investigations a linear stability analysis of a stratified system in a two-dimensional Cartesian geometry is performed to study the effect of compressibility and thermal diffusivity on the stability threshold. In addition, this first investigation provides a reference for subsequent non-linear calculations. Focusing on a local model of unstable shear flows, direct numerical calculations are used to first compare numerical forcing methods to sustain a shear flow against viscous dissipation; and then to study the effect of key parameters on the saturated quasi-steady regime. Finally, magnetic fields are included and the full set of MHD equations is solved to study a potential kinematic dynamo in shear-driven turbulence...|$|E
40|$|Some {{features}} of hydro- and thermodynamics, {{as applied to}} atmospheres and to stellar structures, are puzzling: 1. The suggestion, first made by Laplace, that our atmosphere has an adiabatic temperature distribution, is confirmed for the lower layers, but the reason why it should be so is understood only qualitatively. 2. Arguments in which a concept of energy plays a role, {{in the context of}} hydro-thermodynamical systems and gravitation, are often flawed, and some familiar results concerning the stability of model stellar structures, first advanced {{at the end of the}} 19 th century and repeated in the most modern textbooks, are less than completely convincing. 3. The standard treatment of relativistic thermodynamics does not allow for a systematic treatment of mixtures, such as the mixture of a perfect gas with radiation. 4. The concept of mass in applications of general relativity to stellar structure is unsatisfactory. It is proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation of these matters. We formulate thermodynamics of ideal gases in terms of an action principle and study the interaction between an ideal gas and the photon gas, or heat. The action principle provides a hamiltonian functional, not available in traditional approaches where familiar expressions for the energy have no operative meaning. The usual <b>polytropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in an external gravitational field is examined, in order to determine to what extent it is shaped by radiation. A new formulation of the concept of radiative equilibrium is proposed. Comment: Substantial changes have been made to the pape...|$|E
