Recent results in multivariable robust control synthesis for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems are applied to the control of a turbofan engine {{over a wide range}} of power codes. Seven linear, time-invariant models are used in the control design. The resulting LPV controller consists of seven linear controllers, gain scheduled via linear interpolation. This gain-scheduled controller is obtained directly as part of the described design process, as opposed to conventional processes, where the gain schedules are developed after the fact to connect point designs. A model matching approach is employed such that the resulting closed loop resembles a decoupled set of second-order systems with specified rise times and overshoots. The performance of linear H point designs are compared with the LPV controller at fixed operating points.

In order to improve the transmitter power efficiency, the outphasing modulation in the proposed architecture effectively increases the number of MLRFPWM signal output levels. In addition, a multi-band multibit band-pass delta-sigma modulator (BPDSM) with a hard clipping technique is introduced, which further improves <b>power</b> <b>coding</b> efficiency by trading off distortion performance with coding efficiency.

The two GaN PAs are driven by bipolar RF PWM signals, which are transformed from a concurrent dual-band LTE signal by MDPC. The dual-band LTE signal with 15 -MHz aggregate channel bandwidth at 240 MHz and 500 MHz frequency band is transmitted with- 30 dBc and- 37 dBc out-of-band emissions, respectively.

Critical issue of the HCCIcombustion is {{the control of the}} engine since thecombustion process is mostly dominated by chemicalkinetics. Therefore the accurate assessment of thechemical kinetic is fundamental in numerical simulation ofthis kind of engines. Experimentally it has been demonstrated that even inHCCI engine the charge within the cylinder is not fullyhomogeneous, but many quantities, such as temperature,density and equivalence ratio, vary along the combustionchamber. These inhomogeneities influence thecombustion process and yield the homogeneous reactormodel to be not completely adequate to simulate HCCIcombustion. This paper focuses on the use of a stochastic rectormodel in order to account for temperatureinhomogeneities in the numerical simulation of the HCCIcombustion.

Such link characteristics can significantly degrade TCP performance as the TCP sender assumes wireless losses to be congestion losses resulting in unnecessary congestion control actions. Link errors can be reduced by increasing transmission <b>power,</b> <b>code</b> redundancy (FEC) or number of retransmissions (ARQ). But increasing power costs resources, increasing code redundancy reduces available channel bandwidth and increasing persistency increases end-to-end delay. The paper proposes a TCP optimization through proper tuning of power management, FEC and ARQ in wireless environments (WLAN and WWAN). In particular, we conduct analytical and numerical analysis {{taking into account the}} three aforementioned factors, and evaluate TCP (and “wireless-aware ” TCP) performance under different settings. Our results show that increasing power, redundancy and/or retransmission levels always improves TCP performance by reducing link-layer losses. However, such improvements are often associated with cost and arbitrary improvement cannot be realized without paying a lot in return. It is therefore important to consider some kind of net utility function that should be optimized, thus maximizing throughput at the least possible cost. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA strong {{effect of}} {{divertor}} configuration {{on the threshold}} power for the L-H transition (PLH) was observed in recent JET experiments in the new ITER-like Wall (ILW) [1 – 3]. Following a series of EDGE 2 D-EIRENE code simulations with Be impurity and drifts a possible mechanism for the PLH variation with the divertor geometry is proposed. Both experiment and code simulations show that in the configuration with lower neutral recycling near the outer strike point (OSP), electron temperature (Te) peaks near the OSP prior to the L-H transition, while in the configuration with higher OSP recycling Te peaks further out in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and the plasma stays in the L-mode at the same input <b>power.</b> <b>Code</b> results show large positive radial electric field (Er) in the near SOL under lower recycling conditions leading to a large E×B shear across the separatrix which may trigger earlier (at lower input power) edge turbulence suppression and lower PLH. Suppressed Te‘s at OSP in configurations with strike points on vertical targets (VT) were observed earlier and explained by a geometrical effect of neutral recycling near this particular position, whereas in configurations with strike points on horizontal targets (HT) the OSP {{appears to be more}} open for neutrals (see e. g. review paper [4]) ...|$|E

40|$|Complex thermo-fluid systems pose many {{difficult}} engineering {{problems in}} the area of automatic control system design. Typically, thermo-fluid systems exhibit nonlinear behavior, a high degree of process uncertainty, as well as transport lag and other time delay behaviors. The jet aircraft engine {{is a good example of}} one such system where the linearized dynamical behavior varies widely over the ranges of <b>power</b> <b>code,</b> altitude and flight Mach number. The customer demands high system performance levels, efficiencies, and safety margins with the aid of automatic control despite the high level of system complexity and uncertainty. The development of suitably powerful controller design techniques for this type of problem is therefore of considerable importance. ^ There exist many distinct controller design techniques capable of producing control laws that are robust in the sense that they are immune to variations in the linearized models used to characterize non-linear system dynamical behavior. Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is one such technique that seeks to break down multiple-input multiple-output system control problems into a series of single-input single-output (SISO) problems. QFT relies on a graphical synthesis approach to controller design, converting the performance and stability objectives into gain-phase bounds on the magnitudes of the individual SISO loop transmission functions. It is in this spirit that this work is undertaken, replacing much of this heuristic development in favor of a more thorough, mathematically rigorous approach, while retaining the powerful graphical design method. ^ This thesis contains a motivation for the use of robust control within the frame-work of turbo-mechanical systems, a review of the historical development of multivariable aircraft engine control, a concise mathematical description of the control problem, and a mathematically rigorous mechanism for carrying out the design of robust control laws. An application of the theory is then brought to bear on a particular multivariable engine control problem; that of the General Electric GE 16 after-burning, gas turbofan aircraft engine. ...|$|E
