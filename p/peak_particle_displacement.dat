40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} decades, effects of blast loads on natural and {{man-made}} structures have gained considerable attention due {{to increase in}} threat from various man-made activities. Site-specific empirical relationships for calculation of blast-induced vibration parameters like peak particle velocity (PPV) and <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> (PPD) are commonly used for estimation of blast loads in design. However, these relationships {{are not able to}} consider the variation in rock parameters and uncertainty of in situ conditions. In this paper, a total of 1089 published blast data of various researchers in different rock sites have been collected and used to propose generalized empirical model for PPV by considering the effects of rock parameters like unit weight, rock quality designation (RQD), geological strength index (GSI), and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). The proposed PPV model has a good correlation coefficient and hence it can be directly used in prediction of blast-induced vibrations in rocks. Standard errors and coefficient of correlations of the predicted blast-induced vibration parameters are obtained with respect to the observed field data. The proposed empirical model for PPV has also been compared with the empirical models available for blast vibrations predictions given by other researchers and found to be in good agreement with specific cases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{the topic of}} blast loads on {{structures}} has received considerable attention from researchers. Site-specific empirical models for blast-induced vibration parameters like peak particle velocity (PPV), peak pressure (PP), <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> (PPD), and pore pressure ratio (PPR) are commonly used for blast-resistant designs. However, these empirical models do not consider the variation in soil properties, e. g., the degree of saturation and uncertain in situ conditions. Hence, in this paper, a total of 120 pieces of blast data from various soil sites have been collected and used to propose a generalized empirical model for estimating blast-induced vibration parameters by considering three basic soil properties, namely, unit weight, degree of saturation, and Young's modulus. Standard errors and coefficients of correlation for the prediction of blast-induced vibration parameters by various empirical models are obtained {{with respect to the}} observed soil field data. The present empirical model has been compared with the models of other researchers and found to be in good agreement for specific cases. The present model, having maximum coefficient of correlation and minimum standard error, can be directly used in the calculation of blast loading for design. The present model has also been validated for various degrees of saturation. It has been found that the present model predicts fairly for fully saturated soils irrespective of soil type, and predicts higher values (critical values for design) for partially saturated soils. In the absence of field blast vibration data because of economic, safety, and environmental constraints, the present model will evaluate the blast vibration parameters by using only three basic soil properties.

40|$|Predictions {{of ground}} motions and {{containment}} {{were made for}} the Longshot event. Limits on the areas expected to be within the radius of potential damage (acceleration 0. 1 g) and perceptible motion (acceleration 0. 001 g) were given. Also, prediction graphs were presented for obtaining <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration, <b>displacement</b> and velocity for points of interest on hardrock and unconsolidated material. A preliminary feasibility study was performed to determine the acceptability of the proposed Longshot site {{from the standpoint of}} containment and seismic safety. The results of the investigation showed the proposed Longshot event could be successfully executed at the selected location. Subsequently, an exploratory drilling program was performed and a stemming plan was developed. Based upon the findings of the exploratory program and the evaluation of the stemming plan, Beers, Inc. concluded that the event would be contained at the proposed location. Upon detonation, containment was achieved as predicted. No reports of damage or ill-effects due to excessive motions were made. A limited comparison with published ground motion data indicates satisfactory predictions. (auth...|$|R

The DPIV system utilized two 600 -mj Nd:YAG lasers to generate a double-pulsed light sheet synchronized with the sound field and used to illuminate a portion of the oscillatory flow inside the tube. A high resolution (1320 x 1035 pixel), 8 -bit camera was used to capture double-exposed images of 2. 7 -micron hollow silicon dioxide tracer particles inside the tube. Classical spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques were used to ascertain the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and associated velocities for various sound field intensities and frequencies.

Protecting measures are very limitied, {{therefore it is}} necessary to set out the calculations and measurrements before the construction work. Parameter for assesing the impact of vibration on the building, which is widely recognized and compared to the criteria given in standard, is <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> velocity. Based on the <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> velocity we can determine the minimum distance between the source and existing building, in order to avoid construction damage. Slovenia has no standard for setting limit values for <b>peak</b> <b>particle</b> velocity.

As we were interested in the influence of soil characteristics on the results, the stifness of the ground was varied in the first case and the results compared to empirical equation. In the second case, the results using two different soil material models were compared. A linear-elastic and HS-Small model were used to model the soil.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to study fluidization of a vertically vibrated, three-dimensional shallow granular layer. As the container acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean square <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> increase, gradually fluidizing the layer.

Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations. Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts the change to lower accelerations.

40|$|Finite Larmor radius (FLR) {{effects on}} non-diffusive {{transport}} in a prototypical zonal flow with drift waves are {{studied in the}} context of a simplified chaotic transport model. The model consists of a superposition of drift waves of the linearized Hasegawa-Mima equation and a zonal shear flow perpendicular to the density gradient. High frequency FLR effects are incorporated by gyroaveraging the ExB velocity. Transport in the direction of the density gradient is negligible and we therefore focus on transport parallel to the zonal flows. A prescribed asymmetry produces strongly asymmetric non- Gaussian PDFs of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements,</b> with Lévy flights in one direction but not the other. For zero Larmor radius, a transition is observed in the scaling of the second moment of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements.</b> However, FLR effects seem to eliminate this transition. The PDFs of trapping and flight events show clear evidence of algebraic scaling with decay exponents depending on the value of the Larmor radii. The shape and spatio-temporal self-similar anomalous scaling of the PDFs of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> are reproduced accurately with a neutral, asymmetric effective fractional diffusion model.

40|$|Many {{arthropods}} possess filiform hair sensilla (termed trichobothria in arachnids), {{which are}} extremely sensitive detectors of medium <b>particle</b> <b>displacement.</b> Electrophysiological evidence in some taxa {{suggests that these}} sensilla can detect air <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> resulting from intraspecific communication signals. However, {{it has not yet}} been shown for any species that the air <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> detected by the filiform hairs are themselves perceived as a ?signal? (i. e. that individuals make behavioural decisions based upon the responses of these organs to the displays of conspecifics). We investigate the agonistic behaviour of the whip spider Phrynus marginemaculatus and the role of its trichobothria in receiving agonistic signals. Whip spiders have extremely elongated ?antenniform? first legs, which they vibrate close to their opponents during agonistic interactions, inducing air movements that excite their opponents' trichobothria. We find that ablation of the trichobothria causes significant increases in: (I) contest duration, and (II) the probability of contest escalation past aggressive displays to physical fighting. Therefore, in the absence of air movement-sensitive sensilla, contest assessment is impaired. This suggests that whip spiders exploit true air movement signals during agonistic interactions, and that these are received by the trichobothria. Furthermore, these results indicate that, in whip spiders, such signals help mitigate the cost of agonistic interaction. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

The components, including the on-chip lens set, the microfluidic channel, and the fiber grooves, are defined {{in a single}} layer of SU- 8 by one-step photolithography. The design of the on-chip lens set and the fabrication of the {{microfluidic chip}} are fully described. The influence of the beam-waist radius on the manipulation performance is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified for the first time. In the cross-type optofluidic architecture, the evaluation is performed by measuring the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> with different beam-waist radii under different fluid-flow rates. The on-chip lens set is designed to have a specific dimension to achieve the required beam-waist radius. It is revealed that the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> is counter-proportional to the beam-waist radius. An experiment is performed. The results show that the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> is increased by reducing the beam-waist radius.
