5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched {{an assault on}} the grounds.

5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a <b>private</b> <b>boat</b> and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{hurricane}} {{also had a}} significant impact on land. Earlier in the year, Union forces had captured the fort guarding Hatteras Inlet at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. In the early morning hours of November 2, high seas began to overwash Hatteras Island, [...] "completely covering all dry land except the position of the fort itself". After four hours, water began to subside. Extremely high tides associated with the cyclone continued up the coast as far north as Portland, Maine. Storm tides at various points, including New York City, Newport, Rhode Island, and Boston, reached levels unseen for at least 10 years and up to 46 years. In New York, the storm persisted for 20 hours starting early on November 2; rising waters inundated wharves along the East and Hudson Rivers. Floodwaters flowed up to five blocks inland, and a popular bar located in a hotel became isolated by the flooding. In response, a man transported customers to and from the bar on his <b>private</b> <b>boat</b> at a cost of two cents per ride. Strong winds in Brooklyn brought down trees and telegraph wires.|$|E
