SandersonMy {{public health}} field {{experience}} was completed at the Riley County Health Department located at 2030 Tecumseh Road, Manhattan, Kansas 66502. The Riley County Health Department was {{started as a}} city-county health department in 1952 and became a county health department in 2011. 1 Riley County Health Department’s vision is “healthy people in a healthy community” and they currently serve over 75, 000 residents. 1 The health department seeks to improve public health by promoting the ten essential health services, which include: 1. 	Monitor {{the health of the}} community 2. 	Diagnose and investigate health problems 3. 	Inform, educate, and empower people 4. 	Mobilize community partnerships 5. 	Develop policies that protect and promote the health of the community 6. 	Enforce laws and regulations 7. 	Link to/provide health services 8. 	Assure a competent work force 9. 	Evaluate quality of services and programs 10. 	Research for new insights into improve health 1 I completed 240 hours of field experience under Jessica Fiscus, MPH, who serves as the Health Educator at the health department. Jessica directs planning and implementation for community health education and outreach onsite and in community settings. She also serves on multiple committees and coalitions in Manhattan including the Flint Hills Wellness Coalition and the Riley County <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Committee.</b> Since the field of public health is so versatile, this field experience provided me with a great opportunity to broaden my experience and skillset and introduce me to public health policy making...|$|E
40|$|Background: There were 61074 {{deliveries}} in Akershus county, Norway (1993 - 2002). The perinatal audit investigated 221 antepartum, 19 intrapartum and 113 neonatal deaths. Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out whether the perinatal mortality rate is comparable to the rest of the country. We categorized the cause of death and studied the ability to detect pregnancies with higher risk for perinatal death with focus on IUGR in Akershus. Methods: Retrospective study of the stillbirth cases investigated by the perinatal audit. The information was gathered by the <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Committee</b> of Akershus, and supplemented by antenatal health cards and maternal health records. Results: The perinatal death rate in Akershus was 5. 8 / 1000. The stillbirth rate (gestational age 28 and more) was 3. 4 / 1000 and neonatal mortality rate was 2. 4 / 1000. Unexplained stillbirth was diagnosed in 22 % of antepartum deaths, placental insufficiency 19 %, abruption of the placenta 15 %, infections 10 %, not known 9 %, umbilical cord pathology 7 % and malformations in 5 %. IUGR was recognized by antenatal care as a pregnancy complication in 17 % of the stillbirth. By using individually customized standards, 43 % of stillbirths were below the 2. 5 th birth weight centile for their gestational age. 56 % were below the 10 th centile. The specificity was good, when prospectively recognized IUGR 92 % had birth weight under the 2. 5 th centile. Conclusion: The stillbirth rate in Akeshus was equal to the national rate (3. 5 / 1000) in this period. 31 % of deaths had no explanation. 56 % were below the 10 th birth weight centile, but only 17 % were recognized by antenatal care. Akershus has a great potential in detection of causes of death and IUG...|$|E
40|$|Dear Chairman Casada: As {{required}} by Public Chapter 331, {{the findings of}} the Department of Health’s <b>Perinatal</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> regarding issues related to premature infants are hereby submitted. The Committee was directed by Public Chapter 331 to “study issues and policy options relating to hospital discharge and follow-up care procedures for premature infants born less than thirty-seven (37) weeks gestational age to ensure standardized and coordinated processes are followed as premature infants leave the hospital from either a Level 1 (well baby nursery), Level 2 (step down or transitional nursery), or Level 3 (neonatal intensive care unit) and transition to follow-up care by a healthcare provider in the community. ” Sincerely...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of medical}} care has been {{indirectly}} assessed through the collection of negative outcomes. A preventable death is one {{that could have been}} avoided if optimum care had been offered. The general objective of the present project was to analyze the perinatal mortality at the National Institute of Perinatology (located in Mexico City) by social, biological and some available components of quality of care such as avoidability, provider responsibility, and structure and process deficiencies in the delivery {{of medical care}}. A <b>Perinatal</b> Mortality <b>Committee</b> data base was utilized. The study population consisted of all singleton perinatal deaths occurring between January 1, 1988 and June 30, 1991 (n = 522). A proportionate study was designed. ^ The population studied mostly corresponded to married young adult mothers, who were residents of urban areas, with an educational level of junior high school or more, two to three pregnancies, and intermediate prenatal care. The mean gestational age at birth was 33. 4 ± 3. 9 completed weeks and the mean birthweight at birth was 1, 791. 9 ± 853. 1 grams. ^ Thirty-five percent of perinatal deaths were categorized as avoidable. Postnatal infection and premature rupture of membranes were the most frequent primary causes of avoidable perinatal death. The avoidable perinatal mortality rate was 8. 7 per 1000 and significantly declined during the study period (p 3 ̆c. 05). Preventable perinatal mortality aggregated data suggested that {{at least part of the}} mortality decline for amenable conditions was due to better medical care. ^ Structure deficiencies were present in 35...|$|R

A fetal inflammatory response was present in 10. 1 % and significantly correlated with spontaneous onset of labour. The absence of a fetal inflammatory response was strongly associated with unexplained antepartum death. Conclusions. The increased incidence of histological chorioamnionitis at extremes of gestation is confirmed in the largest dataset to date using population data.

40|$|Summary The {{loss of a}} {{baby who}} was either {{stillborn}} or died in the first weeks of life is a tragic event that affects around 3, 000 families every year in Australia. Perinatal mortality is widely recognised as an important indicator of population health. While Australia {{is one of the}} safest places in the world to give birth, almost 1 in 100 pregnancies will end in a perinatal death. Perinatal deaths in Australia 1993 – 2012 represents the first comprehensive national report on perinatal mortality in Australia and includes a detailed analysis of data relating to stillbirths and neonatal deaths for the period 2011 - 2012 and an analysis of trends for 1993 – 2012. The aim of this report is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the causes of perinatal deaths at a population level and identify changes in perinatal mortality over time. Data used for this report come from information recorded in jurisdictional perinatal data collections and information collated by state and territory <b>perinatal</b> mortality review <b>committees.</b> For the 2 years 2011 and 2012, just over 6, 000 babies died during the perinatal period: a rate of 9. 9 deaths per 1, 000 births. Approximately three-quarters of those deaths were stillbirths (4, 485) with the remaining 1, 580 deaths being neonatal deaths. The rate of perinatal mortality varied by the state or territory in which babies were born, with the highest perinatal mortality rate recorded in Victoria (12. 2 deaths per 1, 000 births) and the lowest in New South Wales (8. 3 deaths per 1, 000 births). The rates also varied considerably between different subgroups including those based on mothers 2 ̆ 7 level of remoteness, socioeconomic status, age, smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and Indigenous status. The perinatal mortality rate of babies born to mothers who identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander was almost double that of babies of non-Indigenous mothers (17. 1 versus 9. 6 deaths per 1, 000 births). Similarly, the perinatal mortality rate was almost 50...|$|R
