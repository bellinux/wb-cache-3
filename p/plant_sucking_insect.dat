However, effects of cover crops in local farming systems are varied and can be affected by timing and method of cover crop termination. We conducted two field studies each in Upper Marlboro and Beltsville, Maryland between 2013 and 2014. The study consisted of three cover crop and one Fallow(F) treatments. Cover crop treatments were Early-Kill (EK) and Late-Kill in which the cover crop was killed with a post-emergent herbicide in late April and May, respectively; and flail mow (FM), in which a flail mower was used to terminate the cover crop in late May. In 2013 and 2014, <b>plant</b> <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> were consistently more numerous in EK than LK treatment. Our findings suggest chemical and mechanical termination on cover crops produce similar results on arthropod populations...|$|R
40|$|Honey can {{be defined}} as the natural sweet {{substance}} produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera) from the nectar of blossoms or from the secretion of living parts of <b>plant</b> or <b>plant</b> <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> living on parts of plants. The medicinal property of honey has been an area of interest to researchers in recent times. This study focused on assessing the physicochemical components of honey samples and their bioactivity on some food spoilage organisms. One hundred samples of honey were collected from different locations in Ondo state, Nigeria. Their physicochemical components which include conductivity, ash content, moisture content, pH, mineral contents and colour were determined. There was variation in the physicochemical components of some of the honey samples with reference to international standards. The assessment of the honey samples as an antibacterial agent revealed it inhibitory potency on both bacteria and fungi isolated from food sample. The inhibitory effect was compared with that of standard antibiotic. The honey samples were seen to display a higher inhibitory effect on the tested organisms than the employed antibiotic.

40|$|Honey is {{a natural}} {{substance}} produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) from the nectar of blossoms or from secretions of living parts of plants or excretions of <b>plant</b> <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> on the living parts of plants, which honeybees collect, transform and combine with specific substances of their own, store and leave in the honey comb to ripen and mature. Besides being of carbohydrate-rich food, honey {{has been used as}} a functional food for its potential health benefits. To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the researchers developed the concept of the “glycemic index” (GI) that ranks carbohydrates on a scale based on how quickly and how much they raise blood sugar levels after eating. The diet should include adequate and healthy balance of nutrients, and according to many health professionals the concept of GI provides a useful means of selecting the most appropriate carbohydrate containing foods for the maintenance of health and the treatment of several disease states. There have been some studies on determining the GI of honey. Further more, we need to determine the GI of various honey types with different botanical and geografical origin. Researches on the issue will serve to bring awareness in the public consciousness...|$|R

The phenolic compounds are involved in resistance mechanisms of the antibiosis type, but few studies are devoted to the studying role of these compounds in the {{interaction of}} <b>plants</b> with <b>sucking</b> <b>insects.</b> The study was conducted to determine how the sugar cane responded to the infestation of Mahanarva fimbriolata in terms of accumulation of phenolic compounds. An experiment was carried out under controlled conditions in a randomized design in a factorial schedule 3 x 2 x 4, with 3 genotypes and sugar cane, 2 levels of nymphs infestation of M. fimbriolata and sampling 4 times, with 4 repetitions. The genotypes SP 80 - 1816 and RB 72454 showed higher levels of total phenols when subjected to an infestation of the pest, but the duration of the nymphal stage and mortality of sharpshooters were significantly lower in those varieties, indicating that the increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds may had been caused by death and decay of the roots. It was not observed variation in levels of total phenols in the variety SP 83 - 5073 subject to an infestation of M. fimbriolata. However, the mortality of the leafhopperof- roots and duration of the stage of nymphs were significantly higher in genotype, indicating the existence of resistance-type antibiosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} insect pests of rice. The molecular responses of <b>plants</b> to <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> resemble responses to pathogen infection. However, the molecular mechanism of BPH-resistance in rice remains unclear. Transcription factors (TF) are up-stream regulators of various genes that bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the transcription from DNA to mRNA. They are key regulators for transcriptional expression in biological processes, and are probably involved in the BPH-induced pathways in resistant rice varieties. Results We conducted a microarray experiment to analyze TF genes related to BPH resistance in a Sri Lankan rice cultivar, Rathu Heenati (RHT). We compared the expression profiles of TF genes in RHT with those of the susceptible rice cultivar Taichun Native 1 (TN 1). We detected 2038 TF genes showing differential expression signals between the two rice varieties. Of these, 442 TF genes were probably related to BPH-induced resistance in RHT and TN 1, and 229 may be related to constitutive resistance only in RHT. These genes showed a fold change (FC) of more than 2. 0 (P 10, there were 37 induced TF genes and 26 constitutive resistance TF genes. Of these, 13 were probably involved in BPH-induced resistance, and 8 in constitutive resistance to BPH in RHT. Conclusions We explored the molecular mechanism of resistance to BPH in rice by comparing expressions of TF genes between RHT and TN 1. We speculate that the level of gene repression, especially for early TF genes, plays an important role in the defense response. The fundamental point of the resistance strategy is that plants protect themselves by reducing their metabolic level to inhibit feeding by BPH and prevent damage from water and nutrient loss. We have selected 21 TF genes related to BPH resistance for further analyses to understand the molecular responses to BPH feeding in rice. </p...|$|R

Forty-four species of insects (23 families) and nine species of ants (6 genera and 3 subfamilies) {{were found on the}} inflorescences of B. crassifolia. The exclusion of ants, primarily Camponotus sericeiventris and Camponotus spp., reduced the treehopper population to 20 % of the original abundance. Ant exclusion and time influenced the abundance of chewing (Exclusion, P< 0. 001; Time, P< 0. 002), and <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> (Exclusion, P< 0. 02; Time, P< 0. 01).

40|$|Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) {{catalyze}} the cleavage of {{fatty acid}} hydroperoxides to aldehydes and oxoacids. These volatile aldehydes {{play a major}} role in forming the aroma of many plant fruits and flowers. In addition, they have antimicrobial activity in vitro and thus are thought to be involved in the plant defense response against pest and pathogen attack. An HPL activity present in potato leaves has been characterized and shown to cleave specifically 13 -hydroperoxides of both linoleic and linolenic acids to yield hexanal and 3 -hexenal, respectively, and 12 -oxo-dodecenoic acid. A cDNA encoding this HPL has been isolated and used to monitor gene expression in healthy and mechanically damaged potato plants. HPL gene expression is subject to developmental control, being high in young leaves and attenuated in older ones, and it is induced weakly by wounding. HPL enzymatic activity, nevertheless, remains constant in leaves of different ages and also after wounding, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may regulate its activity levels. Antisense-mediated HPL depletion in transgenic potato plants has identified this enzyme as a major route of 13 -fatty acid hydroperoxide degradation in the leaves. Although these transgenic plants have highly reduced levels of both hexanal and 3 -hexenal, they show no phenotypic differences compared with wild-type ones, particularly in regard to the expression of wound-induced genes. However, aphids feeding on the HPL-depleted plants display approximately a two-fold increase in fecundity above those feeding on nontransformed plants, consistent with the hypothesis that HPL-derived products have a negative impact on aphid performance. Thus, HPL-catalyzed production of C 6 aldehydes may be a key step of a built-in resistance mechanism of <b>plants</b> against some <b>sucking</b> <b>insect</b> pests...|$|R

Three related issues were addressed: (i) the role of estimated regional species richness and variables operating at the local scale (vegetation structure and diversity) in determining local species richness; (ii) quantification of the relative contributions of α and β diversity to regional diversity using additive partitioning; and (iii) the occurrence of consistent patterns in different years by analysing independently between-year data.
