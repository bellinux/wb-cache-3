5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a <b>public</b> <b>clock</b> stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
500|$|Lazar ( [...] , [...] ), {{also known}} as Lazar the Serb or Lazar the Hilandarian (fl. 1404), was a Serbian Orthodox monk and horologist who invented and built the first known {{mechanical}} <b>public</b> <b>clock</b> in Russia in 1404. The clock, which also struck the hours, was built {{at the request of}} Grand Prince Vasily I of Moscow (r. 1389–1425). Prior to his arrival in Moscow, Lazar had served as a monk in the Serbian Hilandar monastery at Mount Athos. The clock tower was located in the palace behind the Cathedral of the Annunciation. However, the clock and the church in which it was located have not survived.|$|E
500|$|A Serb, Lazar {{was born}} in the town of Prizren, in the Serbian Empire. He was a monk with the rank of crnorizac ( [...] , , černec) serving at the Serbian Orthodox Hilandar monastery, a centre of Serbian {{religious}} and secular culture and [...] "the first Serbian university", located on Mount Athos. Lazar likely left Mount Athos {{as a result of the}} Ottoman conquests in the Balkans. [...] speak of Lazar, newly arrived from Serbia, inventing and building a clock on a tower in the Grand Prince's palace in Moscow behind the Cathedral of the Annunciation at the request of Vasily I, the Grand Prince of Moscow (r. 1389–1425). It was the first ever spring-driven (mechanical) clock, or striking clock, in Russia, and also the country's first <b>public</b> <b>clock.</b> The clock numbers were written in Church Slavonic. It was among the first ten such advanced clocks in Europe, and was regarded a technical miracle at the time. Clocks in urban towers, or municipal hour signals, did exist earlier in Italy, though it is not known how they indicated the hours. In 1344, Paduan chronicles confirmed an entirely new technology – a clock in a tower at the Paduan palace which automatically struck the hours (24h).|$|E

2500|$|The Rathaus or {{city hall}} of Würzburg differs {{from those of}} most Imperial Cities {{in that it was}} not a sumptuous edifice {{purpose-built}} in Renaissance style. Rather, the motley collection of buildings and wings reflects the fact that after 1400 the city was permanently under the control of the bishop who did not allow a representative new building. The Rathaus consists of parts dating from 1339 (chapel), 1453 (tower with the town's first <b>public</b> <b>clock),</b> 1544 (southwest oriel), 1659/60 (Roter Bau). In 1822 the three-winged structure of the neighbouring Karmeliterkloster (monastery of the Carmelites) was added to the city hall. The [...] "Renaissance" [...] row on Karmeliterstrasse was built only in 1898.|$|E
2500|$|The large clock {{projecting}} {{from the tower}} was a well-known landmark in the city as it hung over the roadway of Old London Bridge. It {{was presented to the}} church in 1709 by Sir Charles Duncombe (Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within and, in 1708/09, Lord Mayor of London). Tradition says [...] "that it was erected in consequence of a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became successful in the world, he would give to that Church a <b>public</b> <b>clock</b> ... that all passengers might see the time of day." [...] The maker was Langley Bradley, a clockmaker in Fenchurch Street, who had worked for Wren on many other projects, including the clock for the new St Paul's Cathedral. The sword rest in the church, designed to hold the Lord Mayor's sword and mace when he attended divine service [...] "in state", dates from 1708.|$|E
2500|$|On the façade is a chiming clock, {{with figures}} of giants, perhaps {{representing}} Gog and Magog, who strike the bells with their clubs. [...] It was {{installed on the}} previous church in 1671, perhaps commissioned to celebrate its escape from destruction by the Great Fire of 1666. [...] It was the first <b>public</b> <b>clock</b> in London to have a minute hand. The figures of the two giants strike the hours and quarters, and turn their heads. [...] There are numerous literary references to the clock, including in Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays, Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, both David Copperfield and Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens, The Warden by Anthony Trollope, David Lyddal's The Prompter (1810) and a poem by William Cowper. [...] In 1828, when the medieval church was demolished, the clock was removed by art collector Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford to his mansion in Regent's Park; during World War I, a new charity for blinded soldiers was lent the house, and took the name St Dunstan's from the clock. It was returned by Lord Rothermere in 1935 to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V.|$|E

6000|$|Of {{course the}} town had shrunk fearfully, since I was a child there. I had entertained the {{impression}} that the High-street was at least as wide as Regent-street, London, or the Italian Boulevard at Paris. I found it little better than a lane. There was a <b>public</b> <b>clock</b> in it, which I had supposed to be the finest clock in the world: whereas it now turned out to be as inexpressive, moon- faced, and weak a clock as ever I saw. It belonged to a Town Hall, where I had seen an Indian (who I now suppose wasn't an Indian) swallow a sword (which I now suppose he didn't). The edifice had appeared to me in those days so glorious a structure, that I had set it up in my mind as the model on which the Genie of the Lamp built the palace for Aladdin. A mean little brick heap, like a demented chapel, with a few yawning persons in leather gaiters, and in the last extremity for something to do, lounging at the door with their hands in their pockets, and calling themselves a Corn Exchange! ...|$|E
60|$|The sound he at last most wittingly {{distinguished}} in his nook was {{the single}} deep note of half-past five borne to him from some high-perched <b>public</b> <b>clock.</b> He finally got up with {{the sense that the}} time from then on ought at least to be felt as sacred to him. At this juncture it was--while he stood there shaking his garments, settling his hat, his necktie, his shirt-cuffs, fixing the high polish of his fine shoes as if for some reflection in it of his straight and spare and grizzled, his refined and trimmed and dressed, his altogether distinguished person, that of a gentleman abundantly settled, but of a bachelor markedly nervous--at this crisis it was, doubtless, that he at once most measured and least resented his predicament. If he should go he would almost to a certainty find her, and if he should find her he would almost to a certainty come to the point. He wouldn't put it off again--there was that high consideration for him of justice at least to himself. He had never yet denied himself anything so apparently fraught with possibilities as the idea of proposing to Mrs. Worthingham--never yet, in other words, denied himself anything he had so distinctly wanted to do; and the results of that wisdom had remained for him precisely the precious parts of experience. Counting only the offers of his honourable hand, these had been on three remembered occasions at least the consequence of an impulse as sharp and a self-respect as reasoned; a self-respect that hadn't in the least suffered, moreover, from the failure of each appeal. He had been met in the three cases--the only ones he at all compared with his present case--by the frank confession that he didn't somehow, charming as he was, cause himself to be superstitiously believed in; and the lapse of life, afterward, had cleared up many doubts.|$|E
