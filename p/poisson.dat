5|$|If a <b>Poisson</b> {{process is}} defined {{with a single}} {{positive}} constant, then the process is called a homogeneous <b>Poisson</b> process. The homogeneous <b>Poisson</b> process (in continuous time) {{is a member of}} important classes of stochastic processes such as Markov processes and Lévy processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} <b>Poisson</b> {{process can}} be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary <b>Poisson</b> process. If the parameter constant of the <b>Poisson</b> process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous <b>Poisson</b> process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the <b>Poisson</b> process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} processes by applying some suitable transformations, which {{is the case for}} the homogeneous <b>Poisson</b> process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated <b>Poisson</b> process. Martingales {{can also be}} built from other martingales. For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.|$|E

40|$|Fiber {{networks}} with out-of-plane auxetic behavior {{have been}} sporadically investigated. One {{of the major}} challenges is to design such materials with giant negative <b>Poissons</b> ratio over large deformations. Here in, we report a systematic investigation to create three-dimensional (3 D) fiber networks {{in the form of}} needle punched nonwoven materials with out-of-plane auxetic behavior over large deformations via theoretical modeling and extensive set of experiments. The experimental matrix has encapsulated the key parameters of the needlepunching nonwoven process. Under uniaxial tensile loading, the anisotropy coupled with local fiber densification in networks has yielded large negative <b>Poissons</b> ratio (up to − 5. 7) specifically in the preferential direction. The in-plane and out-of-plane <b>Poissons</b> ratios of fiber networks have been predicted and, subsequently, compared with the experimental results. Fiber orientation was found to be a core parameter that modulated the in-plane <b>Poissons</b> ratio of fiber networks. A parametric analysis has revealed the interplay between the anisotropy of the fiber network and the out-of-plane <b>Poissons</b> ratio based upon constant volume consideration...|$|R

25|$|The {{tractability}} of the <b>Poisson</b> {{process means}} that {{sometimes it is}} convenient to approximate a non-Poisson point process with a <b>Poisson</b> one. The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process {{and the location of}} each point by a <b>Poisson</b> point process. There a number of methods {{that can be used to}} justify, informally or rigorously, approximating the occurrence of random events or phenomena with suitable <b>Poisson</b> point processes.
