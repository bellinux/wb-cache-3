50|$|<b>Physiomics</b> is a {{systematic}} study of physiome in biology. <b>Physiomics</b> employs bioinformatics to construct networks of physiological {{features that are}} associated with genes, proteins and their networks. A few of the methods for determining individual relationships between the DNA sequence and physiological function include metabolic pathway engineering and RNAi analysis. The relationships derived from methods such as these are organized and processed computationally to form distinct networks. Computer models use these experimentally determined networks to develop further predictions of gene function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physiomics</b> {{arose from}} the {{imbalance}} {{between the amount of}} data being generated by genome projects and the technological ability to analyze the data on a large scale. As technologies such as high-throughput sequencing were being used to generate large amounts of genomic data, effective methods needed to be designed to experimentally interpret and computationally organize this data. Science can be illustrated as a cycle linking knowledge to observations. In the post-genomic era, the ability of computational methods to aid in this observation became evident. This cycle, aided by computer models, is the basis for bioinformatics and, thus, <b>physiomics.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} possible applications of <b>physiomics,</b> each requiring different computational models or the combined use of several different models. Examples of such applications include a three dimensional model for tumor growth, the modelling of biological pattern formation, a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} stretch marks in humans, and predictive algorithms for the growth of viral infections within insect hosts.|$|E
40|$|Steered by Professor David Fell of Oxford Brookes University, <b>Physiomics</b> plc, an Oxford-based {{biotechnology}} innovation company has, since 2008, {{firmly established}} {{itself as a}} leading light in systems biology approaches to drug discovery and latterly in therapy design, demonstrable through contracts with three major international pharmaceutical companies. Through its strong advocacy of this approach the sector has invested in and adopted new computational biology processes. As <b>Physiomics</b> has continued to grow, it has expanded its own specialist research team, in many cases recruiting scientists trained within Fellâ€™s Brookes-based research group...|$|E
40|$|The lung is {{a highly}} complex organ {{that can only be}} {{understood}} by integrating the many aspects of its structure and function into a comprehensive view. Such a view is provided by a systems biology approach, whereby the many layers of complexity, from the molecular genetic, to the cellular, to the tissue, to the whole organ, and finally to the whole body, are synthesized into a working model of understanding. The systems biology approach therefore relies on the expertise of many disciplines, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, <b>physiomics,</b> and, ultimately, clinical medicine. The overall structure and functioning of the lung cannot be predicted from studying any one of these systems in isolation, and so this approach highlights the importance of emergence as the fundamental feature of systems biology. In this paper, we will provide an overview of a systems biology approach to lung disease by briefly reviewing the advances made at many of these levels, with special emphasis on recent work done in the realm of pulmonary physiology and the analysis of clinical phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Blood flow {{regulation}} {{by small}} arteries and arterioles includes adaptation of both vascular tone and structure. It is becoming clear that tone and remodeling of resistance vessels are highly interrelated. Indeed, concepts pointing to continuous resistance artery adaptation and plasticity are emerging. The {{purpose of this}} review is to summarize such concepts and approaches related to vascular organization and remodeling, and {{to point out the}} missing links and possible directions for future research. We focus on the individual vessel level. Since several relevant studies are based on isolated vessels, we briefly re-iterate the available isobaric and isometric approaches. We further discuss the major elements of the small artery wall and their relation to the passive and active mechanical properties, as important determinants for vascular remodeling. The cytoskeletal elements and actin re-organization during remodeling are discussed, as well as the re-lengthening of smooth muscle cells during prolonged constriction. We then consider tone as major causal factors in remodeling and discuss the role of vessel wall inflammation. Finally, we illustrate examples of current quantitative, integrative approaches of small artery mechanosensing and adaptation that may lead to a <b>physiomics</b> description of small artery adaptation in health and in diseases such as hypertensio...|$|E
