30|$|In addition, we cultured neurospheres in serum-free {{medium and}} found that the size of S 89 G-DMP 1 neurospheres was no longer uniform as wild type ones. To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> there are changes in {{transcriptome}} as early as in NSCs, we performed transcriptome analyses.

According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, changes in gene expression could be categorized into 11 pathways (Table  4). Among these pathways, again, molecules in the cell adhesion (laminins, integrins, CSPGs) were down-regulated, while gene involved in cell cycles were up-regulated. These data suggested that changes in the expression of cell adhesion and cell proliferation genes occurred as early as in NSCs and maintained after NSC differentiation into astrocytes with deglycosylation of DMP 1.|$|R
30|$|To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> FC {{can affect}} {{exogenous}} H 2 O 2 -induced DCF fluorescence, the epidermal strips {{were treated with}} H 2 O 2 {{in the presence of}} FC for 3  h, and then H 2 O 2 levels were measured. As shown in Figure  3 B, a striking DCF fluorescence in guard cells was observed after treatment with 100  μM H 2 O 2. Compared with the control, there were no changes of DCF fluorescence in guard cells treated with FC alone (Figure  3 B). However, H 2 O 2 -induced DCF fluorescence in guard cells was largely prevented by FC (Figure  3 B). Similarly, CAT also substantially suppressed exogenous H 2 O 2 -induced DCF fluorescence (Figure  3 B). DPI had no obvious effect on fluorescence (Figure  3 B). These results show that like CAT, FC really induces H 2 O 2 removal, and consequently reduces H 2 O 2 level in guard cells treated with exogenous H 2 O 2.|$|R

The morphology of the films indicates the presence of small polycrystallites with a size of similar to 20 nm when the pH of their acid colloids was adjusted to a pH domain of 5. 9 - 2. 0. However, the pH of the precursor colloids can further decrease to a pH domain below 1. 0 by using the strong mineral acid HCl or the HCOOH agent in high concentration, and numbers of large crystallites with a size of about 500 - 1000 nm appear on top of a ZnO fine crystallite layer; the surface root-mean-square of the coatings is over 71. 3 nm...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) phagocytosis-enhancing activity (PEA) by human purified urinary Tamm-Horsfall glyco- protein (THP) {{has not been}} elucidated. In this study, we found human THP bound to lactoferrin (LF) and cathepsin G (CG) expressed {{on the surface of}} PMN, identified by a proteomic study with MALDI-TOF- LC/LC/mass spectrometric analysis. Pre-incubation of 10 % SDS-PAGE electrophoresed PMN lysates with monoclonal anti-LF or anti-CG antibody reduced the binding with THP. To elucidate the signaling pathway of THP on PMN activation, we found THP enhanced ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, reduced p 38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, but had no effect on DNA binding of the five NF-kB family members in PMN. To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> the carbohydrate-side chains or protein-core structure in THP molecule is responsible for THP-PEA, THP was cleaved by different degrading enzymes with carbohydrate specificity (neuraminidase and β-galactosidase), protein specificity (V 8 protease and proteinase K) or glycoconjugate specificity (carboxylpeptidase Y and O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase). We clearly demonstrated that the intact protein-core structure in THP molecule was more important for THP-PEA than carbohydrate-side chains. Putting these results together, we conclude that THP adheres to surface-expressed LF and CG on PMN and transduces signaling via the MAP kinase pathway to enhance PMN phagocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: High order {{cognitive}} {{processing and}} learning, such as reading, interact with lower-level sensory processing and learning. Previous {{studies have reported}} that visual perceptual training enlarges visual span and, consequently, improves reading speed in young and old people with amblyopia. Recently, a visual perceptual training study in Chinese-speaking children with dyslexia found that the visual texture discrimination thresholds of these children in visual perceptual training significantly correlated with their performance in Chinese character recognition, suggesting that deficits in visual perceptual processing/learning might partly underpin the difficulty in reading Chinese. Methodology/Principal Findings: To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> visual perceptual training improves the measures of reading performance, eighteen children with dyslexia and eighteen typically developed readers that were age- and IQ-matched completed a series of reading measures before and after visual texture discrimination task (TDT) training.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that healthy aging affects the configuration of large-scale functional brain networks. This includes reducing network modularity and local efficiency. However, the stability of these effects over time and their potential role in learning remain poorly understood. The goal {{of the present study}} was to <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> previously reported age effects on “resting-state” networks, to test their reliability over time, and to assess their relation to subsequent learning during training. Resting-state fMRI data from 23 young (YA) and 20 older adults (OA) were acquired in 2 sessions 2 weeks apart. Graph-theoretic analyses identified both consistencies in network structure and differences in module composition between YA and OA, suggesting topological changes and less stability of functional network configuration with aging. Brain-wide, OA showed lower modularity and local efficiency compared to YA, consistent with the idea of age-related functional dedifferentiation, and these effects were replicable over time. At the level of individual networks, OA consistently showed greater participation and lower local efficiency and within-network connectivity in the cingulo-opercular network, as well as lower intra-network connectivity in the default-mode network and greater participation of the somato-sensorimotor network, suggesting age-related differential effects at the level of specialized brain modules. Finally, brain-wide network properties showed associations, albeit limited, with learning rates, as assessed with 10 days of computerized working memory training administered after the resting-state sessions, suggesting that baseline network configuration may influence subsequent learning outcomes.

40|$|Objective: Previous {{literature}} has identified {{the importance of}} interpersonal processes for patient outcomes in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), particularly {{in the context of}} significant other relationships. The current study investigated expressed emotion (EE), examining the independent effects of critical comments and emotional overinvolvement (EOI) in association with patient outcomes. Method: Fifty-five patients with CFS/ME and their significant others were recruited from specialist CFS/ME services. Significant other EE status was coded from a modified Camberwell Family Interview. Patient outcomes (fatigue severity, disability, and depression) were derived from questionnaire measures. Forty-four patients (80 %) completed follow-up questionnaires 6 -months after recruitment. Results: Significant other high-EE categorized by both high levels of critical comments and high EOI was predictive of worse fatigue severity at follow-up. High-critical EE was associated with higher levels of patient depressive symptoms longitudinally; depressive symptoms were observed to mediate the relationship between high critical comments and fatigue severity reported at follow-up. There were higher rates of high-EE in parents than in partners, and this was because of higher rates of EOI in parents. Conclusions: Patients with high-EE significant others demonstrated poorer outcomes at follow-up compared with patients in low-EE dyads. One mechanism for this appears to be as a result of increased patient depression. Future research should seek to <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> the role of interpersonal processes in CFS/ME differs across different patient-significant other relationships.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon (Linnaeus 1758), is a gonochorist, a facultative or an obligate hermaphrodite. Juvenile shrimps were sampled from intertidal habitats along the German Wadden Sea coast with a push net {{and from a}} power plant water inlet to quantify the share of primary females. Length-based sex ratios were determined for about 27, 000 individuals using external characteristics. Observed sex ratios were mainly female-biased, and also large males occurred regularly in the catch. This indicates that sex at hatch is not male as would be characteristic for an obligate protandric hermaphrodite and that not all male shrimps change sex. A cohort-based computer simulation, including sex-specific growth rates, mortality and seasonally varying recruitment, generated sex ratios comparable to the field. The observed decline {{in the proportion of}} males with increasing size can be explained solely by faster growth of females without involving hermaphroditism. Based on temperature-dependent growth and moult rates as well as length-specific numbers of eggs per female, the potential egg production of primary and secondary females was modelled, yielding contributions of secondary females of < 1 %. Sex change in C. crangon has previously been observed and may be interpreted as an evolutionary relict of this species having evolved in a habitat characterized by lower population densities, lower predation levels and increased longevity compared to today's living conditions in North Sea coastal waters...|$|R

To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> the increased pressor response to vasoconstrictors {{may be due to the}} calcemic or direct action of active vitamin D 3, we studied the effect of its noncalcemic analogue, 22 -oxacalcitriol, and its inactive analogue, 24, 25 -dihydroxy vitamin D}, on the pressor response to vasoconstrictors in rats. The pressor responses to norepinephrine and Ang II were apparently augmented in 22 -oxacalcitriol-treated rats similarly to 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -treated rats. In contrast, the pressor responses were not affected by either 24, 25 -dihydroxy vitamin D 3 or the intravenous infusion of calcium chloride. In an ex vivo experiment using a mesenteric preparation, the vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine was moderately augmented in rats treated with both 22 -oxacalcitriol and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 but was not affected in rats treated with 24, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3.

The development of DES {{is one of the major}} revolutions in the field of ‘interventional cardiology’. Restenosis rate has been significantly reduced in comparison to bare metal stents. The ideal drug to prevent restenosis must have an anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effect on smooth muscle cells but on the other hand must also enhance re-endothelialization in order to prevent late thrombosis. Additionally, it should effectively inhibit the anti-inflammatory response after balloon induced arterial injury.

Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types of shift work influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment of shift work is warranted. Methods: Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between shift work (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on work history (including shift work), height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data. Results: We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in rotating shift work for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 34; 95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1. 05 – 1. 73) and obese (OR = 1. 57; 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 2. 21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of rotating shift work. Conclusion: Both the positive association between rotating shift work and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night shift work {{in this study are}} consistent with previous findings.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In a longitudinal research design, insulin sensitivity (Si) of 96 research participants was determined at baseline and 1 year later. Body adiposity was assessed at four assessments. RESULTS — The change in Si during the first year of the study was a significant predictor of further fat mass development (P 0. 05). Considering different directions of Si change, Si was a strong predictor for further fat mass development only in the group that decreased their Si (P 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS — The results show that the direction of change in insulin sensitivity at an early age is an important independent predictor for further fat mass development and emphasize the importance of insulin sensitivity as a primary target for long-term obesity prevention, as well as the significance of early age intervention.

In analysis 2, changes in leisure-time sport activities (engagement, frequency and manner) from preretirement to postretirement were analysed with simultaneous changes in body weight (kilogram). In analysis 1 (n= 2711), prevalence estimates for 4 years before and 4 years after retirement showed that higher leisure-time physical activity (walking at least 5 km/week) increased by 36 % in men and 61 % in women during the transition to retirement. This increase was also observed among people at a higher risk of physical inactivity, such as smokers and those with elevated depressive symptoms. In a separate sample (analysis 2, n= 3812), change in weight as a function of preretirement and postretirement physical activity was analysed. Weight gain preretirement to postretirement was 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 48 to 1. 21) to 1. 35 (0. 79 to 1. 90) kg greater among physically inactive persons (decrease in activity or inactive) compared with those physically active (p< 0. 001). Retirement transition may be associated with beneficial changes in lifestyle and may thus be a good starting point to preventive interventions in various groups of individuals in order to maintain long-term changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{aetiology}} of impaired {{growth hormone}} (GH) secretion in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) remains controversial {{due to the}} common occurrence of obesity. To <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> suboptimal GH secretion in PWS is an artefact of excess weight, we evaluated both GH immunological activity and GH bioactivity after arginine administration in 23 non-obese PWS patients [seven females, aged 6. 9 +/- 0. 9 years, body mass index (BMI) SDS 0. 63 +/- 0. 26], in comparison with a control group of 32 healthy subjects, matched for age, gender and BMI (10 females, aged 7. 9 +/- 0. 3 years, BMI SDS 0. 21 +/- 0. 20). Serum GH concentration was measured with a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (IFMA), while GH bioactivity was evaluated by the Nb 2 cell bioassay. Serum IGF-I concentrations were measured by double-antibody RIA. GH mean peak after pharmacological stimulation was significantly lower in PWS individuals compared with controls when measured either by IFMA (6. 05 +/- 1. 23 microg/L vs. 23. 7 +/- 1. 06 microg/L, p < 0. 0001) or by Nb 2 (6. 87 +/- 0. 55 microg/L vs. 12. 88 +/- 0. 19 microg/L, p < 0. 0001). Analysis of integrated GH secretion (AUC) confirmed that the PWS group differed significantly from the control subjects (387. 9 +/- 76. 1 microg/L/h vs. 1498. 1 +/- 56. 2 microg/L/h, p < 0. 0001); the same result was obtained when the GH rise after arginine administration was expressed as nAUC (278. 2 +/- 53. 3 microg/L/h vs. 1443. 6 +/- 52. 5 microg/L/h, p < 0. 0001). PWS patients had an IGF-I SDS significantly lower than those found in control subjects (p < 0. 0001). Subnormal IGF-I values were present in 19 PWS individuals (82. 6 %) and two healthy controls (6. 2 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is some {{evidence}} that subjects with Non‐specific Chronic Low Back Pain (NS‐CLBP) have reduced proprioceptive awareness compared with matched controls, although other studies have questioned this. These conflicting results might be related to the heterogeneity of the NSCLBP population. Sub‐classification into more homogeneous subgroups might help to <b>further</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> or not proprioceptive deficits exist. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the lumbar reposition sense in sitting in a subgroup of patients with NS‐CLBP presenting with a specific Flexion Pattern (FP) motor control impairment in sitting versus healthy controls (HC). METHODS: 15 subjects with NS‐CLBP (FP) reporting an increase in LBP symptoms during prolonged sitting were included in the study and matched with 15 HC subjects. To assess lumbar proprioception, subjects had to perform a repositioning task in sitting, whereby they had to reproduce a target position (neutral lordosis) after five seconds of slouched sitting. This reposition test was repeated three times. Lumbopelvic position in the sagittal plane was measured with a remote postural monitoring device (BodyGuard). Lumbo‐pelvic position was expressed as a percentage of maximal lumbo‐pelvic flexion whereby the target position was calibrated as 0 %. Constant Error (CE), Absolute Error (AE) and Variable Error (VE) of the repositioning were calculated as outcome measures. Additionally, self‐reported pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry disability index) and fear‐avoidance behaviour (Tampa scale for Kinesophobia) were evaluated. RESULTS: A significant difference in reposition sense was found between the two groups for Constant Error (NS‐CLBP‐group=‐ 6, 94 %, HC= 2, 61 %; p= 0. 006) as well as for Absolute Error: (NS‐CLBP‐group= 11, 53 %,HC= 5, 06; p= 0. 002). In contrast, VE was not significantly different between the two groups (VE: Z=‐ 1. 39, p= 0. 165). Absolute Error was significantly correlated with disability (ODI) in the NS‐CLBP‐group (r= 0. 601). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that lumbar proprioceptive awareness in sitting is decreased in a direction‐specific manner in patients with sitting‐related NS‐CLBP classified as having a Flexion Pattern (FP). They demonstrated an average 'undershooting' pattern, meaning that during repositioning they assumed a relatively flexed lumbar posture. This may explain why these patients experience LBP during sitting. Further studies are needed to <b>clarify</b> <b>whether</b> different subgroup populations (e. g. Extension Pattern) show similar or different lumbar proprioceptive deficits. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|It {{is widely}} known {{that not all}} {{quiescence}} {{is followed by the}} activation of seismicity. We should evaluate the results obtained through multiparameter sets rather than rely on one parameter set as this would help avoid any acceptance of false seismic quiescence.

One possible approach to use when the aim is to clarify the statistical significance of the results would be apply calculations using many synthetic catalogs (e.g., Sobolev et al., 2002). However, we have not made this kind of statistical check since the main aim of this paper is to introduce the RTM algorithm.|$|R

40|$|In this review, we {{introduce}} {{our recent}} {{works on the}} formation of the Bose-Einstein conden-sation (BEC) of the coherent oscillation of axions. By taking a coherent state as a quantum state of the coherent oscillation of axions, we have evaluated the interaction rate between them, which suggests that it exceeds the Hubble parameter around 1 - 10 keV. The general relativistic effects is taken into account by the use of effective field theory technique, and it is shown that the interaction between the subhorizon modes and the superhorizon modes (almost homogeneous condensations) can be relevant.
