40|$|Successful {{management}} of asthmatic patients depends on achieving adequate delivery of inhaled drugs to the lung. This assumes particular importance for inhaled corticosteroids where the therapeutic {{goal should be}} to achieve a high ratio of airway anti-inflammatory efficacy to local and systemic side effects. The availability of user-friendly inhaler devices requires a critical appraisal of their effectiveness and an evaluation of whether improved lung deposition of anti-asthma drugs translates into improved clinical efficacy. There is evidence to suggest that the routine use of large-volume spacers for inhaled corticosteroids {{may not be the best}} first-line option, in that reduced drug delivery is associated with multiple actuations, inhalation delay and the presence of static electricity. Breath-actuated pressurized aerosol devices or dry powder inhaler devices may be a better option for many asthmatic patients, although the efficiency of drug delivery varies considerably between these devices. There is good evidence with a reservoir dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> to show that improved lung deposition translates into better therapeutic response, both in terms of beta 2 -agonist and corticosteroid delivery. For inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone propionate and budesonide, there is evidence to show that systemic bioactivity is mainly determined by lung bioavailability rather than gastrointestinal bioavailability, because of the absence of first-pass metabolism of these drugs in the lung. There is also evidence to show that the greater glucocorticoid potency of fluticasone propionate translates directly into greater systemic bioactivity, but not into enhanced efficacy, at doses above 1 mg daily. The use of efficient delivery systems, such as the reservoir dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>device,</b> may not only improve control of asthma and compliance with therapy, but may also allow dose reduction ('step-down' therapy) and hence may possibly reduce overall prescribing costs in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: From its introduction, the {{antibiotic}} tobramycin {{has been an}} important tool in the management of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. Initially an intravenous rescue treatment for pulmonary exacerbations, tobramycin delivered by inhalation has become a mainstay of chronic suppressive CF infection management. Platforms for tobramycin aerosol delivery have steadily improved, with increased lung deposi-tion complimented by decreased device complexities, loaded tobramycin doses, delivery times, and treatment burdens. Most recently, a unique tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) formulation with a portable delivery system, the TOBI ® Podhaler ® (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) has been developed and approved in Europe, Canada, and Chile. Four capsules, each containing 28 mg of TIP are successively pierced and inhaled via the T- 326 Dry <b>Powder</b> <b>Inhaler</b> <b>Device</b> (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). No external power source is required to deliver an efficacious tobramycin dose in minutes.

40|$|The goal of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} an anti-tubercular strategy based on breathable Solid Lipid Microparticles (SLM) to target alveolar macrophages and to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} conventional tuberculosis (TB) therapy. Rifampicin loaded SLM composed of stearic acid and sodium taurocholate were characterized for aerodynamic diameter, surface charge, physical state of the components, drug loading and release as well as drug biological activity on Bacillus subtilis strain. Moreover, SLM cytotoxicity and cell internalization ability were evaluated on murine macrophages J 774 cell lines by MTT test, cytofluorimetry and confocal laser microscopy. SLM exhibited aerodynamic diameter proper to be transported up to the alveolar epithelium, negative charged surface able to promote uptake by the macrophages and preserved drug antimicrobial activity. The negligible in vitro release of rifampicin indicated the capacity of the microparticle matrix to entrap the drug preventing its spreading over the lung fluid. In vitro studies on J 774 cell lines demonstrated SLM non-cytotoxicity and ability to be taken up by cell cytoplasm.

In this work, spray-dried and co-spray dried inhalable lung surfactant-mimic PEGylated lipopolymers as microparticulate/nanoparticulate dry powders containing paclitaxel were rationally designed via organic solution advanced spray drying (no water) in closed-mode from dilute concentration feed solution. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine poly(ethylene glycol) (DPPE-PEG) with varying PEG chain length were mixed with varying amounts of paclitaxel in methanol to produce co-spray dried microparticles and nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy showed the spherical particle morphology of the inhalable particles. Thermal analysis and X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the retention of the phospholipid bilayer structure in the solid-state following spray drying, the degree of solid-state molecular order, and solid-state phase transition behavior. The residual water content of the particles was very low as quantified analytically Karl Fisher titration.

Inhalation of formoterol or salbutamol resulted in similar increases in FEV 1 from 0 to 3 h post-dose. Both drugs produced similar bronchodilation by 5 min, which became almost maximal by 30 min. The primary efficacy variable, the area under the curve (AUC) of the FEV 1 increase above predose baseline from 0 to 30 min (AUC 0 − 30 min), demonstrated significant effects for formoterol (mean 5 · 89 ± 4 · 67 l min− 1), and salbutamol (mean 6 · 06 ± 4 · 34 l min− 1), which were not statistically different from each other but statistically significantly higher (P< 0 · 0001) than that observed with placebo (− 0 · 32 ± 2 · 59 l min− 1).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether spray drying is an appropriate method for the production of respirable particles of therapeutic proteins. Meeting this objective requires that active, stable, dry powders in the 1 - 5 μm size range be obtained. A model protein, β-galactosidase, was used throughout the study. ^ The first part of the experimental work focused on the effect of various processing and formulation variables on the critical quality attributes of the spray dried protein (residual activity, moisture content, particle size and yield). Statistically designed experiments were used so that both direct and interactive effects of the variables could be identified, and the most appropriate formulation and process established. In order to obtain acceptable product yields and moisture contents, relatively harsh drying conditions were required. This necessitated the inclusion of a stabilizer in the formulation to preserve enzyme activity. Trehalose was found to be the most suitable stabilizer of those evaluated (sucrose, mannitol, arginine hydrochloride and trehalose). ^ Subsequent experiments were carried out to evaluate the in vitro deposition properties of the spray dried β-galactosidase from dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices.</b> Respirable fractions were determined using the twin impinger and cascade impactor. These in vitro devices divide the 2 ̆ 7 inspired 2 ̆ 7 dose into different size fractions enabling the amount of material in the respirable size range to be calculated. The respirable fractions were comparable with published values for conventional small molecule drugs. The spray dried powders were found to be extremely sensitive to moisture with dramatic reductions in respirable fractions occurring after exposure of the powders to environments of high humidity. ^ The respirable fractions were highly dependent on the <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> used, and the powder formulation. With less efficient <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices,</b> the presence of a coarser carrier material blended with the spray dried powder substantially improved the respirable fractions.

40|$|Background: In {{pulmonary}} medicine, aerosolization {{of substances}} for continuous inhalation {{is confined to}} different classes of nebulizers with their inherent limitations. Among the unmet medical needs {{is the lack of}} an aerosolized surfactant preparation for inhalation by preterm neonates, to avoid the risks associated with endotracheal intubation and surfactant bolus instillation. In the present report, we describe a high-concentration continuous powder aerosolization system developed for delivery of inhalable surfactant to preterm neonates. Methods: The developed device uses a technique that allows efficient aerosolization of dry surfactant powder, generating a surfactant aerosol of high concentration. In a subsequent humidification step, the heated aerosol particles are covered with a surface layer of water. The wet surfactant aerosol is then delivered to the patient interface (e. g., nasal prongs) through a tube. Results: The performance characteristics of the system are given as mass concentration, dose rate, and size distribution of the generated aerosol. Continuous aerosol flows of about 0. 84 L/min can be generated from dry recombinant surfactant protein-C surfactant, with concentrations of up to 12 g/m 3 and median particle sizes of the humidified particles in the range of 3 to 3. 5 µm at the patient interface. The system has been successfully used in preclinical studies. Conclusion: The device with its continuous high-concentration delivery is promising for noninvasive delivery of surfactant aerosol to neonates and has the potential for becoming a versatile disperser platform closing the gap between continuously operating nebulizers and discontinuously operating dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

TIP is associated with an increased frequency of mild to moderate local adverse events (cough, dysphonia, and dysgeusia) compared with TIS, however, these become less frequent as subjects gain TIP experience.

Particles were rationally designed and produced by advanced spray-drying particle engineering from an organic solution in closed mode (no water) from dilute solution. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that these particles had both optimal particle morphology and surface morphology, and the particle size distributions were suitable for pulmonary delivery. Comprehensive and systematic physicochemical characterization and in vitro aerosol dispersion performance revealed significant differences between these two fluoroquinolone antibiotics following spray drying as drug aerosols and as cospray-dried antibiotic drug: DPPC aerosols. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and confocal Raman microspectroscopy were employed to probe composition and interactions in the solid state. Spray-dried MOXI was rendered noncrystalline (amorphous) following organic solution advanced spray drying. This was in contrast to spray-dried OFLX, which retained partial crystallinity, as did OFLX:DPPC powders at certain compositions. Aerosol dispersion performance was conducted using inertial impaction with a dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> approved for human use.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate patients&# 39; perception of onset of effect with a single dose. Methods: In this double-blind, crossover, Phase IV study, 40 patients were randomized to receive a single dose of indacaterol 75 µg or placebo via a dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>device.</b> The primary variable was time until patient’s perception of onset of effect, using a simple self-administered (nonvalidated) questionnaire that patients answered at nine protocol-specified time points. Exploratory variables included change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and change in percent predicted FEV 1 from predose to postdose (determined 60 – 75 minutes postdose). Results: The least-squares mean time to patient’s perception of onset of effect was 25. 4 minutes and 23. 9 minutes for indacaterol and placebo, respectively. There was no significant effect for treatment, period, or sequence on the time to patient&# 39;s perception. In addition, no statistically significant differences between treatments were observed for patient&# 39;s global satisfaction with onset of effect and global expectation of treatment adherence. For the exploratory variable change in FEV 1 from predose to postdose, indacaterol showed superiority over placebo with a clinically relevant least-squares mean treatment difference of 0. 12 L (P< 0. 0001). There was little or no association between patient’s perception of time to onset of effect and change in FEV 1, or change in percent predicted FEV 1. Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: A single dose of indacaterol 75 µg did not separate from placebo in terms of patient perception of onset, although there was an improvement in FEV 1 for indacaterol compared with placebo.

40|$|Formulation of actives for {{pulmonary}} delivery with dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices</b> frequently requires a {{particle size reduction}} step. The high-energy forces imparted to a material during milling, as well as reducing particle size, can cause {{a significant change in}} physicochemical properties, in particular mechanical activation of the surface (manifested as generation of amorphous regions) which can affect formulated product performance. It is not clear whether particle size reduction occurs prior to, or concomitantly with, generation of amorphous content. In this study the formation of amorphous content with time in crystalline salbutamol sulphate was quantified with isothermal gas perfusion calorimetry as the sample was ball-milled. The data showed that the most particle size reduction occurred initially (d(0. 5) dropping from 12. 83 +/- 0. 4 to 4. 2 +/- 0. 4 within 5 min). During this time period, no detectable amorphous content was observed. Between 5 and 15 min milling time the particle size distribution remained relatively constant but the amorphous content increased non-linearly with time. After 20 min milling time the particle size increased slightly. The data suggest that particle size reduction occurs initially upon application of a force to the crystal. Once maximum particle size reduction has occurred the crystal absorbs the force being applied and the crystal lattice becomes disordered. After extended milling the conditions in the ball mill (heat and/or humidity) may cause crystallisation of some of the amorphous material resulting in particle-particle fusion.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTiotropium {{is a new}} long-acting {{anticholinergic}} bronchodilator, {{which is}} recommended as first-line therapy {{in the management of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is currently available {{in the form of a}} dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> worldwide. Some COPD patients find it difficult to generate inspiratory flow rates of up to 40 l/min, which is required for the drug to reach the airways. To overcome this, a new pMDI form has been developed for administration of tiotropium in patients with COPD. The clinical efficacy of this mode of tiotropium delivery has, so far, not been compared with the currently available dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> (DPI) <b>devices.</b> Aims and objectivesTo compare the bronchodilator effects of a single dose of 18 mcg of tiotropium administered via a pressurized meter dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer with the currently available DPI form through Rotahaler®. Study designA randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, three-period, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-center study was conducted in 19 patients with stable COPD. Single doses of tiotropium (18 mcg) or placebo were administered on three separate study days (4 – 7 days apart) through a Rotahaler® and pMDI with a non-static spacer (Zerostat, Cipla Ltd.). During each study visit forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured over a period of 24 h at 11 different time points (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h), using a bellows spirometer (Vitalograph® 2160, UK) while static parameters like inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) and total lung capacity (TLC) were measured by bodyplethysmography (Jaeger Masterscreen, Germany) at 0 min, 3, 8 and 24 h. ResultsTiotropium administered through both pMDI (and spacer) and DPI showed significantly better mean FEV 1 and mean FVC differences from baseline, in terms of mean maximum change and area under curve over a period of 24 h (AUC 0 – 24 h), as compared to placebo. The mean IC and trough FEV 1 values also improved significantly with tiotropium administered through both the devices as compared to placebo. For all these parameters, there was no difference in the efficacy between pMDI and DPI. There was also no significant difference between the time to onset, time to maximum response and duration of response between tiotropium administered through both the study devices. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in RV, ITGV and TLC by a single dose of tiotopium delivered through either of the devices when compared with placebo over a period of 24 h. ConclusionThis is the first study to demonstrate that tiotropium administered by pMDI and spacer shows a superior time-dependent bronchodilator response when compared to placebo, and that this therapeutic efficacy is similar to tiotropium administered by DPI. We recommend the use of tiotropium administered through a pMDI and spacer to those COPD patients who prefer to use the pMDI device, and especially in those who cannot generate sufficient inspiratory flows required for dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research in this thesis was to investigate two aspects of the de-agglomeration of cohesive materials in respiratory delivery, i. e. the influence of cohesive material properties {{and the influence of}} the inhaler device characteristics. Firstly, the thesis focussed on the characterisation of cohesive powder behaviour during aerosolisation at a sequence of air flow rates to understanding the micro-structure of the powder bed. This part of the thesis determined the relative de-agglomeration as a function of air flow rate of micronized drugs, in particular salbutamol sulphate (SS) and various lactoses using a simple <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> <b>device.</b> The study was extended to the investigation of the de-agglomeration efficiencies of binary mixtures of SS and lactohale 300 (LH 300) in the ratios of SS:LH 300 of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8. The data were modelled using non-linear least square regression and sigmoidal equation parameters were used to characterise single components and binary mixtures. Secondly, the thesis determined to correlate kinetics of emptying and kinetics of de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. This second part of the thesis investigated the kinetics of powder emptying and de-agglomeration of single component systems using three model inhaler devices, Rotahaler® (RH), Monodose Inhaler® (MI) and Handihaler® (HH). The study correlated the rate constants for emptying and de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. Due to the differences in inhaler design, the role of pressure drop across the device and sensitivity of the device on powder de-agglomeration was also studied. The primary particle size distribution of the materials was achieved through wet dispersion of powders using laser diffraction. The powders (single components and binary mixtures) were processed with a validated laboratory mixing technique prior to aerosolisation. The content uniformity of binary mixtures was assessed using a validated UV spectrophotometric assay. The real time particle size distributions of the aerosolised plume were obtained using laser diffraction following aerosolisation from inhaler devices at various air flow rates (30 - 180 l min- 1). The in-vitro performance of SS-LH 300 mixtures were assessed using custom-made jet diameters of stage 1 of the twin stage liquid impinger with drug assayed by a validated HPLC assay. Images of the powders were captured using scanning electron microscopy. The significance (p< 0. 05) was obtained from ANOVA and t-test using SPSS software. Relative de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of SS and LH 300 and the estimated parameters obtained from modelling with sigmoid three parameter equation defined comparative powder micro-structures of cohesive powders. The maximum relative de-agglomeration of SS was much higher than LH 300 at higher air flow rates. In contrast, the relative de-agglomeration of LH 300 was higher than SS at low air flow rates. The de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of cohesive mixtures of SS and LH 300 demonstrated improved powder de-agglomeration with increased content of LH 300 in SS-LH 300 binary mixtures. The study showed that the cohesive materials did not behave independently and that the particle interactions occurring in the powder bed resulted in SS rich and SS poor regions of the aerosolised plume depending on the air flow rate. The parameters obtained from sigmoid three parameter equation provided an understanding of structural changes of binary mixtures (SS and LH 300) and SS with increased proportion of LH 300 in the mixture. Prolonged powder emptying was observed with inhaler devices, MI and HH in contrast to RH where powder emptied within a second. The emitted mass vs. time profiles were modelled using a mono-exponential equation to estimate the rate constant of powder emptying (kCCEM). In general, with both materials, the relative kCCEM followed the order: MI<HH<RH. However, the kCCEM between the materials depended on powder micro-structure of the materials. Similar to kCCEM, the rate of de-agglomeration (kd) from the three inhaler devices followed first-order kinetics. The rate constants i. e., kCCEM and kd were influenced by air flow rate, micro-structure of powder bed and device design. Profiles of kCCEM vs. kd resulted in linear relations for MI and HH where the slopes were 1. 0 and 0. 8 for MI and HH respectively. The capsule characteristics are very important in controlling kCCEM and kd, while the variability in kCCEM and kd was due to the design of the capsule chamber. The relative de-agglomeration as a function of pressure drop between the materials depended on the inhaler device; however; at 4 kPa pressure drop, the mechanism imparted by MI was more efficient in de-agglomerating both materials. The device sensitivity to pressure drop depended on the micro-structure of the powder. The outcomes of this thesis provided an approach to characterise the cohesive powders enabling a better understanding of micro-structures of the cohesive powders for inhalation. In addition, this study provided a way to define emptying and de-agglomeration rate of powders from inhalers to enable the use these rate constants to study both powder and device characteristics in improving inhaler design to achieve better and more reliable performance...|$|E

However, {{it is important to}} have objective evidence to support or refute this view. Systematic reviews have sug-gested that there is no difference in clinical effectiveness between dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> and metered-dose inhalers. However, the studies included in the review were randomised clinical trials and not studies based on real-life clinical prac-tice. In the real world, the efficacy of products as determined in a specified and well-monitored population is only one aspect of product performance – patient characteristics and behaviour are critical. Observational studies in real-world primary care settings suggest that the choice of <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> has an important impact on asthma outcomes. The IMS Mediplus database has now been used to compare outcomes among patients receiving initial maintenance therapy with beclometasone dipropionate administered via different dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers.</b> Patients using the DISKHALERTM dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> used sig-nificantly less short-acting b 2 -agonist than those using the ROTAHALERTM dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler.</b> This suggests a difference in the level of asthma control with the different devices, even when the same chemical entity is delivered.

40|$|AbstractFour {{types of}} {{corticosteroid}} <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices</b> {{are available in}} New Zealand for first-line treatment of asthma, including two aerosol systems [Autohaler™ (3 M Healthcare Ltd, Loughborough, U.

K.) ] and two dry powder systems [Diskhaler™ (Glaxo Wellcome) and Turbuhaler™ (Astra AB, Sodertalje, Sweden) ]. Rates of asthma-related health care consumption and treatment outcomes associated with use of the different inhalers are unknown. In this retrospective survey, asthma-related primary health care consultation and prescription patterns were compared in a large general practice population for each corticosteroid <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> prescribed as first-line treatment. An electronic search of a computerized clinical database yielded the medical records of 5704 patients with physician-diagnosed asthma who were prescribed either the Autohaler, Diskhaler, MDI or Turbuhaler as their sole corticosteroid <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> in the previous 12 months. The mean daily inhaled corticosteroid dose was lowest for the Autohaler (569 μg day− 1; 95 % CI: 538 – 605), followed by the Diskhaler (638 μg day− 1; 95 % CI: 609 – 670) and MDI (655 μg day− 1; 95 % CI: 638 – 673), and was highest for the Turbuhaler (990 μg day− 1; 95 % CI: 954 – 1029, P< 0 · 001). A relatively high proportion of patients aged 19 – 49 years in the Turbuhaler and Diskhaler groups (29 % and 23 %, respectively) received at least one inhaled corticosteroid prescription including a daily dose greater than 1500 μg compared with the MDI group (4 %). In the Diskhaler group the mean daily inhaled corticosteroid dose prescribed for adult patients {{was similar to that}} for the Turbuhaler group (904 μg day− 1 and 1058 μg day− 1, respectively). These data suggest that in New Zealand the dry <b>powder</b> corticosteroid <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices</b> are prescribed for adults at significantly higher doses than the aerosol <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices.</b> Clinical databases of this type yield valuable information on drug utilization in large patient populations and usefully assess clinical prescribing practices...|$|R
40|$|If {{patients}} {{are unable to}} use their inhaler, drug delivery may be unsatisfactory and the patients may fail {{to benefit from the}} prescribed medication. It is important to consider whether patients can use all dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> equally well. Changing a patient from a dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> used well to one that the patient is unable to operate effectively could compromise asthma control. The many marketed dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> reflect differences in design decisions that could affect lung deposition. Studies using different dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> have confirmed that different lung deposition patterns are observed. Furthermore, there may be considerable individual variability in lung deposition. Differences in lung deposition patterns could have clinical effects. Studies may show similar clinical effectiveness with two inhalers, because most products are used at the plateau phase of the dose-response curve, although there may be differences in the adverse event profile. The ideal inhaler does not yet exist. Different dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> show some but not all features of the ideal inhaler; hence, patients may prefer some aspects of one inhaler while favouring a different inhaler for other features. The individual balance of features will govern the overall preference for one inhaler over others. The method for operation of dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> varies. Ease of use is seen as an important consideration when selecting an <b>inhaler</b> <b>device,</b> which should be evaluated in real-life studies using unselected patient populations.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to determine how the flowfield generated in anAerolizer 1 at 60 lmin 1 varied when the inhaler grid and mouthpiece were modified. The computational models were validated by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). Dispersion performance of the modified inhalerswasmeasuredwith amannitol powder using amultistage liquid impinger at 60 l min 1. The inhaler grid was found to significantly affect the performance of the Aerolizer 1. As the grid voidage was increased, the amount of powder retained in the device doubled (due to increased tangential flow of particles in the inhaler mouthpiece) and the FPFLoaded was reduced from 57 to 44 % (due to increased mouthpiece retention). The length of the mouthpiece played a lesser role on the inhaler performance, having no significant effect on the flowfield generated in the devices.

40|$|Background: Inadequate {{technique}} {{reduces the}} effects of inhalation medication. Errors in inhalation technique {{have been reported to}} range up to 85 %. Not only various patients' characteristics but also the device has an effect on correct inhalation technique. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of patients' characteristics and type of <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> on inhalation technique in patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A validated scoring method was used that consisted of triple viewing of video-recorded inhalations, using device-specific checklists. The following patient characteristics were investigated: gender, age, education level, diagnosis, treatment by a pulmonary physician, previously received inhalation instruction, exacerbation frequency, knowledge, self-management competence, pulmonary function, and use of multiple <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices.</b> Chi-square statistics were used for univariate associations between potential determinants and correctness of inhalation technique. Relevant determinants were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Moreover, inhalation technique errors were examined for six inhaler devices: three prefilled dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers,</b> one single-dose dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler,</b> a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and a pMDI with a spacer. Results: Overall, 40 % of the patients made at least one essential mistake in their inhalation technique. Patients who never received inhalation instruction and patients who used more than one <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> made significantly more errors (odds ratio both 2. 2). Comparison between devices showed that a correct inhalation technique most likely occurred with the use of prefilled dry powder devices. Conclusion: Incorrect inhalation technique is common among asthma and COPD patients in a pulmonary outpatient clinic.

40|$|For direct intramacrophagic antitubercular therapy, {{pulmonary}} administration through Dry <b>Powder</b> <b>Inhaler</b> (DPI) <b>devices</b> {{is a reasonable}} option. For the achievement of efficacious aerosolisation, rifampicin-loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticle assemblies (SLNas) were developed using the melt emulsifying technique followed by freeze-drying. Indeed, this drying method can cause freezing or drying stresses compromising powder respirability. It is {{the aim of this}} research to offer novel information regarding pre-freezing variables. These included type and concentration of cryoprotectants, pre-freezing temperature, and nanoparticle concentration in the suspension. In particular, the effects of such variables were observed at two main levels. First of all, on SLNas characteristics – i. e., size, polydispersity index, zeta-potential, circularity, density, and drug loading. Secondly, on powder respirability, taking into account aerodynamic diameter, emitted dose, and respirable fraction. Considering the complexity of the factors involved in a successful respirable powder, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was adopted as a statistical tool for evaluating the effect of pre-freezing conditions. Interestingly, the most favourable impact on powder respirability was exerted by quick-freezing combined with a certain grade of sample dilution before the pre-freezing step without the use of cryoprotectants. In such conditions, a very high SLNas respirable fraction (> 50 %) was achieved, along with acceptable yields in the final dry powder as well as a reduction of powder mass to be introduced into DPI capsules with benefits in terms of administered drug dose feasibility...|$|R
40|$|Targeted drug {{delivery}} is object of an intense research. A medicinal chemistry approach {{allowed us to}} modify an opioid peptide in order to remove the opioid activity and retain the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Polyester-based nanoparticles (Np) surface-decorated with this peptide were shown {{to be able to}} deliver loperamide (a model drug) into CNS, as well as cholesterol (for the treatment of Huntington’s disease) and albumin (a model of a cargo protein). With a view of clinical translation, however, polyester Np seems to be not well suited for CNS diseases. Thus, we decided to use our peptide in alternative ways other than as a conjugate with the carboxyl group of the polyester PLGA, starting material for the production of the Np. We develop a new synthetic procedure that allow the conjugation of the peptide with substrates containing hydroxyl groups, less reactive than the carboxy group of the polyester (we considered as a substrate the poly(vinyl alcohol)), as well as a linker that could be inserted between a cargo and the peptide targeting moiety. At the same time, we moved towards lipidic carriers, a kind of delivery agents already clinically available. To gain experience on these carriers, we designed rifampicin-loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticle assemblies (SLNas), for a direct intramacrophagic antitubercular therapy using Dry <b>Powder</b> <b>Inhaler</b> (DPI) <b>devices</b> and, in the first instance, methyl mannopyranoside as targeting ligand, able to interact with mannose receptors present on macrophages.

40|$|Inhalation is a {{convenient}} way to deliver drugs to the respiratory tract {{in the treatment}} of respiratory diseases. For dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalers</b> (DPI's), the principle of operation is to use the patient-generated inspiratory flow as energy source for emptying of the dose system and the delivery of fine drug particles into the respiratory tract. Resistance to airflow of the <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> is a major determinant for the inspiratory flow profile through the dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> that can be generated by the patient. Therefore, resistance to airflow is one of the design parameters for DPI's, {{that could be used to}} control the inspiratory flow profile, and is one of the parameters to optimise particle deposition in the airways. In this study the effect of resistance to airflow on different parameters of the inspiratory flow curves as generated by healthy subjects, asthmatics and COPD patients was determined. As a result of increased resistance to airflow, the peak inspiratory flow (PIF), the flow increase rate (FIR) and the inhaled volume to reach PIF is decreased. On the other hand, the total inhalation time as well as the 80 % dwell time is increased. In general, tuning of the resistance to airflow in the design of a dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhaler</b> may improve the drug deposition in the respiratory tract. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

Various combinations of <b>inhaler</b> <b>devices,</b> analytes and air flow rates have been evaluated with respect to basic particle characteristics, aerosol deposition behavior, viscous pressure drop and air flow turbulence. The resulting experimental data were employed to find the approximate dependence between the four non-dimensional groups retained in the functional and a very good correlation has been achieved. As a conclusion, the size of the particles has been identified as the most relevant variable, followed by the viscous pressure drop in the <b>inhaler</b> <b>device</b> and the density of the powder.
