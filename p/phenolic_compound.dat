The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate synergistic anti-Campylobacter jejuni activity of fluoroquinolones and macrolides in combination with <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Synergistic antimicrobial activity was measured by performing a checkerboard assay with ciprofloxacin and erythromycin in the presence of 21 <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Membrane permeability changes in C. jejuni by <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> were determined by measuring the level of intracellular uptake of 1 -N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN). Antibiotic accumulation assays were performed to evaluate the level of ciprofloxacin accumulation in C. jejuni. Six <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds,</b> including p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, and taxifolin, significantly increased the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin in several human and poultry isolates.

25|$|Raw {{or fresh}} olives are {{naturally}} very bitter; {{to make them}} palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the throubes black olive, which when allowed to ripen in sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree, is edible.|$|E

A [...] sample of dried mushroom (100gdw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules).

The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} press method for olive oil production, olives are crushed and malaxed into a paste, which is spread on mats.

The fate of the olive <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds,</b> including oleuropein, and antioxidant activity was investigated at each stage {{of the process and}} the waste products (pomace and wastewater) were evaluated as potential sources of valuable <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> and antioxidant activity.

30|$|In conclusion, {{different}} <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> often {{present in}} lignocellulosic hydrolysates have toxicity limits {{that are not}} necessarily similar even between <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> sharing the same functional groups.

The experiments showed that phenolics rich substrates may be fermentable since fermentability depends on the concentration and the nature of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> present in them. Indications also emerged from the present study that mechanisms of inhibition among <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> are dissimilar and may not be defined by the classes of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> (aldehydes, acids, alcohols and ketones) as they are currently known. Further studies involving investigation of gene regulation and varying enzymatic studies are needed to draw conclusions on the specificity of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> inhibition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|R
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

We tested the vir-inducing abilities of 15 different <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> using four wild-type strains of A. tumefaciens [...] KU 12, C 58, A 6, and Bo 542. We analyzed the relationship between structures of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> and levels of vir gene expression in these strains. In strain KU 12, vir genes were not induced by <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> containing 4 '-hydroxy, 3 '-methoxy, and 5 '-methoxy groups, such as acetosyringone, which strongly induced vir genes of the other three strains. On the other hand, vir genes of strain KU 12 were induced by <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> containing only a 4 '-hydroxy group, such as 4 -hydroxyacetophenone, which did not induce vir genes of the other three strains. The vir genes of strains KU 12, A 6, and Bo 542 were all induced by <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> containing 4 '-hydroxy and 3 '-methoxy groups, such as acetovanillone. By transferring different Ti plasmids into isogenic chromosomal backgrounds, we showed that the phenolic-sensing determinant is associated with Ti plasmid.

A difference in inhibition of biomethane production between the <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> was noted. Hydrolysis rate, during anaerobic digestion of miscanthus was inhibited up to 50 % by vanillic acid, while vanillic acid had no influence on the initial rate of biogas production during the anaerobic digestion of hemp straw. Miscanthus has a higher lignin concentration (12 - 30 g/ 100 g DM) making it less accessible for degradation, and in combination with <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> released after harsh pretreatments, it can cause severe inhibition levels during the anaerobic digestion, lowering biogas production. To counter the inhibition, lignin degrading enzymes can be used to remove or degrade the inhibitory <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The interaction of laccase and versatile peroxidase individually with the different <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> was studied to have insight in the polymerization of inhibitory compounds or breakdown of lignocellulose.

40|$|Abstract Sustainable, biotechnological {{utilization}} of non-food, plant biomass {{has been demonstrated}} {{to be a viable}} means of producing energy, fuels, materials and chemicals, representing a paradigm shift from fossil-derived sources. However, the presence of chemicals that inhibit fermentation by microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly used for bioconversion, causes a bottleneck in such processes. <b>Phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> are aromatic compounds that serve as building blocks of lignin in plants. During the deconstruction of plant biomass, <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> are released as degradation products from the lignin component of wood into the hydrolysates, inhibiting fermentation. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to explore approaches for the development of strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have improved tolerance to <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and to better understand its endogenous metabolism of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds.</b> A study was performed on the interaction between the yeast and <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> using single <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> in defined growth medium. The toxicity of thirteen <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> was determined. The concentrations at which each compound completely inhibited the growth of S. cerevisiae was found to differ among the compounds, and three distinct physiological responses were observed.
