MethodA structured review selected 38 peer-reviewed papers between 2006 and 2016 in Sub-Saharan Africa to include in the analysis. ResultsPerformance accountability in MNH through maternal and <b>perinatal</b> death <b>surveillance</b> was the most common accountability mechanism used. Political and democratic accountability through advocacy, human rights, and global tracking of progress on indicators achieved greatest results when multiple stakeholders were involved. Financial accountability can be effective but depend on external support. Overall, this review shows that accountability is more effective when clear expectations are backed by social and political advocacy and multistakeholder engagement, and supported by incentives for positive action. ConclusionThere are few accountability mechanisms in MNH in Sub-Saharan Africa between decision-makers and those affected by those decisions with both the power and the will to enforce answerability.

40|$|To prevent {{frequency}} or {{severity of}} variable decelerations {{in the presence}} of oligohydramnios leading to improved neonatal and maternal outcomes. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Oligohydramnios can cause intrapartum compression of the umbilical cord. This can result in variable decelerations of the fetal heart rate which may be associated with fetal hypoxia, acidosis and increased incidence of operative delivery. In the presence of oligohydramnios the use of intrapartum amnioinfusion has be shown to significantly improve neonatal outcomes and decrease the rate of caesarean section, without increasing the rate of postpartum endometriosis. 1 Evidence shows that amnioinfusion {{in the presence of}} thick meconium liquor during labour does not reduce the risk of moderate or severe meconium aspiration syndrome, perinatal death, or other major maternal or neonatal disorders. 2 Routine use of amnioinfusion in the presence of thick meconium liquor is not recommended in facilities with standard antenatal surveillance.

METHODS: Very low birth weight infants admitted to eight neonatal intensive care units from November 1999 to April 2000 were studied prospectively. The units were defined as Type I if they employed aggressive nutritional support techniques and Type II if other nutritional practices were used. Babies' were defined as malnourished if their z-score for weight was {{less than or equal}} to - 2 on the Canadian <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System growth curves. Data was analyzed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression. The study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent (126 / 200) of the study population were classed as being malnourished at term. Weight at term (corrected gestational age) showed a direct correlation with birth weight, but an indirect correlation with the length of stay, gestational age at birth, time to regain birth weight and CRIB score (p < 0. 05). Small for gestational age infants had a 12. 19 times greater chance of being malnourished at term. Being born at a Type I unit reduced the risk of malnutrition at term by 2. 17 times, male sex reduced this risk by 0. 4 times and achieving total enteral nutrition by the 10 th day of life reduced it by 1. 97 times (p < 0. 03).

40|$|Maternal death {{surveillance}} and response (MDSR) constitutes a quality improvement approach to identify how many maternal deaths occur, what {{the underlying causes}} of death and associated factors are, and how to implement actions {{to reduce the number of}} preventable stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths. This requires a coordinated approach, ensuring both national- and district-level stakeholders are enabled and supported and can implement MDSR in a "no name, no blame" environment. This field action report from Kenya provides an example of how MDSR can be implemented in a "real-life" setting by summarizing the experiences and challenges faced thus far by maternal death assessors and Ministry of Health representatives in implementing MDSR. Strong national leadership via a coordinating secretariat has worked well in Kenya. However, several challenges were encountered including underreporting of data, difficulties with reviewing the data, and suboptimal aggregation of data on cause of death. To ensure progress toward a full national enquiry of all maternal deaths, we recommend improving the notification of maternal deaths, ensuring regular audits and feedback at referral hospitals lead to continuous quality improvement, and strengthening community linkages with health facilities to expedite maternal death reporting. Ultimately, both a top-down and bottom-up approach is needed to ensure success of an MDSR system. <b>Perinatal</b> death <b>surveillance</b> and response is planned as a next phase of MDSR implementation in Kenya. To ensure the process continues to evolve into a full national enquiry of all maternal deaths, we recommend securing longer-term budget allocation and financial commitment from the ministry, securing a national legal framework for MDSR, and improving processes at the subnational level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In October 2003 South Africa {{embarked}} on a program of folic acid fortification of staple foods. We measured the change in prevalence of NTDs before and after fortification and assessed the cost benefit of this primary health care intervention. METHODS: Since the beginning of 2002 an ecological study was conducted among 12 public hospitals in four provinces of South Africa. NTDs {{as well as other}} birth defect rates were reported before and after fortification. Mortality data were also collected from two independent sources. RESULTS: This study shows a significant decline in the prevalence of NTDs following folic acid fortification in South Africa. A decline of 30. 5 % was observed, from 1. 41 to 0. 98 per 1, 000 births (RR = 0. 69; 95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 98; p =. 0379). The cost benefit ratio in averting NTDs was 46 to 1. Spina bifida showed a significant decline of 41. 6 % compared to 10. 9 % for anencephaly. Additionally, oro-facial clefts showed no significant decline (5. 7 %). An independent <b>perinatal</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system also shows a significant decline (65. 9 %) in NTD perinatal deaths, and in NTD infant mortality (38. 8 %). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in NTD rates postfortification is consistent with decreases observed in other countries that have fortified their food supplies. This is the first time this has been observed in a predominantly African population. The economic benefit flowing from the prevention of NTDs greatly exceeds the costs of implementing folic acid fortification.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the results of Maternal and <b>Perinatal</b> Death <b>Surveillance</b> and Response (MPDSR) conducted in three referral hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria over a two-year period and to report the outcomes and the lessons learned. MPDRS panels were constituted in the three hospitals, and beginning from January 2015, we conducted monthly MPDSR in the three hospitals using a nationally approved protocol. Data on births and deaths and causes of deaths as identified by the MPDSR panels were collated in the hospitals. The results show that over a 21 -month period (January 1, 2015 -September 30, 2016), maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remained high in the hospitals. Although there was a trend towards an increase in MMR in Lagos Island Maternity Hospital and Gbagada General Hospital, and a trend towards a decline in Ajeromi Hospital, none of these trends were statistically significant. Eclampsia, primary post-partum haemorrhage, obstructed labour and puerperal sepsis were the leading obstetric causes of death. By contrast, delay in arrival in hospital, the lack of antenatal care and patients' refusal to receive recommended treatment were the patients' associated causes of death, while delay in treatment, poor use of treatment protocols, lack of equipment and lack of skills by providers to use available equipment were the identified facility-related causes of death. Failure to address the patients and facility-related causes of maternal mortality possibly accounted for the persistently high maternal mortality ratio in the hospitals. We conclude that interventions aimed at redressing all causes of maternal deaths identified in the reviews will likely reduce the maternal mortality ratios in the hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Health Issue: Canada's {{standard}} of perinatal care {{ranks among the}} highest in the world, but there is still room for improvement, both in terms of regional differences in care and global comparisons of approaches to care in Canada and elsewhere. Data from the Canadian <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System (CPSS) was used to evaluate morbidity and mortality among mothers and infants. Key Findings: Maternal mortality rates in Canada dropped to 4. 4 per 100, 000 live births in 1993 – 1997 and are among the lowest in the world. Rates of Caesarean section increased from 15. 3 per 100 deliveries in 1994 to 19. 1 in 1997. Although the infant mortality rate in Canada is among the lowest in the world (5. 3 – 8. 8 per 1, 000 live births 1990 – 2000), there are unacceptable disparities between subpopulations. In Aboriginal populations, rates of stillbirth and perinatal mortality are 2 – 2. 5 times the Canadian average. There has been a steady increase in the proportion of births among older women who have the highest risk of preterm births and pregnancy complications. The increasing rate of multiple births has accelerated recently and is of concern as these carry a higher risk of complications and are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.

We used data from Oregon's <b>perinatal</b> <b>surveillance</b> system, the Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2000 to 2001. A stratified random sample of postpartum women were asked questions about events before, during and after pregnancy, including smoking and provision of smoking cessation counseling. The weighted response rate was 78. 8 % (n = 3, 895). Receipt of a clinician protocol for smoking cessation intervention, called the Five A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange), was the outcome of interest. In the Oregon PRAMS survey, we asked women about three of the Five A's (Ask, Advise, Assist). Of 594 first trimester pregnant smokers, the majority were asked and advised about smoking by a prenatal care provider. However, a substantial proportion of women did not receive assistance to quit and only 42. 2 % received all three steps. Significant racial/ethnic variations were found only in the Assist step. Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White women, NH American Indian women had lower odds (adjusted odds ratio [ORa]: 0. 45; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0. 24, 0. 85) of receiving all three steps. In contrast, NH Black women had increased odds of receiving all three steps (ORa: 2. 43; 95 % CI 1. 16, 5. 10).

40|$|State {{and local}} governments license and monitor {{hospitals}} {{to ensure that a}} minimum acceptable level of care is present as one means of improving the outcomes and health status of patients served. Standards developed to achieve these purposes, however, have focused almost exclusively on the inputs and processes believed to be necessary for quality care and optimal services. Even when the overwhelming consensus of professionals and providers is that such standards impact positively on outcomes, direct evidence of such causal relationships is often lacking. In 1983, the Chicago Department of Health began incorporating direct measurement of outcomes into its mandated regulatory functions for one operating unit of hospitals [...] the maternity and newborn services. Crude perinatal and neonatal mortality rates for Chicago hospitals are adjusted using an indirect standardization process that controls for both race and birth weight. This process allows for the calculation of adjusted mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) that are used as an initial screening instrument. Additional evaluation and investigation activities are then directed to hospitals identified through the initial screening process as meriting further study.

40|$|Background: The first duty of any {{government}} is to ensure the health of its children and neonates. Today's countries are classified as declining mortality in this group. To increase neonatal survival rate, classified causes of newborn mortality are the core strategy and policies. This study was aimed to determine the classification of causes of neonatal death in Iran. Methods: Neonatal mortality refers to deaths of young children. It {{is measured by the}} neonatal mortality rate (NMR), which is the number of deaths of neonates per 1000 live births. This study was used data from 11693 neonatal deaths (from 22 weeks gestational age to neonatal death less than 30 days), in Iran's hospitals in 2012 that registered in the <b>perinatal</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system (hospital-based system). Demographic characteristics and other factors associated with neonatal death were investigated. To aid in cause of death analysis, burden of disease analysis, and comparative risk assessment we classified the causes of death according to international statistical classification of diseases version 10 (ICD 10), divided into three cause mortality strata. Results: Results showed {{the most common cause of}} neonatal mortality was "certain conditions originating in the perinatal period" (77. 92 %) with the highest incidence of "disorders related to length of gestation and fetal growth" (37. 7 %) in this group. Also it shows that 20. 82 % of deaths caused by "congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities" and 1. 26 % cases had occurred as a result of "accidents and injuries". The greatest cause of death in the neonates with weight over one thousand grams was "certain conditions originating in the perinatal period" (71. 29 %), with the highest percentage in the disorders related to "length of gestation and fetal growth" (29. 65 %).

40|$|Abstract Background The rate of macrosomia (birth weight≥ 4, 000 g) {{increased}} {{over the past four}} decades {{in many parts of the}} world. Macrosomia is associated not only with higher risks of maternal and neonatal complications but also with health risks in adulthood. We examined trends in neonatal macrosomia and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births among singleton, live, term and postterm births (≥ 37 complete weeks' gestation) in southeast China from 1994 to 2005 and explored possible causes of the temporal trends. Methods Data from <b>Perinatal</b> Health Care <b>Surveillance</b> System in 12 cities and counties in southeast China were analyzed for trends in birth weight, neonatal macrosomia and LGA from 1994 to 2005. A total of 594, 472 singleton live births were included. We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses to relate these trends to changes in maternal and pregnancy characteristics. Results The rate of macrosomia rose from 6. 00 % in 1994 to 8. 49 % in 2000 and then levelled off to 7. 83 % in 2005. Similar trends were observed in mean birth weight. The incidence of LGA births increased continuously from 13. 72 % in 1994 to 18. 08 % in 2000, but the LGA rate remained relatively stable from 2002 to 2005. There was a decrease in gestational age and a significant increase in frequency of prelabor caesarean delivery from 1994 to 2005. In an adjusted multivariable model, the increase in LGA rate from 1994 to 2000 was associated with increasing net gestational weight gain, maternal age, maternal height and maternal education. But they didn't fully explain the increase. The trends of 2002 - 2005 LGA declined after adjusted for maternal and neonatal characteristics. Conclusions In southeast China, the incidence of macrosomia increased from 1994 to 2000 was mainly related to increasing net gestational weight gain. The incidence of macrosomia has levelled off in recent years partly due to increasing use of prelabor caesarean delivery and earlier delivery and partly due to moderation of gestational weight gain. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the dose-response relationship and synergetic {{effect of the}} maternal educational level and two measures of prenatal care on neonatal low birth weight (LBW) risk. METHODS: Data were derived from the <b>Perinatal</b> Health Care <b>Surveillance</b> System (PHCSS) from January 2001 to September 2009 in Kunshan City, Jiangsu province, eastern China, which included data on 31412 women with a normal birth weight delivery and 640 women with a LBW delivery. Logistic modelling was performed to estimate the association including the joint effects with odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) between the prenatal care measures and LBW risk after adjusting for the potential confounders. The dose-response relationship {{between the number of}} prenatal care visits and the risk of LBW was investigated by modeling the quantitative exposure with restricted cubic splines (RCS). RESULTS: There was a significant synergetic effect on the LBW risk between maternal educational attainment and the number of prenatal care visits (χ(2) = 4. 98, P = 0. 0257), whereas no significant maternal educational attainment interaction was found with the week of initiation of prenatal care after adjusting for relevant confounding factors (χ(2) = 2. 04, P = 0. 1530), and the LBW risk displayed a 'U-shape' curve tendency among the different number of prenatal care visits (P for nonlinearity = 0. 0002) using RCS. In particular, the ORs were approaching the curve's bottom when the women had 9 or 10 prenatal care visits. Comparing with 5 prenatal care visits, the ORs and 95 %CI of LBW risk for 7, 9, 11 and ≥ 13 visits were 0. 92 (0. 82 - 1. 03), 0. 50 (0. 38 - 0. 66), 0. 62 (0. 47 - 0. 82), and 0. 99 (0. 61 - 1. 60), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that appropriate prenatal care, in combination with a higher maternal educational level, can produce a protective interaction effect on LBW risk. Reasonable health resource assignment for different social statuses should be taken into account by policy-makers in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: Avaliar a adequa????o do peso ao termo em uma coorte de rec??m-nascidos com peso de nascimento menor que 1. 500 g e correlacion ??-la a vari??veis cl??nicas e nutricionais. M??todos: Estudo {{longitudinal}} onde rec??m-nascidos de muito baixo peso de oito hospitais (divididos em duas categorias: tipo I aporte nutricional agressivo; tipo II outras pr??ticas) foram acompanhados prospectivamente de novembro de 1999 a abril de 2000. O estado nutricional foi avaliado pelo escore z, sendo considerado como desnutri????o o escore z menor ou igual a - 2, segundo a curva do Canadian <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System. Os dados foram analisados por meio de regress??o linear m??ltipla e regress??o log??stica. Este estudo foi aprovado pelo Comit?? de ??tica em Pesquisa. Resultados: 63 % da popula????o estudada (126 / 200) foi classificada como desnutrida ao termo. O peso ao termo apresentou correla????o negativa com o tempo de interna????o, com a idade gestacional ao nascimento, com o tempo para a recupera????o do peso de nascimento e com o clinical {{risk index}} for babies (p < 0, 05). Ter sido classificado como pequeno para a idade gestacional aumentou a chance de ser desnutrido ao termo em 12, 19 vezes. Ter nascido nas unidades tipo I, ser do sexo masculino e ter atingido dieta enteral plena em at?? 10 dias de vida reduziu o risco de desnutri????o ao termo em 2, 17, 0, 4 e 1, 97 vezes, respectivamente (p < 0, 03). Conclus??es: A forma mais eficaz de prevenir a desnutri????o nos rec??m-nascidos prematuros ?? estimular pr??ticas perinatais, objetivando a preven????o da restri????o do crescimento intra-uterino, al??m de priorizar uma abordagem nutricional mais agressiva. Objective: To evaluate the nutritional status at term of {{a cohort of}} newborn babies with birth weights of less than 1, 500 g and to correlate this with nutritional practices and clinical variables. Methods: Very low birth weight infants admitted to eight neonatal intensive care units from November 1999 to April 2000 were studied prospectively. The units were defined as Type I if they employed aggressive nutritional support techniques and Type II if other nutritional practices were used. Babies were defined as malnourished if their zscore for weight was {{less than or equal}} to 2 on the Canadian <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System growth curves. Data was analyzed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression. The study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research. Results: Sixty-three percent (126 / 200) of the study population were classified as being malnourished at term. Weight at term (corrected gestational age) showed a direct correlation with birth weight, but an indirect correlation with the length of stay, gestational age at birth, time to regain birth weight and CRIB score (p < 0. 05). Small for gestational age infants had a 12. 19 times greater chance of being malnourished at term. Being born at a Type I unit reduced the risk of malnutrition at term by 2. 17 times, male sex reduced this risk by 0. 4 times and achieving total enteral nutrition by the 10 th day of life reduced it by 1. 97 times (p < 0. 03). Conclusions: The most effective means of preventing babies being malnourished at term is by encouraging perinatal practices aimed at preventing restricted intrauterine growth, in addition to giving priority to aggressive nutritional management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Health Issue Canada's {{standard}} of perinatal care {{ranks among the}} highest in the world, but there is still room for improvement, both in terms of regional differences in care and global comparisons of approaches to care in Canada and elsewhere. Data from the Canadian <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System (CPSS) was used to evaluate morbidity and mortality among mothers and infants. Key Findings Maternal mortality rates in Canada dropped to 4. 4 per 100, 000 live births in 1993 – 1997 and are among the lowest in the world. Rates of Caesarean section increased from 15. 3 per 100 deliveries in 1994 to 19. 1 in 1997. Although the infant mortality rate in Canada is among the lowest in the world (5. 3 – 8. 8 per 1, 000 live births 1990 – 2000), there are unacceptable disparities between subpopulations. In Aboriginal populations, rates of stillbirth and perinatal mortality are 2 – 2. 5 times the Canadian average. There has been a steady increase in the proportion of births among older women who have the highest risk of preterm births and pregnancy complications. The increasing rate of multiple births has accelerated recently and is of concern as these carry a higher risk of complications and are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. The costs to the health care system are likely to be high. Data Gaps and Recommendations CPSS data, including economic indicators, needs to be collected in a more timely and uniform manner across Canada. The CPSS should provide an evaluation of how well Canada fares in relation to international standards of perinatal care. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prenatal {{records are}} {{potentially}} powerful tools for {{the translation of}} best-practice evidence into routine prenatal care. Although all jurisdictions in Canada use standardized prenatal records to guide care and provide data for health surveillance, their content related to risk factors such as maternal smoking and alcohol use varies widely. Literature is lacking on how prenatal records are developed or updated to integrate research evidence. This multiphase project aimed to identify key contextual factors influencing decision-making and evidence use among Canadian prenatal record committees (PRCs), and formulate recommendations for the prenatal record review process in Canada. Methods Phase 1 comprised key informant interviews with PRC leaders across 10 Canadian jurisdictions. Phase 2, was a qualitative comparative case study of PRC factors influencing evidence-use and decision-making in five selected jurisdictions. Interview data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Phase 3 involved a dissemination workshop with key stakeholders to review and refine recommendations derived from Phases 1 and 2. Results Prenatal record review processes differed considerably across Canadian jurisdictions. PRC decision-making was complex, revealing the competing functions of the prenatal record as a clinical guide, documentation tool and data source. Internal contextual factors influencing evidence use included PRC resources to conduct evidence reviews; group composition and dynamics; perceived function of the prenatal record; and expert opinions. External contextual factors included concerns about user buy-in; health system capacities; and pressures from public health stakeholders. Our recommendations highlight the need for: broader stakeholder involvement and explicit use of decision-support strategies to support the revision process; a national template of evidence-informed changes {{that can be used}} across jurisdictions; consideration of both clinical and surveillance functions of the prenatal record; and dissemination plans to communicate prenatal record modifications. Conclusions Decision-making related to prenatal record content involves a negotiated effort to balance research evidence with the needs and preferences of prenatal care providers, health system capacities as well as population health priorities. The development of a national template for prenatal records would reduce unnecessary duplication of PRC work and enhance the consistency of prenatal care delivery and <b>perinatal</b> <b>surveillance</b> data across Canada...|$|E
40|$|Background: Congenital {{anomalies}} (CAs) are {{a leading}} cause of fetal and infant mortality and morbidity worldwide. They may be identified prenatally, at the moment of birth or later in life. Purpose: To describe the cases of CAs registered over the last 15 years at a level III hospital, comparing individuals who were detected through prenatal (preN) diagnosis with those detected through postnatal (postN) diagnosis. Methods: All records were collected from the Registo Nacional de Anomalias Congénitas (RENAC) online platform between 1 st January 2000 to 31 st December 2014, in a level III hospital, where cases of CAs were notified voluntarily (n = 1, 222). We tested differences for selected variables between the years in study. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify potential factors associated to preN diagnosis. Results: We observed a total of 1, 510 anomalies, being 493 (40. 3 %) circulatory, 252 (20. 6 %) chromosomal, 187 (15. 3 %) musculoskeletal, 138 (11. 3 %) digestive, 133 (10. 9 %) urinary, 117 (9. 6 %) nervous, 37 (3. 0 %) respiratory, 35 (2. 9 %) genital, 25 (2 %) anomalies of the eye, ear, face and neck, 20 (1. 6 %) cleft lip/cleft palate and 73 (6. 0 %) others. Time of diagnosis was known for all subjects: 770 (63. 0 %) were diagnosed prenatally and 452 (37. 0 %) were diagnosed at birth or during the first month of life. We found statistically significant differences between groups for several variables. Assisted reproduction techniques (p = 0. 023), maternal medications during the first trimester of pregnancy (p = 0. 004) and the number of anomalies per individual (p ≤ 0. 001) had a statistically significant impact on receiving preN diagnosis. Conclusion: Our data confirm the importance of both RENAC national database and preN diagnosis in improving perinatal healthcare. However, {{in order to determine the}} national prevalence of CAs and understand any involved factors, it is desirable to enhance the notification in the whole country, facilitating the adjustment of national protocols to achieve a better <b>perinatal</b> counseling and <b>surveillance.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} design {{is ideal for}} examining diseases of public health importance, as its inherent temporal nature renders it advantageous for studying early life influences on health outcomes and research questions of aetiological significance. This paper will describe the development and characteristics of the All Our Babies (AOB) study, a prospective pregnancy cohort in Calgary, Alberta, Canada designed to examine determinants of maternal, infant, and child outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators in health care utilization. Methods Women were recruited from health care offices, communities, and through Calgary Laboratory Services before 25 weeks gestation from May 2008 to December 2010. Participants completed two questionnaires during pregnancy, a third at 4 months postpartum, and are currently being followed-up with questionnaires at 12, 24, and 36 months. Data was collected on pregnancy history, demographics, lifestyle, health care utilization, physical and mental health, parenting, and child developmental outcomes and milestones. In addition, biological/serological and genetic markers can be extracted from collected maternal and cord blood samples. Results A total of 4011 pregnant women were eligible for recruitment into the AOB study. Of this, 3388 women completed at least one survey. The majority of participants were less than 35 years of age, Caucasian, Canadian born, married or in a common-law relationship, well-educated, and reported household incomes above the Calgary median. Women who discontinued after the first survey (n= 123) were typically younger, non-Caucasian, foreign-born, had lower education and household income levels, {{were less likely to}} be married or in a common-law relationship, and had poor psychosocial health in early pregnancy. In general, AOB participants reflect the pregnant and parenting population at local and provincial levels, and perinatal indicators from the study are comparable to <b>perinatal</b> <b>surveillance</b> data. Conclusions The extensive and rich data collected in the AOB cohort provides the opportunity to answer complex questions about the relationships between biology, early experiences, and developmental outcomes. This cohort will contribute to the understanding of the biologic mechanisms and social/environmental pathways underlying associations between early and later life outcomes, gene-environment interactions, and developmental trajectories among children. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{incidence}} of preterm birth (PTB), {{and the extent}} to which it results in perinatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is unclear, partly because reliable estimates of gestational age (GA) at birth are lacking. This research: 1) Describes how clinical and ultrasound (US) estimates of gestational age (GA) influence PTB rates and perinatal mortality amongst a population in Kilifi, Kenya; 2) Implements a novel PTB classification system as proof of concept that such systems are feasible in low-income settings, and 3) Presents two novel approaches for estimating GA for women presenting > 24 weeks’ gestation. Methods: Objectives 1) and 2) used a <b>perinatal</b> <b>surveillance</b> platform developed at the KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kilifi, Kenya. Ultrasound (US) was offered for GA estimation in women ≤ 24 weeks’ gestation clinically. To achieve objective 3), two candidate US dating equations were derived by combining a machine learning algorithm with polynomial regression analyses. Lastly, an entirely automated model with the capacity to estimate GA using computational image analysis of the fetal cerebral cortex was developed and tested. Results: 1) Between November 2011 and July 2013, 3630 women presented for antenatal care, 1107 women had US and data were available for 950 (86 %) of these. The PTB rate by US (US-GA) was 10. 0 % compared to 17. 1 % by a best clinical estimate of GA (C-GA), although the number of perinatal deaths that were preterm by US and C-GA were similar; 2) Implementation of a novel PTB classification system is feasible, and 3) New dating equations and an automated model provide estimates in the 3 rd trimester with a prediction error at 34 weeks of 12. 4 and 14. 2 days, respectively. Conclusion: Clinical estimates of GA significantly overestimate the rate of PTBs. Despite this, the proportion of perinatal deaths in those identified as preterm by clinical and US methods was similar, suggesting that US may be a better predictor of PTB and its associated mortality. Novel dating methods can estimate GA at 34 weeks’ gestation with an error equivalent to that provided by routine clinical methods at 22 weeks’. This has important implications and may extend capacity to provide GA estimates amongst a large group of women whose birth phenotypes remain poorly described.
