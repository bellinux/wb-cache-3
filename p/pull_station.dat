Devices for manual fire alarm activation are installed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated. They are usually actuated by means of physical interaction, such as pulling a lever or breaking glass.|$|R

The ATP will test the Fire Alarm Control Panels, Flow Alarm Pressure Switch, Heat Detectors, Smoke Detectors, Flow Switches, Manual <b>Pull</b> <b>Stations,</b> and Gong/Door By Pass Switches...|$|R
5000|$|Initiating devices: These {{components}} act {{as inputs}} {{to the fire}} alarm control unit and are either manually or automatically activated. Examples would be devices such as <b>pull</b> <b>stations,</b> heat detectors, and smoke detectors. Heat and smoke detectors have different categories of both kinds. Some categories are beam, photoelectric, ionization, aspiration, and duct.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{alarm bells}} {{are divided into}} two categories: {{vibrating}}, and single-stroke. On a vibrating bell, the bell will ring continuously until the power is cut off. When power is supplied to a single-stroke bell, the bell will ring once and then stop. It will not ring again until power is turned off and on again. These were frequently used with coded <b>pull</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fire-Lite {{was founded}} in 1952 by Edward Levy, along with his son, Herbert. At the time, the company {{installed}} and serviced fire alarm systems. However, Levy {{began to focus on}} designing his own components, and in 1962, the company stopped installing and servicing systems. By 1973, the company had grown substantially, and moved into a new 50000 sq ft building. Fire-Lite was the first company to introduce a compact, inexpensive addressable fire alarm control panel. Some of their recognizable products include the Fire-Lite BG-10 <b>pull</b> <b>station,</b> introduced in 1983, and the newer BG-12 <b>pull</b> <b>station,</b> introduced in 1993. Fire-Lite is part of the Honeywell Life Safety Group, along with Notifier.|$|E
50|$|Operation - Activation of a {{fire alarm}} {{initiating}} device, or a manual <b>pull</b> <b>station,</b> signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flows from all sprinklers simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|The {{system of}} {{classification}} {{comes from the}} old tradition of using <b>pull</b> <b>stations</b> to alert the local departments to a fire in their area. The [...] "box" [...] would {{send a message to}} all local stations by telegraph that there was a fire, indicating the location as a number: (station area)-(box number), e.g., 2-11. Fires are still dispatched as [...] "box alarms," [...] following this tradition, with maps broken up into a grid of [...] "box areas." ...|$|R
50|$|Resetting a {{fire alarm}} <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> {{after it has}} been {{operated}} normally requires building personnel or emergency responders to open the station using a key, which often is either a hex key or a more traditional key. Opening the station causes the handle to go back to its original position, allowing the alarm to be reset from the fire alarm control panel after the station has been closed.|$|E
5000|$|Many modern {{fire alarm}} pull {{stations}} are single action and only require {{the user to}} pull down the handle to sound the alarm. Other fire alarm pull stations are dual-action, and as such require the user to perform a second task before pulling down, such as lifting up or pushing in a panel on the station or shattering a glass panel with an attached hammer. Perhaps the most recognizable <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> is the T-bar pull, so named because the handle is shaped like the letter [...] "T". This style is manufactured by many companies.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm <b>pull</b> <b>station,</b> which signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fire" [...] or [...] "General Alarm". This {{indicator}} is lit when an alarm condition {{exists in the}} system, initiated by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler flow switches, manual pull stations, manual call points, or otherwise. Along with the indicator on the panel, notification appliances, such as horns and strobes, are also activated, signaling a need to evacuate to building occupants. In an alarm condition, the fire alarm panel indicates where the alarm originated. The alarm panel can be reset once the device which initiated the alarm is reset, such as returning the handle of a manual <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> to its normal position.|$|E
50|$|This resets {{the panel}} after an alarm condition. All {{initiating}} devices are reset, and {{the panel is}} cleared of any alarm conditions. If an initiating device is still in alarm after the system is reset, such as a smoke detector continuing to sense smoke or a manual <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> still in an activated position, another alarm will be initiated, or in some cases, the panel will refuse to reset until all the alarms have been reset/cleared. A system reset is often required to clear supervisory conditions. A system reset does not usually clear trouble conditions. Most trouble conditions will clear automatically when conditions are returned to normal.|$|E
50|$|The Cherry Grove Fire Department (CGFD) {{is a low}} {{incident}} department. The CGFD {{also has}} pull stations located at every other street corner where unique hose houses contain vital equipment that would be needed by the members to suppress any fire; {{this is due to}} the unique nature of Cherry Grove. There are no roads, only boardwalks, hence no ability to respond with a fire engine. If a fire or emergency is spotted, one should call 911 or run to the nearest street corner and pull the lever down. A fire siren is activated, which alerts the members to respond. CGFD is one of the few fire departments in New York that still uses a manual <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the usual}} tripod-based torch firing methods, the PWF Immersion Process uses a mounted, {{inexpensive}} stationary torch and heating the unwashed cold metal in the flame using a welding tig rod (stainless steel mandrel). The heated metal is then immersed {{directly into the}} powdered enamel (Thompson Enamel 80 mesh opaque or transparent), then reheating and repeating the immersion process three times - a total {{of no more than}} 60-90 seconds per piece. Using Lewis’ patent pending Bead <b>Pulling</b> <b>Station,</b> the thrice-coated enamel bead is then gently pulled from the mandrel and allowed to fall into a simple bread pan filled with garden vermiculite.|$|R

5000|$|Coded panels {{were the}} {{earliest}} type of central fire alarm control, and were {{made during the}} 1800s to the 1970s. A coded panel is similar in many ways to a modern conventional panel (described below), except each zone was connected to its own code wheel ( [...] i.e. An alarm in zone 1 would sound code 1-2-4 the bells or horns in the building, while zone 2 would sound 1-2-5), which, depending {{on the way the}} panel was set up, would either do sets of four rounds of code until the initiating <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> was reset (similar to a coded <b>pull</b> <b>station)</b> or run continuously until the panel itself was reset. Large panels could take up an entire wall in a mechanical room, with dozens of code wheels. Lists of codes had to be maintained, sometimes with copies posted above pull stations (this setup is commonly seen in older wings of hospitals). Smaller panels could be set up in one of two ways. Most of the time, the panel would only have one zone, and therefore, only one code. Common one-zone codes were 4-4-0 and 17-0-0 (which is similar to the 120 bpm March Time setting used on later panels, which has in turn been replaced with an interrupted four count uniform temporal code 3 pattern used since 1996). Alternatively, the panel could be made with no code wheels, using only what was called the gong relay. Normally, this would be used in a system with coded pull stations to re-transmit the coding strikes from the pulls. However, it could also be used as its own zone, with the connected horns or bells sounding continuously instead of in a particular code. These panels are not common today, but can sometimes be found in older buildings such as those on college campuses or hospitals.|$|E
5000|$|Faraday {{was founded}} in 1875 in Brooklyn, New York. In the early 1900s, the company was owned by Stanley & Patterson, an {{electrical}} supplies conglomerate. Around this time, Faraday began producing notification appliances, such as bells, horns, buzzers, etc. They also rebranded coded fire alarm stations from Holtzer-Cabot. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Faraday was known as [...] "Sperti-Faraday", and the company moved to Adrian, Michigan. From the late 1960s up until present, many companies rebranded Faraday's popular line of notification appliances, including Simplex, Standard Electric Time Company, Pyrotronics, Gamewell, FCI, and more. In 1978, Faraday bought out Standard Electric Time, and around the same time, moved its location to Tecumseh, Michigan. In 1977, Faraday bought out S.H. Couch, and still continues to manufacture the iconic F1G [...] "Chevron" [...] <b>pull</b> <b>station,</b> originally designed by Couch in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{fire alarm}} {{activation}} is typically achieved {{through the use}} of a <b>pull</b> <b>station</b> (USA & Canada) or call point (Europe, Australia, Asia and Germany), which then sounds the evacuation alarm for the relevant building or zone. Manual fire alarm activation requires human intervention, as distinct from automatic fire alarm activation such as that provided {{through the use of}} heat detectors and smoke detectors. It is, however, possible for call points/pull stations to be used in conjunction with automatic detection as part of an overall fire detection and alarm system. Systems in completed buildings tend to be wired in and to include a control panel. Systems for use during construction can also be wireless or mechanical, however it is recommended by the Structural Timber Association in the UK that for timber-framed constructions, interconnecting wireless systems be used.|$|E
