In this work, the effect of loading rate and hydrogen content on the fracture behaviour of a Zr- 2. 5 Nb alloy pressure tube was investigated between 25 and 300 degrees C. For the as received material, the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> only had an effect on fracture toughness at 25 degrees C whereas for. hydrided material the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> affected fracture toughness in the transition regime. For all pulling rates, hydrided materials showed typical S curve behavior with an increase in lower shelf, upper shelf and transition temperature with <b>pulling</b> <b>rate.</b> The number of axial splits on fracture surfaces increased with an increase in the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> and a decrease in temperature and fracture toughness was found to decrease with an increase in the number of axial splits. The reduction in fracture toughness is attributed to a localised deformation between axial splits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{sequential}} modular computational scheme {{has been}} proposed for the calculation of temperature profiles in the melt and crystal including the melt-crystal interface shape and the crystal <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> for a fixed crystal radius.

However, the low redox stability and tendency towards oxidation impose certain limitations on the conditions, where Fe 3 O 4 can be successfully used. A possibility to control and prevent oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 thus represents an important challenge for materials engineering. In the present work, the laser floating zone (LFZ) method was employed to produce Fe 3 O 4 fibres using hematite (Fe 2 O 3) as a precursor material. Different growth conditions, namely <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> in the range 10 - 400 mm/h, were studied. The prepared fibres showed a core/shell structure, where the core is isolated by a shell of Fe 2 O 3. The <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> was found to be a crucial growth parameter to control the crystalline nature of the fibres, particularly, the thickness of the shell. Increasing the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> favours the formation Fe 2 O 3 phase and, thus, decreases the width of shell isolating phase. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to identify the presence of Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 phases. The morphology and phase distribution of the grown fibres were analyzed by optical microscopy. Electrical properties of the fibres were measured at various temperatures, to understand the influence of <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> on the fibres shell.

Both the one- and two-dimensional heat transfer models show that heat loss from the melt is dominated by conduction into the crystal and slow heat release to the ambient {{along the length of the}} ribbon. The limiting <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> results from the reduced efficiency of conduction through the melt caused by the curvature of the meniscus which increases height of the die top above the level of the melt.

Cell membranes {{have a limited}} elastic range of 3 – 4 % strain but are protected from direct stretch during physiological loading by their membrane reservoir, an intricate pattern of membrane folds. Using a finite-element model, we suggested previously that access to the membrane reservoir is strain-rate-dependent and that during impact loading, the accessible membrane reservoir is drastically decreased, so that strains applied to chondrocytes are directly transferred to cell membranes, which fail when strains exceed 3 – 4 %. However, experimental support for this proposal is lacking.
