60|$|An object, {{in reality}} of a white colour but {{apparently}} dark, owing to its being shaded, shows the play of a mirror's flash better than any other. The play of a flash, sent through an open window, {{on the walls of}} a room, can be seen at upwards of 100 yards. It is a good object by which to adjust my hand heliostat, which I describe below. Two bits of paper and a couple of sticks, arranged as in the drawing, serve pretty well to direct a flash. Sight the distant object through the holes in the two bits of paper, A and B, at the ends of the horizontal stick; and when you are satisfied that the stick is properly adjusted and quite steady, take your mirror and throw the shadow of A upon B, and further endeavour to throw the white speck in the shadow of A, corresponding to its <b>pin-hole</b> in it, through the centre of the hole in B.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{fabrication of}} ceramic separation membranes, the particulate sols are applied onto porous supports. Major structural deficiencies under this approach are <b>pin-holes</b> and cracks, and the dramatic losses of flux when pore sizes {{are reduced to}} enhance selectivity. We have overcome these structural deficiencies by constructing hierarchically structured separation layer on a porous substrate using lager titanate nanofibers and smaller boehmite nanofibers. This yields a radical change in membrane texture. The resulting membranes effectively filter out species larger than 60 nm at flow rates orders of magnitude greater than conventional membranes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the behaviour of diamond coatings when subjected to solid particle erosion from sand particles. The coatings were deposited by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto tungsten substrates and tested using a high velocity air-sand erosion test facility. The erosion tests were conducted using particle impact velocities of between 33 and 268 m s- 1. Examination of the eroded test specimens showed that the principal damage features observed were circumferential cracks and <b>pin-holes.</b> Comparison with Hertz impact theory revealed that the measured circumferential crack diameters were more than double the predicted Hertzian contact diameter. Moreover, a trend of increasing circumferential crack diameter with coating thickness, which is not predicted by Hertz, was found. Instead, the crack diameters showed good agreement with those predicted by the theory of stress wave reinforcement, which is more commonly associated with liquid impact damage of brittle materials. During impact, the bulk compression and shear waves are reflected at the rear surface of debonded regions of the coating to return to the front surface and reinforce the Rayleigh surface wave, which generates a tensile stress. Where this stress exceeds the local tensile strength of the coating, a ring of cracks surrounding the area of impact is created. This hypothesis was supported by images acquired using scanning acoustic microscopy, which showed that circumferential cracks and <b>pin-holes</b> were only found on areas of the coating that had become delaminated by multiple particle impacts during the erosion tests...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} failure {{mechanisms}} for an electrochemical sensor consisting of {{an array of}} microlithographically fabricated iridium ultramicroelectrodes (UME) on a silicon wafer. It has been noted {{that the use of}} these sensors during voltammetric determination of heavy metal ions in the presence of � 0. 1 MCl − results in loss of response and general failure of the sensor. The addition of Hg or Ag to the Cl containing solution caused massive accumulations on the exposed Ir surfaces, which were identified using auger scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under analytical conditions this failure {{does not appear to be}} due to migration of Cl − but to the penetration of Cl − through <b>pin-holes</b> in the insulating layer and subsequent reaction with the Al interconnect traces on the chip. Consequently, the Al traces dissolved and hydrogen gas was evolved. This reaction generates a potential which is transmitted to exposed Ir and consequently metal ions present in the solution are then reduced onto these surfaces. Several insulating layers, SiO 2 (5000 A ˚) and Si 3 N 4 (1500, 2500 and 5000 A ˚) were also used, but failure occurred with all. It is critical that either sub-micron sized <b>pin-holes</b> during the fabrication process be better controlled or that the Al interconnect traces be replaced by Au. The use of Au however may still allow these unwanted micron-sized UMEs to interfere with the electrochemical analysis. © 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
