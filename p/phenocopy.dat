[...] Discovered at Dartmouth Medical School, Cif {{is able to}} alter the trafficking of select ABC transporters in eukaryotic epithelial cells, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and P-glycoprotein by interfering with the host deubiquitinating machinery. By promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CFTR, Cif is able to <b>phenocopy</b> cystic fibrosis at the cellular level.

40|$|<b>Phenocopies</b> may {{confound}} {{the clinical}} diagnoses of hereditary disorders. We report <b>phenocopies</b> in Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), an autosomal dominant disorder, characterised by the combined occurrence of parathyroid, pituitary and pancreatic tumours. We studied 261 affected individuals from 74 families referred with a clinical diagnosis of MEN 1 and sought inconsistencies between the mutational and clinical data. We identified four patients from unrelated families with <b>phenocopies.</b> Patients 1 and 2 from families with MEN 1, developed prolactinomas {{as the sole}} endocrinopathy {{but they did not}} harbour the germline MEN 1 mutation present in their affected relatives. Patient 3, had acromegaly and recurrent hypercalcaemia following parathyroidectomy, whilst patient 4 had parathyroid tumours and a microprolactinoma. Patients 3 and 4 and their relatives did not have MEN 1 mutations, but instead had familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) due to a calcium-sensing receptor mutation (p. Arg 680 Cys), and the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour (HPT-JT) syndrome due to a hyperparathyroidism type 2 deletional-frameshift mutation (c. 1239 delA), respectively. <b>Phenocopies</b> may mimic MEN 1 either by occurrence of a single sporadic endocrine tumour in a patient with familial MEN 1, or occurrence of two endocrine abnormalities associated with different aetiologies. <b>Phenocopies</b> arose in > 5 % of MEN 1 families, and awareness of them is important in the clinical management of MEN 1 and other hereditary disorders...|$|R

50|$|A <b>phenocopy</b> is a {{variation}} in phenotype (generally {{referring to a}} single trait) which is caused by environmental conditions (often, but not necessarily, during the organism's development), such that the organism's phenotype matches a phenotype which is determined by genetic factors.

40|$|Because {{evidence}} from several sources suggests {{the existence of}} a major genetic factor contributing to the risk for breast cancer, there is current interest in searching for genetic linkage between the putative cancer susceptibility gene(s) and polymorphic DNA markers. However, because of high population rates of the nongenetic form of the condition, and because of the possibility of underlying genetic heterogeneity, it is expected that the number of informative families required for detection of linkage will be greater for breast cancer than for other conditions with major genetic components. Computer simulation approaches may be useful in estimating the power of proposed linkage studies. Here we have simulated multiple genotypes for a medium-sized breast-cancer family and have analyzed the generated pedigrees with a linkage program. The effects of possible <b>phenocopies</b> and of genetic heterogeneity were measured by comparing the results obtained when the parameters were varied in the models. When population-based rates for sporadic cases of breast cancer were incorporated, the number of families required to detect linkage was approximately twice that expected in the absence of <b>phenocopies.</b> Incorrect specification of the probability of <b>phenocopies</b> in the analytic model did not materially alter the power of the proposed study, although significant effects on the estimated recombination fractions were noted...|$|R

Three mutant alleles of FDH carrying insertions of the Enhancer/Suppressor-mutator transposon and one stable allele with a transposon footprint were generated in the Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia genetic background. Closer examination of the adaxial epidermis of rosette leaves revealed that in addition to provoking the previously described fusion phenotype in leaves and floral organs, mutations in FDH have a deleterious effect on trichome differentiation. FDH transcripts were detected exclusively in the epidermis of young vegetative and floral organs.

40|$|Holometabolous insects undergo {{complete}} metamorphosis to become sexually mature adults. Metamorphosis is initiated by brain-derived prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which stimulates {{the production of}} the molting hormone ecdysone via an incompletely defined signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate that Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates embryonic terminal cell fate in Drosophila, is the PTTH receptor. Trunk, the embryonic Torso ligand, is related to PTTH, and ectopic expression of PTTH in the embryo partially rescues trunk mutants. In larvae, torso is expressed specifically in the prothoracic gland (PG), and its loss <b>phenocopies</b> the removal of PTTH. The activation of Torso by PTTH stimulates extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and the loss of ERK in the PG <b>phenocopies</b> the loss of PTTH and Torso. We conclude that PTTH initiates metamorphosis by activation of the Torso/ERK pathway. Manyorganisms undergo distinct tempo-ral transitions in morphology as a partof their normal life process. In humans, for example, passage through puberty is accompa-nied by changes in body mass and the acquisition of sexual maturity.

40|$|SummaryThe WNT {{signaling}} enhancer R-spondin 3 (RSPO 3) is prominently {{expressed in}} the vasculature. Correspondingly, embryonic lethality of Rspo 3 -deficient mice is caused by vessel remodeling defects. Yet the mechanisms underlying vascular RSPO 3 function remain elusive. Inducible endothelial Rspo 3 deletion (Rspo 3 -iECKO) resulted in perturbed developmental and tumor vascular remodeling. Endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular pruning led to reduced microvessel density in Rspo 3 -iECKO mice. Rspo 3 -iECKO mice strikingly <b>phenocopied</b> the non-canonical WNT signaling-induced vascular defects of mice deleted for the WNT secretion factor Evi/Wls. An endothelial screen for RSPO 3 and EVI/WLS co-regulated genes identified Rnf 213, Usp 18, and Trim 30 α. RNF 213 targets filamin A and NFAT 1 for proteasomal degradation attenuating non-canonical WNT/Ca 2 + signaling. Likewise, USP 18 and TRIM 5 α inhibited NFAT 1 activation. Consequently, NFAT protein levels were decreased in endothelial cells of Rspo 3 -iECKO mice and pharmacological NFAT inhibition <b>phenocopied</b> Rspo 3 -iECKO mice.

50|$|Most taxa differ morphologically {{from other}} taxa. Typically, closely related taxa differ {{much less than}} more distantly related ones, but there are {{exceptions}} to this. Cryptic species are species which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire a similar appearance {{as a result of}} convergent evolution or even mimicry. In addition, there can be morphological differences within a species, such as in Apoica flavissima where queens are significantly smaller than workers. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear, morphologically speaking, to be two distinct species, may in fact be shown by DNA analysis to be a single species. The significance of these differences can be examined through the use of allometric engineering in which one or both species are manipulated to <b>phenocopy</b> the other species.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} clear links between the {{alteration}} of RhoGDI2 protein levels and disease progression and/or metastasis in several types of cancer, the mechanistic underpinnings of the mode of RhoGDI2 action under carcinogenic cellular conditions are {{only now beginning to}} be understood. Evidence demonstrates that RhoGDI2 inhibits the endothelin axis and crosstalk with macrophages within the micrometastatic microenvironment to inhibit metastatic outgrowth. As such, RhoGDI2 could prove important in the regulation of tumor dormancy. Targeting this axis with orally available endothelin receptor antagonists may prove efficacious in mimicking the inhibitory role of RhoGDI2 by preventing macrophage infiltration into the micrometastatic niche. Recent work has also determined that genetic and pharmacologic targeting of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) or small inducible cytokine A2, its receptor CCR2 and pharmacologic ablation of macrophages can also <b>phenocopy</b> the effect of RhoGDI2 expression to prevent metastatic colonization of the lung67 and that RhoGDI2 is suppressor of versican, a protein that has been shown to promote cell migration and metastasis in several tumor models.|$|E
