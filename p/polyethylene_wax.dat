50|$|Oil pastels were an {{immediate}} commercial success and other manufacturers {{were quick to}} take up the idea, such as Dutch company Talens, who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce western art education to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them Pablo Picasso. In 1947 Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the war conditions, convinced Henri Sennelier, a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 Sennelier produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists. These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese Holbein brand of oil pastel appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Another brand, Caran d'Ache, introduced Neocolor wax crayons onto the market in 1965, using a patented <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax</b> with superior lubrication; in the nineties these were developed into an oil pastel, Neopastel.|$|E

40|$|The barrier {{resistance}} and wettability of papers are commonly {{controlled by the}} application of petroleum-based derivatives such as <b>polyethylene,</b> <b>waxes</b> and/or fluor- derivatives as coating. While surface hydrophobicity is improved by employing these polymers, they have become disfavored due to limitations in fossil-oil resources, poor recyclability, and environmental concerns on generated waste with lack of biodegradation. Alternatively, biopolymers including polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and polyesters {{can be used to}} formulate new pathways for fully bio-based paper coatings. However, difficulties in processing of most biopolymers may arise due to hydrophilicity, crystallization behavior, brittleness or melt instabilities that hinder a full exploitation at industrial scale. Therefore, blending with other biopolymers, plasticizers and compatibilizers is advantageous to improve the coating performance. In this paper, an overview of barrier properties and processing of bio-based polymers and their composites as paper coating will be discussed. In particular, recent technical advances in nanotechnological routes for bio-based nano- composite coatings will be summarized, including the use of biopolymer nanoparticles, or nanofillers such as nanoclay and nanocellulose. The combination of biopolymers along with surface modification of nanofillers can be used to create hierarchical structures that enhance hydrophobicity, complete barrier protection and functionalities of coated papers...|$|R

In this study, two commercial WMA additives, a proprietary siloxane-based compound and an oxidized <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax,</b> were added to a soft Roofing Asphalt Flux (RAF), a soft Recycled Engine Oil Bottom (REOB) tainted binder, and a somewhat harder binder containing 20 % oxidized asphalt derived from Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Binders were aged according to standard Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) protocols. Selected compositions were subjected to a period of extended PAV aging for 40 h. Standard and advanced rheological and failure tests were used to predict the performance of these binders in service. Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) tests according to Superpave™ protocols were done to determine performance grades. Extended BBR (EBBR) and Double-Edge-Notched Tension (DENT) tests were done to provide further insights into durability and strain tolerance, properties of utmost importance to assure long term pavement performance. The findings of this study show that the addition of the oxidized <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax</b> WMA additive to REOB and/or RAP tainted systems can provide binders that are unstable and likely prone to premature and excessive low temperature failure in service.
