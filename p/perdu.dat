25|$|Duteurtre's first novel, Sommeil <b>Perdu,</b> {{is about}} a {{depressed}} young man leaving his hometown to live in Paris.

25|$|Truffaut {{would often}} stay {{with friends and}} try {{to be out of the}} house as much as possible. His best friend {{throughout}} his youth and until his death was Robert Lachenay, who was the inspiration for the character René Bigey in The 400 Blows and would work as an assistant on some of Truffaut's films. It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, Abel Gance's Paradis <b>Perdu</b> (Paradise Lost) from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.|$|E

500|$|Olivier <b>Perdu,</b> a {{professor}} of Egyptology at the Collège de France, states that biographies {{did not exist in}} ancient Egypt, and that commemorative writing should be considered autobiographical. Edward L. Greenstein, Professor of Bible at the Tel Aviv University and Bar-Ilan University, disagrees with Perdu's terminology, stating that the ancient world produced no [...] "autobiographies" [...] in the modern sense, and these should be distinguished from 'autobiographical' texts of the ancient world. However, both <b>Perdu</b> and Greenstein assert that autobiographies of the ancient Near East should not be equated with the modern concept of autobiography.|$|E
500|$|Marcel Proust {{similarly}} {{learned from}} the Realist example; he adored Balzac and studied his works carefully, although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac's [...] "vulgarity". Balzac's story Une Heure de ma Vie (An Hour of my Life, 1822), in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections, is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in À la recherche du temps <b>perdu.</b> However, Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was [...] "madness." ...|$|E
500|$|The form {{started as}} a simple ballad-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem [...] "Villanelle (J'ay <b>perdu</b> ma Tourterelle)" [...] (1606) by Jean Passerat. From this point, its {{evolution}} into the [...] "fixed form" [...] {{used in the present}} day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend which began in the late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.|$|E
500|$|The fixed-form villanelle, {{containing}} the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from Jean Passerat's poem [...] "Villanelle (J'ay <b>perdu</b> ma Tourterelle)", published in 1606. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1993) {{suggests that this}} became the standard [...] "villanelle" [...] when prosodists such as César-Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem. This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin's additions to Richelet's Dictionnaire de rimes that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet Théodore de Banville; his creation of a parody to Passerat's [...] "J'ay perdu..." [...] would lead Wilhelm Ténint and others {{to think that the}} villanelle was an antique form.|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} Acton's reply, Waugh heard {{that his brother}} Alec had {{arranged}} a job for him based in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff who {{was working on the}} first English translation of Marcel Proust's novel sequence À la recherche du temps <b>perdu.</b> Waugh promptly resigned his position at Arnold House, in anticipation of [...] "a year abroad drinking Chianti under olive trees." [...] Then came Acton's [...] "polite but chilling" [...] response to The Temple at Thatch. This letter has not survived; its wording was recalled by Waugh 40 years later, in his biography A Little Learning. Acton wrote that the story was [...] "too English for my exotic taste ... too much nid-nodding over port." [...] He recommended, facetiously, that the book be printed [...] "in a few elegant copies for the friends who love you", and gave a list of the least elegant of their mutual acquaintances. Many years later Acton wrote of the story: [...] "It was an airy Firbankian trifle, totally unworthy of Evelyn, and I brutally told him so. It was a misfired jeu d'esprit.|$|E
500|$|On {{the way out}} of Hades, Euridice {{is delighted}} to be {{returning}} to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her, does not explain anything to her. She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: [...] "Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte"/"Viens, suis un époux"). Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo's supposed infidelity in the aria [...] "Che fiero momento"/"Fortune ennemie" [...] (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?"/"J’ai <b>perdu</b> mon Eurydice" [...] ("What shall I do without Euridice?"/"I have lost my Euridice") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: [...] "Tendre Amour"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore ("Trionfi Amore"). In the 1774 version, the chorus ("L’Amour triomphe") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.|$|E

2500|$|While most {{scholars}} such as Kenneth Kitchen have equated Manetho's Tefnakht with the king Shepsesre Tefnakht of Sais who is attested by the Year 8 Athens donation stela, a recent article by Olivier <b>Perdu</b> has suggested that this Tefnakht was rather Tefnakht II, a much later king of Sais who ruled in the mid-680's BCE during the late Nubian 25th Dynasty. In his paper, <b>Perdu</b> published a newly discovered stela dating from {{the second year of}} Necho I's reign, which he contends is similar in style, text and content to the Year 8 stela of Shepsesre Tefnakht. <b>Perdu,</b> thus, infers that these two kings of Sais—Necho I and Tefnakht II—were close contemporaries. However, his arguments are not currently accepted by most Egyptian {{scholars such as}} Dan'el Kahn or Kenneth Kitchen who still believe that the Year 8 Athens stela of king Shepsesre Tefnakht likely belongs to Tefnakht I rather than a hypothethical Tefnakht II who would then have assumed power in 685 BC at Sais—early during the reign of Taharqa, {{one of the most powerful}} Nubian rulers of Egypt. Kahn has also stressed at an Egyptological Conference at Leiden that Perdu's epigraphic criteria here in the famed Athens stela—such as the use of the tripartite wig, the method through which the falcon-headed god keeps his head upright in the same stela and on temple wall reliefs contemporary with Tefnakht I's time, the decoration of the stela scene: Heaven supported by wAs scepters--appear already in use in the 24th or early 25th Nubian dynasty during Piye, Shabaka or Bakenranef's reign. The invisible back side of the tripartite wig can be found on the donation stela of Shebitku from Pharbaitos and on the Bakenranef/Bocchoris vase dating to the last days of Piye and the beginning of Shabaka--all appear close in time to the presumed reign of Tefnakht I. Moreover, the head of the falcon-headed god Horus is, as <b>Perdu</b> himself noted, similar in style to the stela of Tefnakht, chief of the Meshwesh and Piye's chief rival.|$|E
