Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools.

Depending on the materials used for Braille, it can be formed or printed in different ways: embossing, screen printing, thermoforming, digital printing. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of thermal properties of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder on the qualitative parameters of Braille. Screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder were chosen for the research. Carrying out the qualitative analysis of printouts with Braille, the thermal stability was evaluated by analyzing the thermograms obtained with derivatograph Q- 1500. This paper presents the findings of the thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of printouts printed on paperboard Plike and using traditional screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder. Based on the testing findings it is determined that thermal stability of printouts <b>printed</b> with thermo-powder <b>ink</b> is higher than printed with screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks.</b> It is determined that the appropriate temperature range of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder drying is 98 ºC – 198 ºC because in this case better relief of Braille dots is obtained.

25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or {{soft lithography}} {{is analogous to}} <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> with a rubber stamp. The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped elastomeric stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its elastomeric properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low surface energy, γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{printing}} technique employed with the Bureau triangle issues of 1894, the paper used to print the Washington-Franklin issues was first dampened so that <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> would be absorbed more thoroughly and evenly. However, {{this resulted in}} paper shrinkage when the sheets of stamps dried, causing the rows of stamps to be drawn closer together. As the flat printing plates for this issue had individual stamp impressions spaced 2mm apart the resulting dried sheet would leave stamps spaced about 1½ mm apart, making {{it very difficult to}} line up rows of perforations accurately between the rows of stamps. Many sheets were issued with perforations somewhat off center, while roughly 20% of the sheets emerged with perforations so off-center that they were deemed unsalable and had to be destroyed. Paper shrinkage would lead the Bureau to try various approaches to the problem in the following issues. Finding well-centered stamps with wide margins in any denomination in this early issue is a challenge for the collector and well centered examples command prices that far exceed average catalog values.|$|E

25|$|In {{a letter}} of November 1937, to art {{historian}} Gunnar Jungmarker (1902–1983) at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals {{that he is in}} an artistic crisis. The black and white woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between black and white surfaces. It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary black <b>printing</b> <b>ink.</b> Gunnar Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: grisaille woodcut. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the black and white key block. These first free grisaille woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self-perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining grisaille woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).|$|E

2500|$|When printing, {{the stone}} is kept wet with water. Naturally {{the water is}} {{attracted}} to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. <b>Printing</b> <b>ink</b> based on drying oils such as linseed oil and varnish loaded with pigment is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.|$|E
2500|$|Lithography uses simple {{chemical}} processes {{to create an}} image. [...] For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("hydrophobic") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("hydrophilic"). [...] Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image after it is etched {{with a mixture of}} gum arabic and acid then subsequently replaced with asphaltum stabilizing the drawing. This allows a flat print plate or stone to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., intaglio printing, letterpress printing).|$|E

2500|$|The 1917–20 {{series was}} {{perforated}} 11 and included all the denominations {{found in the}} two preceding series, but added three new Franklin-heads of 13-cents, 2 and 5-dollars. The two higher denominations appeared late in this issue as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was busy replacing worn printing plates and dealing with various experiments and innovations that delayed production of the 2 & 5 dollar plates. Perhaps to identify these stamps as luxury items, they were printed in two tones, with the vignette head in black and the frame in color. They were further distinguished from lower values by their use of landscape format rather than the normal portrait orientation. Because the 2 & 5 dollar Franklin-head stamps were the two largest denominations they are often referred to by collectors as the 'Big Bens'. The 2-dollar Franklin {{was intended to be}} printed in carmine-red and black, but somehow the color of the <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> from the particular lot that was used turned out to have a distinct orange tone. [...] in <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> is somewhat common in stamp production, but the variance in this case ventured into a different color completely—orange. By the time this acute color variance was {{brought to the attention of}} officials a good number of sheets had already been distributed among the various post offices and were most likely already in circulation. In 1920 a second printing of the 2-dollar Franklin was issued, this time with the colors that were originally intended, carmine-red and black. These were printed and remained in use for some 3 to 4 years and therefore quantities of the red and black variety out number the orange and black approximately 15 to 1. Quantities issued are, for 2-dollar orange and black, 47,700 (470 sheets of 100), and 2-dollar carmine-red and black, 743,600 (7,436 sheets of 100).|$|E

Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book Finger Prints.

2500|$|Lithography {{works because}} of the mutual {{repulsion}} of oil and water. The image is drawn {{on the surface of}} the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the lipid content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous solution of gum arabic, weakly acidified with nitric acid [...] is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of calcium nitrate salt, , and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces. The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the <b>printing</b> <b>ink.</b> Using lithographic turpentine, the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century the art of {{engraving}} on wood had fallen into disuse. Writing circa 1770, Horace Walpole {{goes so far as to}} say that it [...] "never was executed in any perfection in England;" [...] and, speaking afterwards of Papillon's [...] "Traite de la Gravure," [...] 1766, he takes occasion to doubt if that author would ever [...] "persuade the world to return to wooden cuts." [...] Nevertheless, with Bewick, a few years later, wood-engraving took a fresh departure so conspicuous that it amounts to a revival. In what this consisted it is clearly impossible to show here with any sufficiency of detail; but between the method of the old wood-cutters who reproduced the drawings of Durer, and the method of the Newcastle artist, there are two marked and well-defined differences. One of these is a difference in the preparation of the wood and the tool employed. The old wood-cutters carved their designs with knives and chisels on strips of wood sawn lengthwise--that is to say, upon the PLANK; Bewick used a graver, and worked upon slices of box or pear cut across the grain,--that is to say upon the END of the wood. The other difference, of which Bewick is said to have been the inventor, is less easy to describe. It consisted in the employment of what is technically known as [...] "white line." [...] In all antecedent wood-cutting the cutter had simply cleared away those portions of the block left bare by the design, so that the design remained in relief to be printed from like type. Using the smooth box block as a uniform surface from which, if covered with <b>printing</b> <b>ink,</b> a uniformly black impression might be obtained, Bewick, by cutting white lines across it at greater or lesser intervals, produced gradations of shade, from the absolute black of the block to the lightest tints. The general result of this method was to give a greater depth of colouring and variety to the engraving, but its advantages may perhaps be best understood by a glance at the background of the [...] "Woodcock" [...] on the following page.|$|E
60|$|Lithograph Maps.--It may add {{greatly to}} the {{interest}} which a traveller will take in drawing up a large and graphic route-map of his journey, if he knows the extreme ease and cheapness with which copies of such a map may be multiplied to any extent by a well-known process in lithography: for these being distributed among persons interested {{in the country where}} he has travelled, will prevent his painstaking from being lost to the world. Sketches and bird'[S-eye views may be multiplied in the same manner. The method to which I refer is the so-called Anastatic process; the materials can be obtained, with full instructions, at any lithographer's shop, and consist of autographic ink and paper. The paper has been prepared by being glazed over with a composition, and the ink is in appearance something like Indian ink, and used in much the same way. With an ordinary pen, with this ink, and upon this paper, the traveller draws his map; they are neither more nor less difficult to employ than common stationery, and he may avail himself of tracing-paper without danger. He has one single precaution to guard against, which is, not to touch the paper overmuch with his bare and, but to keep a bit of loose paper between it and the map as he draws. As soon as it is finished, the map is taken to a lithographer, who puts it face downwards on a stone, and passes it under his press, when every particle of ink leaves the surface of the paper and attaches itself {{to the surface of the}} stone, precisely as though it had originally been written there; the glaze on the paper, which prevents the ink from soaking into it, makes this transference more easy and complete. The stone can now be worked with, just as a stone that has been regularly lithographed in the usual manner; that is to say, <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> may be rubbed over it and impressions may be taken off in any number. It will be observed that the writing on the paper is reversed upon the stone, and is re-reversed, or set right again, in the impressions that are taken from it. The lithographer's charges for furnishing autographic ink and paper, working the stone, striking off fifty copies of a folio size, and supplying the paper (common white paper) for the copies--in fact every expense included--need not exceed ten shillings, and may be much less. If before drawing his map the traveller were to go to some working lithographer and witness the process, and make two or three experiments in a small way, he would naturally succeed all the better. A map drawn on a large scale, though without any pretension to artistic skill, with abundance of profile views of prominent landmarks, and copious information upon the routes that were explored, written along their sides, would be of the utmost value to future travellers, and to geographers at home.|$|E
