Two groups (n = 60) were defined {{depending on the type of}} <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restoration</b> needed: 1) single unit porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crowns (SCs) and 2) 3 - to 4 -unit PFM fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), with 1 healthy and 1 endodontically treated and fiber post-restored abutment. Within each group, samples were divided into 2 subgroups (n = 30) according to the amount of residual coronal tissues after abutment buildup and final preparation: A) > 50 % of coronal residual structure or B) equal to or < 50 % of coronal residual structure. The clinical outcome was assessed based on clinical and intraoral radiographic examinations at the recalls after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 84 mo. Data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and Cox regression analysis (P < 0. 05). The overall 7 -y survival rate of ETT restored with fiber post and either SCs or FDPs was 69. 2 %. The highest 84 -mo survival rate was recorded in group 1 A (90 %), whereas teeth in group 2 B exhibited the lowest performance (56. 7 % survival rate). The log-rank test detected statistically significant differences in survival rates among the groups (P = 0. 048).

40|$|Electric {{potentials}} {{occurring in}} the oral cavity deserve attention as they may cause various diseases and subjective feelings, which {{are very difficult to}} treat. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the electric potentials within the oral cavity in patients with metal fillings and metal <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations,</b> after using a pulsed electromagnetic field. The study was carried out on 84 patients. The Viofor JPS Classic device was used in the treatment. It generates a pulsed electromagnetic field with low induction of the extremely low frequency (ELF) range. Average values of electric potentials in the preliminary test were about the same in both groups; they were 148. 8 mV and 145. 5 mV. After another appliance of ELF fields there was found a steady decline in the average value of electric potentials in the study group. This decrease was statistically highly significant, while mean values of electric potentials in the control group were characterized by a slightly upward tendency. The obtained statistically significant reduction of electric potentials in the oral cavity of patients having metal fillings and metal <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations,</b> after application of the Viofor JPS Classic device, implies a huge impact of ELF pulsed electromagnetic field on inhibition of electrochemical processes, as well as on inhibition of dental alloy corrosion. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} is to compare two methods for {{evaluating}} the marginal fit of fixed <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations.</b> For this purpose we used a milled ceramic material, out of which we obtained class I inlays. The marginal gap was analyzed using micro CT and electronic microscopy. Materials and methods: After extraction of four caries-free mandibular first molars, first class inlay cavities were prepared. The marginal gap was analyzed circumferentially at the occlusal margin using a Bruker micro CT, by measuring the distance at the occlusal limit of the cavities, between the restoration and the tooth in several points for every surface of each tooth before cementing. For the second method SEM technology was used, and measurements were made at the occlusal limit of the cavities, between the restoration and the tooth in 50 microns steps. The data were compared with One–way ANOVA with Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test performed using 5. 00 for Windows (GraphPad Prism 5. 00 Software, San Diego, California USA). Results and discussion: For both methods we obtained clinical acceptable values of the marginal gap for the milled ceramic inlays. The null hypothesis was rejected. We obtained statistical significant differences of the measured gaps using the two above mentioned methods. Conclusions: Both evaluation methods are reliable for measuring the marginal gap of fixed <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations,</b> each method having specific indications, advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The present {{systematic}} review aimed at assessing {{data from the}} literature on endodontic and prosthetic complications in endodontically treated teeth restored with fiber posts and single crowns (SCs) or fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Available randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating endodontic and prosthetic complications in the teeth treated with fiber posts and restored with different <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations</b> were reviewed. PubMed, Evidence-Based Dentistry, BMJ Clinical Evidence, Embase, DynaMed, and gray literature restricted to scientific literature were analyzed; also, manual researches were performed. English language and time filters (from 1990 to 2015) were used. RESULTS: The database search produced 4230 records, {{many of which were}} duplicates. The manual research did not produce any other relevant article. After duplications were removed, all the selected databases produced 3670 records. Reading titles and abstracts, two independent reviewers excluded 3664 reports. The full-texts of the remaining six reports were read. Only four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this {{systematic review}}. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently reported failures in the available studies were as follows: fiber post debonding, loss of retention of single crowns, and marginal gaps.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{fabrication}} and the investigation of modified bioceramics, with possibilities of growth of complex biological structures, suitable for dental fixed <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations.</b> Three groups of materials were studied for the achievement of the aim: a. the primary materials (three types of dental porcelains, bioactive glass in the system SiO 2 -CaO-Na 2 O-P 2 O 5 and commercial hydroxyapatite), b. composite materials aimed to the reinforcement of the bioactive glass (bioactive glass-commercial hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass-alumina) and c. mixtures (dental porcelain-bioactive glass, dental porcelain-bioactive glass- commercial hydroxyapatite, dental porcelain-bioactive glass-alumina). All samples were characterized before and after the application of appropriate thermal treatments. The characterization of the materials was performed by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffractometry, Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA), Transmittance Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS). Moreover, the bioactive behavior of the materials was investigated through the immersion in the Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). For each soaking time the surface of the samples was characterized in order to be studied the ability of the formation of the biological hydroxyapatite (HCAp) layer on it. The mixture: dental porcelain IPS Classic 50 % - commercial hydroxyapatite 35 % - bioactive glass 15 % (C-HAp) was found as the most convenient for the modification of dental ceramics, suitable for dental fixed <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations.</b> This mixture presents formation of the HCAp layer after 20 days of immersion in SBF, which is the fastest time of growth that is observed among the modified surfaces.

40|$|PURPOSE: In {{the last}} decade, several {{investigators}} reported that standard-diameter implants (SDIs) achieved excellent results. However, no report is available regarding SDIs inserted into fresh-frozen bone (FFB). We conducted a retrospective study {{on a series}} of SDIs (diameter, 3. 75 mm) inserted into homologous FFB to evaluate their clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SDIs inserted with FFB were analyzed. Several variables were investigated regarding patients, anatomic sites, implants, and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restoration.</b> Implant failure and peri-implant bone resorption were considered predictors of clinical outcome. A Kaplan-Meier algorithm and Cox regression were performed to detect those variables statistically associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three SDIs were inserted in 41 patients. Implant length ranged from 10 to 15 mm. Implants were inserted to replace 6 incisors, 13 cuspids, 60 premolars, and 54 molars. The mean follow-up was 23 months. Only 1 of 133 implants was lost (ie, survival rate= 99. 2 %), and no differences were detected among study variables. On the contrary, crestal bone resorption correlates with type of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restoration,</b> with a better outcome for removable dentures. CONCLUSION: The SDIs had high survival and success rates, similar to those reported in previous studies of 2 -stage procedures in nongrafted bone.

40|$|Scope of the study: Analysis of the biomechanical {{aspects of}} the implanto‐prosthetic {{structures}} for planning the treatment in cases of total edentation. Materials and method: The study was performed in the Clinics of Prosthetics and Oral Implantology, Military Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, {{on a group of}} mandibularly totally edentated patients. Planning of the implanto‐pros‐ thetic treatment had in view the peculiarities of total man‐ dibular edentation and observance of the biomechanical principles. Selection of the type of occlusion restoration considered the presence of parafunctions {{and the nature of the}} antagonistic arch. Special attention was paid to the direction and intensity of the forces acting in the region of the future prosthetic work. When bruxism was manifested, its preimplantary removal was compulsory. Results and discussion: In fixed prosthetic restaurati‐ ons applied on implants, distribuition of forces obviously depend on the quality of osteo‐acceptance, as well, and also on the elasticity degree of the prosthetic work. In the case of mobilized <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations</b> supported on implants, rigidization of implants from the anterior region of the mandible may be obtained by means of a bar. In decreasing order of their elasticity, the materials employed are: acrylate, composites, noble and seminoble alloys, other metals, ceramics. Ceramics confers maximum stability to implants, yet without redeeming the forces. For amortizing the forces and for a progressive charging of the implants, it is recommended that the first (temporary) <b>prosthetic</b> <b>restorations</b> should be made of either acrylate or compo‐ sites.
