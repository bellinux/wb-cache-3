40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} reasons for non–payment by residents for services rendered by the Vhembe District Municipality. The municipalities are responsible for delivering such services as water supply, electricity, road maintenance, refuse collection and sanitation. Multistage sampling techniques were employed.

In this case the municipalities that took part in the study were selected first, followed by wards, villages and households. Households in the selected villages were selected randomly to participate in the study. The results showed that although the municipalities were making an effort to raise and send bills to the residents, the residents were not forthcoming with payments.

In Study 1, a two-wave study of 177 employees of a university medical center in the United States, the authors find stable thresholds of about 5. 0 percent for positive reactions to pay increases (magnitude [5. 4 percent], behavioral intentions [4. 2 percent], and affective reactions [5. 6 percent]). In Study 2, a sample of 495 university employees in Finland, the authors also find stable but slightly higher thresholds of about 8 percent for behavioral intentions (8. 4 percent) and positive affective reactions (7. 2 percent) to pay increases.

How can the United States democratize Iraq without Iraqis being {{in charge of}} the democratization process? Does the administration appreciate the intensity of internal opposition to its contingency plans? While U. S. officials are aware of the widespread conviction abroad that control of oil - not disarming Iraq - is the driving force behind U.

Although last week Secretary of State Colin Powell stressed that oil will be used to benefit Iraqis, he did not deny reports, Newsweek said, about using oil money to <b>pay</b> for <b>administration</b> and occupation costs. U. S. officials don't seem to appreciate that democracy cannot be brought to Iraq by an outside power. Only Iraqis, with international assistance, can transform their country.
