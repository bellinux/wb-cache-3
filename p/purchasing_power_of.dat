5|$|Eventually, the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine merchants became {{such that}} it could {{influence}} prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{ordering the}} aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Ordering the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF {{to take advantage}} of the superior <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the US military, and reduced the service's project management requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place. The process functioned smoothly, however, and was cost effective.|$|E

5|$|The first {{banknotes}} of Zimbabwe {{were issued}} by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 {{to coincide with the}} independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.|$|E

The damage done to the roofs, interiors, doors, windows, heating systems, study cabinets and laboratories was three times {{the damage to the}} ruined buildings. The Museum of Zoology lost all of its wet preparations. The interiors of the laboratories of chemistry, physics, pathology and dairy, and a large amount of instruments for the observatories of astronomy and geophysics were destroyed by shrapnel or looted. Bombing destroyed Raadi Manor the main building of the Estonian National Museum.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, {{economic}} opportunities increased for the English peasantry. Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households. These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created {{a wide range of}} opportunities for farmers and artisans. Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere. Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.|$|E

40|$|By {{looking at}} the {{available}} evidence on the London gold market {{in the late eighteenth}} century and early nineteenth century, this p aper presents a new formulation of the gold points and models the mar ket behavior behind gold movements. While there is evidence that the merchants' behavior sustained the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity <b>of</b> gold in terms of currency, there is none to support the view that gold flows realized the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity <b>of</b> gold in terms of traded commo dities. Therefore, the equilibrium condition imposed by both the mone tary approach and the price-specie-flow mechanism seems unnecessarily restrictive.

The <b>purchasing</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> different income classes depend on how relative prices move. Relative prices affected real inequality more strongly in earlier centuries than in the twentieth. Between 1500 and about 1800, staple food and fuels became dearer, while luxury goods, especially servants, became cheaper, greatly widening the inequality of lifestyles. Peace, industrialization, and globalization reversed this inegalitarian price effect in the nineteenth century, at least for England. ...|$|R
