There was initially disagreement on if the deal is legally binding on the United States.

The JCPOA reflects <b>political</b> <b>commitments</b> between Iran, the P5+1, and the EU." [...] According to the State Department <b>Political</b> <b>Commitments</b> are non-binding.|$|R
25|$|These {{processes}} {{occurred in}} a context of ongoing influences from the media and international donor agencies, with some contribution from advocacy groups within China. The SARS epidemic showed the potentially disastrous effect of a fast-moving infectious disease and, simultaneously, allowed the HIV community to acquire new methods to fight the epidemic (e.g., real-time data collection of new cases). However, mobilisation of resources, scientific evidence, and administrative drive did not occur until there was enthusiastic <b>political</b> <b>commitment.</b> The pace of implementation of innovative strategies for HIV detection, prevention, and care, accelerated with the commitments made by the government of Hu Jintao, starting in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, China's {{progress}} in the control of tuberculosis and public-health reform {{will depend on the}} degree of <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> to address these challenges. In this regard, the indication by Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March 2006, that public health is a key component of the country's 11th 5-year development plan is very encouraging. He highlighted the need to improve rural and urban health services, making them affordable for all, and specifically mentioned the need to control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. With increased governmental commitment and funding to improve public health, China has {{reason to believe that the}} prevalence of tuberculosis and deaths caused by the disease can be halved within the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Against this backdrop, {{the central}} {{government}} began efforts to revitalise its tuberculosis control program in 2000. Most important was the increased <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> to tackle tuberculosis. In March 2000, the Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang and Vice-Minister of Finance Gao Qiang attended the Ministerial Conference on Tuberculosis and Sustainable Development in Amsterdam, where they committed to strengthen the country's efforts to control tuberculosis. In December 2000, the State Council of China held a nationwide video-teleconference on tuberculosis. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing gave explicit instructions to strengthen the tuberculosis control effort. In October 2001, the government issued the second 10-year plan (2001–10) to control tuberculosis. In 2002, {{the central government}} increased its funding for tuberculosis from US$300 000 per year to $4·8 million per year.|$|E
25|$|The {{water and}} {{sanitation}} sector has undergone important changes between 1995 and 2008, with most significant changes occurring between 2000 and 2003. Decentralization, commercialization and community participation were key principles of these reforms. In 2003 the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) was created, taking over responsibility for {{water supply and sanitation}} from the former the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). This was seen a sign of <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> to tackle the challenges Yemen faces in the water sector. In 2005 a National Water Sector Strategy and Investment Program was adopted. One result has been closer cooperation between the Ministries of Water and Agriculture, as well as between donors. Through the process of joint annual reviews these ministries, their agencies and donors evaluate progress. The changes affect urban water supply and sanitation, rural water supply and sanitation, as well as water resources management.|$|E

25|$|Following a {{decision}} of the Berlin House of Representatives, the goal is essentially to restore the S-Bahn network to its extent in 1961. This was stated in an agreement between Deutsche Bahn, the Federal Ministry of Transport and the Senate on 4 November 1993. The network was to be restored by 2002. On this basis, the plans {{were included in the}} land use plan of 1995. In a study of the transport development by the then Department for Transport and Commerce in 1995, a plan was published for a network. Only the Jungfernheide–Stresow, Spandau–Staaken and Zehlendorf–Düppel sections, which had existed until 1980, were not incorporated in these plans. This <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> is now only symbolic as some projects are now aimed at points beyond the original destinations or to miss them entirely. Budgetary difficulties, changing traffic flows and alternative development projects using Regionalbahn trains have led to the cancellation or postponement of projects that had already been developed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} immediate {{threat to the}} existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of these countries have failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex interlinking network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however {{become a part of the}} illegal trade. In Bangladesh, tigers are killed by professional poachers, local hunters, trappers, pirates and villagers. Each group of people has different motives for killing tigers, ranging from profit, excitement to safety concerns. All groups have access to the commercial trade in body parts.|$|E

The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] this article I ask two questions prompted by the phenomenon of ‘politically patterned’ climate change denial.

Building on work in philosophy of science on inductive risk, I argue they can. Second, can an individual's <b>political</b> <b>commitments</b> provide her with good reasons not to defer to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's testimony? I argue that they cannot (at least, in the way identified {{in the first part}} of the article), because of the high epistemic standards which govern that body's assertions. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of my arguments...|$|R

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, the singer {{embarked}} {{on his second}} major world tour, the Quinto Piso Tour. Starting on 24 April 2009, the tour included 123 shows between the United States, Spain, Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, among many other countries in Latin America. It ended on 18 June 2010. During the first North American leg of the tour, Arjona expressed interest in singing in Cuba, though showed no <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> for the matter, a clear reference of the charity event Colombian singer Juanes was planning to hold in that country in 2009. Later that year, Arjona cancelled the planning of a concert in the country, and spoke heavily about Juanes' charity concert influence on the decision. The Quinto Piso Tour {{has been one of}} the most successful tours made by a Latin artist, with an attendance of more than one million people from 19 countries. Also, Arjona received in 2010 a Billboard Latin Music Award for [...] "Latin Tour of the Year". The tour grossed more than $15 million.|$|E
500|$|Dream {{magazine}} columnist Kevin Moist {{stated that}} the album [...] "further jazzified his mixture of street poetry, soulful spirit, <b>political</b> <b>commitment,</b> and Black cultural expression." [...] He also noted {{the history of the}} Strata-East label, and summed up Winter in Americas significance, stating [...] "Radically charged but musically mostly stark and low-key, melodic and soulful as hell, sometimes full band flow while at others just voice and piano, all hanging tight under a melancholy cloud of belatedness [...] Thematically, the album reaches back even further than its predecessors in drawing on Black cultural energy as a source of power for facing down the coming political/cultural Ice Age in America. But Scott-Heron was never a one-dimensional ranter, and his pen is as double-edged here as it ever was, slicing into the growing self-destructiveness and sell-out/buy-in tendencies that were fragmenting the Black community, as incisively as it stabs at the jowls of evil in the White House. As badass as it is understated, and really hasn’t dated just a little bit." [...] The Observer called the album a [...] "jazz fusion pillar stone, with a social conscience to boot". Music writer Karl Keely praised Scott-Heron's vocal maturity from his previous work, and noted Jackson's influence for improving and expanding the music's melodic content. Keely commented that it demonstrates [...] "the evolution of Scott-Heron from politicised poet to soulful singer".|$|E
500|$|At Thaxted, Holst became {{friendly}} with the Rev Conrad Noel, {{known as the}} [...] "Red Vicar", who supported the Independent Labour Party and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church; he also developed an interest in bell-ringing. He started an annual music festival at Whitsuntide in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School performed together with local participants. Holst's a cappella carol, [...] "This Have I Done For My True Love", was dedicated to Noel in recognition of {{his interest in the}} ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as [...] "The Dancing Day"). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's October Revolution, demanded in a Saturday message during the service {{that there should be a}} greater <b>political</b> <b>commitment</b> from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely [...] "camp followers" [...] caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.|$|E
