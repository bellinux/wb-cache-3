40|$|Accidental {{analyses}} {{are essential for}} the safety assessment of future fusion nuclear plants. These analyses rely {{on the availability of}} validated numerical codes able to provide robust and credible results for the main safety issues relevant for the plant licensing such as the accidents that may lead to the loss of containment integrity and to their potential consequences. Fusion plants differ from fission ones mainly from the ultra-high vacuum operating conditions of the first containment barrier (the plasma chamber), and for the high amount and volatility of tritium. In nuclear fission and fusion context, the Enel Code for Analysis of Radionuclide Transport (ECART) has been employed in several safety analyses and validated by means of “ad hoc” experimental data [1]. The same occurs for the Accident Source Term Evaluation Code (ASTEC) currently developed by the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN), but mainly applied in nuclear fission plants safety analysis. Compared to ECART, ASTEC benefited to limited validation efforts on fusion reactor accident analyses. As a consequence, the confidence on ASTEC simulation may gain from benchmarking activities against other codes, and notably to ECART. The goal of the present analysis is to compare the results of the two mentioned codes referring to a specific accidental sequence, previously investigated in detail by ECART during the design phases that followed the ITER Generic Site Safety Report (GSSR). The considered <b>Postulated</b> <b>Initiating</b> <b>Event</b> (PIE) is an in-vessel LOCA initiated by a double break in the divertor cooling loop. Then, the consequent dusts and tritium gas transport from the Vacuum Vessel (VV) to the Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) box, contaminating the NBI internal volume. The focus of this code-to-code comparison is to analyze the similarities and the differences between ASTEC and ECART on the prediction of the pressurization of the VV and the connected relief volumes, and on the transport of dusts (Tungsten (W), Beryllium (Be)) and tritium gas eventually mobilized towards the NBI-BOX...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between heavy liquid metal (HLM) and {{water is a}} safety concern for the preliminary designs of lead fast reactor (i. e. LFR) and of subcritical transmutation system prototypes (i. e. XT-ADS). Current pool-type configurations have steam generators (SG) inside the reactor vessel. This implies that the primary to secondary leak (e. g. steam generator tube rupture) shall {{be considered as a}} <b>postulated</b> <b>initiating</b> <b>event.</b> The issue is addressed for CIRCE facility in ICE (Integral Circulation Experiment) configuration. CIRCE facility is a large pool system aimed at studying key operating principles of Lead Bismuth Eutectic (and Lead) systems. The configuration ICE was carried out to perform integral experiments, simulating the coupling between a high-performance heat source (electrically heated fuel bundle) and the heat exchanger, which was representative of the preliminary design of the XT-ADS heat exchanger. A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is applied {{in order to get a}} complete picture of all the failure modes pertaining to this system, to determine their effects and to classify them according to their severity. The outcome of the analysis has identified as major hazard, relative to the CIRCE facility in the ICE configuration, the risk related to the LBE/water reaction, although with a very low probability, with the potential for a suddenly and dangerous pressurization (beyond the failure threshold) within the main vessel. A SIMMER-III code model of the system has been setup to provide deterministic results of the scenario. The results are supported by means of a LBE/water interaction experiment executed in LIFUS 5 facility. LIFUS 5 is a separate effect test facility dedicated to the investigation of LBE/water interaction. SIMMER-III code pre-test and post-test analyses are performed to define the boundary conditions of the experiment and to demonstrate the reliability of the code in simulating the phenomena of interest. The activity contributes to solving the safety issue raised for the operation of CIRCE facility and it provides a sample approach for addressing the safety studies needed in the development of the lead fast reactor and of the subcritical transmutation system...|$|E

40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems (Generation III+) of AREVA. The reactor is an evolutionary design of operating BWRs (Generation II). In order to verify the functionality and performance of the KERENA safety concept required for the transient and accident management, the test facility "Integral Teststand Karlstein" (INKA) was built at Karlstein (Germany). It is a mock-up of the KERENA boiling water reactor containment, with integrated pressure suppression system. The complete chain of passive safety components is available. The passive components and the levels are represented in full scale. The volume scaling of the containment compartments is approximately 1 : 24. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is simulated via the steam accumulator of the Karlstein Large Valve Test Facility. This vessel provides an energy storage capacity of approximately 1 / 6 of the KERENA RPV and is supplied by a Benson boiler with a thermal power of 22 MW. With respect to the available power supply, the containment- and system-sizing of the facility {{is by far the}} largest one of its kind worldwide. From 2009 to 2012, several single component tests were conducted (Emergency Condenser, Containment Cooling Condenser, Core Flooding System etc.). On March 21 st, 2013, the worldwide first large-scale only passively managed integral accident test of a boiling water reactor was simulated at INKA. The integral test measured the combined response of the KERENA passive safety systems to the <b>postulated</b> <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> was the "Main Steam Line Break" (MSLB) inside the Containment with decay heat simulation. The results of the performed integral test (MSLB) showed that the passive safety systems alone are capable to bring the plant to stable conditions meeting all required safety targets with sufficient margins. Therefore the test verified the function of those components and the interplay between them as response to an anticipated accident scenario. The test provided evidence that the INKA is worldwide the first large scale test facility to perform integral verification tests of passive safety concepts under plant-like scaling and thermodynamic conditions. Hence, the test facility also shows that it is capable to perform containment response tests for existing Generation II BWRs (with active safety systems) and advanced (passive) reactor designs besides KERENA. These test results can be used to strengthen existing containment codes with regard to heat transfer, natural circulation, gas- and temperature stratification and others.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for displaying the outcome of systematic accident identification studies for the ITER design. It consists of a matrix that shows {{the potential impact of}} every <b>Postulated</b> <b>Initiating</b> <b>Event</b> (PIE) identified in earlier studies by Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). This matrix is called the PIE-Potential Impacts Table (PIE-PIT). By considering the significant inventories of radioactive material present in the ITER tokamak, and the confinement barriers and functions that protect them, a set of twelve Plant States are defined that characterise all conditions in which some release to the environment is in principle possible. These form the columns of the PIE-PIT, there being one row for every PIE. The table cells are then filled with sequences of codes representing the aggravating failures that would have to occur for the PIE to result in the defined Plant State. A blank cell means no sequence is possible. Although developed as a presentational tool, the PIE-PIT has value in its own right. The selection of twelve Plant States is in itself of interest, and a further set of Plant States are identified in which one or more confinement barriers remains intact, so that there is no release. A total of 32 Plant States characterise all possible conditions in the ITER tokamak. Further, the PIE-PIT {{can be used as a}} basis for the selection of bounding event sequences, to be the study of more detailed analysis. A probabilistic ranking scheme is proposed for this, although an initial selection has been made based on purely deterministic considerations. It is argued that of the twelve Plant States, six can be identified as Bounding Plant States, characterising all types of release from the plant and all significant pathways for this release. From these, a set of six Bounding Events have been selected. Although selected by this independent approach, these six correspond to the scenarios of six of the 25 Reference Events previously analysed in ITER safety studies, including all but one of the events which result in non-trivial releases (the other is considered enveloped by those that have been included). Thus the PIE-PIT provides not only a useful presentational tool for the result of event identification studies, but has also yielded a new limited set of Bounding Events proposed as the basis for future event analyses. The correspondence with earlier event selections gives confidence in the justification of the selection.

40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems (Generation III+) of AREVA. In order to verify the functionality and performance of the concept required for the transient and accident management, the test facility "Integral Teststand Karlstein" (INKA) was built in Karlstein (Germany). It is a mockup of the KERENA boiling water reactor containment, with integrated pressure suppression system. The complete chain of passive safety components is available. While the scaling of the passive components and the levels match the original values, the volume scaling of the containment compartments is approximately 1 : 24.

The integral test measured the combined response of the KERENA passive safety systems to the <b>postulated</b> <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> "Main Steam Line Break" (MSLB) inside the Containment with decay heat simulation. The main goals were to show the performance and the interaction of the KERENA passive safety systems, the ability to keep the core covered, to discharge the decay heat via the appropriate pathway under all circumstances and to maintain the containment within defined limits, i. e. to bring the plant to a controlled state. The performed integral test (MSLB) was being initiated via the opening of the leak at original RPV boundary conditions (75 bar reactor pressure). The leak causes a mass and energy flow from the reactor pressure vessel into the containment. The resulting drop in the RPV water level activates the Emergency Condenser, so that an additional path for energy transfer out of the RPV in parallel to the leak is opened. The pressure increase in the containment is limited via the containment pressure suppression system (short term) and the containment cooling condensers (long term). The results of the test showed that the passive safety systems alone are capable to bring the plant to stable conditions meeting all required safety targets with sufficient margins. Therefore the test verified the function of those components and the interplay between them as response to an anticipated accident scenario.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis work is the computational thermal hydraulic analysis of ITER and DEMO fusion reactors PHTSs; the performances of the cooling loops have been evaluated during normal operation pulsed condition (ITER) and accidental scenario (DEMO). The fusion reaction, {{which is at the}} basis of current tokamak machines, is briefly reported together with a description of the current design status for ITER and DEMO fusion reactors. Also some existing experimental facilities, aimed to test some of the fusion reactors cooling system features, are briefly presented. Then the ITER in-vessel components PHTS (IBED PHTS) is analyzed through the RELAP 5 code during plasma pulse scenario. During the pulsed plasma operation, the pressure and temperature variation within the IBED PHTS shall be controlled and maintained within an acceptable range of values to avoid both potential dangerous pressure fluctuation within the circuit and thermal fatigue to the loop piping and equipment. A set of countermeasure to control the IBED PHTS pressure and temperature and mitigate their fluctuation during the plasma operation is simulated through RELAP 5 and obtained results are shown and discussed. Finally, a temperature and pressure control strategy is proposed, also addressing possible criticalities to be carefully evaluated during the design activities. The reference PHTS layout for DEMO HCPB concept is analyzed, together with its auxiliaries systems, through a novel analytical method, the Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis at component level with evaluation of loss of function. The {{objective of}} the FMEA is to analyze the system and its functions and identify possible failure mode associated to the loss of function and hence define representative accidental scenarios to be further investigated. As result of this analysis a set of Postulated Initiating Events is identified and the possible accidental chain sequences discussed in detail, also specifying the severity of the events (e. g. Large and Small Break LOCA). Hence the DEMO PHTS ex-vessel LOCA, one of the identified <b>Postulated</b> <b>Initiating</b> <b>Event</b> in the FMEA, is analyzed by means of MELCOR code. The purpose of the analyses is to evaluate the influence of size and location of the break in terms of pressurization of the pressure confinement system of DEMO. In this section, together with the reference PHTS layout, an alternative loop configuration, whose design has been entirely developed within the thesis activities, is proposed and modeled. Here the dynamic behavior of the pressure and flow rate of the two PHTS layouts is compared, highlighting in which cases (i. e. for which break size and layout) mitigating actions, such as prompt loop isolation through safety valve activation or atmosphere detritiation, can be performed effectively. In the conclusions a rationale for the future fusion reactors PHTS is formulated {{on the basis of the}} consideration rising from the results collected in this work. Here The PHTS control strategy to be adopted to cope with the pulsed regime is discussed; some remarks on potential critical aspect associated to the pulsed operation are highlighted. Emphasis is given also to the preventive PHTS design features which might enhance the overall safety of the reactor. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{analyses}} of postulated accident scenarios {{as part of}} the safety assessment of ITER, a systematic approach to the selection of events to be studied provides justification for their choice and confidence that the set is comprehensive. Systematic accident identification performed for ITER, mainly using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), has provided an extensive catalogue of <b>Postulated</b> <b>Initiating</b> <b>Events</b> (PIEs). This information is now used in the PIE Potential Impacts Table (PIE-PIT), which displays the links from PIEs to a limited set of Plant States derived from a functional view of the ITER confinement scheme. A total of twelve Plant States represent all significant conditions in which some release to the environment is possible in principle, and from these a set of seven is chosen as clearly bounding the potential consequences of the entire set. This leads to the selection of just seven scenarios as a bounding event set for the ITER tokamak. There is a direct correspondence between these bounding events and events studied in earlier ITER safety analyses. This set of seven bounding events will provide a sound basis for further safety analyses to be performed as the ITER project moves into a licensing stage. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{research}} activity {{for the development}} of innovative nuclear systems tries to answer the current needs of safety, reliability and sustainability, including safety assessment and risk analysis. In this framework, the European project SAMOFAR aims at furnishing the experimental proof of concept of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) and its safety assessment at its present conceptual stage. For this purpose, the Integrated Safety Assessment Methodology (ISAM) is selected and analysed as conceptual methodology and a wide survey on risk analysis tools, international standards and best-practices aims at defining an operational procedure suiting MSFR analysis, including functional safety assessments. Well-established practices applying "Functional Safety" to conceptual systems do not exist; therefore this work proposes and uses a new method based on functional modelling and on the Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FFMEA). This approach allows studying systems with a preliminary design, identifying functions deviations able to compromise safety, listing <b>Postulated</b> <b>Initiating</b> <b>Events</b> (PIEs) and recognizing lack of information, criticalities and necessity of supplementary provisions in the current design.

40|$|Safety {{studies are}} {{performed}} {{in the frame of}} the conceptual design studies for the European Demonstration Fusion Power Plant (DEMO) to assess the safety and environmental impact of design options. An exhaustive set of reference accident sequences are defined in order to evaluate plant response in the most challenging events and compliance with safety requirements. The Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FFMEA) has been chosen as analytical tool, as it is a suitable methodology to define possible accident initiators when insufficient design detail is available to allow for more specific evaluation at component level. The main process, safety and protection functions related to the DEMO plant are defined through a functional breakdown structure (FBS). Then, an exhaustive set of high level accident initiators is defined referring to loss of functions, rather than to specific failures of systems and components, overcoming the lack of detailed design information. Nonetheless reference to systems or main components is always highlighted, as much as possible, in order to point out causes and safety consequences.

The ip accumulation of activated leukocytes and the infiltration of endometriosis lesions by macrophages and T cells are cytological markers of the inflammatory nature of this syndrome. The apparent recruitment of these leukocytes prompted us to search for chemokine expression by endometriosis cells. We reported previously that pelvic fluid RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) concentrations correlated with the stage of endometriosis. In the current study, RANTES messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was identified in normal endometrium and endometriosis lesions, and techniques were developed to localize RANTES protein ENDOMETRIOSIS is a prevalent gynecological conditio...|$|R
40|$|High blood {{pressure}} {{is an important component}} of pre-eclampsia. The underlying mechanism of development of hypertension in pre-eclampsia is complicated and still remains obscure. Several theories have been advanced including endothelial dysfunction, uteroplacental insufficiency leading to generalized vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Increased blood flow and pressure are thought to lead to capillary dilatation, which damages end-organ sites, leading to hypertension, proteinuria and edema. Additional theories have been put forward based on epidemiological research, implicating immunological and genetic factors. None of these theories have been substantiated. Based on a review of literature this paper <b>postulates</b> that the <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> for the development of preeclampsia is intermittent hypoxia associated with irregular breathing during sleep, hypoapnea, apnea,inadequate respiratory excursions during the waking hours and inadequate cardiopulmonary synchronization (abnormal sympatho-vagal balance) ...|$|R

The causal biological effectors are uncertain. <b>Postulating</b> that <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> may be alterations to infant body composition established in utero, we tested the hypothesis that neonatal adipose tissue (AT) content and distribution and liver lipid are influenced by maternal BMI. We studied 105 healthy mother-neonate pairs. We assessed infant AT compartments by whole body MR imaging and intrahepatocellular lipid content by 1 H MR spectroscopy. Maternal BMI ranged from 16. 7 to 36. 0. With each unit increase in maternal BMI, having adjusted for infant sex and weight, {{there was an increase}} in infant total (8 mL; 95 % CI, 0. 09 – 14. 0; p = 0. 03), abdominal (2 mL; 95 % CI, 0. 7 – 4. 0; p = 0. 005), and nonabdominal (5 mL; 95 % CI, 0. 09 – 11. 0; p = 0. 054) AT, and having adjusted for infant sex and postnatal age, an increase of 8. 6 % (95 % CI, 1. 1 – 16. 8; p = 0. 03) in intrahepatocellular lipid.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD is to asses the capability of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to predict the complicated mixing phenomena in the Lower Plenum of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). This activity has been conducted {{in the frame of}} the TACIS-Project R 2. 02 / 02 A: “Development of safety analysis capabilities for VVER- 1000 transients involving spatial variations of coolant properties (temperature or boron concentration at core inlet”. The use of CFD calculations is intended to better understand the in-vessel mixing phenomena, in order to help identifying the system code deficiencies and to properly define future use of system codes for future safety analyses. With such purpose, a specific experimental program and extensive pre and post-test calculations were performed in order to provide material for validating the capability of the developed Russian system code (i. e. TRAP-KS, DKM and KORSAR-GP) and commercial CFD code (i. e. ANSYS CFX- 10) against the obtained experimental data, representing expected physical situations after nuclear power plant (NPP) <b>postulated</b> accident <b>initiating</b> <b>events.</b> The adopted CFD code predicts properly flow patterns for all tests and exhibits a general tendency to a low degree of mixing. Selected system code prediction highlighted capabilities of such fast running analysis tools; at the same time deficiencies were identified, especially for the cases of start-up of one pump, restart of natural circulation as well as the case of stable operation of one pump. At present it is conluded that selected system codes are not yet usable for safety analisys report (SAR) purposes unless the development and use of a proper ‘bounding’ methodology allows using such codes in a conservative and reliable way for SAR purposes; on the other hand the use of CFD codes proved to be a valuable tool to support a system code validation process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman-induced <b>initiating</b> <b>events,</b> {{also called}} Category B actions in human {{reliability}} analysis, are operator actions {{that may lead}} directly to <b>initiating</b> <b>events.</b> Most conventional probabilistic safety analyses typically assume that the frequency of <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> also includes the probability of human-induced <b>initiating</b> <b>events.</b> However, some regulatory documents require Category B actions to be specifically analyzed and quantified in probabilistic safety analysis. An explicit modeling of Category B actions could also potentially lead to important insights into human performance in terms of safety. However, there is no standard procedure to identify Category B actions. This paper describes a systematic procedure to identify Category B actions for low power and shutdown conditions. The procedure includes several steps to determine operator actions {{that may lead to}} <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> in the low power and shutdown stages. These steps are the selection of <b>initiating</b> <b>events,</b> the selection of systems or components, the screening of unlikely operating actions, and the quantification of <b>initiating</b> <b>events.</b> The procedure also provides the detailed instruction for each step, such as operator's action, information required, screening rules, and the outputs. Finally, the applicability of the suggested approach is also investigated by application to a plant example...|$|R
40|$|When {{analyzing}} U. S. commercial {{nuclear power}} plant performance in terms of selected <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> frequencies and component unreliability, the data often appear to suggest two groups of performers - nominal and degraded. Given this observation, a limited review of the data was performed to investigate whether degraded performance typically is momentary or sustained. For example, do plants that exhibited degraded performance for a certain <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> over one period also appear in the degraded performance category over the next period? The data review included a relatively simplistic review for two <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> and two components followed by a more detailed analysis {{of one of the}} <b>initiating</b> <b>events.</b> The limited data review indicates that for the two relatively frequent <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> categories and two important component types, the plant incursions into the degraded category are typically momentary (lasting one to several years) with subsequent returns to the nominal category.

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{maintains}} {{a set of}} risk models covering the U. S. commercial nuclear power plants. These standardized plant analysis risk (SPAR) models include several loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> such as small (SLOCA), medium (MLOCA), and large (LLOCA). All of these events involve a loss of coolant inventory from the reactor coolant system. In order to maintain a level of consistency across these models, <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> frequencies generally are based on plant-type average performance, where the plant types are boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. For certain risk analyses, these plant-type <b>initiating</b> <b>event</b> frequencies may be replaced by plant-specific estimates. Frequencies for SPAR LOCA <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> previously were based on results presented in NUREG/CR- 5750, but the newest models use results documented in NUREG/CR- 6928. The estimates in NUREG/CR- 6928 are based on historical data from the <b>initiating</b> <b>events</b> database for pressurized water reactor SLOCA or an interpretation of results presented in the draft version of NUREG- 1829. The information in NUREG- 1829 can be used several ways, resulting in different estimates for the various LOCA frequencies. Various ways NUREG- 1829 information {{can be used to}} estimate LOCA frequencies were investigated and this paper presents two methods for the SPAR model standard inputs, which differ from the method used in NUREG/CR- 6928.
