5|$|Tribe Microglossini: One genus {{with one}} species, the black <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|The ACT Government {{adopted the}} gang-gang {{cockatoo}} as its official faunal emblem on 27 February 1997. The short-lived budget airline Impulse Airlines featured a sulphur-crested cockatoo on its corporate livery (and aeroplanes). The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> {{which has a}} unique beak and face colouration, {{is used as a}} symbol by the World Parrot Trust.|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> Probosciger aterrimus was studied for 3 years from July 1999 to February 2002 {{in and around}} Iron Range National Park, Cape York Peninsula, Australia. <b>Palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> were weakly seasonal breeders, with the peak of egg-laying occurring in September; 41 breeding attempts were monitored at 28 nesting hollows. Nearly all (27 / 28) nests were in tropical savanna woodland and an average distance of 320 m to rainforest. Males defended about four nest sites, only a subset of which were used for breeding. The typical active nest tree was in a near-vertical hollow with an opening that faced skywards; 62. 1 % of active nests were in living trees and the most common species of nest tree was Eucalyptus tetrodonta (48. 3 %). DNA fingerprinting revealed that some pairs reused the same nest hollow even when breeding attempts were separated by 1 {{or more years of}} no breeding activity, but that changes in hollow ownership also occurred. Nest usurpation, male territorial displays at the nest and evidence of interference competition by conspecifics suggest strong competition for nest sites, which is probably driven by variation in hollow quality and high investment in the nesting platform. Of active nests, 81 % failed to produce a fledgling, thereby ranking the breeding success of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> among the lowest reported for any species of parrot. They also invariably laid a single egg and seemed to breed infrequently, and thus they use an extremely slow life-history strategy. We suggest that this slow life history makes <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> on Cape York Peninsula sensitive to environmental perturbations, with fire being the most probable threatening process...|$|R
50|$|The vocalizations of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> {{are similar}} to those of most wild parrots, but they have also been shown to produce a variety of {{additional}} syllables in display and exchange with neighbouring individuals. These additional syllables are mainly produced by males and are often combined to form long, complex sequences. In a population in the Iron Range, 30 different syllables were distinguished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As an order, Parrots (Psittaciformes) {{are both}} the longest lived birds {{and among the}} most endangered. <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> (Probosciger aterrimus) have an {{extremely}} slow life history, including {{one of the lowest}} rates of breeding success reported for parrots. Here we use population viability analysis (PVA) to examine whether populations of <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> are viable in the long term with such low rates of reproduction. We built PVA models for two field sites with robust data on reproductive success and availability of nest-hollows: Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (Queensland, Australia) and Crater Mountain (Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea). Our Iron Range models incorporate a fluctuating resource base of nest-hollows resulting from natural losses from fire, wind and tree decay and natural replenishment through tree breakages in tropical cyclones. The number of females allowed to breed each year in the simulations was limited by the availability of hollows. Our Iron Range models suggest that the population is only viable if juvenile and adult mortality rates are very low, and that at least some birds in the population live to 100 years old. Based on known maximum lifespans in the Cacatuidae, we conclude that <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> at Iron Range are unlikely to live for long enough on average to support their low rates of reproduction, and highlight the possibility that the population may be in decline. At Crater Mountain, where nestlings are harvested for food by local people, the models suggest that the reported current rate of 40 % of nestlings taken is not sustainable...|$|R
5|$|All {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} except the cockatiel {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), red-vented cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan cockatoo (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) and <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With {{the exception of the}} cockatiel, all remaining cockatoo species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples are the tonal sound {{produced}} by the tail-feathers of the Anna's hummingbird Calypte anna, the drumming of the tail-feathers of the African snipe and common snipe, bill-clattering by storks or the deliberate territorial tapping practised by woodpeckers and certain members of the parrot family, such as <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> which drum on hollow trees using broken-off sticks. The clapper lark's (Mirafra apiata) display flight includes a steep climb with wing rattling.|$|R
50|$|Also {{present in}} the area are several birds whose Australian range is limited to the Cape York Peninsula, {{including}} <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> yellow-billed kingfishers, red-bellied pittas, trumpet manucodes, magnificent riflebirds, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, northern scrub robins, yellow-legged flycatchers, tropical scrubwrens and frill-necked monarchs. The endangered southern cassowary was recorded in Lockerbie Scrub in 1986 but is now probably extinct there. Bush stone-curlews, silver-crowned friarbirds and yellow honeyeaters have been recorded on rare occasions. Graceful honeyeaters are common. White-streaked honeyeaters are present.|$|R
25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut to hold it in place. This behaviour is also shown by <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the pink and white Major Mitchell's cockatoo, the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

50|$|An avid animal, {{fish and}} bird enthusiast, Balan {{is an expert}} breeder {{consistently}} breaking records {{and is one of}} the eminent aviculturists and bird breeders in the world. He maintains one of the largest bird farms in South Asia, Gemini Bird Farm, set in the Padappai region with a vast variety of exotic birds and parrots. The farm regularly donates birds to the Chennai zoo. A speciality of his breeding is of colour mutations of ringneck parrots, <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (endangered species and notoriously difficult to breed), macaws and more.|$|R
5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> use tools to drum.|$|R
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black cockatoo has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively quiet but do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.|$|R
500|$|Tribe Microglossini: one genus {{with one}} species, the black <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> ...|$|E
500|$|A 1999 mtDNA phylogenetic {{study of}} {{cockatoos}} utilizing among others, the red-tailed black cockatoo supported the hypotheses that cockatoos originated in Australia before the Paleogene and Neogene periods (66 mya, marking {{the end of}} the Mesozoic, to 2.6 mya) and that the genus Cacatua diversified in two separate radiations to the islands of Indonesia, New Guinea, and the South Pacific. [...] It concluded that the first extant cockatoo to diverge from the ancestral cockatoos was the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> followed by a subclade containing the black cockatoos.|$|E
500|$|The nesting hollows {{are lined}} with sticks, wood chips and {{branches}} with leaves. The eggs of cockatoos are oval and initially white, as their location makes camouflage unnecessary. However, they do become discoloured {{over the course of}} incubation. They range in size from [...] in the palm and red-tailed black cockatoos, to [...] in the cockatiel. Clutch size varies within the family, with the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and some other larger cockatoos laying only a single egg and the smaller species laying anywhere between two and eight eggs. Food supply also plays a role in clutch size. Some species can lay a second clutch if the first fails. Around 20% of eggs laid are infertile. The cockatoos' incubation and brooding responsibilities may either be undertaken by the female alone {{in the case of the}} black cockatoos or shared amongst the sexes as happens in the other species. In the case of the black cockatoos, the female is provisioned by the male several times a day. The young of all species are born covered in yellowish down, bar the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> whose young are born naked. Cockatoo incubation times are dependent on species size, with the smaller cockatiels having a period of around 20days and the larger Carnaby's black cockatoo incubating its eggs for up to 29days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> only lay one egg {{every second}} year and {{have one of}} the lowest {{breeding}} success rates reported for any species of parrot. Setting off this is their very long lifespan. A male commenced breeding at 29 in Taronga Zoo in Sydney, and a female at the London Zoo was 40 when she laid her first egg in 1966. Breeding takes place inside tree hollows that look like standing pipes. Fires {{play an important role in}} the destruction and creation of nest hollows. Fires allow the colonisation of microorganisms and termites, which enter the tree and start hollowing out the inside. Cyclones are important in the final stage of nest hollow development.|$|R

5000|$|... ==== Birds ==== The feathers, the beak, the feet, and {{different}} tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers {{to produce a}} [...] "drumming" [...] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a [...] "rattle" [...] or [...] "throbbing" [...] noise. <b>Palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise {{to attract the attention}} of mates. Bustards are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates. Mirafra apiata, commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.|$|R
500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a long-term commitment from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved, although {{the placement of}} the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) {{at the base of the}} cockatoos remains uncertain. The cockatiel is alternatively placed basal to all other cockatoo species, as the sister taxon to the black cockatoo species of the genus Calyptorhynchus or as the sister taxon to a clade consisting of the white and pink cockatoo genera as well as the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo.</b> The remaining species are within two main clades, one consisting of the black species of the genus Calyptorhynchus while the other contains the remaining species. According to most authorities, the second clade includes the black <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> (Probosciger), the gray and reddish galah (Eolophus), the gang-gang cockatoo (Callocephalon) [...] and the pinkish Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa), although Probosciger is sometimes placed basal to all other species. The remaining species are mainly white or slightly pinkish and all belong to the genus Cacatua. The genera Eolophus, Lophochroa and Cacatua are hypomelanistic. The genus Cacatua is further subdivided into the subgenera Licmetis, commonly known as corellas, and Cacatua, referred to as white cockatoos. Confusingly, the term [...] "white cockatoo" [...] has also been applied to the whole genus. The five cockatoo species of the genus Calyptorhynchus are commonly known as black cockatoos, and are divided into two subgenera— Calyptorhynchus and Zanda. The former group are sexually dichromatic, with the females having prominently barred plumage. [...] The two are also distinguished by differences in the food begging calls of juveniles.|$|E
500|$|In 1827, Jennings {{proposed}} the name Psittacus niger for the bird. The binomial combination {{had already been}} used by Carl Linnaeus for the lesser vasa parrot in 1758, and by Johann Friedrich Gmelin for the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> in 1788; it was thus invalid even though both other species were already known by different names at the time. Alternate common names include Banks' black cockatoo, Banksian black cockatoo, or simply black cockatoo. Indigenous people of the central Cape York Peninsula have several names for the bird: [...] (minha) pachang in Pakanh; (inh -) inhulg in Uw Oykangand; and (inh -) anhulg in Uw Olkola. (The bracketed prefix (inh- or minha) is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal'.) [...] Ngarnarrh or KarnamarrTo are terms used by the Gunwinggu of Arnhem Land. In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term for the subspecies C. b. samueli is iranti. Karrak is a Noongar term derived from the call for the southwestern race C. b. naso. [...] In {{the language of the}} Bungandidj of south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria this bird was called treen.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> use tools to drum.|$|R
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|R
