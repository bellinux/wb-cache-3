5|$|Headley did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> {{first-class}} cricket in the West Indies in 1933–34, {{but returned}} to Jamaica in readiness for the 1934–35 MCC tour. The visiting team, under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, {{was stronger than}} English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, Wisden and other critics considered it strong enough for the task in hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to C minor. The soloist does not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment.|$|E

Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. Only limited data exists on the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Affected by her {{association}} with Cheng Shuyao, Shangguan did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> major role for several years. This changed in 1955, when she {{starred in the}} film Storm on the Southern Island. Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, {{a far cry from}} her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed a wide variety of characters in many films including It's My Day Off (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin). She was {{recognized as one of the}} most talented and versatile actresses in China.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{eight months}} {{without being able}} to <b>play</b> <b>any</b> football, Villa finally returned from his injury in the 73rd minute of Barcelona's 2–0 win over Dinamo Bucharest on 11 August 2012. Eight days later, he played his first competitive football match since December 2011 in Barcelona's first La Liga game of the season where he received a standing ovation while coming on as a substitute for Pedro. It only took seven minutes before Villa found himself on the score-sheet while sealing a 5–1 victory for his team against Real Sociedad. On 28 November, Villa scored two goals in a 3–1 over Deportivo Alavés, which included his 300th career goal.|$|E

5|$|Burnley did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> {{pre-season}} friendly games {{other than}} a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{an early}} {{reputation}} {{playing for the}} Shannon Club in Trinidad, St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter-Colonial Tournament until 1930. Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England, he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad. Success in trial matches led to his selection for the 1928 tour of England where he failed badly. In 1930, he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and was chosen for one final Test, after {{which he did not}} <b>play</b> <b>any</b> further first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 {{in less than}} four hours in the following match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> cricket for six weeks before he added a pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E

5|$|First-class cricket {{was first}} played in South Africa in the {{previous}} 1888–89 season, when Robert Warton managed a side which toured the country, playing against representative teams {{from each of the}} provinces, and two matches against South Africa, which were later adjudged to have Test cricket status. During that tour, Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side; which was judged to be Kimberley. In other first-class matches during the 1889–90 season, Kimberley faced Natal twice, winning both matches. Transvaal did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> first-class cricket prior to their Currie Cup contest with Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not <b>play</b> <b>any</b> role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

Her family eventually moved to Jakarta to further her singing career, and she was requested to be a backing vocalist for three different pop singers.

5|$|The New Orleans Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) {{were unable}} to <b>play</b> <b>any</b> home games for the entire 2005–06 season, after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, Louisiana on August 29, 2005, and caused {{extensive}} damage to the New Orleans Arena (now known as Smoothie King Center). The team temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, becoming the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. After playing the majority of home games for both the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, the Hornets returned to New Orleans for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|The Nomad {{does not}} have its own game library, but instead plays Genesis games. At {{the time of its}} launch, the Nomad had over 500 games {{available}} for play. However, no pack-in title was included. The Nomad can boot unlicensed, homebrew, and bootleg games made for the Genesis. Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad, but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to <b>play</b> <b>any</b> games for the Sega Master System, Sega CD, or Sega 32X. The Nomad employs two different regional lockout methods, physical and software, but methods have been found to bypass these.|$|E

However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 – eighty years after the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} <b>play</b> <b>any</b> natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|A GameCube {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in 2003 {{as part of an}} exclusivity agreement between Capcom and Nintendo. The GameCube version received mixed reviews from critics and was mainly criticized for its relatively high retail price and outdated graphics. AllGame noted that the fact that the game was not priced as a budget title could mislead buyers into thinking that it was an enhanced update similar to the 2002 Resident Evil on the GameCube. GamePro remarked that, while the game's graphics on the GameCube were not like those of the 2002 Resident Evil or Resident Evil Zero, they were better-looking than previous versions of the game. As of November 2003, 41,395 copies of the GameCube version had been sold in the US. Resident Evil 3 was digitally released on the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2008 and North America in 2009, allowing PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable users to <b>play</b> <b>any</b> {{version of the}} game via emulation.|$|E
