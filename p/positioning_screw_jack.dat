40|$|A two {{dimensional}} test section {{in a low}} speed wind tunnel capable of producing flow conditions free from wall interference is presented. Flexible top and bottom walls, and rigid sidewalls from which models were mounted spanning the tunnel are shown. All walls were unperforated, and the flexible walls were <b>positioned</b> by <b>screw</b> <b>jacks.</b> To eliminate wall interference, the wind tunnel itself supplied the information required in the streamlining process, when run with the model present. Measurements taken at the flexible walls were used by the tunnels computer check wall contours. Suitable adjustments based on streamlining criteria were then suggested by the computer. The streamlining criterion adopted when generating infinite flowfield conditions was a matching of static pressures in the test section at a wall with pressures computed for an imaginary inviscid flowfield passing over {{the outside of the}} same wall. Aerodynamic data taken on a cylindrical model operating under high blockage conditions are presented to illustrate the operation of the tunnel in its various modes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Structural {{synthesis}} of super-redundant mechanism {{is a key}} to design of painting robot for S-shape duct. Based on the principles of modular structure design, the painting robot for S-shape duct falls naturally into three separate control and design components: a moving platform, a locating mechanism, and a painting manipulator. The moving platform consists of a robot body, wheels, gasbags for <b>position</b> adjustment, and <b>screw</b> <b>jacks.</b> The 3 PR-type serial mechanism is adopted for location. The super-redundant 3 P 7 R-type serial mechanism is used for the painting manipulator. The restriction of the distance between connecting rods and the axis of the duct is employed to control self-motion of the painting manipulator for joint trajectory planning. Experiment result shows that minimal distance between robot joints and duct interior is 18 mm and that average dynamic accuracy is ± 6. 8 mm, which satisfies the working requirements...|$|R

50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. <b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R
50|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> {{consists}} of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle {{as well as a}} finer screw thread. However, most <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.|$|R

50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|R
