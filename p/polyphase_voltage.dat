2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to <b>polyphase</b> <b>voltage</b> sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument {{can be made to}} register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.|$|E
40|$|A power-pulse-modulation {{control method}} {{is applied to}} a series-resonant {{converter}} system with multiple ports for generating synthesized waveforms with reversible power flow. The energy emanates from a source (single of <b>polyphase</b> <b>voltage</b> source generating unipolar of bipolar waveforms), and is transmitted to a network (load) in a specific form (unipolar or bipolar, single or <b>polyphase</b> <b>voltage</b> waveforms). A discussion of {{the stability of the}} energy transfer in relation to the excitation voltage leads to a clarifying description of the possibilities for the control of the resonant energy transfer for any conversion ratio. A control strategy is applied to adapt the characteristics of the resonant circuit to the rapidly varying voltages. The results of a simulation program, developed particularly for this class of conversion systems, confirm the processes...|$|E
50|$|Provided two voltage {{waveforms}} have {{at least}} some relative displacement on the time axis, other than a multiple of a half-cycle, any other <b>polyphase</b> set of <b>voltages</b> {{can be obtained by}} an array of passive transformers. Such arrays will evenly balance the polyphase load between the phases of the source system. For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This Scott T connection produces a true two-phase system with 90Â° time difference between the phases. Another example is the generation of higher-phase-order systems for large rectifier systems, to produce a smoother DC output and to reduce the harmonic currents in the supply.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} to generate high voltage pulses (100 kV and up) with high peak power (10 MW and up) and high average power (1 MW and up) from a low voltage input source (e. g. +/- 1. 2 kV). This technology is presently being used to provide cathode pulse modulation for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator klystron RF amplifiers, which operate to 140 kV 11 MW peak power and 1. 1 MW average power. The design of the modulator, {{referred to as the}} Polyphase Resonant Converter-Modulator takes advantage of high-power component advances, in response {{to the needs of the}} traction motor industry (in particular, railroad locomotives), such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT's) and self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene capacitors. In addition, the use of amorphous nanocrystalline transformer core alloy permits high frequency voltage and current transformation with low loss and small size. Other unique concepts embodied in the converter-modulator topology are <b>polyphase</b> resonant <b>voltage</b> multiplication and resonant rectification. These techniques further reduce size and improve electrical efficiency. Because of the resonant conversion techniques, electronic 'crowbars' and other load protective networks are not required. A shorted load detunes the circuit resonance and little power transfer can occur. This yields a high-power, high-voltage system that is inherently self-protective. To provide regulated output voltages, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of the individual IGBT pulses is used. A Digital signal Processor (DSP) is used to control the IGBT's, with adaptive feed forward and feedback control algorithms that improve pulse fidelity. The converter-modulator has many attributes that make it attractive to various pulse power and plasma applications such as high power RF sources, neutral beam modulators, and various plasma applications. This paper will review the design as used for the SNS accelerator and speculate on related plasma applications...|$|R
