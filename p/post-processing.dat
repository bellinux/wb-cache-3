5|$|This is {{the same}} group that set up and {{maintained}} the in-house digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera {{as well as the}} Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital <b>post-processing.</b> The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E
5|$|Perl's text-handling {{capabilities}} can be {{used for}} generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for <b>post-processing</b> by a Perl subprogram.|$|E
25|$|Aperture {{synthesis}} by <b>post-processing</b> motion {{data from}} a single moving source, on the other hand, is widely used in space and airborne radar systems.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{features}} {{to further enhance}} the graphics quality are also available. Dolphin supports spatial anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, <b>post-processing</b> pixel shaders, and a widescreen hack for forcing widescreen output on games that do not support it natively. Games can also achieve higher-than-intended frames per second.|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{to health}} and safety also exist from <b>post-processing</b> {{activities}} done to finish parts {{after they have been}} printed. These <b>post-processing</b> activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry. Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses. Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.|$|E
25|$|DXVA 2.0 {{supports}} only Enhanced Video Renderer as {{the video}} renderer on Windows Vista. DXVA integrates with Media Foundation and allows DXVA pipelines {{to be exposed}} as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). Even decoder pipelines or <b>post-processing</b> pipelines can be exposed as MFTs, {{which can be used}} by the Media Foundation topology loader to create a full media playback pipeline. DXVA 1.0 is emulated using DXVA 2.0.|$|E
25|$|In digital sensors, axial CA {{results in}} the red and blue planes being defocused (assuming that the green plane is in focus), which is {{relatively}} difficult to remedy in <b>post-processing,</b> while transverse CA {{results in the}} red, green, and blue planes being at different magnifications (magnification changing along radii, as in geometric distortion), and can be corrected by radially scaling the planes appropriately so they line up.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} remove {{bacterial}} contamination through <b>post-processing</b> by irradiation {{may reduce the}} fear of mishandling food which could cultivate a cavalier attitude toward hygiene and result in contaminants other than bacteria. However, concerns that the pasteurization of milk would lead to increased contamination of milk were prevalent when mandatory pasteurization was introduced, but these fears never materialized after adoption of this law. Therefore, it is unlikely for irradiation to cause an increase of illness due to nonbacteria-based contamination.|$|E
25|$|Digital imaging uses an {{electronic}} image sensor {{to record the}} image {{as a set of}} electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper, while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image <b>post-processing</b> that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.|$|E
25|$|Fullerene {{production}} processes comprise {{the following five}} subprocesses: (i) synthesis of fullerenes or fullerene-containing soot; (ii) extraction; (iii) separation (purification) for each fullerene molecule, yielding pure fullerenes such as C60; (iv) synthesis of derivatives (mostly using the techniques of organic synthesis); (v) other <b>post-processing</b> such as dispersion into a matrix. The two synthesis methods used in practice are the arc method, and the combustion method. The latter, discovered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is preferred for large scale industrial production.|$|E
25|$|In earlier {{computers}} and video game systems, sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis. In modern systems, {{the increases in}} storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used. The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio, often with hardware acceleration, and real-time audio <b>post-processing,</b> which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development. Based on the internal state of the game, multiple different calculations can be made. This will allow for, for example, realistic sound dampening, echoes and doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) 2.0 which {{enhances the}} implementation of the video pipeline and adds a host of other DDIs, including a Capture DDI for video capture. The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with support for hardware acceleration of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the video renderer. As such, pipelines for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or <b>post-processing</b> and rendering (without decoding) can also be created. These features require the Windows Display Driver Model drivers.|$|E
25|$|From a {{technological}} standpoint, notable features of The Casting include full body and facial motion capture, real-time tears and wrinkles on the face, advanced skin shaders, and some advanced rendering features, such as depth of field, spherical harmonics, auto exposure and {{high dynamic range}} rendering. The technology enables animations of pupil dilation, tongue, eyes, fingers, and dynamic hair with physics. The game engine also supports real-time <b>post-processing,</b> with which E3 attendees could interact at the event. Hair physics is achieved {{by the use of}} Havok. Facial motion capture was recorded using Vicon MX40 cameras and system, and was enhanced with a muscle system.|$|E
25|$|Input lag, {{because the}} LCD's A/D {{converter}} waits for each frame {{to be completely}} been output before drawing it to the LCD panel. Many LCD monitors do <b>post-processing</b> before displaying the image {{in an attempt to}} compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video scaler must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag. Scaling and post processing are usually done in a single chip on modern monitors, but each function that chip performs adds some delay. Some displays have a video gaming mode which disables all or most processing to reduce perceivable input lag.|$|E
25|$|A very {{effective}} measure of both protection {{to both the}} staff and the patient of course is applying less radiation. There is always a trade-off between radiation dose and image quality. A higher x-ray dose leads to a clearer picture. Modern software technology can improve image quality during <b>post-processing,</b> such that the same image quality is reached with a lower dose. Image quality thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but image quality can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based printer driver which {{includes}} the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive the spool file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL <b>post-processing,</b> and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the spool file to the page description language supported by the printer.|$|E
25|$|MODFLOW is a {{well-known}} example of a general finite difference groundwater flow model. It is developed by the US Geological Survey as a modular and extensible simulation tool for modeling groundwater flow. It is free software developed, documented and distributed by the USGS. Many commercial products have grown up around it, providing graphical user interfaces to its input file based interface, and typically incorporating pre- and <b>post-processing</b> of user data. Many other models {{have been developed to}} work with MODFLOW input and output, making linked models which simulate several hydrologic processes possible (flow and transport models, surface water and groundwater models and chemical reaction models), because of the simple, well documented nature of MODFLOW.|$|E
25|$|A re-enactment of the Battle of Grunwald was {{recorded}} for {{the sounds of}} battle, marching, blacksmithing, and the firing of arrows. Recording the knights' voices for <b>post-processing,</b> the speakers wore helmets for an authentic sound. Marcin Przybylowicz was the game's music director and composer, with additional music contributed by Polish folk band Percival because their instruments were older. According to Przybylowicz, working with Percival was a challenge; he expected an academic approach before learning {{that most of the}} group were not formally trained, and much of the music was improvised. Multi-instrumentalist Robert Jaworski of the folk band Żywiołak recorded lute, Renaissance fiddle, bowed gusle, and hurdy-gurdy sections. The score was performed in Frankfurt by the Brandenburg State Orchestra, conducted by Bernd Ruf.|$|E
500|$|Manipulating {{the vast}} {{datasets}} and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern {{numerical weather prediction}} requires {{some of the most}} powerful supercomputers in the world. [...] Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days. Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves. [...] <b>Post-processing</b> techniques such as model output statistics (MOS) have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to graphical rainfall forecasts showing quantitative amounts, rainfall forecasts {{can be made}} describing the probabilities of certain rainfall amounts being met. [...] This allows the forecaster to assign the degree of uncertainty to the forecast. [...] This technique {{is considered to be}} informative, relative to climatology. [...] This method has been used for years within National Weather Service forecasts, as a period's chance of rain equals the chance that [...] will fall in any particular spot. [...] In this case, it is known as probability of precipitation. [...] These probabilities can be derived from a deterministic forecast using computer <b>post-processing.</b>|$|E
500|$|Model output {{statistics}} {{differ from}} the perfect prog technique, which assumes that the output of numerical weather prediction guidance is perfect. [...] MOS can correct for local effects that cannot be resolved by the model due to insufficient grid resolution, as well as model biases. [...] Because MOS is run after its respective global or regional model, its production is known as <b>post-processing.</b> [...] Forecast parameters within MOS include maximum and minimum temperatures, percentage chance of rain within a several hour period, precipitation amount expected, chance that the precipitation will be frozen in nature, chance for thunderstorms, cloudiness, and surface winds.|$|E
500|$|The damaged bus was not {{the only}} problem to filming in Dubai: the first of the three days was afflicted by a {{sandstorm}} which left most of the footage shot unusable. The production team then struggled to complete three days of filming in two days; the last day was compared to [...] "filming Lawrence of Arabia". To complete the episode's filming, interior scenes in the bus were filmed in a studio in Wales. To disguise the fact they were using a translite, a 360-degree background image, Strong utilised often-avoided techniques such as muddied windows and lens flares; the latter also served to create a warmer environment for the viewer. After filming ended, editing and <b>post-processing</b> took place until two days before transmission, leaving the BBC to resort to using an unfinished copy to market the episode.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, the {{commercial}} gillnet fishery for the California halibut (Paralichthys californicus), operating off Santa Barbara, {{expanded to include}} the Pacific angelshark as well. The sharks had become valuable due to their promotion {{as a substitute for}} the seasonally available common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), and the development of new processing techniques. Around 50% of the shark was used, while the skin, cartilage, and offal were discarded. In the 1980s, rising demand led to the introduction of gillnets with a medium-sized mesh, designed specifically for this species. Fishery landings increased from a dressed (<b>post-processing)</b> weight of [...] in 1977, to [...] in 1983, to [...] in 1984. The fishery peaked in 1985 and 1986, when 550,000kg (1.2millionlbs) were taken annually, making this species the number one shark fished off California. This level of exploitation was unsustainable, and despite a minimum size limit imposed in 1986, catches fell to [...] in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Dishonored 2 was {{developed}} by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. After having co-directed the first game, Harvey Smith took on the reins as director of Dishonored 2. Though the first Dishonored {{was developed}} by both Arkane teams in Lyon, France and Austin, United States, its sequel was developed largely solely in Lyon as Arkane Studios Austin were focused on developing 2017's Prey. Both studios collaborated on the game, and playtested each other's builds. The game runs on Arkane's internal [...] "Void" [...] engine, as opposed to Unreal Engine 3 that was previously used in Dishonored. The Void engine is based on id Tech 5, though {{the majority of the}} original engine was rewritten. Arkane removed unneeded elements from the engine like the mini open world and overhauled the graphics. The new engine is intended to improve in-game lighting and <b>post-processing</b> to help the game's visuals, and allows the game to visualize subsurface scattering.|$|E
500|$|During {{development}} of Crystal Tools, the Research and Development Division continually surveyed {{what types of}} tools were needed to create Square Enix's flagship titles. Among the most frequently requested features was an extensive use of character close-ups. This made the staff realize that the Final Fantasy series put great emphasis on the [...] "anime-like coolness" [...] of its characters. Consequently, the engine's developers focused on attractive visuals rather than on accurate physics. To achieve a stylized look, a <b>post-processing</b> filter for additional lighting, blur, and visual effects was implemented. Square Enix's large teams were typically composed of a mix of industry veterans and rookie game developers. To accommodate this, the graphical user interface of the engine became another main feature and {{was designed to be}} as intuitive as possible. The large investments into technology and human resources quickly made the White Engine the company's biggest project to date. After one year of work, version 1.0 of the engine was completed in September 2007.|$|E
500|$|The western North Atlantic {{porbeagle}} {{population has}} a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted {{for the period of}} 2002–2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to shark fishing. [...] In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely {{on the basis of the}} low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. [...] In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (<b>post-processing)</b> for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.|$|E
500|$|The Verge {{gave the}} HTC One an 8.3 out of 10; {{aside from the}} {{positioning}} of its power button and navigation keys, which {{were considered to be}} hard to reach, its hardware design was praised for having a [...] "totally unique and somehow still understated" [...] look, while its 1080p display was considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest displays on a smartphone—although not bright enough to be seen properly in direct sunlight. In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be [...] "an impressively powerful phone across the board" [...] due to its high scores on various benchmark tests. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One’s photos were criticized for looking [...] "soft and mushy" [...] due to extensive <b>post-processing</b> and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being [...] "kind of like Vine, except [...] your clips only last a few months and no one’s ever going to use it." [...] The One was also criticized for its [...] "decidedly average" [...] battery life, and for some of the [...] "unintuitive" [...] design changes that HTC made to the Android UI.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{circumstances}} {{it is possible}} to correct some of the effects of chromatic aberration in digital <b>post-processing.</b> [...] However, in real-world circumstances, chromatic aberration results in permanent loss of some image detail. [...] Detailed knowledge of the optical system used to produce the image can allow for some useful correction. [...] In an ideal situation, <b>post-processing</b> to remove or correct lateral chromatic aberration would involve scaling the fringed color channels, or subtracting some of a scaled versions of the fringed channels, so that all channels spatially overlap each other correctly in the final image.|$|E

Klaas Schwartz has noted {{that the success of}} NWSC since 1998 was facilitated by a high level of support from international donors, international lending agencies, and Uganda's national ministries; effective leadership from top management; a highly professional staff; and, strong institutional cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the direct}} {{application}} of these formulas would require O(N2) operations, {{it is possible to}} compute the same thing with only O(N log N) complexity by factorizing the computation similarly to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). One can also compute DCTs via FFTs combined with O(N) pre- and <b>post-processing</b> steps. [...] In general, O(N log N) methods to compute DCTs are known as fast cosine transform (FCT) algorithms.|$|E
2500|$|Digital imaging {{has raised}} ethical {{concerns}} {{because of the}} ease of manipulating digital photographs in <b>post-processing.</b> Many photojournalists have declared they will not crop their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make [...] "photomontages", passing them as [...] "real" [...] photographs. Today's technology has made image editing relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of forensic photography.|$|E
2500|$|... and {{efficient}} FFT algorithms {{have been designed}} for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987). One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley–Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, {{it is possible to}} express an even-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(N) <b>post-processing</b> operations.|$|E
2500|$|Super-resolution optical {{fluctuation}} imaging (SOFI) is a super-resolution {{technique that}} achieves spatial resolutions below the diffraction limit by <b>post-processing</b> analysis with correlation equations, similar to FCS. While original reports of SOFI used fluctuations from stationary, blinking of fluorophores, [...] FCS has been combined with SOFI where fluctuations are produced from diffusing probes to produce super-resolution spatial maps of diffusion coefficients. [...] This {{has been applied}} to understand diffusion and spatial properties of porous materials, including agarose hydrogels and liquid crystals.|$|E
