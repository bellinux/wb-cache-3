5000|$|Characterization {{of small}} {{proteins}} represents a significant challenge for bottom up proteomics {{due to the}} inability to generate sufficient tryptic peptides for analysis. Top-down proteomics allows for low mass protein detection, thus increasing the repertoire of proteins known. While Bottom-up proteomics integrates cleaved products from all proteoforms produced by a gene into a single <b>peptide</b> <b>map</b> of the full-length gene product to tabulate and quantify expressed proteins, a major strength of Top-down proteomics is that it enables researchers to quantitatively track one or more proteoforms from multiple samples and to excise these proteoforms for chemical analysis.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{show that}} the {{alkaline}} phosphatase protein found in cancer cells has similar characteristics to that found in non-malignant body tissues and that the protein originates from the same gene in both the malignant and the non-malignant cells. One study tested the structural comparison between the alkaline phosphatase proteins found in liver giant-cell carcinoma and non-malignant placental cells. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase that was immunochemically similar to placental alkaline phosphatase was purified from metastases of giant-cell carcinoma of the lung and its {{physical and chemical properties}} were determined. Thereafter, these were compared with purified placental alkaline phosphatase. The results showed great similarity in both based on evaluations of NH2-terminal sequence, <b>peptide</b> <b>map,</b> subunit molecular weight, and isoelectronic point. Overall, this study strongly supports the supposition that the alkaline phosphatase protein in both tumor and non-malignant placental cells are derived from the same gene.|$|E
40|$|A {{ubiquitous}} {{post-translational modification}} observed in proteins is isomerization of aspartic acid to isoaspartic acid (isoAsp). This nonenzymatic post-translational modification occurs spontaneously in proteins and {{plays a role}} in aging, autoimmune response, cancer, neurodegeneration and other diseases. Formation of isoAsp is also a significant issue for recombinant monoclonal antibody based protein therapeutics particularly when isomerization occurs in a complementarity-determining region (CDR) due to potential impact to the clinical efficacy. Here, we present and compare three analytical methods to monitor and/or quantify isoAsp formation in a monoclonal antibody. The methods include two <b>peptide</b> <b>map</b> based technologies with quantitation from either UV integration or total ion peak areas, as well as an alternative approach using IdeS digestion to generate Fc/ 2 and Fab’ 2 regions, followed by HIC to separate the population of Fab’ 2 containing an isoAsp.

Although these eight variants showed identical <b>peptide</b> <b>maps,</b> one could be discriminated antigenically from the others with one of the hybridomas. (The <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> represented about one-third of the HA 1 molecule.)

40|$|We have {{prepared}} {{a computer program}} that predicts complete and partial <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> from amino acid sequences. The program fragments amino acid sequences at designated cleavage sites and calculates the molecular weight and relative labeling of each peptide. These data are graphed as log molecular weight of the original protein (X-axis) vs. log molecular weight of the component peptides (Y-axis). The program is interactive, permitting adjustment {{of a number of}} graphic parameters and alteration of the position of proteins in the first dimension to accommodate aberrations in protein mobility. The program has been used to predict the V 8 protease <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> of the 13 open reading frames (ORFs) identified in the human and the mouse mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. The results were compared to the V 8 protease <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> obtained for mouse and human mitochondrially synthesized proteins by two-dimensional proteolytic digest gels.

40|$|Glutamate {{receptor}} ion {{channels are}} colocalized in postsynaptic densities with Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II), which can phosphorylate and strongly enhance non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor current. In this study, CaM-kinase II enhanced kainate currents of expressed glutamate receptor 6 in 293 cells and of wild-type glutamate receptor 1, {{but not the}} Ser- 627 to Ala mutant, in Xenopus oocytes. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 620 - 638 in GluR 1 was phosphorylated in vitro by CaM-kinase II but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C.

The <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> of the major (P- 22) surface antigen polypeptides of GSHsAg and WHsAg showed that they shared over half of their spots. <b>Peptide</b> <b>mapping</b> of HBsAg subtypes indicated a close relationship between the major polypeptides (P- 24) of adw and adr and a more distal relationship to ayw.

Further, the detection of ground squirrel and woodchuck antigens by Ausria II radioimmunoassay, combined with <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping</b> data indicating the common origin of these viruses, suggests that the common a determinant is shared by each and is restricted to approximately 25 % of the sequences in their major polypeptides...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{molecular}} weight determination and structural analysis of polypeptides and peptide mixtures have become amenable {{by the recent}} development of fast atom bombardment (FABMS) and 252 Cf-plasma desorption (PDMS) mass spectrometry. FABMS and PDMS <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping,</b> i. e., the direct analysis of peptide mixtures resulting from proteolytic digestion, have been developed as powerful methods for the structural characterization of epoxide-metabolizing isoenzymes. The major advantage {{of this approach is}} provided by the selectivity of the endoproteolytic cleavage, combined with the specific and accurate {{molecular weight}} determination of complex digest mixtures containing peptides up to several thousand daltons in size. Furthermore, the mass spectrometric <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping</b> analysis can be combined with a range of protein-chemical modification reactions and with sequential degradation such as by carboxypeptidases. Both FABMS and PDMS <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping</b> have already been successfully applied to the structural differentiation of glutathione transferase and epoxide hydrolase isoenzymes in cases where reference sequence data for at least one isoenzyme form was available. In the application described here, for a series of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH) isoenzymes with hitherto undetermined primary structures, a direct correlation between the structural differentiation from <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping</b> data and differences in their substrate specificities could be demonstrated.

The yeast actin-like protein yielded a single spot on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that a single protein species was present. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the actin-like protein had an apparent molecular weight of 45, 000 compared with 42, 000 for muscle actin. In an attempt to identify the messenger ribonucleic acid coding for the actin-like protein, yeast polyadenylic acid-rich ribonucleic acid was translated in wheat germ and reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesizing systems.

40|$|Human choriogonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric hormone {{consisting}} of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit. hCG and aglycosylated hCG (aghCG) have similar receptor binding affinities but {{differ in their}} ability to activate hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase. aghCG is an effective antagonist. The mechanisms of this antagonism and interactions of antagonistic aghCG with the receptor are not understood. To address this critical question, we have examined the interaction of this hormone analog with the receptor. The hormone receptor on porcine granulosa cells is a glycoprotein of 86 kDa and thas three domains of 24 kDa, 28 kDa, and 34 kDa, which are disulfide-linked. They undergo proteolysis, particularly when bound to the hormones, to produce three polypeptide components. These three receptor components can readily be identified through the use of affinity labeling with the hormones. Affinity labeling with an amino-specific homobifunctional reagent and subsequent cleavage indicate that hCG is cross-linked directly to the 24 -kDa receptor component. In contrast, aghCG is cross-linked directly to the 34 -kDa component. The <b>peptide</b> <b>map</b> of the cross-linked aghCG- 34 -kDa receptor component produced by papain treatment is different from the <b>peptide</b> <b>map</b> of the cross-linked complex of hCG- 24 -kDa component.

Tryptic <b>peptide</b> <b>maps</b> of the dog and human acid beta-galactosidases indicate that 21 of the 24 peptides observed were homologous; a similar result was obtained after chymotryptic <b>peptide</b> <b>mapping.</b> We conclude that dog and human acid beta-galactosidases are structurally similar, and that canine GM 1 gangliosidosis (acid beta-galactosidase deficiency) is an excellent model for the same disease in man...|$|R
