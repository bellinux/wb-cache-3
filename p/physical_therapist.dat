40|$|Establishing the {{adequacy}} or inadequacy {{of the supply}} of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists,</b> nationally and across geographic areas, has important policy implications for federal support of education and training of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> This article summarizes research that was undertaken to determine 1) whether <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> {{are in short supply}} nationally, or are geographically maldistributed in the United States, and 2) if there is an uneven distribution, whether it is possible to identify areas lacking <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> The supply of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> at the county level is examined in relation to factors presumed to indicate need for physical therapy services. Next, the distribution of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> is exam-ined in selected groups of counties to determine why some areas are relatively better supplied than others and whether any obvious set of criteria accurately and consistently identifies those areas appearing underserved.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{increasing}} complexity {{and expansion of}} the body of knowledge in physical therapy have led to specialized practice areas to provide better patient care, the impact of specialization on guideline implementation has been scarcely studied. Objectives The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the similarities and differences in barriers to the implementation of a Dutch rheumatoid arthritis (RA) guideline by generalist and specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> Design This observational study consisted of 4 focus group interviews in which 24 <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> (13 generalist and 11 specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists)</b> participated. METHODS: <b>Physical</b> <b>therapists</b> were asked to discuss barriers to the implementation of the RA guideline. Data were analyzed qualitatively using a directed approach to content analysis. Both the interviews and the interview analysis were informed by a previously developed conceptual framework. RESULTS: Besides a number of similarities (eg, lack of time), the present study showed important, although subtle, differences in barriers to the implementation of the RA guideline between generalist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> Generalist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> more frequently reported difficulties in interpreting the guideline (cognitive barriers) and had less favorable opinions about the guideline (affective barriers) than specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> Specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> were hampered by external barriers that are outside the scope of generalist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists,</b> such as a lack of agreement about the roles and responsibilities of medical professionals involved in the care of the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: The identified differences in barriers to the implementation of the RA guideline indicated that the effectiveness of implementation strategies could be improved by tailoring them to the level of specialization of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> However, it is expected that tailoring implementation strategies to barriers that hamper both generalist and specialist <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> will have a larger effect on the implementation of the RA guideline...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhysical {{therapists}} {{use computers}} for administration {{for two decades}} now. The use of computers for clinical documentation is growing. The question arises how <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> think about Electronic Patient Records. 27 students of the bachelor of physical therapy interviewed 44 <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in private practices according to the USE IT-adoption model {{in order to measure}} the adoption of Electronic Patient Records. All <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> use computers in practice, because they are required to register quality and performance indicators for financial reasons. <b>Physical</b> <b>therapists</b> demonstrate a positive attitude towards Electronic Patient Records, because of the potential to share patient data. However, they consider reporting in the EPR time consuming, and often irrelevant for providing good care. In order to achieve adoption of Electronic Patient Records by <b>physical</b> <b>therapists,</b> a rethinking of the rules for reimbursement of physical therapy, including a relieve of the administrative burden, should precede the necessary redesign of EPR's for <b>physical</b> <b>therapists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reliability study. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the interrater-reliability of the interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound in patients with shoulder pain between <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and radiologists. Although <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in The Netherlands increasingly use diagnostic ultrasound in clinical practice, there is no evidence available on its reliability. A cohort study included patients with shoulder pain from primary care physiotherapy. Patients followed the usual diagnostic pathway of which diagnostic ultrasound could be a part. Patients that received diagnostic ultrasound also visited a radiologist within one week for a second one. Patients and radiologists were blinded for the diagnostic ultrasound diagnosis of the <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> Agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistics. Subgroup analysis was performed on education and experience. A total of 65 patients were enrolled and 13 <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and 9 radiologists performed diagnostic ultrasound. We found substantial agreement (0. 63 K) between <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and radiologists on the assessment of full thickness tears.

40|$|Three {{methods were}} used to {{evaluate}} the effects of continuing education on the practices of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in the State of Nebraska. These were: (1) direct observation, (2) record audit and (3) self-reporting. The continuing education program which was used in this study was entitled 2 ̆ 2 Neurodevelopmental Approach to Adults With Hemiplegia. 2 ̆ 2 These variables measured the number of times the participant cited or demonstrated or self-reported the use of {{all or part of the}} neurodevelopmental techniques as they were applied to gait training. The patients receiving gait training were classified by diagnosis as either a cerebrovascular accident or other neurological diagnosis or other diagnosis. ^ An experimental design was used with 15 randomly selected <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in the control group (no continuing education) and 15 (population) <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in the experimental group (attended the continuing education program). Chi-square analyses revealed a possible short- and long-term effect for <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> who self-reported the ata (p 3 ̆c. 01). No significant difference was found for the groups of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> who were observed or for the groups of <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> who were audited. The results suggest that self-reporting may be the most productive dependent variable when evaluating continuing education program effectiveness in physical therapy. The direct observation method had the limitations of: (1) not having enough qualified observers to observe the <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> treating a sufficient number of patients in the time periods designed, and (2) not having sufficient funds and observers to observe <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> throughout the State. The record audit method appeared to be an inappropriate method for collecting the data as the <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> did not tend to record specific methods used for gait training. This study was a first step in determining methods to evaluate continuing education and in identifying some of the problems associated with these methods when evaluating the use of continuing education by <b>physical</b> <b>therapists.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Evidence {{practice}} {{is becoming more}} important in Dutch physical therapy practice. Next to clinically relevant research in Evidence Based Practice {{it is believed that}} individual clinical expertise plays an equally important part. Individual clinical expertise is acquired by clinical experience and clinical practice. Postpartum pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is treated by pelvic <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and general <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in daily clinical practice. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} form a theory about the experiences and competencies needed in the physical therapy care for postpartum PGP according to <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in the field. The secondary aim is to investigate if there is a clear difference between pelvic <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and general <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> in the <b>physical</b> therapy care of postpartum PGP. Method: A qualitative study design consistent with a grounded theory approach was used. Interviews where used for the data collection and the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) was used to facilitate the process of analysis. Results: Eight themes emerged from the data regarding diagnosis, treatment and competencies; the request for help, history and examination and the use of questionnaires; goals of the patient, length of the rehabilitation and elements of the treatment; knowledge competencies and Social communicative competencies This themes relate to two concepts; the patient and practicing physical therapy and fit in the conceptual framework of physical therapy care in postpartum PGP. For the differences between pelvic <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> and general <b>physical</b> <b>therapists</b> showed two themes; pelvic floor and awareness of skills.
