5000|$|In Finland, the Laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta 9.2.1951/83 (Act on the Openness of Public Documents of 1951) {{established}} {{the openness of}} all records and documents {{in the possession of}} officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta 21.5.1999/621 (Act on the Openness of Government Activities of 1999), called in short [...] "Publicity Act" [...] (Julkisuuslaki) also extended the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.|$|E

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> {{transparency}} and accountability {{are at the heart}} of democracy and are the very instruments allowing it to function properly. On the one hand, all EU Member states admit that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> should prevail against secrecy within government. On the other hand, although these principles are increasingly recognized and necessary for any democratic system many disputes have arisen regarding the specific measures of implementation which would in particular be acceptable for the EU legal order. The main aim of the research is to define the state of the public right to information in the EU grounding it to an adequate legal base. The public right of access to information has been admitted as a necessary measure to ensure the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in practice. Promises to promote greater openness within the EU was included in the Maastricht summit as a political goal and resulted in Declaration No. 17 with commitments from member Sates to make Union more open and transparent and as clos...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{shows how}} {{democratic}} politics requires {{a commitment to}} pluralism as engagement and encounter of the other in their otherness. I contend {{that it is necessary}} to commit to such an idea of pluralism because of the problem of incomplete understanding. I establish this premise by drawing on Hans-Georg Gadamer’s account of human finitude. Based on this premise, I argue that the instantiation of Gadamer’s <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> leads democratic politics to pluralism as engagement and encounter of the other. Further, I develop accounts of asymmetric reciprocity, reflexivity, and agonism as modes of democratic politics that instantiate the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness.</b> In chapter 1, I establish discourse as a necessary element for democratic politics by drawing from the way Jurgen Habermas uses ‘discourse ethics’ to address the problems of understanding in plural societies. In chapter 2, I demonstrate how incomplete understanding poses a problem for discourse and gives rise to interpretive conflicts by drawing from Gadamer’s account of human finitude. Here I also develop an account of openness as a suitable principle for beings with incomplete understanding based on Gadamer’s idea of hermeneutical experience. In chapters 3 - 5, I develop accounts of asymmetric reciprocity, reflexivity, and agonism as modes of democratic politics that instantiate the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness.</b> I do so by drawing from Iris Young’s, John Dryzek’s, and Chantal Mouffe’s approaches to the problems that plurality poses to discourse ethics and democratic politics...|$|E

Therefore, competence provides complete and accurate ease of access to stakeholders according to their rights, and opportunities provide constructive input from stakeholders. This can be done by increasing the ability of the application system and HR competences. Thus, openness, accountability, and fairness of the National Banking can be improved (Permata Budi Asri 2011; Ping et al. 2011; Teng et al. 2011).|$|E
