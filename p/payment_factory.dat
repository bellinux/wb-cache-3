40|$|Background and problem: SKF AB, {{one of the}} world's largest {{roller bearing}} {{manufacturing}} companies, has considered {{the introduction of a}} <b>payment</b> <b>factory.</b> This constitutes a potential strategic change and a good opportunity to contribute to literature on management control systems (MCSs) and strategy. Purpose: To investigate the interrelationship between MCSs and strategy through the lens of institutional logics. Research questions: I. How the overarching MCS influences the strategic decision of implementing a <b>payment</b> <b>factory.</b> II. How the strategic change of implementing a <b>payment</b> <b>factory</b> implies a change in the micro MCS controlling the payment process. Theoretical frame: A macro MCS is distinguished from a micro MCS. The macro MCS is defined as critical success factors and their enforcement while the micro MCS is defined as various actions and results controls aimed at controlling the payment process. The micro MCS is the object of strategic change and the enforcement of the macro MCS is viewed through a lens of institutional logics. Method and data: A qualitative study based on interviews, internal and publicly available documentation. Three interviews with treasury departments outside the case firm and three interviews with business unit financial managers inside the case firm supplemented by informal meetings in the group treasury department. Documentation consisting of procedure descriptions, project plans, payment statistics and annual reports. Analysis and conclusions: Dynamics of three distinctive institutional logics were centred around three CSFs identified within the macro MCS. The implied impact of these dynamics and the macro MCS were evaluated in terms of the potential strategic change {{in the form of the}} <b>payment</b> <b>factory.</b> This resulted in two discrete alternative designs of the new payment process with the associated micro MCS designs detailed. Discussion and theoretical contributions: The analysis results in two distinctive professional logics, a controlling logic and a treasury logic, previously not emphasized in the literature. It also leads to a detailed account of the bidirectional nature of the MCS-strategy relationship highlighting the heterogeneity of the MCS concept and the complex nature of the relationship.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{of some of}} the varied chromatographic techniques which have been used in the South African sugar industry over the past 30 years. These include accurate, precise analytical procedures used for cane <b>payment</b> and <b>factory</b> control. Chromatographic procedures for estimating cane delays, troubleshooting for bacterial infection, factory corrosion and measuring inversion in evaporators are reported. Other applications include the determination of polysaccharides, anions and cations in factory products such as juices, molasses and VHP and white sugars...|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, the Floridsdorf factory {{was in the}} Russian {{zone and}} the plants were used for Russian reparations. In 1955, ÖAF was {{released}} from these <b>payments</b> and the <b>factory</b> began producing trucks again. They went to Austria to build military trucks but the Austrian army eventually selected rival Steyr for its famous Pinzgauer. The Tornado was ÖAF' s challenger, best-selling truck in Austria.|$|R
5000|$|Upon Buchalter's 1922 {{release from}} prison, he {{started working with}} his {{childhood}} friend, mobster Jacob [...] "Gurrah" [...] Shapiro. Through force and fear, they began gaining control of the garment industry unions. Buchalter then used the unions to threaten strikes and demand weekly <b>payments</b> from <b>factory</b> owners while dipping into union bank accounts. Buchalter's control of the unions evolved into a protection racket, extending into areas such as bakery trucking. The unions were profitable for him and he kept a hold over them even after becoming an important figure in organized crime. Buchalter later formed an alliance with Tommy Lucchese, {{a leader of the}} Lucchese crime family, and together they controlled the garment district.|$|R
50|$|The O&K CSÉT Shunting Locomotives were a {{class of}} nine small Irish steam {{locomotives}} built in Berlin, Nazi Germany, by Orenstein & Koppel for shunting wagons of sugar beet at the three Irish Sugar Company (Comlucht Siúcre Éireann) factories in Mallow, Thurles and Tuam. (There was another factory at Carlow, but it used vertical-boilered Belgian locomotives.) They were delivered in two batches, with the first six arriving in 1934 and the last three in 1935. The 1934 batch was paid for by barter, using cattle as <b>payment.</b> Each <b>factory</b> received three locomotives, and numbered them independently, leading to each factory having a No. 1, a No. 2 and a No. 3. Each factory applied their own design of number onto the tanks, and in some cases, bufferbeams, of their respective locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s Kingaroy Shire had {{a burgeoning}} peanut {{industry}} {{and was a}} well established centre for maize production, but it was dairying that was the principal primary industry. As {{a measure of the}} industry's growth, the <b>payment</b> to Kingaroy <b>factory</b> suppliers in its first full financial year was £5723. By 1934 this had grown to £157,785. At the end of 1933, cream suppliers to the factory were being paid eight pence per pound for first grade cream, seven pence for second grade.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{relationship}} between popularization of politics, participation, and social media. It does so by investigating the case study Redundancy Island, a «real-reality show» which, starting from Facebook and a blog to then reach the mainstream media, has narrated the protest of workers on redundancy <b>payment</b> at Vynils <b>factory</b> at Porto Torres (north Sardinia). Those workers self-restrained {{for more than a year}} in the former prison of Asinara. The interviews to these «famed» blue-collar workers were made when they were at the height of popularity. The analysis initially focused on their perceptions of media success, aiming to understand the meaning assigned by the workers to both the «novelty» of their protest and the different forms of support they received from fan-like citizens. Moreover, by monitoring the Facebook group seven months after the occupation of Asinara, we could measure the workers' capability to upkeep the citizens' attention in this «reality 2. 0 ». The analysis suggests the interpretation of Redundancy Island as an emblematic (and well performed) attempt to reshape the account of both a specific dispute and the general crisis. It also shows evidence of a more general trend toward the popularization of protest, in a media eco-system «complicated» by the participative web typical of Facebook and blogs...|$|R
