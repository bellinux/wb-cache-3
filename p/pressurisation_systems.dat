40|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} high altitude operations are generally pressurised {{to protect the}} occupants from the adverse effects of hypoxia, decompression illness and hypothermia. Failure of the <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> is a potential threat to flight safety. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and consequences of aircraft decompression events in Australian civil aviation. The aim was to document the prevalence, nature, type, degree and extent of decompression events in Australian civil aviation, as well as the consequences of such events, especially hypoxia and pressure-related medical effects. A search of all incidents and accidents on the ATSB database was made for pressurisation failure events between 1 January 1975 and 31 March 2006. A total of 517 pressurisation failure events were found (two accidents, eight serious incidents and 507 incidents). Only one pressurisation failure event was fatal (0. 2 per cent of the total events). Hypoxia was reported in four of the events, and ear barotrauma was also reported in four events, due to the subsequent emergency descent. A total of 10 events involved death, hypoxia or minor injury. Mechanical factors were responsible for the majority of <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> failures (73 per cent). The average rate of cabin pressure change was 1, 700 feet per minute, and the average maximum cabin altitude reached was 10, 978 feet. In general, the results of this study show that there is a high chance of surviving a <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> failure, provided that the failure is recognised and the corresponding emergency procedures are carried out expeditiously. Aircrew should maintain a high level of vigilance with respect to the potential hazards of cabin <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> failure...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{propellant}} storage, {{feed and}} management systems {{are an important}} domain in preliminary launcher design activities, as they drive system-level masses and vehicle layout. The Propellant Management Program (PMP) {{was developed by the}} German Aerospace Centre (DLR) department of Space Launcher Systems Analysis (SART) for rapid tank, feedline, pressurisation, cross-feeding and venting analysis. This program {{is an important part of}} DLR-SART’s development toolbox, and has an intended application in the initial sizing of propellant storage and management systems for new launcher concepts. While the physical models behind the program, such as thermal behaviour of propellant and tanks in flight, are welldeveloped, the application of the program as a preliminary design tool is yet to be validated. A wealth of data is publicly available for the Saturn-V rocket, including stage fact sheets flight data from the Apollo missions. This paper details the simulation of the Saturn-V rocket propellant storage, feed and <b>pressurisation</b> <b>systems,</b> undertaken as part of the validation of PMP as a preliminary design tool. The high complexity of the layout and propellant management strategy of the Saturn-V rocket also provided additional functional requirements for future versions of PMP, and highlighted the need for a new pressurisation system control scheme...|$|E
40|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{failures of}} acetabular fixation within {{ten years of}} primary cemented hip replacement are attributable to a failure to achieve good initial fixation of bone and cement. Several {{studies have suggested that}} to achieve good fixation between bone and cement between 3 mm and 5 mm of cement penetration into bone is desirable. Whilst several acetabular cement <b>pressurisation</b> <b>systems</b> exist, {{little is known about the}} effects of cement pressurisation on the pattern of pen-etration of cement into cancellous bone within the pelvis. The current paper assesses the penetration of bone cement into bovine acetabular bone by various pressurisation techniques. We found that pressurisation with the use of a swab in glove or the DePuy pressuriser led to improvement in cement penetration both in terms of maximum depth and also percentage cover of the cup by cement (p < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in mean maximal penetration between the use of the pressuriser and the swab in a glove technique (p = 0. 3). If only a plain cup was used as a pressuriser, the penetration achieved was significantly lower in comparison to use of a pressuriser (p < 0. 02). When compared to previously documented acrylic models, the pattern of intrusion noted in the bovine model was different: penetration was lower at the equatorial and base regions of the acetabulum...|$|E
40|$|Stair <b>Pressurisation</b> <b>Systems</b> (SPS) are a form {{of smoke}} control used in many {{high-rise}} buildings. They are designed to keep smoke out of the stairwell so that occupants have a safe evacuation route during an emergency. Throughout the years, however, many within the Fire Engineering industry have commented that SPS do not really perform as per their design intent. In order to assess this belief, an investigation was undertaken to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} SPS, whereby the effectiveness was assessed by considering the following: if the SPS operates, will the resulting performance be as required by the Australian Standards (i. e. AS 1668. 1 1998) and when required, will the SPS or components actually operate. To do this, two representative SPS within the Melbourne Central Business District were investigated; one with a Variable Speed Drive (VSD), System 1, typical of systems installed more recently and one without a VSD, System 2, typical of earlier types of SPS. The effectiveness evaluation was divided into two parts. The first considered the influence of variations to wind speed, temperature and leakage (referred to as the E-factors), while the second considered the 'other factors' or F-factors, affecting the effectiveness of a SPS (i. e. those factors that can be influenced by commissioning, maintenance, operation of the system, etc.). For this study, these two parts were assessed in isolation to each other, such that when the E-factors were assessed, the other influences were considered not to exhibit any faults. Similarly, when considering the influence of the F-factors, the influence of the E-factors was ignored. The influence of the E-factors was assessed in terms of achieving the door opening force and airflow performance conditions of AS 1668. 1. This was done using a computer network program known as CONTAM. Initially a base building model was developed, complying with the performance conditions of the Australian Standard and then variables such as external temperatures, wind and leakage associated with the building elements were varied as part of a sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that in most cases (unless extreme conditions were used), the effectiveness of the SPS was nearly equal to unity (i. e. ' 1 '). The SPS with a VSD also had a slightly higher effectiveness than the system without, when 'Average' leakage conditions were modelled. However, if the stairwell leakage approached the building facade leakage, the effectiveness in relation to achieving the airflow velocity conditions of AS 1668. 1, for both Systems 1 and 2, significantly reduced. The 'other factors' which may influence the effectiveness of a SPS were those that could be influenced by the design, installation, commissioning, maintenance and operation of the SPS and were assessed after interrelationship diagrams, in the form of fault trees were developed. These diagrams detailed the complex integration of the various components, which make up a SPS and assisted in identifying which components appear to be the most dominant in terms of reducing the reliability of the system. Probability of failure data was obtained through a survey completed by industry personnel intimately associated with SPS. The reliability assessment indicated that the two major dominant factors, in terms of not achieving the performance conditions of AS 1668. 1, were high door opening forces, followed by low airflow velocities. The importance of high door opening forces is significant, as occupants who cannot enter the stairwell in an emergency, {{may not be able to}} evacuate safely. The maintenance requirements associated with SPS as per AS 1851. 6, are illustrated in this thesis in relation to the fault tree diagrams. The results revealed that some of the dominant factors (such as the VSD, the pressure sensor, etc.), achieved low levels of effectiveness. These factors are only considered during the commissioning stage and there is no formal maintenance for these items. These findings help to reinforce the importance of commissioning as well as maintenance (especially for items currently not maintained) and the need for identified faults to be corrected as soon as they are found, or at least prior to the next maintenance inspection. Assessing the effectiveness of a SPS, with respect to the performance conditions of AS 1668. 1, found that the factors referred to as 'other factors' have a greater influence on SPS effectiveness than variations due to wind, temperature and leakage changes. Having said this though, the results generated indicate that SPS are not very effective in terms of achieving the performance conditions of AS 1668. 1 for the whole system (i. e. every door). For example, there is a 1 / 10 chance that the door opening forces will comply and approximately a 1 / 2 chance that the airflow velocities will meet the required performance conditions. These low probabilities are for buildings that are being "commissioned" and "maintained", indicating that although factors appear to be identified, they are not being adequately corrected. In summary, if commissioning is performed correctly, and so too the maintenance, the reliability associated with the components can be significantly improved and therefore, so can the overall effectiveness of the SPS...|$|E
50|$|This high {{performance}} {{is due to}} the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine—the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved.

50|$|Foil bearings, {{also known}} as foil-air bearings, are a type of air bearing. A shaft is {{supported}} by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no contact. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.|$|R

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} at 15:35:15 UTC on 4 November 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. About 260 seconds into the flight, the oxidiser <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system</b> malfunctioned, resulting in cavitation within the feed lines and turbopump.

Although the lower stages of the rocket were still able to place the upper stage and payload into a low Earth orbit, vibrations caused by either the cavitation problem, or a separate problem with the next stage, caused a fuse to become dislodged in the electrical system controlling the upper stage engine. This prevented the Blok L upper stage igniting, leaving the spacecraft in its parking orbit. It decayed from orbit the next day.

5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser <b>pressurisation</b> <b>system,</b> which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|R
