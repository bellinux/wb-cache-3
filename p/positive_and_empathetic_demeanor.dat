2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{was developed}} in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional <b>positive</b> regard, <b>and</b> <b>empathetic</b> understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks {{to get a glimpse of}} the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called self-actualization. From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as humanistic psychodrama. [...] According to humanistic thinking, each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} if there is a relationship between levels of emotional intelligence and burnout among academicians. In this context, for the theoretical part, emotional intelligence and burnout was investigated by reviewing the literature and explaining the relationship between emotional intelligence and burnout was determined as the sub-{{aim of the}} study. Emotional intelligence of academicians will be determined as Positive Emotional Evaluation, <b>Positive</b> Emotional Management, <b>and</b> <b>Empathetic</b> Susceptibility dimensions by using Chan’s EI 12 scale. It will be investigated if the emotional intelligence of the academicians differs according to the demographic characteristics such as their term of employment, age, gender, title, field of education. Maslach Burnout Scale was used to evaluate the burnout dimension. In this study, the burnout dimensions were determined as Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Achievement, Emotional Toughness, Emotional Softening and Depersonalization. The changes in emotional intelligence and elements of burnout were investigated using the demographic variables. During the research conducted to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence and burnout, t-test, variance analysis, factor analysis, correlation and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. The relationship was found between emotional intelligence and burnout...|$|R

The Turkish Version of California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory, The Turkish Version of Problem Solving Inventory <b>and</b> <b>Empathetic</b> Tendency Scale were used to collect data.

50|$|Although, {{the public}} opinion is that message boards are harmful, the {{following}} studies show how they point to suicide prevention <b>and</b> have <b>positive</b> influences. A study using content analysis analyzed all of the postings on the AOL Suicide Bulletin Board over 11 months, and concluded that most contributions contained <b>positive,</b> <b>empathetic</b> <b>and</b> supportive postings (Eichenberg, 2008). Then, a multi-method study was able {{to demonstrate that the}} users of such forums experience a great deal of social support and only a small amount of social strain. Lastly, in a survey participants were asked to assess the extent of their suicidal thoughts on a 7-level scale (0, absolutely no suicidal thoughts, to 7, very strong suicidal thoughts) for the time directly before their first forum visit and {{at the time of the}} survey (Eichenberg, 2008). The study found significant reduction after using the forum. The study however cannot conclude the forum is the only reason for decrease. Together, these studies show how forums can reduce the number of suicides.|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityMany mental health programs are designed for the dominant culture and are adapted {{to be applied to}} various non-dominant cultures such as the Chicano population. This means that Chicano adolescents' needs, especially any who are from an oppressed culture are not addressed. Therefore, services designed specifically for at-risk Chicano adolescents are vital. In this study, these concerns are addressed through the development of an intervention designed specifically for Chicano adolescents involved in delinquency to help promote positive interpersonal relationships. The intervention used the adolescents' interest in dating relationships to capture their attention and then attach concepts from the integrated literature on Chicano values, oppressed culture, and adolescent development meaningfully to their own lives. The overall goal is to pool all this knowledge in order to develop and test a pilot of this intervention for at -risk Chicano adolescents. The intervention was designed as a sixteen session psycho-educational group for Chicano adolescent males. It focused on helping these adolescents develop <b>and</b> sustain more <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>empathetic</b> opposite sex relationships. The intervention also utilized school they attend, and multiple adults and peer groups that have meaning in the children's lives. In order to do prevention for children, one must closely examine at the systems and groupings that affect them. One of the main systems that a child becomes involved in is the parental system, consisting of the child's mother and father or any other guardian acting as the responsible parent. Much research (Florsheim, 2003; Gottman & Katz, 1996; Peterson & Zill, 1986) suggests that the parental system has immense effects on the children involved. For instance, as the parents interact around their children, the children will pick up on the parents' moods or the parents' moods will affect their interactions with their children. From this systemic point of view, the best way to provide prevention would be to start working with the parental system as early as possible before negative patterns begin to form. Although the parental system is often conceptualized as "a couple ", the focus here is on systems. The parental system may include a limited relationship between separated parents, the inclusion of a grandparent, or a network of friends and family who will step in as co-parents. Since most parental systems include a couple, the logical approach for prevention of negative patterns within the couple would be to intervene at the earliest formation of couples. When looking at the early couple system, one need go no further than high school. In high school {{a large portion of the}} adolescent population begins their interest in, and experiments with, dating relationships. This study will focus on creating an intervention for adolescent dating relationships as a developmentally appropriate precursor to later intimate and romantic relationships (Furman, 2002). This is a good time to begin dialogue about partner relationships because of adolescent interest in dating relationships as a part of their developmental stage. If interventions such as Chicano Life are shown to be more efficacious than standard interventions, practitioners and governmental institutions will need to account for why they too often offer a one size fits all type of intervention...|$|R
