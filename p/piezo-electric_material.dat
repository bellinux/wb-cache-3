In the introduction, the most important among the present and future systems are listed and their main characteristics are briefly indicated. The case of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) presently studied in the European community to enter service {{in the beginning of the}} 2000 's is particularly discussed since, it is now, the most ambitious project in this field. The equipments of the future numerical radiocommunication systems will include a large number of piezo-electric devices for filtering and frequency generation. New characteristics (higher frequencies, larger bandwidth, very reduced dimensions, etc [...] .) will be required for these devices so that new developments will be necessary to find solutions to these requirements. It is believed, that the corresponding evolutions will be very significant of the main trends in piezo-electricity for the next ten years. This paper review the UHF and VHF filtering technologies and the frequency generation techniques the most likely to be used in the future radiomobile systems. For each kind of devices (filters for either UHF or an intermediate frequency and frequency sources), we discuss the most probable requirements, the present state of the different technologies, the new advances required to develop highly miniaturized devices for the mobile equipments or high performances sub-assembly for the base stations. In most cases, it appears that the availability of new <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>materials</b> and the obtainment of better characteristics for the existing materials will be essential factors in the achievement of the required characteristics for these devices.

50|$|Any thermoacoustic {{imaging device}} {{requires}} {{a source of}} electromagnetic radiation, be it a laser or a microwave antenna, to deliver energy to the anatomy being studied, and one or more acoustic detectors coupled acoustically to the outside surface of the anatomy, as is illustrated in Fig. 4. The typical acoustic detector is an ultrasound transducer, which is commonly made of a <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>material</b> that converts detected pressure to an electrical signal. Thermoacoustic waves are induced within the anatomy wherever absorption takes place, {{and the strength of}} these thermoacoustic waves is proportional to the energy absorbed within the tissue. Some of these waves propagate through the anatomy over some time interval (time-of-flight) before being detected by {{one or more of the}} acoustic transducers. The exact time-of-flight is proportional to the distance between an absorption site and a transducer, assuming for the moment that each transducer is a point detector. For any given time-of-flight, each transducer will receive the sum of the thermoacoustic waves originating at the same distance from the detector in question as is illustrated in Fig. 5. For this reason, ambiguity arises when attempting to localize an absorption site with a point transducer. A variety of stratgies have been employed to mitigate this ambiguity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accuracies}} of all AFM techniques {{rely heavily}} on a sample scanning tube, the piezo-tube. The piezo-tube scanner {{is responsible for the}} direction of tip displacement during a sample analysis, and is dependent on the mode of analysis. The piezo components are either arranged orthogonally or manufactured as a cylinder. In all techniques, sample topography is measured by the movement of the x and y piezos. When performing non-contact mode pc-AFM, the piezo-tube keeps the probe from moving in the x and y direction and measures the photocurrent between the sample surface and conducting tip in the z-direction. [...] The principles of the piezo-tube is dependent upon how the <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>material</b> reacts with an applied voltage to either the interior or exterior of the tube. When voltage is applied to the two electrodes connected to the scanner, the tube will expand or contract causing motion to the AFM tip in the direction of this movement. This phenomenon is illustrated as the piezo-tube becomes displaced by an angle, θ. As the tube is displaced, the sample that, in traditional AFM is fixed to the tube generates lateral translation and rotation relative to the AFM tip, thus movement of the tip is generated in the x and y directions When voltage is applied of the inside of the tube, movement in the z-direction is implemented.The relationship between the movement of the piezo-tube and the direction of the displacement of the AFM tip assumes that the tube is perfectly symmetric. When no voltage is applied to the tube the z-axis bisects the tube, sample and sample stage symmetrically. When a voltage is applied to the exterior of the tube (x and y motion), the expansion of the tube can be understood as a circular arc. In this equation, the r term indicates the outside radius of the piezo-tube, R is the curvature radius of the tube with applied voltage, θ is the bend angle of the tube, L is the initial length of the tube and ΔL is the extension of the tube after the voltage is applied. The change in length of the piezo-tube, ΔL, is expressed as the intensity of the electric field applied to the exterior of the tube, the voltage along the x-axis, Ux, and the thickness of the wall of the tube.|$|E

Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys (MSMA) are {{attractive}} active materials {{because they have}} large strain (about 10 %) as the classical shape memory alloys (SMA), but can provide a 100 times shorter time response, so, MSAM will be the ideal material of structural engineering vibration control.

40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{process of}} {{acquiring}} the energy surround-ing a system and converting it into usable electrical energy is termed power harvesting. In {{the last few}} years, {{there has been a}} surge of {{research in the area of}} power harvesting. This increase in research has been brought on by the mod-ern advances in wireless technology and low-power electron-ics such as microelectromechanical systems. The advances have allowed numerous doors to open for power harvesting systems in practical real-world applications. The use of pie-zoelectric materials to capitalize on the ambient vibrations surrounding a system is one method that has seen a dramat-ic rise in use for power harvesting. Piezoelectric materials have a crystalline structure that provides them with the ability to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge and, vice versa, to convert an applied electrical potential into mechanical strain. This property provides these materials with the ability to absorb mechanical energy from their surround-ings, usually ambient vibration, and transform it into electrical energy that can be used to power other devices. While <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>materials</b> are the major method of harvesting energy, other methods do exist; for example, one of the conventional methods is the use of electromagnetic devices.

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{employed}} to help reduce both mechanical and acoustic vibrations within the system. Mechanical vibrations are mainly attributed to traffic {{in and out of}} a building Other sources of mechanical vibrations have often been seen in the higher stories of a building due to reduced damping from building supports. This source of vibrational noise is easily controlled through the use of a vibration isolation table. Acoustical vibrations are far more common than mechanical vibrations. This type of vibration is a result of air movement near the instrument such as fans or human voices. Several {{methods have been}} developed to help reduce this source of vibration. An easy solution for this is separating the electronic components from the stage. The reason for this separation of components is due to the cooling fans within the electrical devices. While operating, the fans lead to a constant source of vibrational noise within the system. In most cases, other methods still need to be employed to help reduce this source of noise. For instance, the instrument can be placed within a sealed box constructed of acoustic dampening material. Smaller stages also result in less surface area for acoustic vibrations to collide with, thus reducing the noise recorded. A more in depth solution consists of removing all sharp edges on the instrument. These sharp edges can excite resonances within the <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>materials</b> which increase the acoustic noise within the system.|$|R

MSMA are attractive active materials because they have large strain (about 10 %) as the classical shape memory alloys (SMA), but can provide a 100 times shorter time response.

This device is a push-pull actuator: two pieces of MSMA material act in an opposite way. The magnetic fields are created by coils and concentrated by ferromagnetic circuits. In order to move {{the central part of}} the actuator, a current pulse in the first coil is generated.

Dots of metal film and grooves {{have been used}} as reflectors; reflection is caused by the mechanical discontinuity. This research project is a study of an alternative reflector, the thin metal dot, which reflects by interacting with the electric field that accompanies the SAW on a <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>material.</b> Experimental work is done on Y-cut LiNbO 3, a common SAW material, the aim being to characterise the reflection mechanism sufficiently to design devices, particularly on this material. Reflectivities of a large range of dot sizes is reported. Velocity change due to dots, another parameter required in device design, is also measured. In addition, holes in a metal film, physically the opposite of dots, are also studied. A theorectical model is developed to predict the behaviour of dots in devices. For a Z -propagating wave in LiNbO 3, the SAW velocity for completely free and completely metallised surfaces were used to specify the properties of the material. For propagation in other directions on the surface, particularly near the X direction, a different acoustic mode, the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), has an influence on SAW reflections, and the model also requires the LSW velocities under the same two conditions. The model uses these parameters, together with dot geometry, to determine reflectivity in any direction and velocity change due to the dots. The results agree well with experiments. A device (a RAC) is designed using this model, to bring out any unforseen difficulties in the use of dot arrays.

The classical structural analysis considers the mechanical loads and aims to evaluate the stress fields due to these external forces. When complex structures are subject to a strong temperature variation they may present a large deformation that may produce complex stress fields. The evaluation of these deformations is mandatory {{in order to avoid}} the failure of the structure, that is, a thermo-mechanical analysis should be performed. Moreover, the use of advanced <b>materials,</b> such as <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>materials,</b> allows the displacement filed to be evaluated, if they are used as sensors, or, the deformations to be reduced, if they are used as actuators. Multi-field analyses are mandatory in these cases and accurate thermo-piezo-elastic models must be used to predict the response of the structure. Complex stress fields cannot be investigated using classical structural models, beams and plates, because their kinematic assumptions, e. g. rigid cross-section for the beam of constant thickness for the plates. The use of three-dimensional models may achieve accurate results but it may require a huge computational cost. The present work extends the use of a refined node-dependent kinematic one-dimensional model to the thermo-piezo-mechanical analysis. Node-dependent kinematic one-dimensional models allow refined kinematic models to be used only in the area of the structure where complex phenomena are expected, that is, these models are able to reduce the computational cost preserving the accuracy of the results only where is required. The fully coupled thermo-piezo-elastic model has been derived in the framework of the Carrera unified Formulation that allows the structural matrices to be written in a general and compact form.

Conventional ultrasound transducers employ <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>material</b> to convert sound pressure to an electronic signal. An array requires individual fabrication, placement and wiring of these transducers. Last decades, micro-machined ultrasound transducers (MUTs) have received large interest. Array MUTs are fabricated and wired directly as a single silicon "chip". This micro-machining technology leverages the cost-effective wafer-scale CMOS technology that was developed by the semiconductor industry. A MUT consists of a flexible membrane that is sensitive to ultrasonic pressure waves, like a drumhead. The membrane deformation is most commonly measured by recording the electrical capacitance between the membrane and a fixed bottom plate. Unfortunately, these MUTs do not meet the sensitivity of piezo-electric transducers. Moreover, electrical transducers normally require a coaxial wire for each array element. The size of this wire bundle is, for example, problematic in medical intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), where atherosclerosis is diagnosed from a high-resolution ultrasonograph of the artery wall that is obtained by catheter which is brought inside the blood vessel. We propose a new type of ultrasound microphone that consists of a silicon photonic micro-ring resonator integrated in the membrane of a MUT. Incident ultrasonic pressure waves deform the membrane and thus deform the resonator, thereby shifting its optical resonance frequencies. This shift is accurately recorded by an external interrogation system. Next to the resonators, it is possible to integrate tiny optical multiplexers on the same chip so that many resonators can be simultaneously interrogated via a single optical fiber. Moreover, the all-optical sensor {{can be used in}} MRI scanners. We proved the operation principle of this new ultrasound microphone. The designed, fabricated and characterized microphone consists of a photonic racetrack-shaped resonator (footprint 50 ?m by 10 ?m, height 0. 220 ?m) that is integrated in an acoustically resonant silicon-dioxide membrane (diameter 0. 124 mm, height 2. 5 ?m). Fabrication of the microphone demonstrated successful integration of silicon photonic circuits in silicon micro-mechanical systems. First the photonic circuit was fabricated in a semi-industrial CMOS line. Second the membrane was fabricated by etching a hole from the back-side of the wafer using a Bosch etch process. The photonic micro-ring resonator was interrogated using a laser and a photo-receiver, providing a minimal detectable wavelength shift of 36 fm. We measured an ultrasonic minimal detection level (noise equivalent pressure) below 1 Pa which is on the same order of magnitude as the state-of-the-art of PZT piezo-electric based transducers. The microphone showed an acoustical resonance around 0. 75 MHz with a - 6 dB bandwidth of 20 %. We only studied the most simple configuration of this microphone {{and there is a lot}} of room for improvement. The relation between a deformation of the micro-ring resonator and the shift in the resonance wavelengths was studied in a well-defined static mechanical setup. Depending on the width of the waveguide and the orientation of the silicon crystal, the linear wavelength shift per applied strain varies between 0. 5 and 0. 75 pm/microstrain for infrared light around 1550 nm wavelength. The influence of the increasing ring circumference is about three times larger than the influence of the change in the propagation speed of the light through the waveguide (effective index), and the two effects oppose each other. The strong dispersion in silicon sub-wavelength waveguides (400 nm by 220 nm) accounts for a decrease in sensitivity of about a factor two. The optical characteristics of the micro-ring resonators and their components were extensively studied. Different methods to characterize directional couplers (direct and in ring-resonators) gave similar results. An interesting observation was that directional couplers introduce a large coupling-induced phase delay when nearly all light couples from one waveguide to the other. Most properties of silicon ring resonators and their components can be computed using approximate analytical theories. Many theories on integrated optics were originally derived for low-index-contrast waveguides like optical fibers (?n < 0. 1). We reviewed and revised those theories for application to silicon-on-insulator waveguides which have a very high index contrast (?n ~ 2). This work is formulated such that it can be used in a university course with only basic theory of electrodynamics as prerequisite. Analytical theories provide insight and allow fast computation of the behavior of photonic devices and circuits. In conclusion, we studied silicon photonic micro-ring resonators and their application in mechanical sensing. Application of these sensors in micro-machined ultrasound transducers opens new opportunities for ultrasonic array technology. Department of Imaging PhysicsApplied Science...|$|E

Thus, in order for tangential motion to ensue, an associated lift-up in the direction normal to the surface, will take place. Although this behaviour has been sporadically pointed out in literature, we believe that the butterfly curves associated with it during presliding have not been reported before. We have performed dry, pre-sliding rubbing experiments that show that there is a regular, relative normal displacement associated with the tangential motion; in particular, that normal motion describes rate-independent, hysteresis, butterfly curves (similar in nature to those found in <b>piezo-electric</b> and magnetic <b>materials),</b> in the tangential displacement and in the tangential force respectively. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A unified {{method to}} {{evaluate}} the fundamental solutions for generally anisotropic multi-field materials is presented. Based on {{the relation between the}} Rayleigh expansion and the three-dimensional Fourier representation of a homogenous partial differential operator, the proposed technique allows to obtain the fundamental solutions and their derivatives up to the desired order as convergent series of spherical harmonics. For a given material, the coefficients of the series are computed only once, and the derivatives of the fundamental solutions are obtained without any term-by-term differentiation, making the proposed approach attractive for boundary integral formulations and efficient for numerical implementation. Useful general relationships for the computation of derivatives of various order of the fundamental solutions are presented. Furthermore, no particular treatment is needed for mathematically degenerate cases. The fundamental solutions of the Laplace equation and isotropic elastic solids are exactly retrieved as special cases. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach for isotropic elastic, generally anisotropic elastic, transversely isotropic and generally anisotropic <b>piezo-electric</b> and magneto-electro-elastic <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{systems will}} be used as {{precursors}} to human exploration to explore the solar system and expand our knowledge of planetary surfaces. Robotic systems will also be used to build habitats and infrastructure required for human presence in space and on other planetary surfaces. Such robots will require a high level of intelligence and automation. The ability to flexibly manipulate their physical environment is one characteristic that makes humans so effective at these building and exploring tasks. The development of a generic autonomous grasp ing capability will greatly enhance the efficiency and ability of robotics to build, maintain and explore. To tele-operate a robot over vast distances of space, with long communication delays, has proven to be troublesome. Having an autonomous grasping capability that can react in real-time to disturbances or adapt to generic objects, without operator intervention, will reduce the probability of mishandled tools and samples and reduce the number of re-grasp attempts due to dropping. One aspect that separates humans from machines is a rich sensor set. We have the ability to feel objects and respond to forces and textures. The development of touch or tactile sensors for use on a robot that emulates human skin and nerves is the basis for this discussion. We will discuss the use of new <b>piezo-electric</b> and resistive <b>materials</b> that have emerged on the market with the intention of developing a touch sensitive sensor. With viable tacti le sensors we will be one step closer to developing an autonomous grasping capability...|$|R
40|$|One {{characteristic}} of sliding friction {{is that the}} apparent load carrying capacity of the contact increases with the sliding speed. This is true for both dry and lubricated friction. In dry conditions this is so because, owing to decreasing adhesion influence with speed, a single asperity will be more active, so more in contact, per unit displacement, or more "available" for load carrying. In lubricated conditions a pressure build up can be observed with rising sliding speed due to the hydrodynamic effect of the fluid. In this configuration at high speed or low load the contact {{can be seen as}} a hydrodynamic bearing. The lubrication regimes are commonly divided into: Boundary Lubrication (BL), Mixed Lubrication (ML) and Full Lubrication or Hydrodynamic Lubrication (FL, HL). In the BL regime the lubricant’s hydrodynamic action is negligible and the load is carried directly by the surface asperities, similar to dry friction contact. In de ML regime the load is carried by the lubricant’s hydrodynamic action and/or directly by surface asperities. When the load is carried totally by the lubricant film the contact enters FL regime. Consequently, when the normal load is constant, for a given slider, the number of contacting asperities will decrease with increasing sliding speed, i. e., the slider will lift up. This behaviour has already been observed by several researchers. Several explanations have been offered in the past, notably (i) Amontons’ classical, but controversial hypothesis that the asperities on the mating surfaces have to surmount each other (the mean asperity slope representing then the coefficient of friction), and (ii) Tolstoi’s questionable hypothesis that the effect be owing to induced normal vibrations coupled with the non-linear asperity stiffness behaviour. Another explanation of the phenomenon could be given, namely that it is a direct consequence of adhesion, deformation, creep and pressure build up, which in fact resolves the contradiction of the first view without excluding the second. Here, we present experimental evidence of the increasing bearing capacity which results in a lift-up effect for dry as for lubricated friction. We performed dry and lubricated, sliding rubbing experiments that show a relative normal displacement associated with the tangential motion. In particular, with periodic tangential input, the normal motion describes regular, hysteresis, butterfly like curves (similar in nature to those found in <b>piezo-electric</b> and magnetic <b>materials).</b> This paper explores the basic behaviour of the lift-up effect and those butterfly curves experimentally. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of self-powered system for powering small scale power electronic {{devices such as}} wireless networks and nodes, radio frequency based tags or readers and wireless sensors for applications like structural condition monitoring (SCM) and wireless data recording are getting very popular. The integration of vibration based energy harvesters with the above mentioned devices is a promising approach towards self-powered systems. The techniques of vibration based energy harvesting involve utilization of either <b>piezo-electric</b> or magnetostrictive <b>materials.</b> However, the active materials mostly employed in energy harvesters are either too expensive or are not commonly available. The objective {{of the study is}} to utilize construction material more specifically structural steel as an active material because of its abundant availability and practical applications in bridges buildings and rail tracks etc. The literature study regarding various energy harvesting techniques and their applications are presented first to emphasize the importance of vibration based energy harvesting. The prototype design of the proposed energy harvester including the design of mechanical grips and magnetic circuit are discussed in detail. Three different test samples are utilized in which two samples are constructed {{in the form of a}} stack using 1 mm and 1. 5 mm thick steel sheets and the third sample is a solid steel bar with the dimensions of 20 mm x 20 mm. The free length and cross-sectional area of each sample are 100 mm and 400 mm 2 respectively. The measurement method developed for single steel tester is utilized and a new method for obtaining magnetization curves is proposed in the study. In order to determine the effect of stress on magnetization curves, the test sample is first stressed statically using AC magnetization to obtain the stress dependent magnetization curves. It is observed that the permeability of the test material changes under tensile and compressive stress showing the stress dependent magnetic characteristic of the material. To experimentally verify the validity of measurement method and the proposed method, the test sample is stressed dynamically using DC magnetization inducing voltage in the pickup coil. The induced voltage is because of the inverse magnetostriction also known as Villari effect. The results from the solid steel sample and the sample made up of steel sheets are compared during cyclic loading. The steel sheet sample does not go into saturation because of the changing magnetic circuit length as well as the air gap caused by the buckling of individual sheets. Whereas, the induced voltage from the pickup coil starts dropping in case of solid sample which shows that the material is reaching saturation. To validate the magnetization curves obtained from the proposed method, the magnetizing current (I) for maximum ΔB (change in flux density) is calculated which is compared with the I at peak amplitude of the induced voltage curve. The results from the calculations do not take into the account the eddy current losses or hysteresis and therefore the measured results deviate slightly from the calculated results. The maximum power is measured at the point of maximum ΔB value by varying the load resistance for two different cases of cyclic loading. The average output power is measured 13. 3 μW for cyclic loading from zero to - 20 MPa and 8. 76 μW for cyclic loading from 2. 5 to 25 MPa at 11 Hz of mechanical vibration using 2. 62 Ω load resistance...|$|R
