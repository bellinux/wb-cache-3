As the use of RGO has increased, product safety concerns have become more important. Methods: In the present study, the subacute oral toxicity and bacterial reverse mutagenicity of RGO were evaluated. Sprague–Dawley rats were orally administered with RGO for 28 d by gavage. Daily RGO dose concentrations were 0  mg/kg body weight (bw), 500  mg/kg bw, 1, 000  mg/kg bw, or 2, 000  mg/kg bw per day. Bacterial reverse mutation tests included five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli WP 2 and Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, and TA 1537), which {{were used in the}} presence or absence of metabolic activation. The <b>plated</b> <b>incorporation</b> <b>method</b> for mutation test was used with RGO concentrations ranging from 312. 5  μg to 5, 000  μg per plate.

There were no toxicological changes related to RGO administration in hematological and serum biochemical characteristics in either control or treatment animals. Furthermore, no gross or histopathological changes related to RGO treatment were observed. The bacterial reverse mutation test results did not reveal, at any RGO concentration level and in all bacterial strains, any increase in the number of revertant colonies in the RGO treatment group compared to that in the negative control group.

Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebiasis, may develop resistance to nitroimidazoles, a group of drugs {{considered to be the}} most effective against this parasitic disease. Therefore, research on new drugs for the treatment of this common infection still constitutes {{an important}} therapeutic demand. In the present study we determined the effects of a carbamate derivative, ethyl 4 -chlorophenylcarbamate (C 4), on trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM- 1 :IMSS. C 4 was subject to various toxicity tests, including the determination of mutagenicity for bacterial DNA and changes in the enzymatic activities of eukaryotic cells. Genotoxicity studies were performed by the mutagenicity Ames test (<b>plate</b> <b>incorporation</b> and preincubation <b>methods)</b> with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with or without metabolic activation produced by the S 9 fraction of rat liver. C 4 toxicity studies were performed by measuring enzymatic activity in eukaryotic cells by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide-formazan test with Fischer 344 rat hepatocytes. C 4 did not induce either frame-shift mutations in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium TA 97 or TA 98 or base pair substitutions in strains TA 100 and TA 102. The compound was not toxic for cultured rat hepatic cells. Trophozoites treated with 100 μg of C 4 per ml were inhibited 97. 88 % at 48 h of culture; moreover, damage to the amoebae was also confirmed by electron microscopy. The antiamoebic activity of C 4 was evaluated by using an in vivo model of amoebic liver abscess in hamsters. Doses of 75 and 100 mg/ 100 g of body weight reduced the extent of the amoebic liver abscess by 84 and 94 %, respectively.

At the moment of sample collection, the subjects were invited to fill a questionnaire on their main characteristics and lifestyle. On the basis of laboratory data analysis, it emerged that, on 288 samples with a valuable mutagenic activity, 20 urinary extracts (8 of which were males and 12 were females) showed mutagenicity levels twice as much as spontaneous revertants. Diet and indoor exposure to passive smoking, fireplace and cooking fume exposure seemed {{to play a major role}} among the lifestyle behaviours investigated in generating positive mutagenic response with a statistically significant difference between positive and negative samples induction (Chi square, P = 0. 0057 and P = 0. 0168 respectively). After correction of induced revertants by means of creatinine excretion determination, it appeared that females, who had the higher mean urinary mutagenic activity, showed a mutagenicity level twice as much as men (364 +/- 491 revertants/mmole creatinine for males against 605 +/- 868 revertants/mmole creatinine in females, Mann-Whitney U-test, z = - 3. 97, P < 0. 0001) possibly in consequence of their greater cooking fumes exposure. The study, that carefully evaluated the characteristics of involved subjects, reveals the presence, even though modest, of mutagens in urine of an apparently not significantly exposed population. In addition, standardization of method leads to suppose little feasible a confounding influence of considered features. Moreover, it would be therefore rather interesting to study the effect of low exposure time persistence...|$|E

The research question was “Is there a significant difference between regular detergent and environment friendly detergent in terms of promoting mutations in the Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay?” It was hypothesized that; there would be a significant mean difference in terms of promoting mutations between the groups. The regular detergent will show more mutagenic effect, followed by environment friendly detergent. The Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity <b>plate</b> <b>incorporation</b> assay was used for testing this hypothesis. In the first stage, toxicity assay was performed.

The relative mutagenicity for the propylene oxides was different in the liquid suspension assay than that determined by the standard <b>plate</b> <b>incorporation</b> assay and also differed between the two bacterial strains. The assay differences were attributed to epoxide stability. The differences between strains was observed to be due to the response of the error-prone repair system, found only in TA 100, to the stronger alkylating agents...|$|R
40|$|Some common decay organisms of {{vegetables}} and ripened fruits are Alternaria species. Even fruits and vegetables kept under refrigeration can be spoiled by Alternaria species because the mold grows at low temperatures. Alternaria alternata is commonly found in grain in areas with {{a high incidence of}} esophageal cancer. Three metabolites, altertoxins I, II, and III, have been isolated from A. alternata and have hydroxyperylenequinone structures. Although other perylenequinone metabolites such as stemphyperylenol and stemphyltoxins I, II, III, and IV, have been isolated from Stemphylium botryosum var. lactucum, a plant pathogen and mold, we isolated and identified stemphyltoxin III from A. alternata. This metabolite was tested for mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium <b>plate</b> <b>incorporation</b> assay with and without Aroclor 1254 -induced rat S- 9 metabolic activation. A positive response was noted with and without metabolic activation in S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 1537, and there was a marginal response in strain TA 100...|$|R
