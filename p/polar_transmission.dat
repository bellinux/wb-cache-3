We employ a <b>polar</b> <b>transmission</b> representation along with a Kontorovich-Lebedev transform to derive integral representations of {{the field in the}} interior and exterior regions of a sphere circumscribing the loop. The convergence of the obtained expressions is discussed and comparisons with full-wave simulation and other methods are shown...|$|E
30|$|Conventional {{transmitters}} use Cartesian modulation to form complex transmit signal. As a result, {{linear amplification}} is required, yielding large back-off for high PAPR signal. Polar modulation, decomposing the complex transmit signal into amplitude and phase signals, allows {{the application of}} two different amplifications for the two signals. In the envelope-elimination-and-restoration (EER) transmitter [12], the phase signal (constant-enveloped) is amplified by a high-efficiency nonlinear PA and the amplitude signal by a linear PA. Then, the amplified amplitude signal is used to modulate the amplified phase signal, yielding the original signal amplified by an equivalent high-efficiency linear PA. Another <b>polar</b> <b>transmission</b> technique is known as envelope tracking (ET) [13] in which the amplitude signal is used to control the supply voltage of a linear PA such that the PA can always be operated in the high-efficiency regions. With a different operation principle, the Doherty transmitter [14] combines two equal-capacity PAs, referred to as carrier and peaking, in the quarter-wavelength network. Only the carrier PA is active when the amplitude of the signal {{is lower than the}} half of the peak amplitude, and both PAs are active when the signal amplitude is larger than the half of the peak amplitude. In the above approaches, the transmit signal is decomposed into two amplified by two PAs and there exist various kinds of implementation issues. For example, signal bandwidth is expanded and the stringent timing alignment between two signals is difficult. Still, there is another well-known approach referred to as linear-amplification-with-nonlinear-component (LINC) technique [17] to be described in the next paragraph.|$|E

More precisely, we bound the exponent of the number of sub-channels whose Bhattacharyya constant falls in a fixed interval [a,b]. Mathematically this can be stated as bounding the limit _n →∞ 1 /nP(Z_n ∈ [a,b]), where Z_n is the Bhattacharyya process.

40|$|Highly {{luminescent}} germanium nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized at {{room temperature}} by hydride reduction of germanium tetrachloride (GeCl 4) within inverse micelles. Regulation of the Ge NC size is achieved by varying the alkyl chain length of the cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants used to form the inverse micelles. The Ge NCs are chemically passivated with allylamine ligands using a Pt-catalyzed hydrogermylation reaction, minimizing surface oxidation while rendering the NCs dispersible {{in a range of}} <b>polar</b> solvents. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy shows that the NCs are highly crystalline with well-defined core diameters tuned from 3 to 5 nm. UV-Vis absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy show significant quantum confinement effects, with moderate absorption in the UV spectral range, and a strong, narrow luminescence in the visible with a marked dependency on excitation wavelength. A maximum quantum yield of 20 % is shown for the nanocrystals, and a transition from primarily blue to green emission is observed as the NC diameter increases to 4. 5 nm...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the design and implementation of a digital active phase modulator path of a polar transmitter {{in the case of}} orthogonal frequency division multiplex WLAN application. The phase modulation path of the polar transmitter provides a constant envelope phase modulated signal to the Power amplifier(PA), operating in nonlinear high efficient switching mode. The core design of the phase modulator is based on linear vector-sum phase shifting topology to differential quadrature input signals. The active phase shifter consists of a DAC that generates binary weighted currents for I and Q branches and differential signed adder that vector-sums the generated quadrature currents to generate the phase at the output. 6 bits control the phase shifter, creating 64 states with the resolution of 5 : 625 ? for the whole 360 ?. The linear (binary weighted) vector-sum technique generates a reduction in the resultant amplitude that should be taken into consideration in case of nonlinear PA in <b>polar</b> <b>transmission.</b> On the other hand, the digital phase information is applied as the control bits to the phase shifter that determine the weightings and the signs of the I and Q vectors. The key point is the operation of the phase modulator in terms of phase accuracy, with the wideband modulation standard such as OFDM WLAN. A technique has been proposed to enable the polar phase modulator to operate with a real-time wideband data and to compensate for the phase shifter output reduction. Since the reduction in gain is due to vector sum resultant of I and Q currents, it is compensated by modifying the I and Q currents for each 64 phase states. The design is implemented using 0. 18 um CMOS technology and measured with maximum data rate of 64 QAM,OFDM modulation of WLAN standard. The output amplitude of the phase shifter with the correction technique is approximately constant over the 64 states with maximum variation of 3. 5 mv from the constant peak to peak value. The maximum achieved phase error is about 2 ? with a maximum DNL of 0. 257...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} spectroscopic and morphological {{characterization of}} gold-fluoropolymer (CFx(Au)) nanocomposites, deposited by ion beam cosputtering, is presented. These composites are technologically relevant, since they exhibit vapor-sensing properties based on swelling phenomena. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{allows us to}} assess that gold codeposition induces a progressive defluorination of the polymeric chains, leading to a significant increase of the polymer chains' branching and of the concentration of unsaturated fluorinated carbons. The presence of a fluoride peak in the F is spectrum proves the formation of <b>polar</b> gold fluorides. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy reveals the presence of in-plane homogeneously distributed nanosized gold domains, while angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates a nonhomogeneous in-depth distribution of the gold particles, with the outer surface being less rich in nanoparticles.

40|$|Abstract—Designing <b>polar</b> {{codes for}} <b>transmission</b> over two-user {{multiple}} access channels is considered. In the proposed scheme, both users encode their messages using a polar encoder, while a joint successive cancellation decoder is deployed at the receiver. The encoding is done separately, while the codes are constructed jointly. This {{is done by}} treating the whole polar transformation on both users as a single polar transformation, wherein the multiple access channel (MAC) is regarded as one more level of polariza-tion. We prove that our scheme achieves the whole uniform rate region by changing the decoding order in the joint successive can-cellation decoder. Various simulation results over binary-additive Gaussian noise MAC are provided. At the end, a comparison is made with the existing results on polar codes for multiple access channels to emphasize the differences and the main advantages of our scheme.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>polar</b> coding for <b>transmission</b> over a non-stationary sequence of independent binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels {W_i}_i= 1 ^∞, where the i-th encoded bit is transmitted over W_i. We show, for the first time, a polar coding scheme that achieves the effective average symmetric capacity I({W_i}_i= 1 ^∞) := _N→∞ 1 /N∑_i= 1 ^N I(W_i), assuming that the limit exists. The polar coding scheme is constructed using Arıkan's channel polarization transformation in combination with certain permutations at each polarization level and certain skipped operations. This guarantees a fast polarization process that results in polar coding schemes with block lengths upper bounded by a polynomial of 1 /ϵ, where ϵ is the gap to the average capacity. More specifically, given an arbitrary sequence of BMS channels {W_i}_i= 1 ^N and P_e, where 0 < P_e < 1, we construct a polar code of length N and rate R guaranteeing a block error probability of at most P_e for transmission over {W_i}_i= 1 ^N such that N ≤κ/(I_N - R) ^μ where μ is a constant, κ is a constant depending on P_e and μ, and I_N is {{the average of the}} symmetric capacities I(W_i), for i= 1, 2,, [...] .,N. We further show a numerical upper bound on μ that is: μ≤ 10. 78. The encoding and decoding complexities of the constructed polar code preserves O(N N) complexity of Arıkan's polar codes...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>polar</b> coding for <b>transmission</b> over m-user multiple access channels. In the proposed scheme, all users encode their messages using a polar encoder, while a joint successive cancellation decoder is deployed at the receiver. The encoding is done separately across the users and is independent of the target achievable rate, {{in the sense that}} the encoder core is the regular Arıkan's polarization matrix. For the code construction, the positions of information bits and frozen bits for each of the users are decided jointly. This is done by treating the whole polar transformation across all the m users as a single polar transformation with a certain base code. We prove that the covering radius of the dominant face of the uniform rate region is upper bounded by r = (m- 1) √(m) /L, where L represents the length of the base code. We then prove that the proposed polar coding scheme achieves the whole uniform rate region, with small enough resolution characterized by r, by changing the decoding order in the joint successive cancellation decoder. The encoding and decoding complexities are O(N N), where N is the code block length, and the asymptotic block error probability of O(2 ^-N^ 0. 5 - ϵ) is guaranteed. Examples of achievable rates for the case of 3 -user multiple access channel are provided.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>polar</b> coding for <b>transmission</b> over m-user multiple access channels. In the proposed scheme, all users encode their messages using a polar encoder, while a multi-user successive cancellation decoder is deployed at the receiver. The encoding is done separately across the users and is independent of the target achievable rate. For the code construction, the positions of information bits and frozen bits {{for each of the}} users are decided jointly. This is done by treating the polar transformations across all the m users as a single polar transformation with a certain polarization base. We characterize the resolution of achievable rates on the dominant face of the uniform rate region {{in terms of the number}} of users m and the length of the polarization base L. In particular, we prove that for any target rate on the dominant face, there exists an achievable rate, also on the dominant face, within the distance at most (m- 1) √(m) /L from the target rate. We then prove that the proposed MAC polar coding scheme achieves the whole uniform rate region with fine enough resolution by changing the decoding order in the multi-user successive cancellation decoder, as L and the code block length N grow large. The encoding and decoding complexities are O(N N) and the asymptotic block error probability of O(2 ^-N^ 0. 5 - ϵ) is guaranteed.

40|$|Abstract—We {{review and}} study several single carrier based {{multi-level}} and multi-dimensional coding (ML-MDC) technologies recently demonstrated for spectrally-efficient 100 -Gb/s transmis-sion. These include 16 -ary PDM-QPSK, 64 -ary PDM- 8 PSK, 64 -ary PDM- 8 QAM {{as well as}} 256 -ary PDM- 16 QAM. We show that high-speed QPSK, 8 PSK, 8 QAM, and 16 QAM can all be gen-erated using commercially available optical modulators using only binary electrical drive signals through novel synthesis methods, and {{that all of these}} modulation formats can be detected using a universal receiver front-end and digital coherent detection. We show that the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), which is highly effective for blind polarization recovery of PDM-QPSK and PDM- 8 PSK signals, is much less effective for PDM- 8 QAM and PDM- 16 QAM. We then present a recently proposed, cascaded multi-modulus algorithm for these cases. In addition to the DSP algorithms used for constellation recovery, we also describe a DSP algorithm to improve the performance of a coherent receiver using single-ended photo-detection. The system impact of ASE noise, laser phase noise, narrowband optical filtering and fiber nonlinear effects has been investigated. For high-level modulation formats using full receiver-side digital compensation, it is shown that the requirement on LO phase noise is more stringent than the signal laser. We also show that RZ pulse shaping significantly improves filter- and fiber-nonlinear tolerance. Finally we present three high-spectral-efficiency and high-speed DWDM transmission experiments implementing these ML-MDC technologies.
