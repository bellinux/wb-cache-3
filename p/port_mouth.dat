500|$|On 23 June the Spanish fleet {{anchored}} off Porto Longone, {{where it}} was decided during a war council to relieve Orbetello after the most essential repairs had been made. Two days later several Dunkirkers were dispatched to force the Talamone's <b>port</b> <b>mouth,</b> and 8 ships arrived from Naples at Porto Santo Stefano, destroying or capturing about 70 tartanes and barges which contained the supplies of Thomas of Savoy's army during the operation. Du Daugnon, meanwhile, returned to Toulon. Despite his failure, reinforcements could later be carried to Talamone aboard five ships, and Linhares' attempts to dislodge the French siege lines were unsuccessful. Linhares disembarked 3.300 soldiers led by Pimienta, who divided them in two corps and advanced upon the French lines. The first one managed to occupy a hill on [...] which a French cavalry attack was repulsed, but the second corps was dislodged after a 6-hour battle and forced to reembark. 400 wounded men were evacuated; the killed were left on the battlefield. The siege was not lifted until an army under the Duke of Arcos and the Marquis of Torrecuso stormed the besieger camp a month later, killing or capturing over 7,000 men and taking all the artillery and the baggage, which turned the whole French campaign into a failure.|$|E

[...] Dissatisfied with {{the outcome of the}} naval battle, Philip IV, who expected that the French fleet would have been destroyed, and the honour of his navy restored, dismissed and imprisoned Count of Linhares and Admiral Pimienta, among other officers, accusing them of mismanagement and abandonment of their forces. Linhares was replaced by Luis Fernández de Córdoba, Pimienta by Jerónimo Gómez de Sandoval, and Bazán del Viso by Giannettino Doria. Philip IV also appointed his 17 years old illegitimate son John of Austria as Príncipe de la mar, commander of all the Hispanic maritime forces, giving them widespread orders and powers in order to end with the misrule of the Spanish Navy. The French failure at Orbetello, nevertheless, contributed greatly to the reduction the French pressure in Italy. 6,000 soldiers from Naples could be consequently carried to Valencia to fight against the French armies in Catalonia. On September, a French expedition led by Charles de la Porte de la Meilleraye, with Portuguese help, succeeded in capturing both the presidi of Piombino and Porto Longone, which encouraged the Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, to change his allegiance from the Spanish monarchy to France.|$|E

40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycle of mercury (Hg) is affected {{not only by}} the physical, chemical and hydrological characteristics of the environment, but also by changes in productivity and biodiversity. In waters the complexes of Hg are related to the salinity and to the load of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the dissolved and in the particulate phases. Surface and bottom seawater were sampled along the Venetian coast at ten sites with different characteristics. Samples were analyzed employing hyphenated techniques and LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) were quantified. Although for some samples both the species were under the LOQ, the presence of methyl mercury (CH 3 Hg+) and ionic mercury (Hg 2 +) {{at the same time in}} surface and in bottom waters were observed. Variability in CH 3 Hg+ concentrations may be due to changes in the phytoplankton communities, which in turn may be affected by nutrient loads from the catchment area and <b>port</b> <b>mouths</b> of the Venice Lagoon. Thus, monitoring these nutrient loads may be essential for the health of the Venetian littoral system, since they may affect blooms, methylation and hyper-bioaccumulation along the trophic web, with effects on the environment and on human health...|$|R
