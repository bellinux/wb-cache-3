25|$|Canada Post uses {{automated}} cancellations with computer-printed messaging. In this way, {{the corporation}} can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages ("Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel") and promotional messages (such as Canada Post's web address).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary {{from one person}} or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. However, development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized courier service for the diffusion of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in {{the territory of the}} State (2400 BC). The earliest surviving <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> is also Egyptian, dating to 255 BC.|$|E

In a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Court noted: [...] "Each day, according to the Government's submissions here, the United States Postal Service delivers some 660 million <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> to as many as 142 million delivery points."

50|$|CPC Binary Barcode is Canada Post's {{proprietary}} symbology used in its automated mail sortation operations. This barcode {{is used on}} regular-size <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> especially mail sent using Canada Post's Lettermail service. This barcode {{is printed}} on the lower-right-hand corner of each faced envelope, using a unique ultraviolet-fluorescent ink.|$|R
25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|E

As noted in Kibble, when the surviving mail arrived into Tel Aviv, Israel, it was stamped with a Hebrew instructional marking prior to being forwarded on to its final town destination within Israel. The boxed violet instructional marking reads (translated from the Hebrew):"This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> survived in El-Al airplane that was shot down over Bulgaria on 27.7.1955." [...] The Hebrew text is [...] in size, while the outline of the boxed instructional marking is [...] in size.|$|E
2500|$|The rest of Dammeier's {{argument}} {{was devoted to}} the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> from somebody, I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that [...] "the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".|$|E

6000|$|Another {{plan is to}} {{maintain}} that if the poet does not in any case mention a corslet, there was no corslet. Thus in V. 99, an arrow strikes Diomede [...] "hard by the right shoulder, the plate of the corslet." [...] Thirteen lines later (V. 112, 113) [...] "Sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through out of Diomede's shoulder, and the blood darted up through the pliant chiton." [...] We {{do not know what}} the word here translated [...] "pliant" [...] [Greek: streptos] means, and Aristarchus seems to have thought it was [...] "a coat of mail, chain, or scale armour." [...] If so, here is the corslet, but in this case, if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or rings of bronze be meant, gualon cannot mean a large [...] "plate," [...] as it does. Mr. Ridgeway says, [...] "It seems certain that [Greek: streptos chitoon] means, as Aristarchus held, a shirt of mail." [...] [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, vol. i. p, 306.] Mr. Leaf says just the reverse. As usual, we come to a deadlock; a clash of learned opinion. But any one can see that, in the space of thirteen lines, no poet or interpolator who wrote V. i 12, i 13 could forget that Diomede was said to be wearing a corslet in V. 99; and even if the poet could forget, which is out of the question, the editor of 540 B.C. was simply defrauding his employer, Piaistratus, if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the poet. When this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a corslet, it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it, though, as we have seen, a man is occasionally smitten, in the midriff, say, without any remark on the flimsy <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|E

50|$|This symbology, {{derived from}} the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can {{individually}} have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height. This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points. The information that goes into each barcode is obtained from the address printed {{on the front of}} the envelope it is ultimately printed on, as well as the physical dimensions of each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> This code also uses a Reed-Solomon error correction technique, so that in case a particular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> is mishandled, the information encoded in the barcode can still be correctly decoded.|$|E
