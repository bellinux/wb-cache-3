50|$|At SummerSlam, Yokozuna, now {{weighing}} in at 568 lb, and the newly-reborn patriot Luger fought {{it out for}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Luger took control late in the match, scoring on Yokozuna with a bodyslam and flying forearm. Luger had metal plates put into his arm following an injury from a motorcycle accident, making it a formidable weapon (it was stipulated that Luger had to wear a <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> over it, but it was torn off {{in the course of}} the match) and Yokozuna was knocked out of the ring, unconscious, and lost via countout. The title did not change hands, but the match's result made it seem like Luger had a chance against his gigantic foe. The contract Luger had signed for the match, as orchestrated by Yokozuna's new spokesman and advisor James E. Cornette, stated that if he did not win the championship, he would not get another shot at the title. Yokozuna and Luger continued to feud until Survivor Series, where each chose a team of allies for an elimination match. The match was billed as an All-Americans (Lex Luger, The Undertaker and Steiner Brothers) vs. Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Quebecer Jacques, Ludvig Borga and Crush) contest.|$|E

The stress-strain compression curves from the experimental results were used to analyze the absorption energy of the pads. It was determined that knitted spacer fabric had better relative energy absorption than closed cell foams, and better absolute energy absorption when treated with shear-thickening fluid. Also, the dead mass of spacer fabrics is the lower than the one of foams. Physical form and morphology of knitted spacer fabric allowed easier thermal and vapour transfer to the environment in comparison to those of closed-cell foam, where knitted spacer fabric had both lower dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance values than closed cell foam which makes the knitted spacer fabric suitable for protective pads used in high sport activity and hot environmental environments.

40|$|After {{coronary}} artery bypass, some patients have diaphragmatic elevation, usually {{on the left}} side. To test our hypothesis that this phenomenon is due to phrenic nerve injury resulting from either 1) dissection of the proximal portion of the left internal mammary artery or 2) topical cooling of the heart with icy slush, we performed the following 2 -part study. First, we reviewed our hospital records of 99 {{coronary artery}} bypass patients, 55 of whom had received left internal mammary artery grafts and 44 of whom had undergone saphenous vein grafting; the results showed {{no significant difference between}} the rates of left-sided diaphragmatic paralysis in the 2 groups (47 % versus 41 %, respectively). Next, we performed a prospective, randomized study in 100 consecutive patients, using a cardiac insulation pad to protect the left phrenic nerve in 58 patients and using no <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> in 42 patients. At the time of hospital discharge, left-sided diaphragmatic elevation was seen in 6 (10. 3 %) of the 58 patients in whom insulation had been used and in 19 (45. 2 %) of the 42 patients whose phrenic nerve had been unprotected (p < 0. 001). We conclude that cooling of the left phrenic nerve with icy slush in the pericardial cavity causes left-sided diaphragmatic paralysis and that the frequency of this injury can be reduced if a cardiac insulation pad is placed between the nerve and the icy slush.

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} if previous {{surgery for}} {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (transurethral resection of the prostate or open prostatectomy), age, and preservation of prostatic apex can influence postoperative urinary continence in patients submitted to radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 62 patients with bladder cancer who were treated with radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder between 1987 and 1998 and had been followed for at least 24 months. The average age and median follow up were 61 years and 53 months, respectively. Postoperative urinary continence was correlated with 3 factors: patient age, preservation of prostatic apex during surgical excision and prior prostatic surgery for benign disease. Patients were defined as incontinent {{when they had to}} use more than 1 <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> at the daytime. Results: The overall incidence of urinary incontinence was 12. 9 % (8 out of 62 patients). The only statistically significant factor that impacted upon urinary continence was previous prostatic surgery, with respectively 33 % versus 7 % rate of incontinence for patients previously operated on and for those without previous operation (p = 0. 023 odds ratio = 6. 5, 95 % confidence interval). Preservation of prostatic apex did not reach difference, 12 % versus 13 %, for those with and without preservation, and age also did not influence the postoperative continence rate. Conclusions: Prior prostatic surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia probably can increases the risk for postcystectomy incontinence and preservation of prostate apex did not affect the continence rate. This issue deserves to be considered by the surgeon and must be discussed previously with the patients when planning an orthotopic bladder replacement.

40|$|Modern tactics for {{carrying}} out military and antiterrorist operations calls {{for the development of}} a new generation of enhanced portable infrared imagers. The high performance of these imagers relies on the focal plane arrays, which are maintained at cryogenic temperatures using rotary Stirling cryogenic engines. These engines are known as powerful sources of wideband vibration export. For the sake of weight and compactness, the enclosure of the above imager is usually designed in the form of a light metal thin-walled shell, accommodating a directly mounted Infrared Detector Dewar Cooler Assembly. The operation of the device typically leads to an excitation of the inherently lightly damped structural resonances and therefore, to a radiation of the specific acoustic signature capable of compromising the aural stealth of the IR imager. Such a noisy IR imager may be detected from quite a long distance using enhanced sniper detection equipment or even aurally spotted when used in a close proximity to the target. Numerous efforts were taken towards achieving the desired inaudibility level, apparently becoming one of a crucial figure of merit characterizing the portable IR imager. However, even the best examples of modern should-be silent imagers are quite audible from as far as 50 meters. The presented research intends to improve the aural stealth of the portable IR imager by using three different approaches: First, by compliantly mounting the Infrared Detector Dewar Cooler Assembly where the stiffness and damping of the vibration <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> are optimized for the best acoustical performance without developing excessive line of sight jitter. Secondly, by using the concept of the weak radiator to reshape the enclosure mode shapes, and finally developing a multi-modal distributed dynamic absorber (MMDA) to enhance the absorption of the vibrating structure. The multi-modal characteristic of such a dynamic absorber makes it highly dynamically reactive through a wide frequency range (20 kHz) of excitation. It will be shown that incorporating a MMDA into the vibrating structure will result in ultra range vibration attenuation, making the IR aurally silent.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} the injury rate in three British Shotokan karate championships in consecutive years. In these tournaments strict rules governed contact, with only "light" or "touch" contact allowed. <b>Protective</b> <b>padding</b> for the head, hands, or feet was prohibited. METHODS: Prospective recording of injuries resulting from 1770 bouts in three national competitions of 1996, 1997, and 1998. Details of ages {{and years of}} karate experience were also obtained. RESULTS: 160 injuries were sustained in 1770 bouts. The overall rate of injury was 0. 09 per bout and 0. 13 per competitor. 91 (57 %) injuries were to the head. The average age of those injured was 22 years, {{with an average of}} nine years of experience in karate. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> does not result in higher injury rates than in most other series of Shotokan karate injuries.

40|$|Purpose: Bladder neck {{preservation}} during radical prostatectomy {{has been}} advocated for improving urinary continence. We compared bladder neck preservation and resection in a randomized trial, looking at continence rates and surgical cancer control. Materials and Methods: Patients with stage T 1 c-T 2 c prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy with maximal {{preservation of the}} external urinary sphincter. Bladder neck preservation or resection was chosen by chance during surgery. Urinary continence (1 or no <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> daily) was assessed by interview 2 days after catheter removal, and 2 and 6 months after surgery. the surgeon, pathologist and interviewer were the same throughout. Neither patient nor interviewer knew which procedure was done. Planned enrollment was 120. Results: Enrollment was stopped after 70 patients because surgical margins were positive only at the bladder neck in 10 % of the preservation group but in none of the resection group (p = 0. 08). Each group was assigned 35 patients but the bladder neck could not be preserved in 4 and 1 died, leaving 31 in the preservation group and 38 in the resection group. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between groups in early or late urinary continence rates. Two days after catheter removal, and 2 and 6 months after surgery the respective rates were 79 %, 87 % and 95 % with resection, and 67 %, 87 % and 97 % with preservation. Conclusions: in our opinion bladder neck preservation during radical retropubic prostatectomy does not improve urinary continence and might compromise cancer control. the external sphincter appears more important for continence after radical prostatectomy.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} the most cost effective urogynaecological treatment {{from a range of}} five standard therapies of 217 female patients, and to test the hypothesis that the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence was more cost effective than surgical or pharmacological interventions, using the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as a common assessment. Methods: The first step in this process was to determine whether a generic cost effectiveness instrument, the York Quality of Life Questionnaire was sufficiently sensitive to allow its use in the field of urogynaecology. The York Questionnaire was compared with several other quality of life questionnaires and outcome measures that have been previously utilised in urinary incontinence, and was found to be equally sensitive in detecting change in quality of life as a result of treatment. The next step was to measure the costs required to produce this change in quality of life and to calculate the QALY's for five urogynaecological treatments in three prospective trials comprising of: a randomised trial of Nurse Continence Advisor versus Urogynaecologist conservative treatment of urinary incontinence (n= 143), a prospective trial of laparoscopic versus open colposuspension (n= 62), and the pharmacological treatment of detrusor instability (n= 12). Costs assessed included consultation fees, investigations, theatre costs, hospital stay, patient time off work & travel expenses, and reduction in <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> costs. Results: The cost/QALY for 5 years as a result of each of the five treatments varied from $ 28, 009 for the Nurse Continence Advisor conservative treatment to $ 134, 069 for the open colposuspension treatment. Conclusions: This finding suggests that the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence is the most cost effective, and should be utilised as the first form of treatment. As a consequence, financial resources would be more efficiently utilised in the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence, such as increasing the availability of services offered by Nurse Continence Advisors and physiotherapists...|$|E
