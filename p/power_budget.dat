The craft had a communication rate of [...] at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, {{a rate of}} approximately [...] per transmitter is expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5hours (one-way). The [...] NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond Jupiter. [...] The spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization. [...] The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) {{mounted on the body}} under the dish. The receivers are new, low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability is now considered operational (when the spacecraft <b>power</b> <b>budget</b> permits both TWTAs to be powered).|$|E

40|$|Many {{computing}} {{systems are}} constrained by <b>power</b> <b>budgets.</b> While they could temporarily draw more power, doing so creates unsustainable temperatures and unwanted electricity consumption. Developing systems that operate within <b>power</b> <b>budgets</b> is a constrained optimization problem: configuring the components {{within the system}} to maximize performance while maintaining sustainable power consumption. This is a challenging problem because many different components within a system affect power/performance tradeoffs and they interact in complex ways. Prior approaches address these challenges by fixing a set of components and designing a <b>power</b> <b>budgeting</b> framework that manages only that one set of components. If new components become available, then this framework must be redesigned and reimplemented. This paper presents PCP, a general solution to the <b>power</b> <b>budgeting</b> problem that works with arbitrary sets of components, {{even if they are}} not known at design time or change during runtime. To demonstrate PCP we implement it in software and deploy it on a Linux/x 86 platform...|$|R
40|$|Power {{costs are}} very {{significant}} for data centers. To maximally utilize the provisioned power capacity, data centers often employ over-subscription, that is, {{the sum of}} peak consumptions of individual servers may be greater than the provisioned capacity. <b>Power</b> <b>budgeting</b> methods are employed to ensure that actual consumption never exceeds capacity. However, current <b>power</b> <b>budgeting</b> methods enforce capacity limits in hardware and are not well suited for virtualized servers because the hardware is shared among multiple applications. We present a <b>power</b> <b>budgeting</b> system for virtualized infrastructures that enforces power limits on individual distributed applications. Our system enables multiple applications to share the same servers but operate with their individual quality of service guarantees. It responds to workload and power availability changes, by dynamically allocating appropriate amount of power to different applications and tiers within applications. The design is mindful of practical constraints such the data center’s limited visibility into hosted application performance. We evaluate the system using workloads derived from real world data center traces. ...|$|R

We provide detailed mathematical analysis of our model for <b>power</b> <b>budgeting</b> which highlights the effectiveness of our methodology.
