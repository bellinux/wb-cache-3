5000|$|When {{simultaneous}} EDS/EBSD collection can be achieved, {{the capabilities}} of both techniques can be enhanced. There are applications where sample chemistry or phase cannot be differentiated via EDS alone because of similar composition; and structure cannot be solved with EBSD alone because of ambiguous structure solutions. To accomplish integrated mapping, the analysis area is scanned and at each point Hough peaks and EDS region-of-interest counts are stored. Positions of phases are determined in X-ray maps and measured EDS intensities are given in charts for each element. For each phase the chemical intensity ranges are set to select the grains. All patterns are then re-indexed off-line. The recorded chemistry determines which phase / crystal structure file is used for indexing of each point. Each pattern is indexed by only one phase and maps displaying clearly distinguished phases are generated.

40|$|AbstractTemporal <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> was {{measured}} {{as a function}} of spatial separation of the stimulus components. In contrast to many previous studies, <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> thresholds were measured directly, rather than inferred from the ability to discriminate synchronous from antiphase stimuli, or from segregation or shape tasks. For abutting bars, relative phase thresholds were closely proportional to temporal frequency. The proportionality corresponded to a threshold temporal offset of 2. 5 – 9. 5 ms, across subjects. Introduction of a small gap (0. 125 ° or greater) led to a dramatic (3 - to 7 -fold) increase in thresholds for temporal <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and thresholds were no longer proportional to temporal frequency. Insertion of a third bar filling the gap resulted in a recovery of the low thresholds, provided that its modulation was consistent with apparent motion across the three bars. Below 8 Hz, <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> thresholds across three bars were equivalent to thresholds for two abutting bars. Above 8 Hz, <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> thresholds for the three bar combination were lower than thresholds for two adjacent bars, implying that phase information was integrated across all three bars. <b>Phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> thresholds do not appear to reflect the properties of a single mechanism. Especially at high temporal frequencies, low thresholds for <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> are closely tied to the presence of apparent motion. Temporal <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> is markedly impaired by a small separation of stimulus components.

The experiments described here provide the first evidence of a motor contribution to the representation of relative phase. Using an interference paradigm, we demonstrate that a motor load dramatically impairs <b>discrimination</b> of relative <b>phase.</b> Comparable interference effects were observed for biological and mechanical stimuli, indicative of a domain-general mechanism.

40|$|Two {{alternative}} approaches describe determinants {{of responding to}} a stimulus temporally distant from primary reinforcement. One emphasizes the temporal relation of each stimulus to the primary reinforcer, with relative proximity of the stimulus determining response rate. A contrasting view emphasizes immediate consequences of responding to the stimulus, the key factor being the conditioned reinforcement value of those immediate consequences. To contrast these approaches, 4 pigeons were exposed to a two-component multiple schedule with three-link chain schedules in each component. Only middle-link stimuli differed between chains. Baseline reinforcement probabilities were 0. 50 for both chains; during <b>discrimination</b> <b>phases</b> it was 1. 0 for one chain and 0. 0 for the other. During <b>discrimination</b> <b>phases</b> pigeons responded more to the reinforcement-correlated middle link than to the extinction-correlated middle link, demonstrating that responding was affected by the probability change. Terminal link responding was also higher in the reinforced chain, even though the terminal link stimulus was identical in both chains. Of greatest interest is initial link responding, which was temporally most distant from reinforcement. Initial link responding, necessarily equal in the two chains, was significantly higher during the 1. 0 / 0. 0 <b>discrimination</b> <b>phases,</b> even though overall reinforcement probability remained constant. For 3 of 4 birds, in fact, initial-link response rates were higher than terminal-link response rates, an outcome that can be ascribed only to the potent conditioned reinforcement properties of the middle-link stimulus during the <b>discrimination</b> <b>phases.</b> Results are incompatible with any account of chain behavior based solely on relative time to reinforcement...|$|R

Comparison of Figures 2 b and 3 b or 4 b and 5 b shows again increasing performance of the optimal detectors as the phase diversity between the sources increases.

We note again, for a given set of unknown desired signal parameters, that better performance are obtained when the total noise is either known or estimated from secondary data only. In a same way, the knowledge of a TNAR allows to increase the performance in comparison with an absence of TNAR. Finally, for a given set of total noise parameters, the a priori knowledge of the signal steering vector s increases the performance.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} receptive-field {{structure}} of mechanisms operating in human color vision, by recording visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to multiharmonic gratings modulated either in luminance or color (red-green). Varying the Fourier {{phase of the}} harmonics from 0 deg to 90 deg produced a family of stimulus profiles that varied from lines to edges. The stimuli were contrast reversed to elicit steady-state VEPS, and also randomly jittered (at a higher temporal frequency than the contrast reversal) {{to ensure that the}} evoked response resulted from the polarity reversal, rather than from local variation of luminance or color. Reliable VEPs were recorded from both luminance and chromatic stimuli at all phases, suggesting that the mechanisms sensitive to chromatic contrast and those sensitive to luminance contrast have both symmetric and asymmetric receptive fields. Contrast thresholds estimated by extrapolation of the contrast response curves were very similar to psychophysical thresholds for <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination,</b> suggesting that the VEP response is generated by mechanisms mediating <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The results support the idea that human color mechanisms have receptive fields with a variety of spatial symmetries (including odd- and even-symmetric fields) and that these mechanisms may contribute to <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> of chromatic stimuli in a similar way to what has been suggested for luminance vision...|$|E

When n was varied, Lawden found a phase plateau of moderate breadth where <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> thresholds were {{about half of those}} measured in compound detection. I present the results of similar experiments, using one-dimensional (gratings) and two-dimensional (plaids). In a sine-plaid condition, the 1 F grating was split into two 1 F plaid components at ± 45 deg from vertical while the nF component remained a vertical grating. In a square-wave plaid (SqW-plaid) condition the plaid components were square waves. For each of these conditions, the horizontal spatial repetition (SR) of the plaid is given by (F/√ 2); it is half an octave lower than the spatial frequency (SF) of the oblique components but it is not represented in the stimulus spectrum. By plotting <b>phase</b> <b>discrimination</b> relative to compound detection a phase-plateau was found for all three conditions. When these data were plotted as a function of SF ratio (nF/F) the curves describing the two plaid conditions were found to be leftward translations of that describing the grating condition. However, when the results were plotted as a function of SR ratio (nF/SR), the three functions lay on top of each other. The finding that phase-reversal discrimination is not governed by the Fourier attributes of the stimulus per se, rules out an explanation in terms of a linear, broad-band, phase-sensitive mechanism. Rather, the results imply that information is combined across the set of SF- and orientation-tuned mechanisms before the decision variable. These interactions appear to be governed by the spatial (not Fourier) attributes of the luminance profile of the stimulus.
