40|$|Background Clinical {{specialist}} (CS) {{and advanced}} practitioner (AP) roles {{have increased in}} nursing and midwifery internationally. This study explored clinical practice in sites with and without clinical nurse or midwife specialists or advanced nurse practitioners in Ireland. Methods Using a case study design, interview, observational and documentary data from postholding sites (CSs or APs employed) were compared with data from non-postholding sites (no CSs or APs employed). Interviews and observations were conducted with <b>postholders</b> (n?=? 23), and compared with data from healthcare professionals (nurses or midwives, doctors) (n?=? 23) in matched services. Interviews were held with Directors of Nursing and Midwifery (n?=? 23), healthcare professionals (n?=? 41), service users (n?=? 41) with experience of receiving care or working with <b>postholders,</b> and non-postholders in matched services. The data were analysed using Nvivo (Version 8). Results The findings suggest that <b>postholders?</b> practice appeared to differ from non-postholders? in relation to case management and service provision. <b>Postholders</b> were seen as {{having an impact on}} readmission rates, waiting lists/times, collaborative decision-making, continuity of care and workload management. <b>Postholders?</b> autonomy to manage caseloads was perceived to lead to smoother transition of patients/clients through the healthcare system. Service-users? self-reports appeared to appreciate the individualised holistic care provided by <b>postholders.</b> <b>Postholders?</b> role in facilitating person-centred care and promoting interprofessional team working, are essential elements in quality care provision and in global healthcare workforce planning. Conclusions To meet changing healthcare demands, promote person-centred care, and improve service delivery, more specialist and advanced practice posts in nursing and midwifery should be developed and supported within healthcare...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{hospital}} based posts in which nurses take over clinical work previously done by junior doctors is growing. Accountability for {{the scope of}} such new roles and the standards of practice which apply to them are still unclear. When analysed together and compared, the regulations arising from the professional bodies (GMC and UKCC), civil law concerning certain wrongs to patients, and employment law are sometimes contradictory and hard to interpret. The resulting uncertainties about appropriate management for clinical roles evolving between the professions, coupled with an increasingly litigious public, put the nurses and consultants involved at risk of complaints and of disciplinary and legal action. Drawing on our current research into changing clinical roles at the medical-nursing interface, we suggest strategies to reduce risk. Doctors and nurses should be equal partners in planning and managing these new posts, patients should be informed adequately {{about the nature of}} the <b>postholder's</b> role and training, significant changes in the work of such <b>postholders</b> should be formally acknowledged by the employer and relevant insurers, individuals taking up new roles should have access to legal advice and support to cover legal risk, and national regulatory bodies need to work together to harmonise their codes of practice in relation to changing clinical roles between the professions...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To gain an {{understanding}} of the perspectives of <b>postholders</b> about a new nursing role designed to highlight areas where care for individuals with long-term conditions (LTC) could be improved. Background: The number of individuals who will suffer with LTC is predicted to rise significantly, and managing the care of individuals effectively is a current challenge facing health services across the world. Design: A small-scale qualitative exploration of the nurse’s perception of a new role and of their perceptions of its impact on the care of those living with LTC. Method: Data were obtained between March 2008 and November 2008 from the in-reach nurses (n = 4). Data sources were focus groups, semi-structured interviews and nurse’s reflective diaries. Analysis of data was via a thematic approach. Results: The nurses in this study agreed about the challenges and rewards of the newly created post. Information from reflective diaries showed the difficulties faced by patients moving between community and hospital services, as perceived by the nurses. Some of the nurses demonstrated deeper understanding of these difficulties and the use of a problem solving approach to enable patients to have a smooth journey across the interface of community and hospital care. Conclusion: Although there were mixed responses to the in-reach posts by the <b>postholders</b> and their colleagues, there is some strong qualitative evidence to support new ways of working. Relevance to clinical practice: Although a small initiative, through using in-reach posts, nurses are able to gain a wider perspective of the patient journey that may benefit effectiveness and quality of care available to individuals living with LTC...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} staff {{in a sample of}} institutions specifically designed to be innovative - City Technology Colleges (CTCs). The research focused on theories of educational change developed by Gross, Giacquinta and Bernstein (1971) and Fullan (1991) in order to evaluate the benefits, problems and cost-effectiveness of innovative associate (non-teaching) staff posts. Eight CTCs, providing a geographical spread and a variety of innovative posts, were selected. In each, four posts (15 women and 17 men) were chosen for detailed study. The posts covered: • support for management and administration (10) • support for the curriculum (13) • support for both management and curriculum (9). Two hundred and two semi-structured interviews were conducted with governors, senior and linemanagers, teachers and <b>postholders</b> during two phases of fieldwork undertaken between autumn 1993 and summer 1995. The freedom of CTCs provided scope for the opportunistic use of postholders' skills. The majority of posts were judged to be cost-effective. The benefits of the innovative posts included improved opportunities for students and staff to gain from associate staff expertise; managers and teachers, respectively, having more time for planning and pedagogy; and more cost-effective use of resources. Problems were related to teachers' resistance, lack of clarity in the posts and excessive responsibilities being given to <b>postholders.</b> Gross et al's and Fullan's theories were congruent with the fmding of the study but neither theory was sufficient to explain {{the success or failure of}} innovation in these CTCs. The concept of culture - both positive aspects (which enabled staff, including those who were not teachers, to feel part of a new innovative venture) and negative aspects (teaching or industrial sub-cultures preventing the innovations from taking root) - emerged as a useful explanatory concept. The study concluded with implications for policy, practice and further research. Gross, N, Giacquinta, J. and Bernstein, M. (1971) Implementing Organizational Innovations, New York: Basic Books.

40|$|Summary: Background The {{consultant}} nurse role {{emerged into}} the National Health Service in 1999, presented {{against a backdrop}} of practice and service modernisation. As with any innovative development, the role was originally subject to much scrutiny with regards to impact and outcome. However, six years after its initial introduction, continued focus and support on this role is less visible. This paper presents a follow-up review of the role and function of consultant nurses in critical care, using an original survey tool that underpinned Dawson and McEwen's work in 2003. From the results of the current study, key changes in role are identified and areas for further development are highlighted. Aims • To provide a contemporary profile of the consultant nurse in critical care. • To identify changes in the consultant nurse role from 2003 to 2006. Method A national email survey of all known critical care nurse consultants in post in the United Kingdom was undertaken in October 2006. Using a validated survey tool originally used in 2003, a return rate of 73 % (n = 47) was yielded. Results Biographics of this survey reveal a static consultant nurse population with increasing length of tenure in post (mean = 60. 2 months). There is no substantial increase {{in the size of the}} cohort since 2003. <b>Postholders</b> demonstrate advanced academic skills through higher degrees (94 %) and carry a national and international profile through presentation and publication portfolios (92 % national and 53 % international presentation, 62 % multi-authored publication, 47 % single authored publication). The core role that consultant nurses in critical care engaged in is practice and service development (mean involvement score = 3. 65), with expert practice holding least mean involvement scores (mean involvement score = 2. 67). There is evidence of increasing use by these posts for strategic input at organisational/trust level. Conclusions This paper has identified ongoing strengths and limited developments of the consultant nurse in critical care role. Whilst it is clear that core role functions have not dramatically changed, there are demonstrable shifts towards more strategic engagement within Acute Care Trusts. This has brought about concerns regarding overall management of the role, and sustainability of <b>postholders</b> to balance this ever-increasing portfolio. It is also clear that there has been little new investment in this key leadership role, and this raises concerns as to the perceived contribution that experienced clinical nurses bring to a currently financially and operationally driven health service agenda. <br/...|$|R

One of the early <b>postholders</b> was Sergeant Muys (meaning [...] "mouse"), from whom Muizenberg (formerly Muysenbergh and Muys Zijn Bergh (Muys' mountain) before that) gets its name.

40|$|The online {{networked}} environment {{continues to}} challenge the information profession. Easy access to masses of information via search engines has given business people, students, and many others false {{confidence in their ability}} to find what they need. The knowledge economy has driven large parts of the workforce into information-intensive roles and moved other professions closer to our territory. Information professionals have had to develop more specialised roles to make a distinctive business contribution. The new specialisms include emerging hybrid roles, which combine information expertise with extensive in-depth knowledge drawn from other professional disciplines. The new ‘hybrid professionals’ typically sit on the boundaries of established professions, occupying the expanded territory representing the overlaps among different domains. These boundary-spanning roles require a wider skillset and broader knowledge base than before: organisational understanding and management abilities must be supported by competence in two distinct, often diverse, specialist fields. Hybrid professionals are now firmly established in the information world. Notable examples include the specialist fields of legal know-how, health informatics, information literacy and digital libraries. A key feature of these hybrid domains is the different sub-species that have emerged reflecting the backgrounds of <b>postholders</b> who can enter the shared territory from either side of the professional divide. Indicators of their maturity include the representation of these specialisms at progressive levels of the organisational hierarchy; the creation of dedicated professional networks and formal bodies to support their work; and the development of specialist postgraduate education and training programmes for both new entrants and seasoned practitioners...|$|R
