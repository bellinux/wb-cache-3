40|$|Abstract. Two {{starting}} collagens, sponge and floc collagen, {{were used}} to prepare collagen/tricalcium phosphate (TCP) composites. The resulting composites were porous and had 200 µm pore size. However, {{there was a difference}} in the microstructure of the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> for the composites derived from the two collagens, the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> in sponge collagen/TCP composite were still porous and had 200 nm micropores size, TCP particles were trapped in collagen matrices. While floc collagen/TCP composite had smooth and dense walls in which TCP particles were embedded. The difference could be attributed to the starting collagen with different status. Sponge collagen has a soft structure, which easily becomes disassembled fibrils during alkali treatment, the disassembled fibrils are integrated again to form a dense morphology for <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> after freeze-drying. While floc collagen has already a low disassembly degree, the alkali treatment could not be able to separate the fibrils, this remains as micropores in <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> after freeze-drying. Both porous composites are significant in bone tissue engineering or regeneration. MTT test results showed the two composites had good cytocompatibility, and sponge collagen/TCP composite was somewhat better than floc collagen/TCP composite, which could result from that micropores derived roughness in <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> of sponge collagen/TCP composite is suitable for cell growth...|$|R

50|$|The {{resistance}} to transport in porous media increases because the viscosity of the fluid (which fills the pores) {{increases in the}} vicinity of the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> (Renkin effect; see also electroviscous effects). This effect is important in very narrow pores and in pore narrowing their diameter to the same size as the diameter of the diffusing particles. Constrictivity must be distinguished from the effects of Knudsen diffusion. Knudsen diffusion occurs when the particle interacts with the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> more than it does with other particles due to the large free path and narrow pores. Constrictivity, on the other hand, depends on the influence of the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> on the fluid filling the pores.|$|R
30|$|The {{final step}} of the {{template}} fabrication is the electric passivation of the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> by an 8 -nm-thick layer of Al 2 O 3 deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to avoid unfavorable current flow through the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> during galvanic deposition. This is done in 80  cycles of trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H 2 O with extended diffusion time at 300 °C in a Picosun Sunale R 200 ALD tool (Espoo, Finland).|$|R
50|$|The transport-available {{porosity}} {{equals the}} total porosity less the pores which, {{due to their}} size, are not accessible to the diffusing particles, and less dead-end and blind pores (i.e., pores without being connected {{to the rest of}} the pore system). The constrictivity describes the slowing down of diffusion by increasing the viscosity in narrow pores as a result of greater proximity to the average <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b> It is a function of pore diameter and the size of the diffusing particles.|$|E
50|$|The melting {{process for}} the frozen phase is {{initiated}} from existing molten phase, such as the liquid-like layer that is retained at the <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b> This is shown in Figure 1 for a through ink bottle pore model (position A); the arrows show how the liquid-like layer initiates the melting process and this melting mechanism is said to occur via sleeve shaped menisci. For such a melting mechanism, the smaller necks will melt first and as the temperature is raised the large pore will then melt. Therefore, the melting event would give an accurate description of the necks and body.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{cylindrical}} pores, melting {{would occur}} {{at a lower}} temperature via a hemispherical meniscus (between solid and molten phases), than it would via a sleeve-shaped meniscus. Scanning curves and loops {{have been used to}} show that cryoporometry melting curves are prone to pore-pore cooperative effects and this is demonstrated by position B in Figure 1. For the through ink bottle pore, melting is initiated in the outer necks from the thin cylindrical sleeve of permanently unfrozen liquid-like fluid that exists at the <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b> Once the necks have become molten via the cylindrical sleeve meniscus mechanism, a hemispherical meniscus will be formed {{at both ends of the}} larger pore body. The hemispherical menisci can then initiate the melting process in the large pore. Moreover, if the larger pore radius is smaller than the critical size for melting via a hemispherical meniscus at the current temperature, then the larger pore will melt at the same temperature as the smaller pore. Therefore, the melting event will not give accurate information on the pore body. If the incorrect melting mechanism is assumed when deriving a PSD (pore size distribution) there will be at least a 100% error in the PSD. Moreover, it has been shown that advanced melting effects can lead to a dramatic skew towards smaller pores in PSDs for mesoporous sol-gel silicas, determined from cryoporometry melting curves.|$|E

5000|$|NMR {{techniques}} are typically {{used to predict}} permeability for ﬂuid typing and to obtain formation porosity, which is independent of mineralogy. The former application uses a surface-relaxation mechanism to relatemeasured relaxation spectra with surface-to-volume ratios of pores, and the latter is used to estimate permeability. The common approach {{is based on the}} model proposed by Brownstein and Tarr. They have shown that, in the fast diffusion limit, given by the expression:where [...] is the surface relaxivity of <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> material, [...] is the radius of the spherical pore and [...] is the bulk diffusivity. The connection between NMR relaxation measurements and petrophysical parameters such as permeability stems from the strong effect that the rock surface has on promoting magnetic relaxation. For a single pore, the magnetic decay as a function of time is described by a single exponential:where [...] is the initial magnetization and the transverse relaxation time [...] is given by: is the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore, [...] is bulk relaxation time of the fluid that fills the pore space, and [...] is the surface relaxation strength. For small pores or large , the bulk relaxation time is small and the equation can be approximated by: Real rocks contain an assembly of interconnected pores of different sizes. The pores are connected through small and narrow pore throats (i.e. links) that restrict interpore diffusion. If interpore diffusion is negligible, each pore can be considered to be distinct and the magnetization within individual pores decays independently of the magnetization in neighbouring pores. The decay can thus be described as: ...|$|E
30|$|Platinum is {{deposited}} {{within the}} hydrophobic microporous silicon in Figure 2. However, when the <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> is hydrophilic, platinum deposition occurs {{only on the}} top of the porous layer. These results can be explained by the affinity of the <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> to water molecules. Platinum complex ion ([PtCl 42 −) behaves like a molecule with lower polarity due to its large size. Therefore, platinum ions have high affinity to the hydrophobic <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> compared with water molecules to the <b>pore</b> <b>wall,</b> and hence, platinum ions are excluded from bulk to the <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> [6]. In case of platinum, platinum ions pass through a bare silicon surface because deposition proceeds toward the pore opening from the pore bottom. Therefore, platinum deposition behavior is affected by the hydration property of <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b> In hydrophilic microporous silicon, once deposition occurs at the pore opening, platinum is not deposited into pores but on the top surface due to the need of high overpotential on the bare silicon.|$|E
30|$|However, silver {{deposition}} is {{not affected}} by the hydration properties of the <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b> These results {{can be explained by}} the growth direction of deposition. Metal ions have to reach to the frontier of the deposition site and pass through not a bare silicon surface but the surface on which metal is deposited when metal deposition proceeds toward the pore bottom. Once the metal is deposited on the <b>pore</b> <b>wall,</b> the hydration property of <b>pore</b> <b>wall</b> changes due to the metal covering. Therefore, silver is uniformly deposited in microporous layer without relation to the hydration properties of the <b>pore</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|Normally, either {{nitrogen}} or brine {{can be used}} as a fluid. When {{high rates}} of flow can be maintained, the results are comparable. At low rates, air permeability will be higher than brine permeability. This is because gas does not adhere to the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> as liquid does, and the slippage of gases along the <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> gives rise to an apparent dependence of permeability on pressure. This is called the Klinkenberg effect, and it is especially important in low-permeable rocks.|$|R

High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) patterns and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of PMOF-Bp materials confirmed the formation of a biphenylbridged periodic mesophase with molecular-scale periodicity in the organosilica framework. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and NMR spectroscopic data also strongly suggested that the biphenyl organic segment is covalently bonded with silicon atoms in the acidic ethanol-washed biphenyl-bridged mesoporous framework. The emission behavior is sensitive to synthesis and thermal treatment temperatures. The biphenyl-bridged PMO films show absorption and emission due to the presence of biphenyl segment in <b>pore</b> <b>walls.</b> Nanoindentation hardness of the PMOF-Bp films could be controlled by temperature, degree of pore ordering and molecular periodicity, and even thickness of films.

These minerals can be sand, clays, oxides, carbonates, and zeolite (Mahmoud et al. 2015). Kaolinite, smectite, illite, and chlorite are four main clay minerals present in the sandstone formation (Wilson et al. 2014). Clay can be either structural clay or dispersed clay. Dispersed clays are silicate clay minerals that attached to the rock mineral surfaces. Nesham defined the three different types of dispersed clay based on the clay crystal structure and location on <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> or within inter-granular pores and pore throats and divided it into three groups (a) discrete particle, (b) pore lining, and (c) pore bridging (Neasham 1977). Discrete particle clays developed as pseudo-hexagonal crystals such as plates, attached to <b>pore</b> <b>walls</b> or occupying inter-granular pores. Pore-lining clays are those attached to <b>pore</b> <b>walls,</b> which appear as long and thin clay coating. Illite, chlorite, and montmorillonite were observed with pore-lining crystal morphologies. Pore-bridging clays are also attached to the <b>pore</b> <b>walls.</b> This type of clays includes illite, chlorite, and montmorillonite. Clay morphology of the high permeability sands shows that the discrete particle type is the dominant type affecting the permeability in high permeability cores. Whereas the intermediate permeability sands are affected mostly by the pore-lining variety. On the other hand, the low permeability sand contains pore-bridging types of clays.|$|R
