50|$|In modern times, the {{tendency}} {{has been for}} the major <b>parties</b> to <b>have</b> Māori as their Māori Affairs spokespeople (and thus as Minister) when possible.

5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of the June 2015 Turkish elections, Agar.io {{was used in}} Turkey as a medium of {{political}} advocacy; many players were naming their cells after Turkish political parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar political views, battling against other players with opposing views. Some political <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> used Agar.io in campaign posters {{as a symbol of}} support.|$|E

5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized.

The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E

5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{political}} <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> been {{represented in}} the committee. The first committee consisted exclusively {{of members of the}} Liberal Party. The party was represented on all committees until 1973, after which it has not had a seat. In 1907, Francis Hagerup became the first representative from the Conservative Party, and this party has been represented on the board since. The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The Christian Democratic Party was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The <b>party</b> <b>has</b> held several {{ordinary}} congresses throughout different cities, mostly focussing on provinces in south-eastern Turkey. So far, the <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had two nationwide extraordinary congresses, held in 2013 and 2014, where {{elections were}} held to select the chairpersons of the party.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, {{in spite}} of the fact that the <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> been disbanded, the Christian Heritage <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} to appear sporadically in opinion polls as recently as April 2013.|$|R
5|$|The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai {{is now the}} {{majority}} in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Singapore underwent several significant changes. Non-Constituency Members of Parliament {{were introduced in}} 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. Nominated Members of Parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs. The Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected President who has veto power {{in the use of}} national reserves and appointments to public office. The opposition <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> complained that the GRC system has made {{it difficult for them to}} gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore, and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{previous}} election in 1898, the Protectionist Party (or National Federal <b>Party)</b> <b>had</b> become the Progressive Party, while the Free Trade <b>Party</b> <b>had</b> become the Liberal Reform Party.|$|R
50|$|Several leading {{members of}} the long-standing national-liberal New Wafd <b>Party</b> <b>have</b> also joined the alliance, even though the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{announced}} to contest the elections together with the Freedom and Justice Party.|$|R
25|$|The <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{representation}} {{at local}} government level in England.

5|$|Until the {{legalisation}} {{of opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered political <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.|$|E
5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{believe that}} Caragiale's ultimate relocation to Germany {{was at least}} in part prompted by the Caion affair. This was notably suggested by Caragiale's actor friend, Ion Brezeanu. Moreover, literary rivals as well as third <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> noted that Caion's calumnies shed focus from his own dubious creative methods. In his speech of 1902, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea openly accused Caion of forging historical records during his stint at Noua Revistă Română. More than fifty years after the fact, Ștefan Cazimir discovered that the poems Caion claimed to have authored, and which Caragiale found especially entertaining, were in fact poor-quality translations from Charles Baudelaire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} free elections, {{with the end}} of the Estado Novo period, only right-wing <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> governed the city: the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD. The CDS saw its {{popularity}} suffer an abrupt decline in 1997, and has since then been the third political party. On the other hand, the PSD in the same year achieved its first absolute majority with 62.4% of the votes. After the 2017 municipal elections, seven councilmen were members of the centre-right Partido Social Democrata (PSD), and two of the centre-left Partido Socialista (PS). The mayor is Aires Pereira, for the PSD, elected with 57.7% of the votes. The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes. Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members, with the PSD holding 16 seats, the PS 6, the right-wing CDS 2 and one member for the left-wing Left Bloc, the green party People–Animals–Nature (PAN) and one for the left-wing CDU.|$|E

Since 2008, however, in order to ease tensions with the People's Republic of China, the <b>party</b> <b>has</b> endorsed the [...] "three nos" [...] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou - no unification, no independence and no use of force.|$|R
50|$|From the {{establishment}} of Vort Arbeide in 1884, the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> a growing and notable organisation of newspapers and other press outlets. The party press system eventually resulted in Norsk Arbeiderpresse (“Norwegian Labour Press”, now A-pressen).

In 1920 the <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 33 newspapers and 6 semi-affiliated newspapers. The <b>party</b> <b>had</b> its own publishing house, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag, succeeded by Tiden Norsk Forlag. In addition to books and pamphlets, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag published Maidagen (annual May Day publication), Arbeidets Jul (annual Christmas publication) and Arbeiderkalenderen (calendar).|$|R
