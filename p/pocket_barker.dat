40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the results of}} several years of testing the use of ultrasound to find structural defects in pallet parts and pallet cants used to produce pallet parts. To determine the magnitude of unsound defects, we inspected full length cants from seven saw mills from Virginia and West Virginia. Split, wane, shake, holes, decay, unsound knots, <b>bark</b> <b>pocket,</b> and mechanical defects were all considered as unsound defects. Regardless of mill and species, split {{accounted for the highest}} percentage of defect volume per cant. Decay: <b>bark</b> <b>pockets,</b> shake, and holes also contributed significantly to the total defect volume. The scanning results of deckboards, stringers and cants showed that ultrasound can be used effectively to locate, identify, and quantify the various pallet parts defects. Significant losses of ultrasound signals/energies were observed through these defects. Other ultrasound parameters, such as time of flight, pulse length can be used for characterizing defects. Reconstructed two-dimensional images were able to show the exact position and surface area of the defects. Defects can be classified/distinguished using classifying tools like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, and k-nearest neighbor. Results demonstrated that real-time, online inspection and classification of defects in wooden pallet parts are possible by ultrasound scanning. Results also showed that pallet cants can be graded by unsound wood content and that processing full length cants to cut-to-size cants can be optimized with the knowledge of defect size and location provided by the ultrasound scanning...|$|R

Veneers resulting from processing trials from six commercially important Australian hardwood species {{were dominated by}} D-grade veneer. Defects such as encased knots, gum pockets, gum veins, surface roughness, splits, <b>bark</b> <b>pockets,</b> and decay impacted the final assigned grade. Four grading scenarios were adopted. The first included a change to the grade limitations for gum pockets and gum veins, while the second investigated {{the potential impact of}} effective pruning on grade recovery. Although both scenarios individually had a positive impact on achieving higher face grade veneer qualities, the third and fourth scenarios, which combined both, had a substantial impact, with relative veneer values increasing up to 18. 2 % using conservative calculations (scenario three) or up to 22. 6 % (scenario four) where some of the upgraded veneers were further upgraded to A-grade, which attracts superior value. The total change in veneer value was found to depend on the average billet diameter unless defects other than those relating to the scenarios (gum or knots) restricted the benefit of pruning and gum upgrading. This was the case for species prone to high levels of growth stress and related defects...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{monitoring}} of airborne {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) pollution levels was novelly demonstrated by analyzing the dated corks of a <b>bark</b> <b>pocket</b> formed from 1873 to 2003 in a Longpetiole Beech (Fagus longipetiolata) tree trunk sampled from southeastern China. The fundamental studies indicated that the PAHs of log K- 0 a 8. 5 existing as particle-phase dependent on log V-p are accumulated through stochastic entrapment by the lenticels {{on the surface of}} the cork. The translocation of PAHs by xylem flow and phloem stream as well as radial diffusion from the cork to the inner tissues was not significant, and the cork is most effective for accumulating airborne PAHs. The total concentrations of 16 EPA PAHs (SigmaPAHs) in the dated corks progressively increased from 43. 5 ng/g recorded in the earliest available cork in 1873 - 1875 to the maximum 345. 7 ng/g in 1956 - 1961, and then gradually decreased to 267. 0 ng/g in 2003, while the concentration of perylene (PER) was slightly fluctuating at 0. 178 +/- 0. 033 ng/g. Moreover, the concentration ratio of SigmaPAHs to PER increased from 193 to 2431 from 1873 to 2003, indicating a progressive increase in PAH pollution in southeastern China...|$|R

40|$|Fast-growing hybrid aspens (Populus tremula L. Ã— P. tremuloides Michx.) are {{currently}} {{of great interest}} in Sweden since they can produce biomass at high rates and, at the same time, {{can be used to}} produce higher value wood products. This study focuses on the effects of pruning hybrid aspen to improve its wood quality. About 50 % of the trees in the experimental stand were pruned by removing twigs, at heights up to 4 m, when they were 7 â€“ 8 years old. Ten years later, 20 pruned and 20 unpruned trees, representing four clones, were randomly selected. Ten knots or twig/stem junctions, respectively, per tree were exposed for inspection using a chain saw and examined. The results revealed that pruned trees cicatrised the knots within about three years and thereafter produced substantial amounts of faultless wood. In contrast, unpruned trees (which had retained almost 80 % of their twigs, often as dry twigs with <b>bark</b> <b>pockets)</b> had produced small uneven amounts of quality wood. Removal of twigs with acute angles and/or large diameters resulted in greater colour defects and rot in annual rings outside the pruning position, but the time of cicatrisation was not significantly affected. The results show that pruning can be used to enhance the wood quality of hybrid aspen over a short time period, and that pruning should be performed early during the rotation period when branches are small, in order to minimize discolouration and rot in the new annual rings...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} users of thin, unsurfaced {{hardwood}} lumber is the pallet manufacturing industry. Almost all manufactured products spend part of their life cycle on a pallet during transportation. This makes pallets {{a critical component of}} both the transportation and manufacturing sectors of the economy. Many newly constructed wooden pallets, however, are not currently manufactured to deliver the best performance (strength, durability, and safety) â€”despite interest by pallet users and pallet manufacturersâ€”because manual grading and sorting of parts is impractical due to processing speeds and volume, labor costs, and laborer skill. This paper describes initial work aiming to create an automated grading/sorting system for hardwood pallet parts using ultrasonic. Experiments were conducted on yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera, L.) and red oak (Quercus rubra, L.) deckboards using pressurecontact, rolling transducers in a pitch-catch arrangement. Sound and unsound knots, cross grain, <b>bark</b> <b>pockets,</b> holes, splits, and decay were characterized using six ultrasound variables calculated from the received waveforms. Our scanning system shows good data-collection repeatability, and scanning rate has little effect on the calculated variables. For each defect type, at least one ultrasonic variable demonstrated significant capability to discriminate between that defect and clear wood. Energy loss variables exhibited the greatest sensitivity to many defect types. Based on the empirical relationships identified in this study, we are now developing models to classify defects using ultrasonic signal characteristics. Scanning properties of the prototype apparatus suggest that it can readily be translated into a commercial product.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 In recent years, {{the forest}} {{products}} {{industry has been}} forced to cope with a supply of raw material that is declining in both quality and quantity. In addition, log prices are escalating rapidly. Because log costs may represent as much as 90 percent of the overall production costs of lumber (Williston, 1985), it is crucial that a mill make every attempt to maximize grade and recovery. Quality control (QC) is a broad term used loosely to indicate producing a product to meet the customer's Specifications. In lumber production, quality control is heavily influenced by meeting lumber grade requirements while minimizing fiber use. One component of these grade requirements is conformance to size standards. Size control is one of the functions of a mill's QC department. Size control for lumber manufacturing involves minimizing the variations in the dimensions of lumber that are introduced by the sawing process. An adequate size control program enables a sawmill to maximize both grade and recovery. Grade may be maximized by reducing the amount of boards downgraded due to either excess wane or from planer skip that can result from excessive sawing variation. Minimization of sawing variation can also lead to maximizing recovery. It should be made clear that the reduction in target size that can result from minimizing sawing variation will most often result in a slightly longer or wider board from any one log rather than obtaining additional boards (Darwin, 1989). There are however certain limited log diameter breakpoints at which additional boards may be obtained due to decreased sawing variation. What is proposed in this project is an automated system to collect and analyze board measurement information using optical scanning techniques. The system is intended to provide feedback to mill quality control personnel. This thesis has built upon the image processing and quality control system developed by Aslam (1990) at the Department of Forest Products at Oregon State University. The system is discussed in Aslam's M. S. thesis {{as well as in the}} article by Funck et al. (1992). The image processing system scans the edges of boards while still held in cant form after leaving a gang edger. The system can provide lumber thickness as well as kerf width data. A size control program is included to analyze measurement data and provide information regarding sawing variation. A far more detailed representation of sawing variation can be obtained using this system than is possible with standard size control practices providing measurement accuracy is sufficient. For instance, at gang edgers immediate feedback regarding sawing variation for both boards and kerf is provided. Sawing variation information is of sufficient detail for diagnosing which machine center, and more specifically, which pocket of saws is causing sawing problems. This thesis continued the previous work by quantifying measurement accuracy using various hardware and software configurations, and by developing the software necessary to analyze and then display the data in the most meaningful form. Software techniques were created to avoid measurement errors. The first step in the project was a pilot study conducted using several different imaging configurations, noise filtering techniques, and edge-detection algorithms to quantify the system's precision in measuring static objects. The second step was to develop display software to convey the detailed information this system can provide. The development of measurement error trapping mechanisms was the third step. Measurement errors may occur through incorrectly locating the edges of boards due to the presence of wane, bark, pitch or <b>bark</b> <b>pockets,</b> or knots. Measurement errors may also occur when physically blocked saw kerfs cause a failure to detect a board edge. Lastly, the system was tested on images representing a range of measurement difficulty. This test was performed to determine the measurement accuracy of the system when using combinations of three different edge-detection algorithms and three different noise filtering techniques. This type of automated measurement collection, data analysis and display system will have a financial benefit to a mill by enabling the mill to quickly identify and correct situations leading to sub-optimal lumber or grade recovery...|$|R
