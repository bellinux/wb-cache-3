5|$|All ten pitches have undersoil {{drainage}} and {{an automated}} sprinkler system. In addition, two have undersoil heating. Each <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> built {{to match the}} playing surface specifications of the Emirates Stadium. Three of the pitches are reserved for the Arsenal youth team, three for the reserves and three for the first team. The tenth <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> where first team friendlies and Under-18 league fixtures take place.|$|E
5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> never {{considered to be an}} error. If a <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E
5|$|Caldas Sport Clube (CSC) {{was founded}} 15 May 1916. The club {{sponsors}} teams in several levels of football (soccer) and futsal. The team's main <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> Campo da Mata, a 13,000-seat field {{located in a}} wood adjacent to Parque D. Carlos I.|$|E
50|$|On 2 April 2015, {{three new}} {{artificial}} <b>pitches</b> <b>were</b> inaugurated at the sports {{centre of the}} club. One of the <b>pitches</b> <b>is</b> 40 x 60 metres and the two other <b>pitches</b> <b>are</b> 22 x 40 metres in size. The cost {{of the construction of}} the new <b>pitches</b> <b>was</b> 150 million Hungarian forints. The investment was financed by the Hungarian Football Federation (70%) and by the Zugló Local Government.|$|R

50|$|In November 2011, it was {{reported}} that a number of English football clubs were interested in using artificial pitches again on economic grounds. As of October 2016, artificial <b>pitches</b> <b>are</b> not permitted in the Premier League or Football League but are permitted in the National League and lower divisions. The two most prominent English football clubs to currently use third-generation artificial <b>pitches</b> <b>are</b> Sutton United, whose FIFA 2-Star quality <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> installed at Gander Green Lane in August 2015, and Maidstone United, whose 2-Star <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> built along with the new Gallagher Stadium in July 2012. Matches between the two clubs have been named by fans El Plastico (a reference to El Clásico). Artificial <b>pitches</b> <b>are</b> also permitted in all rounds of The FA Cup competition.|$|R
5|$|When voicing child characters, {{the voice}} actors speak within their normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The {{recorded}} audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> altered {{to make the}} voice sound more {{like that of a}} fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Augustinsson {{is often}} {{referred}} as a modern wing-back, whose qualities is in his offense, possession, pace and a good left foot. He {{started out as a}} central midfielder, but changed position to left-back at age eleven due to tough competition in the midfield. He has always been a specialist in set pieces and takes a lot of corners and freekicks. His role models on the football <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> former left back Gareth Bale and David Alaba.|$|E
5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American ice hockey rink. The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of two halves of 45 minutes each, matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Both Nargis and Mani's <b>pitches</b> <b>were</b> {{featured}} and derided on the spin-off Worst Decisions Ever, with Nargis {{claiming that}} her team {{had told her}} that the <b>pitches</b> <b>were</b> excellent; guests stated Velocity had chosen to let her hang herself.|$|R
50|$|At one time, the <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> the {{smallest}} in the Irish league, but {{it no longer}} holds this distinction since the <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> enlarged after the stock-car racing track was removed in the later years of the last century.|$|R
5000|$|Discrete pitches, {{rather than}} {{continuously}} variable <b>pitches,</b> <b>are</b> virtually universal, with exceptions including [...] "tumbling strains" [...] and [...] "indeterminate-pitch chants".

5|$|The Ibrox <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by four covered all-seater stands, officially {{known as the}} Bill Struth Main (south), Broomloan Road (west), Sandy Jardine (north) and Copland Road (east) Stands. Each stand has two tiers, {{with the exception of}} the Bill Struth Main Stand, which has had three tiers since the Club Deck was added in 1991. The two corner areas, known as the West and East areas of the Sandy Jardine Stand, have one tier of seating below a JumboTron screen.|$|E
5|$|The Old Trafford <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by four covered all-seater stands, officially {{known as the}} Sir Alex Ferguson (North), East, Sir Bobby Charlton (South) and West Stands. Each stand has at least two tiers, {{with the exception of}} the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which only has one tier due to construction restrictions. The lower tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections, the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Kenny's speech is {{achieved}} by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> altered to make the voice sound more {{like that of a}} fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.|$|E

5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E

5|$|The hockey <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter {{edges are}} called the side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} part of Lerkendal idrettspark, which also {{consists}} of three training pitches, two in full size and of which one has artificial turf. The main training <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> the natural grass Skoglunden, while the artificial turf venue is Lerkendal kunstgress. The two pitches both have flood lighting, heating and are often used for matches by Rosenborg's recruit and reserve teams. The team has a health club located within the south stand. The club's offices are located in Brakka, a German-built barracks dating from World War II.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E

5000|$|Goodwin {{is located}} roughly halfway up Northumberland Road off the A57 in the Crookesmoor part of Broomhill. The hockey <b>pitches</b> <b>are</b> {{to the south}} of the road, {{opposite}} the Weston Park Hospital whereas the indoor facilities and remaining football <b>pitch</b> <b>are</b> to the north, closer to Crookes Valley Park.|$|R
5|$|Each {{half of the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> then divided {{again by}} a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the <b>pitch</b> <b>is</b> delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E
5000|$|This match - {{originally}} {{scheduled to}} be played in Round 16 on 14 February 2014 - was postponed as the <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> deemed unplayable. [...] The <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> again found to be unplayable on the new date of 22 February, and the match was postponed for the second time.|$|R
50|$|Zambrano had six pitches. His most-used <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> a heavy sinker at 88-92 mph {{designed}} to get ground balls. His next-most used <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> a cutter (88-91), followed by a splitter (80-85). He also threw a four-seam fastball (90-91), slider (79-82), and curveball (high 60s-low 70s). The only major variation in his approach to right-handers and left-handers was that he threw the splitter much more to lefties. That <b>pitch</b> <b>was</b> a favorite with two strikes against lefties, while he threw the cutter most often in those counts against righties.|$|R
