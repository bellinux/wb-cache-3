5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. <b>Preventive</b> <b>care</b> is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of <b>preventive</b> <b>care</b> available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

40|$|Background: It was {{postulated}} that parents would receive less <b>preventive</b> dental <b>care</b> than {{their children and}} that adults would receive more <b>preventive</b> dental <b>care</b> than parents. Other predictors were also explored. Methods: A convenience sample of adults and parents, presenting to the emergency department, answered questions about age, ethnicity, education, medical insurance, dental insurance, and preventive and emergency dental care in the past year. Parents answered similar questions for a child> 3 years to < 18 years. Parents were defined as living with their children < 18 years. Significant univariate odds ratios based on group (adult, parent or child), age, ethnicity, education, medical insurance, dental insurance and emergency dental care were then analyzed using stepwise logistic regression.

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and <b>preventive</b> <b>care,</b> fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Preventive</b> health <b>care</b> {{programs}} can save lives {{and contribute to}} {{a better quality of}} life by diagnosing serious medical conditions early. The <b>Preventive</b> Health <b>Care</b> Facility Location (PHCFL) problem is to identify optimal locations for <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> facilities so as to maximize participation. When identifying locations for <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> facilities, we need to consider the characteristics of the <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> services. First, people should have more flexibility to select service locations. Second, each <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> facility needs to have a minimum number of clients in order to retain accreditation. Results This paper presents a new methodology for solving the PHCFL problem. In order to capture the characteristics of <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> services, we define a new accessibility measurement that combines the two-step floating catchment area method, distance factor, and the Huff-based competitive model. We assume that the accessibility of <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> services is a major determinant for participation in the service. Based on the new accessibility measurement, the PHCFL problem is formalized as a bi-objective model based on efficiency and coverage. The bi-objective model is solved using the Interchange algorithm. In order to accelerate the solving process, we implement the Interchange algorithm by building two new data structures, which captures the spatial structure of the PHCFL problem. In addition, in order to measure the spatial barrier between clients and <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> facilities accurately and dynamically, this paper estimates travelling distance and travelling time by calling the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API). Conclusions Experiments based on a real application for the Alberta breast cancer screening program show that our work can increase the accessibility of breast cancer screening services in the province. </p...|$|R
40|$|With {{health care}} {{expenditures}} rising across the board, and financial literacy at a concerning rate for nations across the globe, {{it is only}} natural that we ask ourselves the question, “Could the two be related?” This study examines the impact of financial literacy on <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> participation using data taken from a survey of students at Western Kentucky University.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 2012 Medicaid data from Washington state. The data {{was obtained from the}} Washington State Health Care Authority and included children under age six who were enrolled in the Medicaid program in 2012 for 11 - 12 months (N= 206, 488). Medical diagnosis codes (from hospital, inpatient, and outpatient data) and Medicaid eligibility files were used to determine each child’s special needs status. The outcome was utilization of preventive dental services, as determined by Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate both crude and adjusted prevalence rate ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). All analyses were conducted using Stata 13 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). Results: There were 58, 511 children determined to have SHCN (28. 3 %). A total of 114, 570 children had at least one preventive dental visit in 2012 (55. 5 %). Age, SHCN status, Ethnicity, Race, and county Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) were statistical confounders and included in the adjusted Modified Poisson regression analysis. The adjusted analysis revealed CSHCN were 1. 04 times more likely to utilize <b>preventive</b> dental <b>care</b> than their typically developing peers (95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 05, p < 0. 001). Other factors associated with increased likelihood of <b>preventive</b> dental <b>care</b> use included: Hispanic ethnicity, <b>preventive</b> medical <b>care</b> use, older age, and living in an area not classified as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) (p < 0. 001 for all). Conclusions: Medicaid-enrolled CSHCN in Washington state are slightly more likely to receive preventive dental services than children without SHCN. Other factors associated with increased likelihood that a child utilized <b>preventive</b> dental <b>care</b> included older age, having <b>preventive</b> medical <b>care,</b> not residing in a dental HPSA, and Hispanic ethnicity.

40|$|The {{principle}} of non-discrimination in Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) holds that its rights are equally applicable to ‘everyone’. Nevertheless, evidence from the national context suggests that {{access to health care}} for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants depends on their legal status and in particular, <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> is often inaccessible to them. This has led to several hitherto under-investigated questions concerning the right to health in this context: Does a right to <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> exist at the international level? If so, what individual rights and State obligations are involved in this right? How does the {{principle of}} non-discrimination relate to this right? Does this principle offer (additional) protection to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in terms of a possible right to <b>preventive</b> health <b>care?</b> Method: The main issue is what the principle of nondiscrimination has to offer for the <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> of persons without a regular residence status. Based on an analysis of the non-binding, but authoritative, General Comments of the United Nations (UN) Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the paper takes an exploratory style that goes beyond traditional legal analysis and investigates how the law should be interpreted in order to enhance its effectiveness and relevance. Results and Discussion: Strictly speaking, there is no explicit, binding right to <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> for asylum seekers or undocumented migrants in the ICESCR itself. 2 Nevertheless, implications {{can be found in the}} CESCR General Comments Number 14 and 20. 3 Particularly, if one takes into account how the law should be interpreted according to CESCR General Comment 14 (CESCR GC 14), there should be a right to <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. The exact content of such a right, however, is less clearly defined. Further, the {{principle of non-discrimination}} is not conclusive as to whether the right to health would apply equally to asylum seekers and/or undocumented migrants as it would to nationals. Conclusion: For non-discrimination to be truly unambiguous with regard to the <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> of asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, it would be necessary to strike out the ‘general welfare’ provision of CESCR General Comment 20 (CESCR GC 20) and to clearly state that the ‘other status’ criterion also entails ‘residence status’. In that sense, the principle of non-discrimination is, indeed, an empty promise and the right to <b>preventive</b> health <b>care</b> for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants seems to be much better protected under the CESCR GC 14 ’s non-discriminatory interpretation of the right to health itself...|$|R
