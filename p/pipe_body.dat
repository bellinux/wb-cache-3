5000|$|During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of the <b>pipe</b> <b>body,</b> {{known as}} Poisson's ratio, takes place such {{that when the}} stuck pipe is {{subjected}} to axial strain due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its diameter will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate tensile and compressive forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its diameter will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a vibration cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the physical processes involved in the build-up of the sound signal in a labial organ pipe a pipe foot model has been developed. The main important parameters, such as positions of the lower and upper labium, the wind pressure in the foot and {{the width of the}} flue can be adjusted by means of this model. Moreover, different types of languid and <b>pipe</b> <b>bodies</b> (resonators) can be attached to the model. For the reason of corresponding to a real metal organ pipe these parts of the model are made of "organ metal". The reproducibility of measurements is provided by the micrometer screws applied for the adjustments. Flow and edge tone measurements were carried out with the help of this model. A comparison with real organ pipes gives some indications for the range of the parameters. Because of the flexible adjustments and the large range of values of every parameter, it is possible to find different ranges with varying parameter settings for the occurrence of the edge tone. The analysis of these measurement results shows the dependency of the edge tone of the adjusted parameters...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to remove grease or oil contamination prior to blast cleaning. Solvent cleaning, burn-off, etc., are commonly used for this purpose. In the blast cleaning process, compressed air (90 to 110 psi/610 to 760 kPa) is used to force dan abrasive onto the surface to be cleaned. Aluminum oxide, steel grit, steel shot, garnet, coal slag, etc., are the frequently used abrasives. Another method of blast cleaning is centrifugal blast cleaning, which is especially used in cleaning the exterior of pipe. In this method, abrasive is thrown to the rotating <b>pipe</b> <b>body,</b> using a specially designed wheel, which is rotated at high speed, while the abrasive is fed from {{the centre of the}} wheel.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of tension, the <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> weight is not a factor {{that could lead to}} failure. The casing length is not {{significantly}} long, so that the <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> weight does not cause a tremendous axial load. However, the load caused by bending effect needs to be thoroughly analyzed and considered in the selection of the proper casing. Since there is a horizontal displacement around the surface, which could result in casing deformation, all the casings may produce an extra axial load that is generated by bending. So this issue was considered along with the <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> weight in tension design to prevent the casing from being damaged by unexpected axial loads.|$|E
40|$|The {{size of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> of {{coiled tubing}} would change applied by {{internal}} pressure, cyclic bending complex loads. CT fatigue was accompanied by the sizes of the <b>pipe</b> <b>body,</b> namely diameter, circumference, ellipse degree increasing. When the sizes got to some degree, the CT’s mechanism would decreased, when it passed the guide arch, injection and other equipments, {{it could lead to}} incompatibilities with deployment equipment which could cause severe mechanical damage and the several sticking accidents. Therefore, grasping the change law and an accurate prediction for CT sizes limits growth was necessary for both safety and reliability in CT operations. In this study, the full-scale fatigue and sizes testing on the CT fatigue machine were investigated under 25 MPa internal pressure and bending cyclic complex loads. The data from the testing experiment of size of the <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> was analysed and the relationship between sizes limits, namely, diameter, circumference, ellipse degree and the cycle (Residual Life) was found. And according to the curve fitting equation, the increasing laws of sizes for CT was established under the internal pressure of 25 MPa. The sizes of CT were accurately and timely predicted and the sizes limits were controlled and monitored which could provide reliable method for the safety service for CT...|$|E
40|$|The {{build-up}} of {{the sound}} in a flue organ pipe is mainly influenced by the edge tone. A small change of the flue parameters, such as positions of the lower and upper lip, the wind pressure in the pipe foot and {{the width of the}} flue, mostly results in big differences in the build-up and the spectra. In order to understand the basic physical processes a pipe foot model of a labial organ pipe with adjustable parameters has been developed. Furthermore, different types of languids and resonators (<b>pipe</b> <b>bodies)</b> can be attached to the model. A High value was set on comparisons and measurements with real metal organ pipes in order to give an indication for advisable ranges of the parameters. Flow velocity, edge tone, mouth tone and pipe sound measurements were carried out with the help of this model. From the results of the measurements theoretical models have been developed for flow velocity, velocity distribution, edge and mouth tone frequencies and for the ratios of the frequencies of edge tone modes. These models may facilitate the design and scaling of flue organ pipes...|$|R
50|$|The most {{familiar}} examples of acoustic resonators are in musical instruments. Every musical instrument has resonators. Some generate the sound directly, {{such as the}} wooden bars in a xylophone, {{the head of a}} drum, the strings in stringed instruments, and the pipes in an organ. Some modify the sound by enhancing particular frequencies, such as the sound box of a guitar or violin. Organ <b>pipes,</b> the <b>bodies</b> of woodwinds, and the sound boxes of stringed instruments are examples of acoustic cavity resonators.|$|R

The reproducibility of measurements is provided by the micrometer screws applied for the adjustments. Flow and edge tone measurements are carried out with the help of this model. Velocity measurements with different flue widths show that the exit velocity of the jet corresponds to the Bernoulli-velocity and is asymmetrically contracted. At larger distances (> 5 mm) the velocity distribution can be described by a Gauss-function having linearly increasing width. A mathematical relation of the centerline velocity {{as a function of the}} cut-up height L is found. The results of edge tone measurements show differences between previous studies and the present one. No frequency stages (and hysteresis phenomena) are found within the investigated pressure and cut-up range; the frequency modes of the edge tone coexist. The measured frequencies can be described by theoretical models...|$|R

50|$|Calabash gourds (usually with {{meerschaum}} or porcelain bowls set inside them) {{have long}} made prized pipes, {{but they are}} labour-intensive and, today, quite expensive. Because of this expense, <b>pipes</b> with <b>bodies</b> made of wood (usually mahogany) instead of gourd, but with the same classic shape, are sold as calabashes. Both wood and gourd pipes are functionally the same (with the important exception that the dried gourd, usually being noticeably lighter, sits more comfortably in the mouth). They consist of a downward curve that ends with an upcurve where the bowl sits. Beneath the bowl is an air chamber which serves to cool, dry, and mellow the smoke. There are also briar pipes being sold as calabashes. These typically {{do not have an}} air chamber and are so named only because of their external shape.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the second}} half of June, 2008, 50 {{broadband}} seismic stations were deployed on Mt Etna volcano in close proximity to the summit, allowing us to observe seismic activity with exceptionally high resolution. 129 long period events (LP) with dominant frequencies ranging between 0. 3 and 1. 2 Hz, were extracted from this dataset. These events form two families of similar waveforms with different temporal distributions. Event locations are performed by cross-correlating signals for all pairs of stations in a two-step scheme. In the first step, the absolute location of the centre of the clusters was found. In the second step, all events are located using this position. The hypocentres are found at shallow depths (20 to 700 m deep) below the summit craters. The very high location resolution allows us to detect the temporal migration of the events along a dike-like structure and 2 <b>pipe</b> shaped <b>bodies,</b> yielding an unprecedented view of some elements of the shallow plumbing system at Mount Etna.

30|$|During the {{selection}} of the grade of casing, the designer should pay attention to its strength to see whether the selected casing can bear the possible maximum stress and tension. In this model, we are looking into four main strengths corresponding to four types of failures. Those strengths are: collapse resistance, <b>pipe</b> <b>body</b> yield strength, joint strength, and internal pressure resistance (burst strength). After the casing size is selected, a series of casing grade and strength can also be examined. Those grade and strength data are put into the model in terms of the charts corresponding to different types of casing. The following is a brief overview of the casing strength calculation and selections.|$|E

40|$|About 60 new isotopic age {{determinations}} help {{clarify the}} geologic {{history of the}} Round Mountain and Manhattan gold districts, Nevada. Cretaceous granite of Shoshone Mountain, southeast of Round Mountain, was emplaced about 95 m. y. ago and was domed, metamor-phosed, and mineralized with tungsten-bearing quartz veins 80 m. y. ago. The granite of Pipe Spring, south of Manhattan, was emplaced probably at about 80 m. y. ago. Mineralization associated with the <b>Pipe</b> Spring <b>body</b> occurred about 75 m. y. ago. A granodiorite stock and associated rhyolite and andesitc dikes intruded the granite southeast of Round Mountain 36 m. y. ago; apparently base and precious metals mineralization accompanied their intrusion, but mineralization has not been dated isotopically.
