40|$|The {{complete}} genome {{of a novel}} Circovirus {{isolated from}} an Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) with feather lesions {{similar to those that}} occur in psittacine beak and feather disease is reported. Degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify and sequence novel Circovirus DNA from affected feathers. Sequence analysis indicated that the tentatively named raven circovirus (RaCV) was 1898 nucleotides in size with two major open reading frames synonymous with other avian circoviruses, ORF C 1 and ORF V 1, likely to encode a putative capsid protein (Cap) and replicase-associated protein (Rep), respectively. In common with other circoviruses was the conservation of several nucleotide structures and amino acid motifs implicated in virus replication.

40|$|Circoviruses of {{pigs and}} birds are {{established}} pathogens, however, the exact role of other, recently described circoviruses and circovirus-like viruses {{remains to be}} elucidated. The {{aim of this study}} was the detection of circoviruses in neglected host species, including honey bees, exotic reptiles and free-living amoebae by widely used broad-spectrum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for the replication initiation protein coding gene of these viruses. The majority of sequences obtained from honey bees were highly similar to canine and <b>porcine</b> <b>circoviruses,</b> or, were distantly related to dragonfly cycloviruses. Other rep sequences detected in some honey bees, reptiles and amoebae showed similarities to various rep sequences deposited in the GenBank. Back-to-back PCR primers designed for the amplification of whole viral genomes failed to work that suggested the existence of integrated rep-like elements in many samples. Rolling circle amplification and exonuclease treatment confirmed the absence of small circular DNA genomes in the specimens analysed. In case of honey bees Varroa mite DNA contamination might be a source of the identified endogenous rep-like elements. The reptile and amoebae rep-like sequences were nearly identical {{with each other and with}} sequences detected in chimpanzee feces raising the possibility that detection of novel or unusual rep-like elements in some host species might originate from the microbial community of the host.

DogCV was detected by PCR in fecal samples from 19 / 168 (11. 3 %) dogs with diarrhea and 14 / 204 (6. 9 %) healthy dogs and in blood from 19 / 409 (3. 3 %) of dogs with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, fever of unknown origin, or past tick bite. Co-infection with other canine pathogens was detected for 13 / 19 (68 %) DogCV-positive dogs with diarrhea. DogCV capsid proteins from different dogs varied by up to 8 %. In situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy detected DogCV in the lymph nodes and spleens of 4 dogs with vascular compromise and histiocytic inflammation. The detection of a circovirus in tissues of dogs expands the known tropism of these viruses to a second mammalian host. Our results indicate that circovirus, alone or in co-infection with other pathogens, might contribute to illness and death in dogs. Circoviruses are nonenveloped, spherical viruses with a single-stranded circular DNA genome of ≈ 2 kb; they group as a genus within the family Circoviridae, together with the proposed genus Cyclovirus and the phylogenetically more distinct genus Gyrovirus (1). Most of the known species in the genus Circovirus infect birds and cause signs including malformations and necrosis of the integument, lymphoid depletion, and immunosuppression (2).

40|$|Circoviruses {{are known}} to infect birds and pigs and can cause {{a wide range of}} severe {{symptoms}} with significant economic impact. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the Circoviridae family we tentatively named "Cyclovirus" whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the Circovirus genus. Circoviridae detection in the stools of U. S. adults was limited to <b>porcine</b> <b>circoviruses</b> which were also found in most U. S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U. S. human stools were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated {{that the majority of the}} 25 Cyclovirus species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission.

40|$|DNA {{cleavage}} and ligation are pivotal {{steps for}} initiation and termination of genome replication via the rolling circle mechanism. After recruitment of the replicon-encoded initiator protein, replication is initiated by {{introduction of a}} strand- and site-specific nick within the double-stranded origin of replication (dso). The resulting free 3 -hydroxyl group serves as a primer for DNA synthesis, while the 5 -phosphate group is displaced during DNA replication. After at least one round of replication, the nascent strand is cleaved again within the regenerated origin and the 5 -phosphate end is ligated to the newly created 3 -hydroxyl group resulting in release of unit-length monomers. Due to characteristic sequences found within the origin of replication and the replication proteins, genome amplification of <b>porcine</b> <b>circoviruses</b> type 1 and type 2 (PCV 1 and PCV 2) {{is assumed to be}} mediated by rolling circle replication. This study demonstrated {{for the first time the}} ability of Rep and Rep of PCV to introduce and reseal strand discontinuities within the origin of replication in vitro. Rep and Rep cleave the viral strand between nucleotides 7 and 8 within the conserved nonamer 5 -T 1 AGTATTAC 9 - 3  and become covalently attached to the 3 -cleavage product. The conserved nonamer is the only sequence element identified necessary for cleavage. Since PCV Rep and Rep are also capable of resealing the viral single-stranded DNA, participation of these proteins in termination of replication is suggested. In this context, joining was strictly dependent on preceding substrate cleavage as well as close proximity of origin fragments presumably accomplished by base pairing. Cleavage of origin fragments in vitro depends on conserved motives I, II and III. Mutation analysis identified tyrosine- 93 as the catalytic amino acid. In contrast, the GKS box is not essential for DNA cleavage, although PCV Rep was proven to hydrolyse ATP in vitro. Formation of homo- and heterocomplexes of the replication proteins was observed. This supports the hypothesis that Rep/Rep form a dimer or multimer for initiating and terminating RCR, thereby providing the second catalytic center essential for termination. The impact of the motives conserved in the replication proteins as well as in the origin of replication was tested in a cell culture-based replication asay. Integrity of conserved motives I, II, III as well as the GKS box and the ability of of PCV Rep/Rep to promote replication are linked. Recruitment of Rep and Rep to the viral origin by binding to hexamers H 1 /H 2 of the minimal binding site was demonstrated to be a prerequisite for replication. Cruciform extrusion for providing the single-stranded DNA conformation of the nonamer indispensable for cleavage and dependency of termination on sequences flanking the nonamer is suggested...|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of viruses}} carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and <b>circovirus.</b> <b>Porcine</b> herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be {{eliminated}} from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd.

50|$|Porcine {{parvovirus}} (PPV) causes reproductive {{failure of}} swine characterized by embryonic and fetal infection and death, {{usually in the}} absence of outward maternal clinical signs. The disease develops mainly when seronegative dams are exposed oronasally to the virus anytime during about the first half of gestation, and conceptuses are subsequently infected transplacentally before they become immunocompetent. There is no definitive evidence that infection of swine other than during gestation is of any clinical or economic significance. The virus is ubiquitous among swine throughout the world and is enzootic in most herds that have been tested. Diagnostic surveys have indicated that PPV is the major infectious cause of embryonic and fetal death. In addition to its direct causal role in reproductive failure, PPV can potentiate the effects of <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> type II (PCV2) infection in the clinical course of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).|$|E
5000|$|Many {{biologists}} consider viruses to be non-living {{because they}} lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products.

As well, an emerging idea that is gaining traction among some virologists {{is the concept of}} the virocell, in which the actual phenotype of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle is simply a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore. [...] The smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the bacteriophage Phi-X174 with a genome size of 5386 nucleotides.

Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses as well as others can have genomes that are considerably less that 2,000 nucleotides. [...] The smallest RNA viruses in terms of genome size are small retroviruses such as rous sarcoma virus with genomes of 3.5 kilo base pairs (kb) and particle diameters of 80 nanometres (nm). The smallest double stranded DNA viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb and 42 nm; parvoviruses have smaller capsids, at 18-26 nm, but larger genomes, at 5 kb.

40|$|Abstract <b>Porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> type 2 (PCV 2) is {{the primary}} causative agent of <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease, a complex multisystem {{syndrome}} in domestic pigs. Despite the significant economic losses caused by <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease, the mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying the clinical findings remain largely unclear. As various reports have highlighted the potential key role of vascular lesions in the pathogenesis of <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease, {{the aim of this}} work was to investigate effects of PCV 2 infection on vascular endothelial cells, focusing on cell viability and expression of adhesion/junction molecules. PCV 2 infection reduced endothelial cell viability, while viral infection did not affected the viability of several other classical cell lines. Also, PCV 2 infection in endothelial cells displayed a dual/biphasic effect: initially, infection increased ICAM- 1 expression, which can favor leukocyte recruitment and emigration to tissues and possibly inducing characteristic <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease inflammatory lesions; then, secondarily, infection caused an increase in zonula occludens 1 tight junction protein (ZO- 1) expression, which in turn can result in difficulties for cell traffic across the endothelium and a potential impairment the immune response in peripheral tissues. These virus-induced endothelial changes could directly impact the inflammatory process of <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease and associated vascular/immune system disturbances. Data suggest that, among the wide range of effects induced by PCV 2 on the host, endothelial modulation can be a pivotal process which can help to explain PCV 2 pathogenesis in some <b>porcine</b> <b>circovirus</b> disease presentations...|$|E
