40|$|During {{last years}} the {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} ice hockey related concussions have been increased and, hence, something {{should be done to}} stop this growth. The main aim {{of this study was to}} find out how dasher board materials and structures affect impact characteristics and, thereby, the risk of concussions. The measurements were divided into two parts; in the first part, the physiological characteristics of body checks were determined in real game measurements, and the second part, consisted of simulation of body checks in the laboratory. High speed cameras and accelerometers were used to collect data. More flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material (dasher board B) resulted in lower peak force and stiffness as well as greater stopping distance compared to the other dasher boards. However, the dasher board with flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material including shielding supporting posts resulted to be non-consistent and, thereby, that kind of dasher boards cannot be classified as safe ones. Single-framed dasher board was detected to be more flexible than dual-framed counterpart and heavier <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> resulted in significantly higher element stiffness (p <. 05). With this study it was shown that modification of the materials and structures of the dasher boards give an opportunity to affect impact characteristics and, thereby, the concussion risk. In the light of the results and the epidemiology of concussions it seems that the most safety dasher board would be single-framed with light and flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material and it would not include shielding supporting posts. However, there are still many questions under debate and, therefore, the investigation must be continued...|$|R

25|$|The {{protection}} of shipping {{was a source}} of controversy in the RAF, since it required a substantial commitment of fighters. On average the 12 convoys passing through the Channel waters needed cover every day and roughly one-third were attacked. It became an immediate burden to No. 11 Group RAF under the command of Keith Park which was responsible for defending south-west England. The employment of convoys from the Suffolk coast to Lyme Bay negated the value of using the sea as a <b>protective</b> <b>shield</b> because the location gave tactical advantages to the attacker. Coastal radar could give little advance warning of incoming raids since the proximity of Luftwaffe airbases, meant that German aircraft could attack and quickly withdraw, making interception difficult. Standing patrols over convoys could compensate but this exhausted pilots and handed the tactical initiative to the Germans.|$|E

When the station's <b>protective</b> <b>shield</b> is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest moon of the planet Endor (led by Han Solo) {{with the help of}} the native Ewoks, rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station targeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself, which eventually explodes and destroys the station.

Jet radius or liner thickness, shell thickness, liner material density, α angle and stand-off distance are evaluated in purpose to investigate {{their effect on}} performance of shaped charge jet velocity and jet breakup phenomena, also we investigate the effect of stand-off distance on shaped charge jet penetration into steel target. We also studied the performance of some <b>protective</b> <b>shields</b> materials in order to assure more protection for vehicle structure against shaped charge jet penetration. For that, different materials were used as armors such as: kevlar epoxy, polyethylene, glass epoxy, steel- 1006 and Al 2 O 3 ceramic.

25|$|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game with a}} third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for {{the first time in}} the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver). Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow and strong. Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair. In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen. Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, <b>protective</b> <b>shield.</b> The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely. Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. They lose health when they are attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health can be restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions. Players control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances, in certain parts of the game.|$|E
25|$|The Hatsuharu-class destroyers were {{designed}} to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's naval strategic projections. They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use. This required the gun turrets to be modified for high-angle fire, which also meant more powerful motors to traverse and elevate the guns more quickly to engage high-speed aircraft. The torpedo launchers were {{to be given a}} <b>protective</b> <b>shield</b> to allow for use in heavy weather and to protect against splinter damage. And the Hatsuharu vessels were to be fitted with modern, enclosed command spaces protected against strafing aircraft. These requirements could only be met by adding weight high up on the ship and increased the ship's center of gravity. The only way to adhere to the allotted displacement was to try to reduce the weight of the hull and other equipment below the waterline as much as possible. But this put the ship's designers in a no-win situation as any reduction of weight below the waterline further raised the ship's center of gravity and reduced her stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of galectin-3 is elevated in {{the circulation of}} patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer. It has also been identified bound to glycans {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells. In cancer patients whose cancer has metastasised, galectin-3 is higher still, suggesting that this galectin has a crucial role in metastasis. Galectin-3 also binds to MUC-1, a very large transmembrane mucin, which on cancer cells changes expression from long core 2 type O-glycosylation to shorter core 1 type O-glycosylation. Core 2 glycans terminate in galactose or sialic acid, whereas core 1 is branched and has potential for large carbohydrate extensions. High levels of MUC-1 are associated with poor prognosis and increased potential of metastasis. This cancer-associated MUC-1 is a natural ligand for galectin-3. In normal cells, MUC-1 has distinct polarisation and acts as a protective barrier around the cell, reducing cell-cell interactions. In breast cancer cells, it is hypothesised that galectin-3 has high affinity for cancer-associated MUC-1, causing depolarisation and breaking the cell's <b>protective</b> <b>shield.</b> This exposes small adhesion molecules {{on the surface of the}} cell, which interact with adhesion proteins on endothelial cell walls, such as E-selectin, promoting intravastion into the blood stream. Experiments shows that overexpression of MUC-1 alone is not enough to increase metastatic potential, and in fact it inhibits tumour cell entry into the blood stream. It requires the presence of upregulated galectin-3 in addition to MUC-1 to increase invasive and metastatic properties of the cancer. This is supported by other studies showing that inhibition of galectin-3 in human breast cancer cells lose their malignancy in vitro. This may provide a clue towards developing therapeutics for cancer, such as galactin-3 inhibitors.|$|E
