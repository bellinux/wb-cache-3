25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed <b>pressurized</b> <b>container</b> and is {{released}} in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|E
2500|$|Inhalation of butane {{can cause}} euphoria, drowsiness, , asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, {{fluctuations}} {{in blood pressure}} and temporary memory loss, when abused directly from a highly <b>pressurized</b> <b>container,</b> and can result in death from asphyxiation and ventricular fibrillation.

40|$|Efficient {{reliability}} industrial experiments {{consist of}} submitting items to accelerated life tests. It {{is of interest}} to obtain measures of the realiability of the devices under the usual working conditions, represented here by the mean lifetime. A practical problem refers {{to the accuracy of}} interval estimation of the parameter of interest when the sample size is small or moderate. In this paper, we describe the effect of several reparametrizations on the accuracy of the interval estimation. We propose a reparametrization that leads to accuracy while allowing orthogonality between the parameters. The idea is to consider a logarithmic reparametrization on orthogonal parameters in order to have independent maximum likelihood estimates with good asymptotic normal approximation. The study is illustrated by a data set on an accelerated life test at <b>pressurized</b> <b>containers</b> of Kevlan/Epoxy 49. ...|$|R
50|$|HFC-125 (ECARO-25 / FE-25 / NAF S 125) is a gaseous fire {{suppression}} agent {{which can be}} used in clean agent {{fire suppression}} systems. It is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment, or where water-based fire protection is impractical, such as museums, banks, clean rooms and hospitals. HFC-125 does not deplete ozone (ODP 0). The HFC-125 clean agent is stored in a <b>pressurized</b> <b>container</b> and introduced into the hazard as a gas. The agent is odorless, colorless, electrically non-conductive, non-corrosive, and leaves no residue. It is used in occupied enclosed areas that contain high-value assets.|$|E
50|$|Propane is {{a popular}} choice for {{barbecues}} and portable stoves because the low boiling point of -42 C makes it vaporize {{as soon as it}} is released from its <b>pressurized</b> <b>container.</b> Therefore, no carburetor or other vaporizing device is required; a simple metering nozzle suffices. Propane powers some locomotives, buses, forklifts, taxis, outboard boat motors, and ice resurfacing machines and is used for heat and cooking in recreational vehicles and campers. Since it can be transported easily, it {{is a popular}} fuel for home heat and backup electrical generation in sparsely populated areas that do not have natural gas pipelines.|$|E
5000|$|Inhalants are a {{broad range}} of {{household}} and industrial chemicals whose volatile vapors or pressurized gases are concentrated and breathed in via the nose or mouth to produce intoxication (called [...] "getting high" [...] in slang), in a manner not intended by the manufacturer. They are inhaled at room temperature through volatilization (in the case of gasoline or acetone) or from a <b>pressurized</b> <b>container</b> (e.g., nitrous oxide or butane), and do not include drugs that are sniffed after burning or heating. For example, amyl nitrite (poppers), nitrous oxide and toluene - a solvent widely used in contact cement and model airplane glue - are considered inhalants, but smoking tobacco, cannabis, and crack are not, even though these drugs are inhaled (as smoke).|$|E

40|$|The current {{development}} of solar power converters with air as working fluid focuses mostly on concentrating collectors combined with hot-air engines, and on very low temperature solar tower concepts. Whilst concentrating collectors and Stirling engines need complex technology, solar tower converters have very low efficiencies and require large installations. <b>Pressurized</b> <b>containers</b> as energy converters offer {{the advantage of}} simplicity, but appear {{not to have been}} investigated in detail. In order to assess their performance potential, an idealised thermal pressure converter was analysed theoretically. Two improvements to increase the initially low efficiency derived from theory were found. Neglecting losses, maximum theoretical efficiencies ranged from 6. 7 % for a temperature difference of 60 K to 17. 7 % for a difference of 195 K. The low pressure solar thermal converter appears to offer development potential for low-tech solar energy conversion. <br/...|$|R
