5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E

40|$|Female {{undergraduates}} from {{a private}} college {{on the east coast}} were surveyed regarding their feelings about having children and were asked to complete the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). Eighty-one percent of the respondents indicated a desire to have one or more children. Nineteen percent responded negatively or were uncertain of their feelings at that time. On the BSRI, 12 % were classified as Masculine, 38 % as Feminine, 37 % as Androgynous, 13 % as Undifferentiated. Comparison of the Masculine, Feminine and Androgynous groups (the Undifferentiated group was excluded from analysis) showed that the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Feminine <b>women</b> indicating a desire to have children was significantly higher than the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Masculine <b>women.</b> The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Androgynous <b>women</b> indicating a desire to have children was significantly higher than the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Masculine expressing that same desire.

METHODS: The Antiretroviral Therapy in Lower-Income Countries, ART-LINC Collaboration is a network of clinics providing HAART in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. We compared UNAIDS data on the gender distribution of HIV infection with the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and men receiving HAART in the ART-LINC Collaboration. RESULTS: Twenty-nine centers in 13 countries participated. Among 33, 164 individuals, 19, 989 (60. 3 %) were <b>women.</b> <b>Proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> receiving HAART in ART-LINC centers were similar to, or higher than, UNAIDS estimates <b>of</b> the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV-infected <b>women</b> in all but two centers. There were fewer women receiving HAART than expected from UNAIDS data in one center in Uganda and one center in India. Taking into account heterogeneity across cohorts, women were younger than men, {{less likely to have}} advanced HIV infection, and more likely to be anemic at HAART initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Women in resource-constrained settings are not necessarily disadvantaged in their access to HAART.
