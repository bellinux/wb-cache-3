5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{visit to}} Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have {{encouraged}} {{an interest in}} the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.|$|E

40|$|This {{work-in-progress}} paper {{consists of}} four points which relate to the foundations and physical realization of quantum computing. The first <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the qubit cannot be taken as the basic unit for quantum computing, because not every superposition of bit-strings of length n can be factored into a string of n-qubits. The second <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the “No-cloning” theorem {{does not apply to}} the copying of one quantum register into another register, because the mathematical representation of this copying is the identity operator, which is manifestly linear. The third <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> quantum parallelism <b>is</b> not destroyed only by environmental decoherence. There are two other forms of decoherence, which we call measurement decoherence and internal decoherence, that can also destroy quantum parallelism. The fourth <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> processing the contents of a quantum register “one qubit at a time” destroys entanglement...|$|R

25|$|The women's {{contribution}} {{to the war effort}} challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticised Whorf's {{examples}} from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent {{events in the}} real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> while English speakers may be able to understand how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not think in that way.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by a train wreck that occurred in 1878 in the town of Bennett, Colorado (then known as Kiowa Crossing) in which a Kansas Pacific Railway train was swept away when a rail bridge washed out. Most of the wreck was recovered save for the locomotive. Ironically, in 1989 (the year the novel takes place) it was discovered that the Kansas Pacific Railway had secretly recovered the locomotive and placed it back into service, yet still wrote it off and therefore committed insurance fraud. A further ironic <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Canada would sever its last legal dependence on the British government in 1982, the year after the book was published, {{with the passage of the}} Canada Act.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of using}} steady {{alternating}} current (AC) to create the pinch had a serious limitation. AC power drops to zero voltage twice per cycle, and during this time it would not induce a current in the plasma, briefly ending confinement. Direct current (DC) power avoids this issue. Another key <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the current in the plasma also heated it. In the original designs, a weak pinch current was used for confinement while the external heaters slowly heated the plasma. But if the current was also used as the heat source there was no practical limit to the heating rate, which was limited only {{by the power of}} the pulse. Combining the two concepts, a new reactor design emerged where the system operated in brief but powerful pulses. Such a machine would demand a very large power supply.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{replacement}} of the Dundee foundry engine there is no record of the Stirling brothers having any further involvement with air engine development, and the Stirling engine never again competed with steam as an industrial scale power source. (Steam boilers were becoming safer and steam engines more efficient, thus presenting less of a target for rival prime movers). However, beginning about 1860, smaller engines of the Stirling/hot air type were produced in substantial numbers for applications in which reliable sources of low to medium power were required, such as pumping air for church organs or raising water. These smaller engines generally operated at lower temperatures so as not to tax available materials, and so were relatively inefficient. Their selling <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> unlike steam engines, they could be operated safely by anybody capable of managing a fire. Several types remained in production beyond the end of the century, but apart from a few minor mechanical improvements the design of the Stirling engine in general stagnated during this period.|$|E
500|$|Due to Joe's rant at Turning Point, TNA {{created a}} storyline in which Joe {{was unhappy with}} his {{position}} in the company. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe and Nash would team up to challenge for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Final Resolution. At the event, Nash abandoned Joe, causing him to fight off both A.J. Styles and Tomko, before succumbing to defeat in the storyline. After this, Joe and Nash began a partnership, in which Nash tried to help Joe deal with his issues over {{the way he was}} treated by TNA, and secured him a new contract. Joe was soon given a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on the February 21, 2008 episode of Impact! by Cornette. At Lockdown, Joe defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Joe held the championship until TNA's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October 12, 2008, in which Sting defeated Joe with help from Nash (who had been inactive since the summer). On the October 30, 2008 episode of Impact!, Nash said the reason Hall missed the match at Turning <b>Point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] Hall did not believe that Joe was [...] "worth the rub". Joe and Nash fought at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on November 9, 2008, which Nash won. Joe and Nash fought again several months later at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 24, 2009, where Joe won, thus ending the feud.|$|E

500|$|On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel {{his first}} {{interview}} on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline. The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar {{appeared on the}} program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's [...] "ulterior motive" [...] is really {{to get people to}} take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the Time magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article, {{and the rest of the}} twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article, and Miscavige called Behar [...] "a hater". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to [...] "kidnap Scientologists out". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was [...] "missing the issue", and said that his real <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he thought the article was not an objective piece.|$|E

40|$|The Purpose of {{this study}} is to clarify the {{contents}} and features of Government Plan for Sport, Performance Measurement for the Development of Sport, and Active Britain- A Manifesto for Sport and Recreation etc. which were published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Sport England and the Central Council of Physical Recreation respectively. As the DCMS pointed out, for the first time in the history of sport development in Britain, government policy-making involved the people who actually work in sport at all levels - in schools, local authorities, communities, national governing bodies, administrative bodies, sports charities and equity groups. In this article, I will try to grasp some points of network of sports actors, which are trying to influence the future of sports policy direction using their own resources. The findings of my study can be summarized as follows. The first <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the DCMS <b>is</b> increasingly establishing pluralistic routes for sports actors and is emphasizing importance of marketing and self-responsibility. The second <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> competitiveness among actors is intensified. The third <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a correlation between the public sectors (DCMS, Sport England, UK Sport etc.) and voluntary sectors (CCPR etc). The fourth <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> actor's networking tendency requires cooperation between both sectors.
