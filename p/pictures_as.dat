5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left {{the stage for}} 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E

This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Following a career-ending {{illness or}} injury (the sources {{disagree}} on the cause), which left him in constant pain, Barbette returned to Texas but continued {{to work as a}} consultant for motion <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> well as training and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised both the provocative <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> well as simpler shots of Gaga without makeup and stage costumes. The book appeared at number five on The New York Times Best Seller list, before fluctuating down the ranking in subsequent weeks. Due to {{a lawsuit against}} Gaga by her former assistant, in 2013 the photos taken by Richardson were asked to be submitted as evidence for the case.|$|E

5|$|Written by Douglas Adams, {{this was}} one of several ideas that Adams {{proposed}} to the production office around 1976. It was rejected by script editor Robert Holmes, who nonetheless encouraged Adams to continue submitting material; this ultimately led to his commission for The Pirate Planet. In 1980, Adams revised The Krikkitmen for use by Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>as</b> a potential Doctor Who feature film, although nothing came of this project. Finally, Adams included many of the ideas from The Krikkitmen in his novel Life, the Universe and Everything, the second sequel to his The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other <b>pictures</b> <b>as</b> well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E

5|$|The film {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1990 at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, or New Line Cinema at various times, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>as</b> its distributor. Favreau signed on as director, aiming for a naturalistic feel, and he chose to shoot the film primarily in California, rejecting the East Coast setting of the comics to differentiate the film from numerous superhero films set in New York City-esque environments. Filming began in March 2007 and concluded in June. During filming, the actors were free {{to create their own}} dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armors, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.|$|E
5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal <b>Pictures</b> <b>as</b> distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E
5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal <b>Pictures,</b> <b>as</b> executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E

5|$|The {{company that}} would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie {{subsidiary}} of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company, {{a subsidiary of the}} French Pathé Frères company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C <b>Pictures,</b> <b>as</b> it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.|$|E
