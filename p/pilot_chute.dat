25|$|Komarov. Kamanin, as {{the state}} {{commissioner}} for the Soyuz 1 launch, was present at Baikonur throughout launch preparation that began 6 April 1967. Once the rocket lifted off on 23 April Kamanin {{took charge of the}} first mission control shift. Vladimir Komarov, on his second orbit, reported failure in solar panels - one of them failed to deploy. So far, the situation was manageable, and Kamanin dispatched Gagarin to the second mission control station in Yevpatoria. On the 13th orbit, state commission realized imminent danger and decided to land Komarov and cancel Soyuz 2. 6:45 AM, 24 April while Komarov was still alive, Kamanin boarded the plane departing to the landing area. In the air, Kamanin received the first (incorrect) news of Soyuz descending with a fully deployed parachute. He was not aware of disaster until meeting General Artamonov on the Orsk airfield. Kamanin lost an hour and half travelling to the crash site, only to see the capsule still on fire. Later, the Soyuz 1 parachute failure was linked to an insufficient <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> that failed to drag the main parachute from its container.|$|E
50|$|The {{throw-out}} <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is {{the most}} popular type in use today. The <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> When the user grabs the handle and throws the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> and the throw-out <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|E
5000|$|Bill also {{invented the}} {{pull-out}} and throw-out <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> [...] A <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{is a small}} parachute used to extract and deploy a main parachute. The throw-out approach replaces the spring-loaded <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> which was released by a rip-cord. The throw-out system allows the skydiver to deploy his or her <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> directly into the air stream. Other inventions include the Skyhook RSL safety device and the [...] "Sigma System" [...] for tandem drogue release.|$|E
50|$|The {{pull-out}} and throw-out <b>pilot</b> <b>chutes</b> {{are identical}} in construction; {{the difference is}} in their connection to the handle and the bridle, {{and in the way}} they are packed.|$|R
50|$|Drogues used on tandem-systems are {{basically}} large throw-out <b>pilot</b> <b>chutes,</b> but the bridle is anchored on the container with a release system. When the user throws the drogue, the drogue inflates and the bridle extends. The deployed drogue slows down the free-fall {{speed of the}} tandem pair. When the user wants to open the parachute, he pulls a ripcord, releasing the bridle and allowing the drogue to open the main container.|$|R
50|$|Although possible, it is {{difficult}} to cause the aircraft to get into a dangerous attitude, stall, or chute collapse by means of <b>pilot</b> control inputs. <b>Chute</b> collapse is considered by many pilots to be virtually impossible with square wings. The wing is more likely to collapse with the more maneuverable, but inherently less stable, elliptical wing, but such collapses are normally followed by an immediate reflation and often go unnoticed by the pilot. In the rare circumstances where an elliptical wing collapses, the collapse is caused either by some extreme adverse meteorological condition or by pilot error. The Federal Aviation Administration reports that over 80 percent of all aviation accidents are due to pilot error. Inflatable ram-air elliptical wings can have upward of 30 individual cells whereas square wings typically have fewer than 13 cells.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of smaller higher {{performance}} canopies, the drag induced by trailing a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> behind a canopy has become a significant concern. To reduce this drag some <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> designs of the Pull-out and Throw-out variety are collapsible. Once deployment of the parachute has occurred a kill line running up {{the center of the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> bridle becomes loaded. This kill line pulls down on the apex of the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> collapsing it and greatly reducing its drag on the canopy.|$|E
50|$|With the {{pull-out}} system, the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{is packed}} inside the container. The activation handle {{is attached to}} a lanyard, which in turn is attached to the closing pin. The lanyard is also attached to base of the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> at the point of connection to the bridle. When the user pulls the handle, the closing pin is pulled, opening the container. Continuing the pull, the user pulls the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> out of the container and into the airstream, at which point the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> inflates and pulls the main parachute out of the container.|$|E
50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> and opens the container; the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.|$|E
5000|$|The LAPES {{delivery}} procedure {{begins by}} slowing to approach speed, lowering the ramp, and opening the cargo door. To preclude {{damage to the}} aircraft from an inadvertent contact with the ground, the landing gear is lowered. The aircraft approaches the extraction zone {{in a manner similar}} to landing. On command of the <b>pilot,</b> the drogue <b>chute</b> is released and allowed to trail behind the aircraft on a tether. As the pilot flares and achieves a wheel height of 1-2 meters above ground, the drogue chute is allowed to pull the extraction chutes out into the airstream. The force of these chutes overcomes the floor locks, pulling the pallet across the ramp, out of the aircraft, and onto the extraction zone. The pilot adjusts the flight controls to remain level during the extreme change in the aircraft center of gravity caused by the pallet movement. While the pallet slides to a stop using the extraction chutes as a brake, the pilot climbs away from the extraction zone and raises the landing gear. On climb out, the rear cargo door is closed and the ramp is raised, completing the sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Ward {{was sent}} with his unit to Egypt {{and participated in}} the North African Campaign. Around midday on 17 June 1942, Ward's {{squadron}} was returning to base, very low on fuel, when they were attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 27. Two Hawker Hurricanes were shot down and their pilots bailed out. Most of the Squadron had not noticed this and landed, but according to Allied reports, Ward returned to protect the pilots in their parachutes only to be shot down and killed. According to the German report of the action: Around midday four Bf 109s ran into ten Hurricanes and approximately 20 Curtiss planes in the air between Gambut and Ras Azeiz. Oberleutnant Marseille {{was the first to}} dive into a thick crowd of enemy fighters and shot one of them down on his first pass. As he was breaking to shake an enemy off his tail, another plane flitted across his gunsight. Marseille fired immediately and this opponent, too, fell burning. He then sighted four fighters flying in a defensive circle protecting their fellow <b>pilots</b> in the <b>chute</b> harness. Marseille shot down two more out of the Lufbery circle.|$|R
50|$|Only the hand-deployed <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> may be {{collapsed}} automatically after deploymentâ€”by a {{kill line}} reducing the in-flight drag of the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{on the main}} canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This {{is known as a}} free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{is a small}} {{auxiliary}} parachute used to deploy the main or reserve parachute. The <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{is connected to the}} deployment bag containing the parachute by a bridle. On modern skydiving rigs three types of pilot chutes can be found: ...|$|E
5000|$|Occasionally, a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> {{does not}} {{generate}} enough force either {{to pull the}} pin or to extract the bag. Causes {{may be that the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is caught in the turbulent wake of the jumper (the [...] "burble"), the closing loop holding the pin is too tight, or the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is generating insufficient force. This effect is known as [...] "pilot chute hesitation," [...] and, if it does not clear, it can lead to a total malfunction, requiring reserve deployment.|$|E
50|$|The Skyhook {{system is}} {{engineered}} {{so that it}} should not interfere with reserve deployment activated by directly pulling the reserve rip cord in situations where no main parachute had been deployed. The key component in the system, from which the Skyhook derives its name, is a cantilevered hook that grasps the reserve bridle about midway between the reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> and the bag containing the packed reserve chute. If the departing main parachute applies more pull force on the bridle than the reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> then the main parachute will remain hooked onto the reserve bridle, and so it will pull the reserve parachute out of the reserve compartment. If the reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> exerts more pull force on the bridle than the main parachute, then the main parachute will unhook and the reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> will deploy the reserve parachute normally.|$|E
50|$|The {{spring-loaded}} <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is used {{in conjunction}} with a ripcord. When the user pulls the ripcord, the container opens, allowing the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> compressed inside and loaded with a large spring inside it to jump out. Spring-loaded pilot chutes are mainly used to deploy reserve parachutes. They are often also used to deploy the main parachute on skydiving students' parachute equipment.|$|E
50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular {{throw-out}} deployment system where the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the deployment bag from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked during packing or where the kill line has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> It can be caused by a mis-routed <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> bridle. It can also be caused by too large a deployment bag and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped deployment bag. If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> hesitation.|$|E
50|$|Some designs {{replace the}} kill {{line with a}} fixed length of shock cord, which {{stretches}} when the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is moving quickly, allowing it to inflate. When the pilot slows down (after opening a canopy, for example) the shock cord retracts, killing the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> While this avoids the possibility of pilot-in-tow malfunction due to an un-cocked pilot, it has the disadvantage of requiring significant airspeed to operate. This could cause a delayed deployment if used for a BASE or balloon jump, or any other jump with a low speed deployment. This type may also begin to re-inflate behind a highly loaded, fast moving canopy, negating the usefulness of a collapsible <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Type V airdrop {{platform}} being extracted by a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> from a C-130 Hercules during an airdrop ...|$|E
50|$|The skydiver may {{attempt to}} extract the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> or clear the entanglement. Extracting the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> while simple {{during the course of}} a normal jump, becomes a new challenge, because its {{location}} will have shifted due to the deployment of the main canopy. Skydivers may wish to practice on the ground deploying their <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> with the main canopy out of the container in order to gain experience with this procedure. If successfully cleared, the main parachute will likely fail to deploy correctly due to severe line twists. However, the skydiver can treat this as a normal high-speed malfunction, release the main, and deploy the reserve. Failing to clear the entanglement prior to deploying the reserve may result in a main-reserve entanglement.|$|E
50|$|A ripcord {{is a part}} of a skydiving harness-container system; {{a handle}} {{attached}} to a steel cable ending in a closing pin. The pin keeps the container closed and keeps the spring-loaded <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> inside. When the ripcord is pulled, the container is opened and the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is released, opening the parachute. On tandem systems the ripcord releases the 3-ring release system anchoring the bridle to the harness-container, allowing the parachute to open.|$|E
50|$|These {{types of}} AAD {{typically}} employ a small pyrotechnic charge to sever the reserve container closing loop, allowing the spring-loaded reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> to deploy.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "horseshoe" [...] {{describes}} a malfunction where a parachute deploys, but remains {{attached to a}} skydiver by its risers {{and at least one}} other point. This prevents the canopy from opening properly and the canopy and lines form a horseshoe shape extending from the risers up and then back down again to the other point where the parachute remains attached to or entangled with the skydiver. This malfunction may occur when the closing pin of a skydiving rig is released from the closing loop and allows the deployment bag to separate from the container. Because the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is still stowed, the malfunction takes on the shape of a horseshoe. This malfunction may also occur if the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> or bridle connecting the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> to the canopy becomes entangled with the skydiver. It is possible, though rare, to experience this type of malfunction when one or more parachute lines entangle with or snag on some portion of the parachute rig.|$|E
50|$|The CYPRES {{works by}} using a cutter to cut the reserve {{container}} closing loop. A spring-loaded <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> then leaves the container and breaks through the skydiver's slipstream to begin reserve deployment.|$|E
50|$|A {{closing pin}} is a curved piece of {{stainless}} steel metal used in the sport of skydiving. The pin is sewn onto the bridle which is a 7 to 10-foot long piece of nylon webbing connected to the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> The closing pin passes through the closing loop and in doing so, secures the main container of a skydiving rig, keeping the parachute from deploying prematurely. When the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is thrown out by the skydiver and catches air, it pulls the closing pin from the closing loop and allows the main parachute {{to be released from}} the container and inflate.|$|E
50|$|Drogue parachutes are {{sometimes}} used to deploy a main or reserve parachute {{by using the}} drag generated by the drogue to pull the main parachute out of its container. Such a drogue {{is referred to as}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> when used in a single user (sports) parachute system. The <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> is only used to deploy the main or reserve parachute; it is not used for slowing down or for stability. Tandem systems are different; a drogue is so deployed shortly after exiting the aircraft as to reduce the terminal velocity of the pair of tandem jumpers. It is later used to deploy the main parachute as on sports systems.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} parachutes used in PR-5 WiewiÃ³r plus allow to control descent {{velocity}} depending on airplane weight and expected windspeed. Two basic types: ring and cruciform parachutes in various sizes are available; all use <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> pull-out deployment.|$|E
50|$|Paratroopers' main parachutes {{are usually}} {{deployed}} by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag {{that contains the}} parachuteâ€”without relying on a <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> for deployment. In this configuration the deployment bag {{is known as a}} direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.|$|E
50|$|Instructor-assisted {{deployment}} (IAD) is {{a parachute}} deployment program most adequately similar to static line. The main {{difference is that}} instead of being deployed by a static line, the student's jumpmaster (who is in the plane with them) deploys the student's parachute by throwing the <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> downward and clear of the door as the student exits.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Bill Booth {{started the}} Relative Workshop in a Miami garage. In the late 1970s Bill made two major {{contributions}} {{to the world of}} skydiving. First he invented and patented the Hand Deploy <b>Pilot</b> <b>Chute</b> System, which soon changed the sport forever. The second invention, and perhaps his greatest contribution to the sport, was the invention of the 3-ring release system.|$|E
50|$|During the {{following}} atmospheric flight, the Entry Module slowed {{down to about}} 240 m/s and as it passed 10.6 Kilometers in altitude, initiated the parachute deployment sequence. Three chutes were sequentially deployed (a <b>Pilot</b> <b>Chute,</b> a Drogue Chute and the Main Chute). The deployment of the Main Chute occurred {{at an altitude of}} about 7.5 Kilometers slowing the spacecraft to 6 m/s.|$|E
50|$|The Skyhook {{system can}} also cause complications. One such {{incident}} was captured on video, where a spinning main caused a Skyhook to severely twist the reserve. A standard RSL or manual reserve pull would have taken longer to deployâ€”but a reserve <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> would have pulled the reserve freebag upwards, rather than spinning and entangling it. Due to the increased risk of spinning malfunctions, the use of Skyhooks with high-performance canopies remains an active area of discussion.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} war, {{there was an}} effort to combine the best aspects of then current {{parachute}} designs. The resulting parachute, the Airplane Parachute Type-A, incorporated Charles Broadwick's coatpack, a ripcord that allowed a pilot to manually deploy the parachute instead of depending on a static line connected to a plane, and a small <b>pilot</b> <b>chute</b> that pulled the parachute from its pack. The Airplane Parachute Type-A was widely used and saved a number of people, including a young Charles Lindbergh.|$|E
50|$|The B53 was 12 ft {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of 50 in. It weighed 8850 lb, including the W53 warhead, the 800 to 900 lb parachute system and the honeycomb aluminum nose cone to enable the bomb to survive laydown delivery. It had five parachutes: one 5 ft <b>pilot</b> <b>chute,</b> one 16 ft extractor chute, and three 48 ft main chutes. Chute deployment depends on delivery mode, with the main chutes used only for laydown delivery. For free-fall delivery, the entire system was jettisoned.|$|E
50|$|One {{way to make}} a {{parachute}} open very quickly is to use a static line or direct bag. These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps â€” below 60 m â€” to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the paratrooper's deployment system, also called a PCA (<b>Pilot</b> <b>Chute</b> Assist).|$|E
50|$|The RAPS {{system was}} {{developed}} from the Static Line Rounds system. It enabled a student to make their first jumps on a ram-air parachute, which offers softer landings and more control. RAPS evolved into the category system, which allows students to use ram-air canopies from their first jump. In the early jumps the parachute is deployed automatically using a static line; after proving basic proficiency the student progresses onto freefall, opening their own parachute {{by means of a}} ripcord and spring-loaded <b>pilot</b> <b>chute.</b> The static line method is used in many countries, and although it varies it is, in general, based upon the following structure.|$|E
