25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> separate. The twelve <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that any amount of postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|E
25|$|With the {{termination}} of <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps the need for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Postage Due stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular postage due stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular postage due stamp.|$|E
25|$|The British Postal Consultancy Service made a Report in 1994 {{recommending that}} the Post Office should run commercially instead {{of by the}} government. Therefore, on 1 October 1995, Posta Limited came into being and took over the GPO, the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> and all Branch Offices and Sub Post Offices. In 1997, the GPO, Central Mail Room, <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> and Philatelic Bureau {{moved to a new}} complex in Qormi Road, Marsa, where it remains to this day.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of ordinary postage stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps were allowed for use to pay the postage for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parcel</b> <b>post</b> {{is perhaps}} the least collected, or studied, area of postal history due {{to the size of}} {{potential}} material much of which is never saved. From 1883 Special labels were applied to parcels in Great Britain. International parcels handling tend to gather Customs evidence making for attractive material.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps of 191213 {{were printed}} on the flat plate press which yielded plate blocks of six stamps with the plate number {{designated}} in the margin (designating a particular printing run). Beginning in January 1913, the denomination of the stamps was printed in word form in the margin.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{complexity}} of management {{is associated with}} importantdecision making, confronting {{a great number of}} uselessinformation. Selection of information- the choice of only qualityones, i. e. essential ones, is a big problem in management decision-making. Implementation of systemic approach i. e. dialectical-network thinking (DNT) can help to deal with it. Thepaper presents a holistic thinking approach in a case study forthe Slovenian parcel postal problem. The volume of parcelflows at the Post of Slovenia between Posts is increasing rapidlyand it requires a new design of the postal network. This paperpresents a reorganization of parcel services between Postal LogisticsCenters and Posts by adding Regional <b>Parcel</b> Centersand <b>Parcel</b> <b>Posts</b> to the network. A case for the area covered byLjubljana Postal Logistics Center is given, which takes intoconsideration the sorting out and the retaining of parcels in thePosts, <b>Parcel</b> <b>Posts</b> and Regional <b>Parcel</b> Centers within their individualareas...|$|R

25|$|A special {{printing}} of the 191213 <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps {{was made for}} the Panama-Pacific Exposition held in San Francisco in 1915 from the dies that made the printing plates for this series of stamps.

25|$|Aside from {{items that}} were {{considered}} dangerous to handle, almost any type of merchandise was allowed to be mailed by the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service, even baby alligators and honey bees. (Such fragile items were later additionally charged by Special handling stamps.) Soon the new service was widely used by farmers and other rural Americans to purchase merchandise they previously could not obtain at their remote locations. This in turn aided the growth of mail order giants such as Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward.|$|E

As an alternative summer training program, the 307th held cavalry Citizens' Military Training Camp training at Fort Myer, and its primary ROTC feeder school was the Virginia Military Institute. Its designated mobilization training station was the York Concentration Area in Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|The brigade {{held its}} {{inactive}} training period {{meetings at the}} <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Building in Richmond. Between 1923 and 1940, the 154th usually conducted summer training at Fort Meade in Maryland, occasionally holding summer training with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment at Fort Myer or Fort Belvoir. Its subordinate regiments provided basic military instruction to civilians under the Citizens' Military Training Camp program at Fort Myer and Fort Belvoir {{with the assistance of}} the 3rd Cavalry as an alternate form of training. During its participation in the July 1930 Third Corps Area command post exercise, the brigade was temporarily commanded by 306th Cavalry commander, politician, and lawyer John Philip Hill. After the United States entered World War II, the brigade was disbanded on 30 January 1942 along with the division, after most of its officers were called up for active duty.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, due to {{the immense}} value of the Cullinan, the {{authorities}} {{in charge of the}} transportation were posed with a huge potential security problem. Detectives from London were placed on a steamboat that was rumoured to carry the stone, where a parcel was ceremoniously placed in the captain's safe and guarded throughout the entire journey. However, this was a diversionary tactic. The stone on that ship was a fake, meant to attract those who would be interested in stealing it. The actual diamond was sent to England in a plain box via <b>parcel</b> <b>post,</b> albeit registered. Upon receiving the stone safely in England Sir Francis Hopwood and Mr Richard Solomon (the Agent-General of the Transvaal government in London) travelled from London to Sandringham, Norfolk by train, accompanied by just two experienced Scotland Yard policemen. They reached their destination safely, despite reports of a potential robbery looming. Later that day, Edward invested Solomon as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).|$|E

25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods and imagine how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E

Harlan noted that after hearing of the abuses of the express system, Lane recommended to Congress that it establish a <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> service {{as part of the}} United States Post Office Department.

2500|$|The U.S. <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular postage items, whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The new stamps were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas. Partly owing to some confusion involving their usage, their exclusive use as <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps proved short lived, as regular postage stamps were soon allowed {{to be used to}} pay parcel postage rates.|$|E
