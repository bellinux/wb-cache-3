25|$|In the {{interest}} of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned <b>position</b> <b>control</b> system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move {{it away from the}} required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.|$|E

The {{position}} of the cart [...] relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the {{position of}} the cart, that is, null angle [...] where [...] is small. [...] This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical. [...] Any offset in the tilt sensor or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset.

2500|$|Often the {{observed}} signal is offset by a steady component, {{and only the}} changes are of interest. A switch (AC position) connects a capacitor in series with the input that passes only the changes (provided {{that they are not}} too slow -- [...] "slow" [...] would mean visible). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the input is connected directly (DC switch position). Most oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third switch position (GND) that disconnects the input and grounds it.

40|$|Magnetic {{shape memory}} alloys (MSM alloys), {{a new kind}} of smart materials, have become a {{potential}} candidate in many engineering fields. MSMs have the advantage of bearing a huge strain, much larger than other materials. In addition, they also have fast response. These characteristics make MSM a good choice in micro engineering. However, MSMs display the obvious hysteresis phenomenon of nonlinear behavior. Thus the difficulty in using the MSM element as a positioning actuator is increased due to the hysteresis. In this paper, the hysteresis phenomenon of the MSM actuator is analyzed, and the closed-loop <b>positioning</b> <b>control</b> is also implemented experimentally. For that, a modified fuzzy sliding mode control (MFSMC) is proposed. The MFSMC and the PID control are used to design the controllers for realizing the <b>positioning</b> <b>control.</b> The experimental results are compared under different experimental conditions, such as different frequency, amplitude, and loading. The experimental results show that the precise <b>positioning</b> <b>control</b> of MFSMC can be achieved satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The main {{objective}} of all organizations {{is to improve}} the efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel’s performance and this partly depends on effective management. Managers are valuable assets and studying their behavior and personality dimensions may provide important guide for effectiveness and efficiency improvement. In this connection, the objective of this research is to determine the association between organizational effectiveness and the personnel managers’ <b>position</b> of <b>control</b> in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The present research is a cross-sectional study. The statistical societies of this research included all personnel and personnel managers in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. 168 subjects of 8 departments were selected through accidental-stratified sampling and the data for the managers of these departments were also collected. Two questionnaires, organizational effectiveness and Ratters’ <b>position</b> of <b>control,</b> were used for data collection. Results: The results of this research showed that there was a significant association between organizational effectiveness and managers’ <b>position</b> of <b>control.</b> However, we didn’t find a statistically significant association between organizational effectiveness and managers’ <b>position</b> of <b>control</b> in terms of their sex, managerial experience and education. Conclusion: As managers with internal <b>position</b> of <b>control</b> are more effective than those with external <b>position</b> of <b>control,</b> we can appoint individuals with internal <b>control</b> <b>position</b> to managerial posts. Furthermore, we can train managers to shift their external <b>position</b> of <b>control</b> to the internal one...|$|R

A secondary objective was to prospectively assess the additional costs of 3 D versus 2 D imaging with portal imaging for patient <b>positioning</b> <b>controls.</b> Patients and methods Economics data are issued from a multicenter randomized medico-economics trial comparing the two frequencies of patient <b>positioning</b> <b>control</b> during prostate IGRT. A prospective cohort with patient <b>positioning</b> <b>control</b> with PI (control group) was constituted for the cost comparison between 3 D (IGRT) versus 2 D imaging. The economical evaluation was focused to the radiotherapy direct costs, adopting the hospital's point of view and using a microcosting method applied to the parameters that may lead to cost differences between evaluated strategies. Results The economical analysis included a total of 241 patients enrolled between 2007 and 2011 in seven centres, 183 in the randomized study (128 with CBCT and 55 with fiducial markers) and 58 in the control group. Compared to weekly controls, the average additional cost per patient of daily controls was € 847 (CBCT) and € 179 (markers). Compared to PI, the average additional cost per patient was € 1392 (CBCT) and € 997 (fiducial markers) for daily controls; € 545 (CBCT) and € 818 (markers) in case of weekly controls. Conclusion A daily frequency for image control in IGRT and 3 D images patient <b>positioning</b> <b>control</b> (IGRT) for prostate cancer lead to significant additional cost compared to weekly control and 2 D imaging (PI). Long-term clinical assessment will permit to assess the medico-economical ratio of these innovative radiotherapy modalities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{achieving}} a cooperative behavior in a dual-arm robot system is addressed. A control strategy is conceived in which one robot is <b>position</b> <b>controlled</b> and devoted to task execution, whereas a suitable compliance is conferred to the end effector of the other robot to cope with unavoidable misalignment between the two arms and task planning inaccuracies. A modular control structure is adopted that allows {{the selection of the}} proper operating mode for each robot, depending on the task requirements. The proposed approach is experimentally tested in two different tasks involving the two robots in the laboratory setup. First, a parts-mating task of peg-in-hole type is executed; the robot carrying the peg is <b>position</b> <b>controlled,</b> whereas the robot holding the hollow part is controlled to behave as a mechanical impedance. Then, a pressure-forming task is executed, in which a disk-shaped tool is required to align with a flat surface while exerting a desired pressure; in this case, the robot carrying the disk is <b>position</b> <b>controlled,</b> whereas the robot holding the surface is force controlled.
