Malta’s old image of “sun, sea, and sand” and four star hotels is slowly being replaced by cultural tourism, which involves reallocation of funding to develop and sustain cultural heritage sites for tourism. This paper presents two Neolithic temple sites in Gozo, Malta that lie {{at opposite ends of}} the preservation-presentation spectrum due to <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and <b>site</b> accessibility. The first, Ggantija, is a UNESCO Heritage Site, and has seen extensive excavation, the artifacts of which are housed in the National Archaeology Museum in Valletta, Malta and in the Archaeology Museum in Victoria (Rabat), Gozo. The second, Ta’ Marziena, is located on privately owned farmland and has never been excavated. Additionally addressed is the impact of invented heritage on preservation by local villagers and New Age religionists, and the role of tourist photography and postcards in presentation. I propose a method of incorporating the several lesser Neolithic temple sites of Gozo into a cultural tourism route through the island. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|OF THE DISSERTATION ON "PUBLIC INTEREST IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW" Zdeněk Horáček, 2011 The {{dissertation}} examines <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> {{in environmental}} law. Due {{to the lack}} of professional resources dealing with the very concept of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> the dissertation offers its basic definition and relevant connections, but always in relation to the institutes of the environmental law. Interpretive and historical aspects of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> are analyzed and basic definition features, classification and process of the formulation of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> including correction of the improper process, are established. The dissertation specifies <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in environmental law as a legally defined value of environmental protection shared by whole society. Such a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> is promoted in all the phases of evaluation and authorization of a project that may be harmful to the environment, in the extent always depending on the specific situation. The dissertation concludes that environmental protection is a worldwide shared value and <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> In addition, <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in environmental protection is a criterion for a decision making process carried out by public authorities, and the resulting <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> (adopted solution) depends on the specific circumstances of the situation...|$|R

40|$|As {{a set of}} {{economic}} activities, tourism trades {{on the character of}} special places. Conflict can emerge where local residents perceive that tourism development proposals challenge the special qualities of place, and where place meaning and attachments are compromised. A key function of government in mediating conflict is to protect <b>public</b> <b>interests,</b> yet explicit consideration of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in tourism development conflict is unusual. This paper argues for a reinvigoration of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in the mediation of tourism development conflicts. It explores the concept of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and how governments interpret and give meaning to it in development debates. In a case study of a cruise ship terminal proposal on the Gold Coast, Australia, the state adopted a neoliberal interpretation of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> wherein increased global competitiveness of the destination was the overriding common good pursued. Local and diverse interests were marginalised in the debate. The paper concludes that in order to reinvigorate <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> evaluation framework for tourism development is needed...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in merger analysis. We begin with {{a review of the}} use of such factors in jurisdictions around the world and then focus on the U. S.

Although we do not advocate a ready embrace of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations, we do think that the Wal-Mart/Massmart decision provides insight into how jurisdictions that consider <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors might usefully do so. Based on the lessons learned from these two cases, we conclude with a discussion of the appropriate norms that jurisdictions should follow when taking account of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in merger enforcement, with particular emphasis on clear articulation of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> goals, transparency of process, and quantification of costs and benefits...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to legal}} {{uncertainty}} surrounding {{the application of}} key provisions of European and UK data protection law, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting individuals’ informational privacy is routinely neglected, as are the <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> in certain uses of data. Consent or anonymisation are often treated as the paradigmatic example of compliance with data protection law, even though both are unable {{to attend to the}} full range of rights and interests at stake in data processing. Currently, where data processing may serve a realisable <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> and consent or anonymisation are impracticable (if not impossible to obtain) the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions to processing are the rational alternative justifications for processing. However, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions are poorly defined in the legislation, and misunderstood and neglected in practice. This thesis offers a much-needed alternative to the predominant consent-or-anonymise paradigm by providing a new understanding of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection law and to suggest a new approach to deploying the concept {{in a way that is}} consistent with the protective and facilitative aims of the legislation. Through undertaking legislative analysis new insight is provided on the purpose of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions in data protection law, revealing critical gaps in understanding. By engaging with <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> theory and discovering the conceptual contours of the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> these gaps are addressed. Combined with the insight obtained from the legislative history, we can determine the reasonable range of circumstances and types of processing where it may be justifiable to use personal data based on the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> On this basis, and to develop a new approach for deploying the concept, other legal uses of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> are examined. The lessons learned suggest legislative and procedural elements that are critical to successful deployment of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection. The thesis concludes with the identification of key components to allow a clearer understanding of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in this field. Further, these insights enable recommendations to be made, to reform the law, procedure and guidance. In doing so, the concept of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> can be confidently deployed in line with the aims of data protection law, to both protect and facilitate the use of personal data...|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>interest</b> {{litigation}} {{is an important}} tool for social transformation in many developed and developing countries. It is often used by the underprivileged or the oppressed, whose voices are otherwise under-represented in the democratic process, to vindicate their legal rights and to push for social change through the judicial mechanism. The success of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> litigation requires a liberal court and activist judges {{who are willing to}} loosen traditional adversarial procedural rules in litigation and to allow non-governmental organisations and individuals to bring the often controversial and political <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> issues to the court. In Hong Kong, we see a surge of judicial review cases relating to issues of wide <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in recent years that are similar to <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> litigation in other jurisdictions.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations in competition law legislation has been controversial, dividing {{policy makers and}} economists alike. Debate {{has focused on the}} practical application of these <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concerns when a merger is proposed, or when prohibited conduct is implicated. The uncertainty involved has had to be addressed by the competition authorities in recent years when dealing with high profile mergers and excessive pricing cases. This has necessitated development in somewhat unchartered legal terrain: the incorporation into competition policy of traditionally non-competition objectives. The traditional purpose of competition law has primarily been protecting and enhancing consumer welfare. Attempting to reconcile this objective with <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations, which are now statutorily enshrined, presents significant challenges. However, South Africa's pressing economic redistributive justice needs provided compelling motivation for the legislature including <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations in competition law, and authorities must remain cognizant of this. This paper critically considers whether it is appropriate for competition authorities to address welfare and <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concerns, by analysing significant merger and prohibited conduct cases involving <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations. A comparison into international approaches and trends in including <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in competition control serves to provide global context. Furthermore, this paper interrogates the legitimacy of intervening in the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> whilst examining the tension between efficiency and equity...|$|R
