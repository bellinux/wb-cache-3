50|$|Sorgenfrei’s plays draw {{inspiration}} from the western canon—often serving as reinterpretations of classics {{with a combination of}} Japanese plays and <b>performance</b> <b>styles.</b> Her fusion of <b>performance</b> <b>styles</b> and contemporary theatre improves understanding of plays by offering an intercultural East/West mix. In retelling Medea through a Noh cycle, her work reaches out to other cultural audiences and challenges western social norms. As theatre historian Helene Foley has argued, Medea: A Noh Cycle Based on Greek Myth “turns to a reimagined Japanese tradition to empower a more aggressive feminist assault on patriarchal culture.” Sorgenfrei’s play achieves the desired effect by portraying the story of a powerful female protagonist through a <b>performance</b> <b>style</b> in which traditionally only Japanese men participated. Her reinterpretation subverts Athen’s and Japan’s patriarchal theatre while also offering an analytical amalgamation of cultures, which reflects the creative and academic possibilities of theatre.|$|R
40|$|Literature {{may become}} an {{interesting}} subject because the audiences can understand and {{imagine what the}} author said. Through studying literature, people can get enjoyment, delight and satisfaction. In literature especially film,people can enter a new world of experience that she never has before. In this thesis, the writer focuses on the changing <b>performance</b> <b>style</b> of Andrea"Andy" Sach, the main character in the film "The devil wears prada". More specifically, this study deals with three problems: (1) What is Andrea change her <b>performance</b> <b>style?</b> 2) Why Andrea change her <b>performance</b> <b>style?</b> 3) What the effects of Andrea change her <b>performance</b> <b>style</b> to herself including her social life?. This thesis used descriptive qualitative method {{because there was no}} treatment as in experimental research. This thesis just described or interpreted the condition or situation. The writer used objective approach in analiying because the writer did not need to study the authorâ€™s live, the background of the work, and the background of society, but she just analyzed the work itself. The object of the study was Lauren Weisbergerâ€™s film "The Devil Wears Prada" especially on Andreaâ€™s changing <b>performance</b> <b>style.</b> The writer did not use population and sample because this study is not intended to be generalized. The result of the analysis showed that Andrea changes her simple fashion through more stylish way to express herself through fashion. The new performance makes her looks elegant and prettier than before, besides she is more confidence work in Runway. The reason of changing her <b>performance</b> <b>style</b> is to support her job. She must give the best as an assistant of chief editor at Runway, a top New York fashion magazines. She becomes stylish assistant and proves to everybody that she is proper work at Runway. But, since her new style of fashion and her work hard, she becomes very busy woman. It brings positive effect with the successful of her job that increases significantly. On the other hand, since her carrier increases, it also gives negative effect for Andyâ€™s life. She loses her personal life with friends and family...|$|R

40|$|This {{treatise}} analysis what functions {{light has}} in theater. It {{was inspired by}} Rosalinda Krauss essay Sculpture in the Expanded Field but builds mostly on the following three books Linda Essig Lighting and the design idea (2 nd ed), Nigel H. Morgan Stage lighting for theater designers and Francis Reid The stage lighting handbook (6 th ed). It discovers nine unique functions of light (<b>performance</b> <b>style,</b> dramatic style, image,illumination, 3 D space, 3 D form, selectivity, environment, atmosphere) and develops a graphical mapping of them based on a mapping by Reid. The functions <b>performance</b> <b>style,</b> dramatic style, image are superior the others. Some light functions are more closely related than others and the different functions can easily be misunderstood. The functions <b>performance</b> <b>style</b> and dramatic style (or just style) are especially difficult to understand and map out. Environment and atmosphere are two functions that is in opposition {{to one another and}} {{it would be interesting to}} make an expansion around these set of terms by using Krauss theories...|$|R
