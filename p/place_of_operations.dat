60|$|Then {{came the}} {{question}} as to who should descend the last tunnel to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Oliver wished Maqueda to return {{to the top of the}} cliff and wait there, but she said at once that she could not think of attempting the ascent without our aid; also that she was determined to see the end of the matter. Even Joshua would not go; I think, that being an unpopular character among them, he distrusted the Mountaineers, whose duty it would have been to escort him.|$|E
60|$|To this a {{reply was}} sent {{from the office}} of the Syndicate in New York, by means of a cable boat from the French coast, that on no account could their purpose be altered or their propositions modified. Although the British Government might be {{convinced}} {{of the power of the}} Syndicate's motor-bombs, it was not the case with the British people, for it was yet popularly disbelieved that motor-bombs existed. This disbelief the Syndicate was determined to overcome, not only for the furtherance of its own purposes, but to prevent the downfall of the present British Ministry, and a probable radical change in the Government. That such a political revolution, as undesirable to the Syndicate as to cool-headed and sensible Englishmen, was imminent, there could be no doubt. The growing feeling of disaffection, almost amounting to disloyalty, not only in the opposition party, but among those who had hitherto been firm adherents of the Government, was mainly based upon the idea that the present British rulers had allowed themselves to be frightened by mines and torpedoes, artfully placed and exploded. Therefore the Syndicate intended to set right the public mind upon this subject. The note concluded by earnestly urging the designation, without loss of time, of a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

50|$|In Indian {{thought and}} Indian logic Anavastha is an {{important}} doctrine. All major schools of philosophy have examined and commented upon this concept and laid down guidelines {{so as to avoid}} the endless series of statements and propositions and the non-finality of those propositions. Certain aphorisms of Pāṇini, in his Ashtadhyayi indicate that asiddhatva leads to anavastha since rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there because application of a rule should certainly result in finality. The word अत्र atra of Sutra 6.4.22 indicates that two rules must have the same आश्रय āśraya or <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> but where their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> are different they are not asiddha to each other.|$|R

50|$|It was {{suggested}} that the Rus' Khaganate was a state, or a cluster of city-states, set up by a people called Rus', described in all contemporary sources as being Norsemen, somewhere in what is today European Russia, as a chronological predecessor to the Rurik Dynasty and the Kievan Rus'.

50|$|Nonetheless, if the {{two were}} {{separated}} for too long, it would spell disaster for both, and therefore Madame Xanadu, who was not only instrumental in returning the Spectre to Earth (and 'separating' Jim Corrigan) but also held her <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> {{in the same building}} as Corrigan's agency, introduced a guardian for Corrigan. The attractive young woman Kim Liang became not only Jim's secretary, but also a caretaker, herself a separated piece of Xanadu's soul (although this was unknown to her at the time). The importance of Xanadu in these actions would later set the stage for her role in Corrigan's life when John Ostrander set up a new Spectre title.|$|E

50|$|This case {{established}} much of {{the protocol}} still used by the courts today in determining the citizenship of a corporation in diversity-of-citizenship cases. It established a more loose code, rather than a uniform one, that examines both the “Nervous System” approach {{as well as the}} “Place of Operations” approach to reach a verdict. This reasoning {{stems from the fact that}} all corporations are different and will have varying factors, levels of operations, and natures of headquarters that all may change its principal state of citizenship. It is important to note that corporations can all have their own specific test to determine their citizenship. However, it is also important to note that once a corporation has declared its citizenship to one state, it cannot make other claims in future cases of diversity-of-citizenship without severely altering either its chief <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> or place of headquarters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Microfinance Banks have a {{critical}} role of providing different financial products and services to the people most especially the low income earners who lack collateral to borrow from formal financial institutions like the commercial banks. This category of financial institutions serves some of the world’s most needy. A significant challenge facing these banks is the battle to control its portfolio at risk to remain within the international bench mark. In this paper, we reviewed practical approaches to controlling loan default and other related risks common to Microfinance Banks. The paper also reviewed related literatures on Microfinance credit risk portfolio assessment and suggested the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations</b> Research experts in tackling Microfinance Banks challenges. The major finding was that credit risk {{continues to be a}} threat to Microfinance Banks sustainability. Our conclusion is that Microfinance Banks ’ credit risk will reduce to the barest minimum if the recommended practical approaches to controlling loan defaults are adhered to...|$|E

50|$|Nearly all {{reverse osmosis}} plants {{operated}} for the desalination of sea water {{in order to}} produce drinking water inindustrial scale are equipped with an energy recovery system based on turbines. These are activated by the concentrate (brine) leaving the plant and transfer the energy contained in the high pressure of this concentrate usually mechanically to the high-pressure pump. In the pressure exchanger the energy contained in the brine is transferred hydraulically and with an efficiency of approximately 98% to the feed. This reduces the energy demand for the desalination process significantly and thus the operating costs. Therefrom results an economic energy recovery, amortization times for such systems varying between 2 and 4 years depending on the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R
