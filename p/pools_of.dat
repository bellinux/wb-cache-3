5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|Lemmings {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} levels, grouped into four {{difficulty}} categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.

5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E

5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience. Their poses are similar and her tall crown is typical of those seen on statues rather than either royalty or painted figures of the Virgin. Harbison further suggests that the two <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> light on the floor echo the two candles {{on either side of}} one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E

5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|There is epigraphic {{evidence}} from the Hellenistic period and Antigonid dynasty that that the Macedonian kingdom relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state.

Although these were highly influential members of local and regional government, Carol J. King asserts {{that they were not}} collectively powerful enough to formally challenge the authority of the Macedonian king or his right to rule. Robert Malcolm Errington affirms that no evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been picked from the available aristocratic <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> philoi and hetairoi that were used to fill vacancies of officers in the army.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
