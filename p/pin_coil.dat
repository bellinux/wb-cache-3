50|$|There are {{two types}} of spring pins: slotted spring <b>pins</b> and <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as hinge pins. They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use <b>coiled</b> <b>pins</b> in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> are commercially {{available}} {{in three different}} duties, standard (ISO 8750), heavy (ISO 8748) and light duty (ISO 8751), which provide {{for a variety of}} combinations of strength, flexibility and diameter to suit different mating host materials and performance requirements. Typical materials for <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> include high carbon steel, stainless steel and alloy 6150.|$|R
50|$|When <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. <b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. <b>Coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove pins, slotted spring <b>pins</b> and spirally <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary: Percutaneous {{intraspinal}} navigation (PIN) {{is a new}} {{minimally invasive}} approach to the subarachnoid space. Using conventional radiographic fluoroscopy, en-trance is gained to the lumbar subarachnoid space, allow-ing navigation throughout the spinal canal. Using an antenna/guidewire introduced via PIN, we performed en-dospinal MR imaging of the thoracic spinal cord in a cadaver and canine subject. Comparison images were ob-tained with an optimal surface <b>coil.</b> <b>PIN</b> allows endospinal MR imaging of the spinal cord, providing significant sig-nal-to-noise ratio gains over conventional imaging. Percutaneous intraspinal navigation (PIN) has been recently described as a minimally invasive ap-proach to the subarachnoid compartment of the spine and brain (1). MR fluoroscopy {{has been used to}} guid...|$|R
40|$|A hinge (20) {{includes}} two hinge plates (22, 24) and a connecting hinge <b>pin</b> (32). A <b>coil</b> spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the hinge pin (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the hinge pin (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} hinge plates (22), so that the hinge pin (32) slides longitudinally as the hinge plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the hinge pin (32). As the hinge pin (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the hinge plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the hinge plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R
5000|$|Roberts derived his {{nickname}} for being known as [...] "snake like" [...] and untrustworthy. Roberts also {{said on the}} Pick Your Poison DVD that he got {{his nickname}} by copying Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken [...] "The Snake" [...] Stabler (of whom Roberts was a huge fan). To accentuate this, he often slid ("slithered") {{into and out of}} the ring on his belly under the bottom rope. Once he reached the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 1986, Roberts would bring a live Burmese Python (though various snakes were used over the years, most were named [...] "Damien") to ringside in a canvas bag. Other snakes used were a Reticulated Python named Lucifer, an unnamed (de-venomized) Cobra, and an albino Burmese Python named Revelations (during Roberts' Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the <b>pin,</b> Roberts would <b>coil</b> the constrictor around the opponent's neck, and the snake would slither around on top of the fallen wrestler, sometimes appearing to strangle him.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} an active optical detuning circuit for magnetic resonance imaging endoluminal receiver coil. Three endoluminal coils prototypes were built: a coil without any detuning circuit, a coil with a galvanic (classic) detuning circuit using a PIN diode, and a coil with an optical detuning circuit using two photodiodes in parallel with a <b>PIN</b> diode. These <b>coils</b> were built and characterized on a laboratory experimental bench. Then, an in vitro experiment was performed with a 3. 0 T MR system to evaluate {{the impact of the}} endoluminal receiver coils in detuned phase on the image uniformity distribution measured using the body coil. Next, the endoluminal coil was used as a receiver coil to compare the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution based on iso-contour maps. On experimental bench, the results show an increase delay of the switching times (tuned-detuned or detuned-tuned) for optical-detuned coils of about 10 μs due to the electro-optical circuits, delay still compatible with requirements. When the body coil is used as a transceiver, the SNR uniformity is similar whether the galvanic or the optical detuning circuit is used. Finally, the SNR iso-contours of the different endoluminal coils prototypes are comparable...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of two cerclages {{with wire}} spirals as distractor spacers was {{evaluated}} for the correction of pelvic stenosis in felines. A three-year-old, mixed-breed, male feline {{was taken to}} the Veterinary Hospital of the UFRJ. It presented symptoms of constipation, dyschezia, hyporexia and mild apathy. On radiographic examination, a deformation of the pelvic bones and a narrowing of the pelvic canal were detected. The patient underwent pelvic stenosis correction surgery. Two spirals were made with cerclage wire and 2. 0 -mm diameter Steinmann pins; coupled to the chuck of a drill, the pins were wrapped with cerclage wire, running laps around the <b>pin.</b> Then, the <b>coils</b> were positioned in the space formed by separating the hemipelves and stabilized by keeping them separated to the desired opening. Effectiveness of the technique was evidenced by measurements made using new radiographic images in comparison with the images obtained before the surgical procedure. There were evident decreases in the sacro-ischium line and pubic line of 3. 98 and 3. 18, demonstrating an increase of approximately 21 % in the pelvic canal diameter. The animal showed no apparent macroscopic or radiographic reaction. The preliminary clinical application of the adapted pelvic distraction technique is relevant for allowing the appropriate correction of a stenosis of the pelvic girdle and its consequences, representing a major technical and scientific innovation in the correction...|$|R
40|$|Triplets {{composed}} of superconducting quadrupoles {{have been built}} and installed as [...] the final focusing element for the high-energy positron and electron beams of the SLAC Linear Collider. Special features include independent alignment to lOOmicron tolerance inside a common cryostat; non-magnetic materials to allow operation inside the detector’s solenoid field; a continuous-flow helium-only system using 50 -meter-long flexible transfer lines; and complete operation of the system before installation. The mechanical design and cryogenic operation experience are presented. INTRODUCI’ION The Superconducting Final Focus was designed to solve several novel and difficult requirements posed by the experimental program at the SLAC Linear Collider. Machine optics require high-gradient (120 T/m) precisely aligned magnetic quadrupoles to focus the 50 GeV/c electron and positron beams to few-microndiameter spots [11. The new physics experiment for this facility, the SLC Large Detector (SLD), requires focusing elements that can work {{in the presence of}} its 6 -Tesla solenoidal field and with as small an encumbrance of the detector area as possible. Finally, this new focusing system had to be made ultra reliable with all controls remoted, be completely tested and aligned in final form offline, and then installed with as few changes as possible. These criteria guided the design of the focusing system as follows:. The high-gradient and external-field conditions were met by using superconducting quadrupoles with nonmagnetic materials. Precision alignment was achieved by <b>pinning</b> the magnet <b>coils</b> and laminations into stiff cylinders which formed part of the cryostat. These cylinders were adjusted from the outside through lowloss gimbals and supports while monitoring the field position through a probe in a warm bore on the magnet axis. The reliability, testing, and installation issues were solved by using simple pool-boiling helium-only cryostats continuously fed by flexible, low-loss transfer lines. A schematic overview of the system is shown in Figure 1. It has been successfully operating at the SLC since early 1991...|$|R
