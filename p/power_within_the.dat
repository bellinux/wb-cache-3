5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> provinces {{occurred in the}} early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E

The confrontation continued as the planters challenged on several occasions the right of British government to pass laws binding on the colony, arguing that the Court of Policy has exclusive legislative <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> colony. Plantation owners who controlled the voting of the taxes disrupted administration by refusing to vote the civil list.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline and}} fall of Pedro II of Brazil {{occurred}} {{over the course of}} the 1880s, with the underlying factors accumulating and coming increasingly into focus after 1881. This period paradoxically coincided with a time of unparalleled economic and social stability and progress for Brazil, during which the nation had achieved a prominent place as an emerging <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> international arena.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} tension between the factions struggling for <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> insurgency, {{the first of the}} pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan Detachment. It was sparked by the arrest and execution on 18 April of pro-Chetnik agitator Bogdan Jovićić by Vukmanović-Tempo and the newly formed 1st East Bosnian Shock Battalion. Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the detachment and the Shock Battalion. Vukmanović-Tempo then abandoned the Ozren Partisan Detachment, taking the detachment staff and remaining loyal Partisans with him.|$|E

5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E
5|$|In October 1964 Khrushchev was ousted. Suslov {{played a}} crucial role in the event. Suslov was, {{alongside}} Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of the most influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the ouster of Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain the man behind the scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E

Rather than continue {{to serve in the}} military, he became a politician in the Liberal Party. In 1845, he was elected a member of the provincial house of representatives of Rio de Janeiro province, site of the national capital of the same name. Rio Branco rose to <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> province under the tutelage of Aureliano Coutinho, Viscount of Sepetiba—a veteran politician who held tremendous influence over the young and inexperienced Emperor PedroII. He temporarily abandoned politics after Aureliano Coutinho's fall from grace and the subsequent dissolution of the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{argue that}} the British government's {{decision}} reflected what James Gelvin, Professor of Middle Eastern History at UCLA, calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia. American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 the Zionist Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an American Jewish population of three million. But the Zionist organizations had recently succeeded, following {{a show of force}} within the American Jewish community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole. This impacted British and French government estimates of the balance of <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> American Jewish public.|$|E

5|$|Worcester Castle was a Norman {{fortification}} built between 1068 and 1069 in Worcester, England by Urse d'Abetot {{on behalf}} of William the Conqueror. The castle had a motte-and-bailey design and was located {{on the south side}} of the old Anglo-Saxon city, cutting into the grounds of Worcester Cathedral. Royal castles were owned by the king and maintained on his behalf by an appointed constable. At Worcester that role was passed down through the local Beauchamp family on a hereditary basis, giving them permanent control of the castle and considerable <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> city. The castle played an important part in the wars of the 12th and early 13th century, including the Anarchy and the First Barons' War.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his <b>power</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E

Washizu takes the throne {{and at one point}} is about to make Yoshiteru his heir, but changes his mind when his wife tells him she is pregnant. Washizu instead arranges to have Yoshiteru and his father killed, but Yoshiteru escapes. Another adaptation filmed in India, Maqbool (2003), replaces Fleance with a character named Guddu.
