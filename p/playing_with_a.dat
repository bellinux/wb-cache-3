5|$|Blount {{was born}} December 5, 1986, in Madison, Florida, to Gary and Barbara Blount. He has one brother and one sister. Blount is the great-nephew of avant-garde jazz {{musician}} Sun Ra (born Herman Blount). He attended Taylor County High School {{in the small}} town of Perry, Florida, where he was a two-sport star in both football and track & field. In high school football, he was a four-year starter and three-time 1,000-yard rusher. He first reached the milestone as a sophomore and equaled the feat the following season despite <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thigh bruise for most of the year. He accorded second-team All-state player honors as a prep senior. In track & field, Blount competed in events such as the 100-meter dash (11.34 s), the long jump (22-1 or 6.75m), and the shot put (53-2 or 16.22m). He was also a member of the 4 × 100 m squad.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Miller's style evolved through <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} major jazz figures. After leaving {{university}} he was pianist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for three years, then accompanied vocalist Betty Carter. Three-year stints with trumpeter Woody Shaw and with drummer Art Blakey's high-profile Jazz Messengers followed, {{by the end}} of which Miller had formed his own bands and begun recording under his own name. He was then part of drummer Tony Williams' quintet from its foundation, while continuing to play and record with numerous other leaders, mostly in small groups. Miller was Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and continued to play and tour internationally with other high-profile figures in the music until his death from a stroke at the age of 57.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an NFL {{record by}} {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> back injury, had a third punt blocked for a net gain of 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended a futile season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} was a let down year {{not only for}} Durant {{but also for the}} Roughriders as a whole. The Riders stumbled out of the gate losing seven of their first eight games. Durant's production fell significantly through the course of the season. Near {{the end of the season}} Durant was <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken bone in his foot, which ultimately lead to him missing the last two games of the regular season. The Riders would finish the year with only 5 wins and 13 loses, placing them in last place in the league. Despite the reduced production in 2011 on April 27, 2012 the Riders extended his contract through the 2014 CFL season.|$|E
5|$|Until {{suffering}} an upper-body injury {{during practice}} in early March 2011, Glass {{was the lone}} staple on the Canucks' fourth line, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rotation of wingers and centres. Glass missed nine games with the injury, returning in early April. He finished the regular season with 3 goals and 10 points over 73 games, helping the Canucks win the Presidents' Trophy as {{the team with the}} league's best record. With the top seed in the Western Conference, the Canucks eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks en route to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. Over 20 post-season games, Glass recorded no points and 18 penalty minutes.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had been <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> torn posterior cruciate ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{straight}} bat and stretching forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{grew up in}} Alperton, {{a suburb}} of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they {{recorded}} their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained {{a member of the}} band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and was bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie O'Sullivan then {{competed in}} the International Championship, cited as the biggest event in Asia, in Chengdu after beating James Cahill to qualify. Having battled to beat Ben Woollaston 6–4, in his opening match of the tournament, Ronnie sailed past his next two opponents, McGill and Li Hang, 6–1. This {{set up a meeting}} with Mark Williams, a man who had not beat O'Sullivan for 12 years, in the quarters; however, after falling 3–0 behind, Williams won the next 5 frames and {{eventually}} the match, 6–5. O'Sullivan next {{competed in the}} Champion of Champions where he was defending champion. O'Sullivan begun his defence with a 4–2 defeat of Stuart Bingham. He then went on to whitewash Marco Fu 6–0 to reach the semi-final. In the semi-final, O'Sullivan defeated Ding Junhui 6–4 and then went on to defeat Judd Trump in a high-scoring final, 10–7, making four century breaks and eleven breaks over fifty during the match. On 4 December 2014, O'Sullivan completed his 13th career maximum break in the fourth round of the UK Championship, against Matthew Selt. Three days later he won his fifth UK Championship, coming through 10–9 against Judd Trump in the final. After trailing 1–5 and 4–9, Trump won five frames in succession, before O'Sullivan prevailed in the deciding frame despite <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken ankle, having broken it the previous week whilst running.|$|E
