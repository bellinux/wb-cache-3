However his financial situation was still bleak, and on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after an Arsenal supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for him. In August 1974, he was again found Guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican, {{and was sentenced to}} 200 hours of Community service and ordered to pay £40 costs.

25|$|In 1866, Marcus Neff hired {{attorney}} John H. Mitchell {{to complete}} some legal business, {{but failed to}} pay Mitchell's bill. Mitchell sued and received a default judgment against Neff, with Neff's property sold at auction to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Pennoyer purchased the land from Mitchell, who had purchased the land at the sheriff's auction, and later Neff {{became aware of the}} forced sale. Neff then sued Pennoyer to regain the property in a case that became the U.S. Supreme Court case of Pennoyer v. Neff that defined legal jurisdiction for citizens residing in different states. At the trial, federal judge and Pennoyer adversary Matthew Deady ruled in favor of Neff, with the Supreme Court affirming the decision in 1877. Pennoyer was compelled to give the land back to Neff, and the property became a part of the Willamette Heights neighborhood in later years.|$|E

A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel.

Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately.

500|$|In July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his {{opponent}} Hillary Clinton released a campaign video {{of one of}} the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with the Trump Organization, where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The Clinton campaign used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses. Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, The Washington Post reported that a [...] painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase.|$|E
500|$|In July 1991, Creation {{agreed to}} {{relocate}} the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records {{was unable to}} <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, [...] "I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had {{to raise the money}} himself to get the gear out." [...] Shields' unexpected and random behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect both on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time. Green later recalled, [...] "It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'." [...] During this time, both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows. Shields dismissed these concerns as [...] "Ill-informed hysteria." [...] Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label's morning post [...] "shaking with fear," [...] became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label's inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green's hair turning grey overnight. [...] "He would have not gone grey if it was not for that album," [...] Verfaillie said.|$|E
