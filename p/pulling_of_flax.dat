40|$|The use {{of waste}} biomass for energy {{purposes}} is currently {{of great interest to}} scientific and industrial groups around the world. Flax shive is a waste <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> processing industry, which can be used for energy purposes. The most interesting are the processes of thermal processing, making maximum use of the energy potential of the processed biomass wastes. Such methods of thermal processing include various types of pyrolysis. The paper presents the results of a kinetic study of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> bonfire in the temperature range up to 600 °C using the experimentally obtained data of dynamic thermogravimetry. To find the kinetic parameters and the kinetic model of the process, we used model–independent methods and methods of nonlinear regression. Mathematical processing of the experimentally obtained data made it possible to determine the formal kinetic mechanism of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive, the kinetic parameters and the temperature interval of each stage of the process. The obtained kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> the <b>flax</b> shive in the future will allow optimizing the industrial pyrolysis technology, to reduce the time spent on carrying out research and construction works. This kinetic model of pyrolysis process contains 4 stages <b>of</b> decomposition <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive, corresponding to the processes of moisture loss and thermal destruction <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive components — hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. The significant mass of the carbonaceous residue obtained {{as a result of the}} pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive (about 29 % by weight) allows us to conclude that it is potentially possible to use it further for the production of carbon-containing materials. Finally, conclusions about the applicability <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive as a raw material for obtaining carbon sorbents will help to make the results of further studies of strength, surface and sorption properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{reports on}} a study of thermal {{degradation}} <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres to gain an improved understanding of the use and limitations <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres as reinforcement for thermoplastic composites manufactured by the vacuum forming process.

40|$|Flax fibres are an {{interesting}} alternative for the widely used glass fibres. The specific stiffness <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres is higher than for glass, which indicates a possible weight benefit[1]. Flax fibres are a natural renewable material (it takes only 100 days to reach his full height). During growth and the process from stem to fibre the total used energy is very limited (± 10 MJ/kg) compared to glass (55 MJ/kg) [2]. In extra the culture <b>of</b> the <b>flax</b> is a very environmental friendly culture, which needs no irrigation and almost no pesticides and nutrients. Although the high potential <b>of</b> the <b>flax</b> fibres, the use of them in composites is very limited. The main reason is the limited length <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres, which makes it necessary to apply twist on the fibres {{in order to obtain}} a continuous yarn. The presence of the twist leads to a drastic decrease in mechanical properties, especially for the stiffness. In this work the influence of the twist on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres is investigated. Therefore flax from different stages in the fibre production process are taken, each with a different amount of twist.
