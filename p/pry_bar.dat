5|$|In February 2014, strange vignettes began airing {{advertising}} Hardy's {{return to}} TNA under his OMEGA character, Willow. He made his TNA return at Lockdown, in the Lethal Lockdown match {{as part of}} Team MVP. He then appeared on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, facing Rockstar Spud. In the following weeks, {{he would continue to}} feud with Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud, leading to a tag-team match between them (with Kurt Angle as Willow's partner) at Sacrifice on April 27, Willow and Angle would go on to win that match. On the May 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated James Storm by disqualification when Storm shoved the referee and as Storm made his way up the ramp, Mr. Anderson appeared and hit Storm with the Mic check. On the May 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow's match against Magnus ended in a DQ when Bram interfered and handcuffed Willow to the bottom rope and started to hit him with a metal turnbuckle. On the May 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated both Magnus and Bram in a two on one handicap match. On the May 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated Magnus in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On the June 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow won his match against Bram by DQ when Magnus came to the ring and attacked him with a Steel <b>Pry</b> <b>Bar.</b> At Slammiversary XII, Willow was defeated by Magnus.|$|E
25|$|Gein {{admitted}} to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain {{as to whether}} the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they exhumed two of the graves and found them empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body), thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (60 cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his <b>pry</b> <b>bar,</b> and most of the body was gone from the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} loss to Eric Young, Magnus began a losing streak, after losing {{out on a}} number one contender's spot for the {{championship}} Magnus was met in a backstage segment by his childhood friend and fellow Brit Bram, who began to chastise him, claiming he had gone soft. Over the next several weeks, Magnus began showing signs of a face turn when Bram would throw weapons into the ring and encourage him to let out a more intense side but Magnus would refuse. More signs began to show from Magnus when he first attacked Bram in a backstage segment, and then when Magnus saved Tigre Uno from an assault from Bram the following week. On the edition of 5 June of Impact Wrestling, {{it looked as though}} Magnus would finalize his face turn and save Willow from Bram, but would in fact remain heel and attack Willow himself with a steel <b>pry</b> <b>bar.</b> Since developing a more violent persona, Magnus and Bram began a rivalry with Willow and the returning Abyss. Magnus defeated Willow on 15 June 2014, at Slammiversary XII. on 26 June 2014, episode of Impact Wrestling Magnus and Bram defeated Willow and Abyss in a tag team Monster's Ball match. On 20 August 2014, at Hardcore Justice, Magnus was a participant in a six-sides of steel match to determine a number 1 contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, the match was ultimately won by Eric Young and Bobby Roode.|$|E

2500|$|Although rarely {{listed as}} an element, {{the common law}} {{required}} that [...] "entry occur {{as a consequence of}} the breaking". For example, if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar—but then notices an open door, which he uses to enter the dwelling, there is no burglary under common law. The use of the <b>pry</b> <b>bar</b> would not constitute an entry even if a portion of the prybar [...] "entered" [...] the residence. Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would not constitute an entry. However, if any part of the perpetrator's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry, the instrumentality rule did not apply. Thus, if the perpetrator uses the prybar to pry open the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window, an [...] "entry" [...] would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands.|$|E

Unit maintenance personnel were not billeted in the BLT building, and they rounded up <b>pry</b> <b>bars,</b> torches, jacks and other equipment from unit vehicles and maintenance shops and began rescue operations. Meanwhile, combat engineers and truck drivers began using their organic assets, i.e., trucks and engineering equipment, {{to help with the}} rescue operations. 24th MAU medical personnel, Navy dentists LT Gil Bigelow and LT Jim Ware, established two aid stations to triage and treat casualties. Medevac helicopters, CH-46s from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM-162), were airborne by 6:45 AM. U.S. Navy medical personnel from nearby vessels of the U.S. Sixth Fleet went ashore to assist with treatment and medical evacuation of the injured, as did sailors and shipboard Marines who volunteered to assist with the rescue effort. Lebanese, Italian, British, and even French troops, who had suffered their own loss, provided assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Travelers {{heading west}} in 1848 and later, crossed Forty Mile Desert, then {{followed}} the trail blazed by the Mormons in 1848 up the Carson River valley {{from what is}} now Fallon, Nevada, in 1850 the town was called [...] "Ragtown". Then, {{to get over the}} Carson Range, it was a very rough road through Carson River Canyon where the wagons had to be wrestled over the boulders by ropes, <b>pry</b> <b>bars,</b> levers and a few improvised bridges before the wagon trains finally entered beautiful 7100 ft Hope Valley. Westward travelers from Hope Valley had to climb a steep, rocky and tortuous path over the back wall of a glacier carved cirque to reach Carson Pass. The section of trail at the end of Hope Valley near Red Lake is called [...] "The Devil's Ladder" [...] where the trail has to climb over 700 ft of very steep mountain in the final half mile (1 km). Today, a hiker's careful eye can still find notches, grooves and rust marks left by iron rimmed wagon wheels. Nearby, trees scarred by ropes, chains and pulleys used to haul the heavy wagons up the precipitous slope, can be seen. Travelers could get {{to the top of the}} pass in about one day of hard work, an acceptable trade-off for many emigrants. The trail crossed the Sierra Crest through 8574 ft Carson Pass.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{resulting}} in this report {{is to develop a}} mechanically enhanced breaking <b>bar,</b> or <b>prying</b> <b>bar,</b> for bringing down trees. There was already a prototype to study, which was assembled by welded steel components. A specification of demands took form after continuous technical discussions with the inventor, assignee and mentors. When an analysis of this device and its function was made, the work continued with calculations to establish the foundation to design a mechanical model. Geometrical relationships were established to design the sub-components of the breaking bar and its functions. Simulations regarding material strength and mechanical function were made by the use of different modules in the CAD-software Solid Works and led to a simplified version of the breaking bar. The new simplified version was accepted by the inventor and the drawings for the new tool could now be made. During the time of this work the inventor has prepared his patent request and therefore this work has been classified and considered under secrecy for the inner circle persons containing the Kogertek-employees. The breaking bar which was produced with its powerful gear ratio is amplifying the force from the handle by a factor 25 and lifts 50 mm in the felling cut of the tree. In theory the tool would weigh approximately 1800 grams and can be used to bring down a tree with a diameter of at most 40 cm. Drawings for the constituent components were sent to a workshop to be manufactured and a mechanical breaking bar was assembled and tested...|$|R

These beetles feed primarily on tree sap and fruits.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Marine Raider {{stiletto}} {{was designed}} for one purpose: killing the enemy, and its design was not compromised. The stiletto was a finely designed, almost delicate, single-purpose weapon, which {{did not include a}} variety of other tasks normally associated with a machete or utility knife. Due to the thin tip, even thinner than the tip of the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife, the stiletto was not designed to be used for opening ration cans or as a <b>pry</b> <b>bar</b> to open cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect small and {{localized}} movements of geotechnical facilities is important monitoring and early-warning hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited {{in its ability to}} both scan massive structures and detect small and localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m 2). Specifically, this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0. 5 to 5 meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using <b>pry</b> <b>bars</b> and airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering approximately 20, 000 m 2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and (2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving. The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1. 7 mm were detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m, were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring technology for geotechnical applications...|$|R
40|$|From Edison films catalog: The picture {{opens with}} the {{interior}} of a cell in an insane asylum. The inmate, who imagines himself to be Napoleon the Great, is seated at a table dressed in the costume of that world renowned general. A keeper enters with a bowl of soup. "Napoleon" tastes the soup and then dashes the contents of the bowl into the keeper's face. A fierce fight follows with "Napoleon" getting the better of it until two more keepers rush in and the three beat him unmercifully and leave him insensible on the floor. After the keepers leave, "Napoleon" gets up, smashes the table and <b>pries</b> off the <b>bars</b> of his cell with one of the table legs and escapes through the window. The second scene shows "Napoleon" escaping through the woods, pursued by the three keepers, and succeeding scenes following in rapid succession show the most exciting and ludicrous situations. In his flight "Napoleon" discovers an empty barrel, crawls into it and rolls {{to the bottom of the}} hill, and thus eludes his pursuers for a time. He next reaches a large tree. The first limbs are high above the ground, but "Napoleon" jumps and easily reaches one of the branches. The three keepers follow and disappear into the tree. A panoramic effect shows "Napoleon" descending from another tree, followed closely by the three keepers. A haystack is now reached. A tramp is sleeping at the foot with a gun beside him. "Napoleon" takes his gun and paces back and forth as a sentinel on guard. The keepers soon discover him and the chase continues. Finally "Napoleon" gets back to the asylum, climbs up to his cell window, and when the tired and worn out keepers return they are dumfounded [sic] at finding "Napoleon" seated at a table reading a paper. At each change of scene "Napoleon" stops to pose in characteristic attitude, producing a highly amusing effect. 530 ft. $ 63. 60. Copyright: Thomas A. Edison; 7 Oct 1904; H 51386.

This situation is the why {{there is a need for}} a bike lock which can combine the security of a U-lock, with the flexibility and size of a chain. This project solves the problem by using a hardened steel chain, comprised of long sturdy chain links connected by stainless steel rivets. This allows for a bike to be locked to a telephone pole or tree about a foot in diameter, while still protecting the bike from the threat of bike theft. This was accomplished through the selection of a strong steel with good hardenability, followed by forces analyses to determine what shape and size is required to prevent tampering from standard bike theft tools, such as hacksaws, bolt cutters, and pry bars. These analyses resulted in a necessary chain link cross-section of 1. 250 inches by 0. 250 inches, to resist bolt cutters, and a length of each link being 15 inches in total. The required hardness to resist cutting from a hacksaw is above 65 on the Rockwell C Scale, and the design includes washers to prevent a <b>pry</b> <b>bar</b> from fitting between the links...|$|E
