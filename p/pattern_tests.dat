50|$|A defect is {{an error}} caused in a device during the {{manufacturing}} process. A fault {{model is a}} mathematical description of how a defect alters design behavior. The logic values observed at the device's primary outputs, while applying a <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> to some device under test (DUT), are called the output of that <b>test</b> <b>pattern.</b> The output of a <b>test</b> <b>pattern,</b> when <b>testing</b> a fault-free device that works exactly as designed, is called the expected output of that <b>test</b> <b>pattern.</b> A fault {{is said to be}} detected by a <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> if the output of that <b>test</b> <b>pattern,</b> when <b>testing</b> a device that has only that one fault, is different than the expected output.

Such algorithms however require <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> with a high defect coverage, posing a major challenge particularly for embedded testing. In mixed-mode embedded test, a large amount of pseudo-random (PR) patterns are applied prior to deterministic <b>test</b> <b>pattern.</b> Partial Pseudo-Exhaustive <b>Testing</b> (P-PET) replaces these pseudo-random <b>patterns</b> during embedded <b>testing</b> by partial pseudo-exhaustive <b>patterns</b> to <b>test</b> a large portion of a circuit fault-model independently.
