5|$|In 2005 Stephan C. Schuster at Penn State University {{and colleagues}} {{published}} the first sequences {{of an environmental}} sample generated with high-throughput sequencing, in this case massively parallel <b>pyrosequencing</b> developed by 454 Life Sciences.

5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 <b>pyrosequencing.</b> Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 <b>pyrosequencing</b> typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and <b>pyrosequencing,</b> and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pyrosequencing</b> of {{bisulfite}} treated DNA. This is {{sequencing of}} an amplicon {{made by a}} normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide {{at a time to}} the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} of RNA-seq also include similar image processing, however, {{conversion}} of images to sequence data is typically handled automatically by the instrument software. The Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis method {{results in a}} random or ordered array of clusters distributed {{over the surface of}} a flow cell. The flow cell is imaged up to four times during each sequencing cycle, with tens to hundreds of cycles in total. Flow cell clusters are analogous to microarray spots and must be correctly identified during {{the early stages of the}} sequencing process. In Roche’s <b>pyrosequencing</b> method, the intensity of emitted light determines the number of consecutive nucleotides in a homopolymer repeat. There are many variants on these methods, each with a different error profile for the resulting data.|$|E
25|$|Sanger {{sequencing}} and <b>pyrosequencing</b> are {{two methods}} {{that have been}} used to detect frameshift mutations, however, it is likely that data generated will not be of the highest quality. Even still, 1.96 million indels have been identified through Sanger sequencing that do not overlap with other databases. When a frameshift mutation is observed it is compared against the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to determine if the mutation has a damaging effect. This is done by looking at four features. First, the ratio between the affected and conserved DNA, second the location of the mutation relative to the transcript, third the ratio of conserved and affected amino acids and finally the distance of the indel {{to the end of the}} exon.|$|E
40|$|We sampled Thaumarchaeota {{populations in}} the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, including shelf waters under the Mississippi River outflow plume that are subject to recurrent hypoxia. Data from this study allowed us to: (1) test the hypothesis that Thaumarchaeota would be abundant in this region; (2) assess phylogenetic composition of these populations for comparison with other regions; (3) compare the efficacy of quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on primers for 16 S rRNA genes (rrs) with primers for genes in the ammonia oxidation (amoA) and carbon fixation (accA, hcd) pathways; (4) compare distributions obtained by qPCR with the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota rrs in <b>pyrosequenced</b> libraries; (5) compare Thaumarchaeota distributions with environmental variables to help us elucidate the factors responsible for the distributions; (6) compare the distribution ofThaumarchaeota with Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB) to gain insight into the coupling between ammonia and nitrite oxidation. We found up to 108 copies L− 1 of Thaumarchaeota rrs in our sam-ples (up to 40 % of prokaryotes) by qPCR, with maximum abundance in slope waters at 200 – 800 m.

25|$|By 2004 / 2005, <b>pyrosequencing</b> {{had been}} brought to {{commercial}} viability by 454 Life Sciences. This new sequencing method generated reads much shorter than those of Sanger sequencing: initially about 100 bases, now 400-500 bases. Its much higher throughput and lower cost (compared to Sanger sequencing) pushed the adoption of this technology by genome centers, which in turn pushed development of sequence assemblers that could efficiently handle the read sets. The sheer amount of data coupled with technology-specific error patterns in the reads delayed development of assemblers; at the beginning in 2004 only the Newbler assembler from 454 was available. Released in mid-2007, the hybrid version of the MIRA assembler by Chevreux et al. was the first freely available assembler that could assemble 454 reads as well as mixtures of 454 reads and Sanger reads. Assembling sequences from different sequencing technologies was subsequently coined hybrid assembly.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pyrosequencing</b> {{has also}} been used to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA without using methylation-specific PCR. [...] Following PCR {{amplification}} of the region of interest, <b>pyrosequencing</b> is {{used to determine the}} bisulfite-converted sequence of specific CpG sites in the region. [...] The ratio of C-to-T at individual sites can be determined quantitatively based on the amount of C and T incorporation during the sequence extension. [...] The main limitation of this method is the cost of the technology. [...] However, <b>Pyrosequencing</b> does well allow for extension to high-throughput screening methods.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} as to which primers or primer sets, being used with varying degrees of success, repeatability and species-level resolution, are best for molecular genetic analysis of AMF. Additionally, the current advances and coming changes in genetic sequencing technology, e.g. Sanger, to 454 <b>pyrosequencing,</b> to Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq, can force researchers to only use certain primers. The large size of the [...] "Krüger" [...] (~1500bp) and [...] "Redecker" [...] (~900bp) primer sets prohibit use with newer sequencing technology (e.g. Illumina MiSeq) as opposed to 454 <b>pyrosequencing</b> that is capable of these long read lengths. Though Roche Diagnostics has announced the discontinuation of the 454 platform for 2016, it is still commonly used in genetic analyses. Perhaps new 'all-inclusive' AM specific primers should be created to support the new technologies for as descriptive a molecular analysis from the [...] "Kruger" [...] primer set using 454 pyrosqeuncing, as shown below. The reverse may also be true, where molecular technologies should be developed with both long read lengths (which would allow for large primer sets) as well as sequencing depth.|$|E

However, the reproducibility {{of this method}} for biodiversity assessment remains largely unexplored. Here we evaluated reproducibility by analysing 454 <b>pyrosequenced</b> biological replicates of two complex plankton communities collected from one freshwater port and one marine port.

Yet, SAR 11 sequences are rarely detected in fosmid libraries, suggesting that the widespread abundance may be an artefact of PCR cloning and that SAR 11 has a relatively low abundance. Here the relative abundance of SAR 11 is explored in both a fosmid library and a metagenomic sequence data set from the same biological community taken from fjord surface water from Bergen, Norway. <b>Pyrosequenced</b> data and 16 S clone data confirmed an 11 – 15...|$|R

Here, we ask: (1) if the macroecology of meiobenthic communities is explained mainly by dispersal constraints or by environmental conditions; and (2) if levels of meiofaunal diversity surpass existing estimates based on morphological taxonomy. Location: UK and mainland European coast. Methods: Next-generation sequencing techniques (NGS; Roche 454 FLX platform) using 18 S nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene. <b>Pyrosequences</b> were analysed using AmpliconNoise followed by chimera removal using Perseus.

2500|$|A {{number of}} methods {{can be used}} to {{determine}} this C:T ratio. At the beginning, MS-SnuPE relied on radioactive ddNTPs as the reporter of the primer extension. [...] Fluorescence-based methods or <b>Pyrosequencing</b> can also be used. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis to differentiate between the two polymorphic primer extension products can be used, in essence, based on the GOOD assay designed for SNP genotyping. [...] Ion pair reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) has also been used to distinguish primer extension products.|$|E
2500|$|Metagenomics is {{the study}} of metagenomes, genetic {{material}} recovered directly from environmental samples. [...] The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. [...] Such work revealed {{that the vast majority of}} microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent studies use [...] "shotgun" [...] Sanger sequencing or massively parallel <b>pyrosequencing</b> to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities. Because of its power to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.|$|E
2500|$|The Illumina dye {{sequencing}} {{method is}} based on reversible dye-terminators and was developed in 1996 at the Geneva Biomedical Research Institute, by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli. In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal colonies, initially coined [...] "DNA colonies", are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. Unlike <b>pyrosequencing,</b> the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide {{at a time and}} image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera. Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity; with an optimal configuration, the ultimate throughput of the instrument depends only on the A/D conversion rate of the camera. The camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides, then the dye along with the terminal 3' blocker is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing the next cycle.|$|E
