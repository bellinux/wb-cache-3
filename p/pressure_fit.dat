5000|$|Almost all blades are decorated, {{although}} not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade. Once the blade is cool, and the mud is scraped off, the blade has designs and grooves cut into it. One {{of the most important}} markings on the sword is performed here: the file markings. These are cut into the tang (nakago), or the hilt-section of the blade, during shaping, where they will be covered by a tsuka or hilt later. The tang is never supposed to be cleaned: doing this can cut the value of the sword in half or more. The purpose is to show how well the blade steel ages. A number of different types of file markings are used, including horizontal, slanted, and checked, known as ichi-monji, ko-sujikai, sujikai, ō-sujikai, katte-agari, shinogi-kiri-sujikai, taka-no-ha, and gyaku-taka-no-ha. A grid of marks, from raking the file diagonally both ways across the tang, is called higaki, whereas specialized [...] "full dress" [...] file marks are called kesho-yasuri. Lastly, if the blade is very old, it may have been shaved instead of filed. This is called sensuki. While ornamental, these file marks also serve the purpose of providing an uneven surface which bites well into the hilt which fits over it, and is made from wood. It is this <b>pressure</b> <b>fit</b> for the most part that holds the hilt in place, while the mekugi pin serves as a secondary method and a safety.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} system for quantitative respirator fit testing by negative pressure was evaluated by comparison testing with a computerized aerosol fit test system (Dynatech Frontier Model 260 A). The new negative pressure system measures leakage flow while inspiratory pressures are sustained in a respirator facepiece {{rather than by}} pressure decay. Four phases of comparison testing were graduated by level of control, ranging from non-subject tests with hypodermic needle leakages to fit tests of 125 Air Force personnel. Throughout the series of tests, negative <b>pressure</b> <b>fit</b> factors were consistently more conservative than aerosol fit factors and showed less variability. Leakage flow rates measured by the negative pressure instrument were highly correlated with leak needle cross-sectional area as predicted by principles of air-flow physics. Comparison of subject and non-subject generated aerosol fit factors indicated significant aerosol losses, possibly due to streamlining and respiratory tract deposition.

40|$|Demand for {{customised}} body contouring stretch garments, which apply {{varying degrees}} of compressive stretch for sportswear, cosmetic body shaping and medical applications is increasing. In evolutionary terms stretch garment pattern design is in its infancy. Traditionally garment pattern-drafting co-ordinates encompass an implicit fit rationale. Although body scanning and automated measurement extraction is exciting, the process itself cannot bring about a better fit. Stretch fabrics are produced in a diverse range. Currently determining the degree of fabric extension and how to apply the amount of available stretch in the pattern reduction process is trial and error for the inexperienced. The garment-to-body fit relationship is crucial particularly when a specific compressive fit is desired.

40|$|International {{audience}} In-situ X-ray and {{neutron diffraction}} investigations on Cu 3 N indicate {{the onset of}} a high-pressure phase transition at about 5 GPa. The tetragonal cell parameters of the high-pressure phase reveal a discontinuous volume decrease of about 20 %. The phase transition is reversible, with a hysteresis of about 2 GPa. Subsequent ex-situ investigations in a multi-anvil press evidence a reversible re-formation of ambient pressure Cu 3 N from XRD patterns. The structure refinement with N atoms disordered in distorted octahedral voids of a tetragonal body-centered Cu-substructure leads to an occupation of approximately 1 / 3 and thus to a composition of Cu 3 N 1. 0 (1). Optical absorption measurements (IR-VIS) up to 10 GPa indicate a semiconductor–metal transition. Density-functional based total energy calculations concerning the proposed high-pressure phase of Cu 3 N support strongly the experimental findings of a pressures-induced phase transition above 6 GPa to a structure with a Cu tetragonal body-centered sublattice and nitrogen atoms in distorted octahedral voids. However, the calculations identify a need for an ordered alternative to provide the tetragonal distortion {{within the range of}} the observed c / a -ratio. The resulting lattice parameters and the transition <b>pressure</b> <b>fit</b> with the measured data.

40|$|Secondary anisotropies in {{the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background are a treasure-trove of cosmological information. Interpreting current experiments probing them are limited by theoretical uncertainties rather than by measurement errors. Here we focus on the secondary anisotropies resulting from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect; the amplitude of which depends critically on the average thermal pressure profile of galaxy groups and clusters. To this end, we use a suite of SPH simulations that include radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We examine in detail how the pressure profile depends on cluster radius, mass, and redshift and provide an empirical fitting function. We employ three different approaches for calculating the tSZ power spectrum: an analytical approach that uses our pressure profile fit, a semi-analytical method of pasting our <b>pressure</b> <b>fit</b> onto simulated clusters, and a direct numerical integration of our simulated volumes. We demonstrate that the detailed structure of the intracluster medium and cosmic web affect the tSZ power spectrum. In particular, the substructure and asphericity of clusters increase the tSZ power spectrum by 10 - 20 % at ell ~ 2000 - 8000, with most of the additional power being contributed by substructures. The contributions to the power spectrum from radii larger than R_ 500 is ~ 20 % at ell = 3000, thus clusters interiors (r < R_ 500) dominate the power spectrum amplitude at these angular scales.

It provides estimates for the time constants of the respiratory System (tauRS(model)) and of the decay of continuing inspiratory muscle activity in early expiration (tauMUS(model)). In ten anesthetized, tracheostomized cats flow, tracheal pressure and diaphragmatic EMG were measured during normal expirations and expirations with four different added resistances. No {{significant differences were found between}} tauRS(model) (0. 21 - 0. 49 sec) obtained by fitting the model to the flow data and tauRS obtained from the straight part of the expiratory flow-volume curve. tauMUS(model) (0. 050 - 0. 052 sec) was comparable to similar time constants obtained from the integrated diaphragmatic EMG or from end-inspiratory, tracheal occlusion <b>pressure.</b> <b>Fitted</b> peak flow and time to peak tidal expiratory flow were not significantly different from those measured.

It was firstly proposed that women who were higher in intrasexual competition would see a job candidate wearing revealing attire as less hireable and would derogate her more compared to a job candidate wearing not-revealing attire and also more so than women who were lower in intrasexual competition. Secondly, it was proposed that women who were higher in intrasexual competition would rate workplace attire as being more important and feel higher levels of <b>pressure</b> to <b>fit</b> in within the workplace compared to women lower in intrasexual competition.
