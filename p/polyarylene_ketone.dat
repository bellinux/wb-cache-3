The average diameter of the spots was approximately 10 nm at 40 % RH, which increased to 13 nm at 70 % RH. The total area of the proton conducting spots, as well as current at each spot, on the membrane surface increased at high humidity and temperature.

SPAEEKK/silica hybrid membranes were prepared using the sol 2 ̆ 013 gel process under acidic conditions. The SPAEEKK/silica hybrid membranes were fabricated with different silica contents and the membranes were modified to achieve improved proton conductivity incorporating P 2 ̆ 013 OH groups (H 3 PO 4 treatment). The silica particles within the membranes {{were used for}} the purpose of blocking excessive methanol cross-over and for forming a pathway for proton transport due to water absorption onto the hydrophilic triple bond; length of mdashSiOH surface. The proton conductivities of H 3 PO 4 -doped membranes were somewhat higher than the un-doped (H 3 PO 4 -free) membranes due to increasing hydrophilicity of the membranes. The presence of silica particles within the organic polymer matrix, which decreases the ratio of free water to bound water due to the triple bond; length of mdashSiOH on the surface of silica derived from sol 2 ̆ 013 gel reaction, results in hybrid membranes with reduced methanol permeability and improved proton conductivity.
