5000|$|There {{were a few}} exceptions, namely, some {{conceptual}} [...] "anti-records" [...] {{they released}} in the late 1980s and early 90s. The first, from 1988, was entitled Wind Licked Dirt, and consisted of an uncut vinyl LP in a cover packed {{with a bunch of}} small pebbles, which are included to [...] "play" [...] the record with. A later edition of this was made with a [...] "CD" [...] (a clear <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> from a spindle of blank discs), and it is currently available as a [...] "C-0 cassette." [...] The second was entitled Oxygen is Flammable, and was a broken piece of plastic packaged in a small box. Enclosed were instructions which state that the piece of plastic is a record, and that it's played by pouring water over it. The instructions also call attention to possible similarities between the sounds of water falling and fire rising. One record was cut with blank grooves and packaged with a piece of steel wool; the owner of the record was requested to scour the surface of the record with the steel wool and then play it. This record was entitled [...] "Fire". Another was called Shear, which was a ball of cotton batting packaged in a small box. Wrapped around the contents are instructions on three thin strips of paper, which informs the holder that the cotton batting is a recording, which is played by squeezing. The sounds this [...] "record" [...] gives are described by Larsen as being a [...] "sharp fluffy slightness" [...] and a [...] "thin fluffy pressed". These three releases are, in and of themselves, a kind of performance piece.|$|E
40|$|Background: Negative {{pressure}} wound therapy (NPWT) {{has gained}} acceptance among surgeons, {{for the treatment}} of open abdomen, since very high closure rates have been reported with this method, compared to other kinds of wound management for the open abdomen. However, the method has occasionally been associated with increased development of fistulae. We have previously shown that NPWT induces ischemia in the underlying small intestines close to the vacuum source, and that a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> placed between the intestines and the vacuum source prevents the induction of ischemia.

40|$|The {{object of}} {{study is a}} {{semiconductor}} silicon disc-crystal currently used {{in the design of}} semiconductor diodes. The disc-crystal is manufactured by the sandblasting separation of a premasked silicon wafer into individual elements. The crystal has frustum-of-a-cone shape with its top diameter determined by a <b>protective</b> masking <b>disc</b> diameter and the bottom one defined by the features of the forming process. The apex angle of the cone 2 α or a half-angle α between the lateral surface of the cone and the normal drawn to its base is used as a reference value. The work has studied the influence a thickness of the separated wafer and a width of the gap between the masked discs on the crystal shape. The masking cover is a set of square protective elements (3 x 3 mm), spaced at 0. 6; 0. 7; 0. 8 and 0. 9 mm. The mask material is a self-adhesive PVC-film with thickness of 200 microns. Pilot-plant semi-automatic sandblasting equipment was used to for separation. After processing of results (the angle 2 α {{at the top of the}} cone) the following conclusions have been made: - with increasing thickness of the silicon wafers the gap between the <b>protective</b> <b>discs</b> of mask must be increased; - in case a range of the minimum gaps between the <b>protective</b> <b>discs</b> is within 0. 35 - 1. 20 mm the half-angle α, which defines the shape of the cut surface, can be considered to be constant and equal to 12 º [...] . 14 º. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES:: Blood flow {{changes in}} the {{intestines}} during conventional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), and NPWT using a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> over the intestines in laparostomy. BACKGROUND:: Higher closure rates of the open abdomen have been reported with NPWT compared with other kinds of wound management. However, the method {{has been associated with}} increased development of fistulae. We have compared the changes in blood flow in the intestinal wall using conventional NPWT and NWPT with a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> between the intestines and the vacuum source. METHODS:: Midline incisions were made in 10 pigs and either conventional NPWT or NPWT with a disc over the intestines was applied. The microvascular blood flow was measured in the intestinal wall before and after the application of topical negative pressures of - 50, - 70, and - 120 mmHg, using laser Doppler velocimetry. RESULTS:: The blood flow was significantly decreased (by 24 %) after the application of conventional NPWT at - 50 mmHg, compared with a slight decrease (2 %) after the application of NWPT with a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> (P < 0. 05). The blood flow was significantly decreased (by 54 %) after the application of conventional NPWT at - 120 mmHg, compared with a slight decrease (17 %) after application of NPWT using a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> (P < 0. 001).

40|$|There are {{increasing}} reports of deaths and serious complications {{associated with the}} use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Bleeding may occur in patients when NPWT is applied to a wound with exposed blood vessels or vascular grafts, possibly due to mechanical deformation and hypoperfusion of the vessel walls. Recent evidence suggests that using a rigid barrier disc to protect underlying tissue can prevent this mechanical deformation. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rigid discs on the tissue exposed to negative pressure with regard to tissue pressure and microvascular blood flow. Peripheral wounds were created on the backs of eight pigs. The pressure and microvascular blood flow in the wound bed were measured when NPWT was applied. The wound was filled with foam, and rigid discs of different designs were inserted between the wound bed and the foam. The discs were created with or without channels (to accommodate exposed sensitive structures such as blood vessels and nerves), perforations, or a porous dressing that covered the underside of the discs (to facilitate pressure transduction and fluid evacuation). When comparing the results for pressure transduction to the wound bed, no significant differences were found using different discs covered with dressing, whereas pressure transduction was lower with bare discs. Microvascular blood flow in the wound bed decreased by 49 ± 7 % when NPWT was applied to control wounds. The reduction in blood flow was less in the presence of a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> (e. g., - 6 ± 5 % for a dressing-covered, perforated disc, p = 0. 006). In conclusion, NPWT causes hypoperfusion of superficial tissue in the wound bed. The insertion of a rigid barrier counteracts this effect. The placement of a rigid disc over exposed blood vessels or nerves may protect these structures from rupture and damage...|$|E
40|$|Higher closure {{rates of}} the open abdomen have been {{reported}} with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) than with other kinds of wound management. We have recently shown that NPWT decreases the blood flow in the intestinal wall, and that the blood flow could be restored by inserting a <b>protective</b> <b>disc</b> over the intestines. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether layers of Jelonet™ (Smith & Nephew) dressing (paraffin tulle gras dressing made from open weave gauze) over the intestines could protect the intestines from hypoperfusion.

The microvascular blood flow was measured in the intestinal wall before and after the application of topical negative pressures of - 50, - 70 and - 120 mmHg, using laser Doppler velocimetry. Baseline blood flow was defined as 100 % in all settings. The blood flow was significantly reduced, to 61 ± 7 % (P < 0 · 001), after the application of - 50 mmHg using conventional NPWT, and to 62 ± 7 % (P < 0 · 001) after the application of - 50 mmHg with Jelonet dressings between the dressing and the intestines.
