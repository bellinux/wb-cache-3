40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{experienced by}} parents are increasingly recognized to affect offspring performance. We {{set out to}} investigate the effect of parental larval diet on offspring development time, adult body size and adult resistance to the bacterium Serratia marcescens in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies for the parental generation were raised on either poor or standard diet and then mated in the four possible sex-by-parental diet crosses. Females that were raised on <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> produced larger offspring than females that were raised on standard food. Furthermore, male progeny sired by fathers that were raised on <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> were larger than male progeny sired by males raised on standard food. Development times were shortest for offspring whose one parent (mother or the father) was raised on standard and the other parent on <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> and longest for offspring whose parents both were raised on <b>poor</b> <b>food.</b> No evidence for transgenerational effects of parental diet on offspring disease resistance was found. Although paternal effects have been previously demonstrated in D. melanogaster, no earlier studies have investigated male-mediated transgenerational effects of diet in this species. The results highlight the importance of not only considering the relative contribution each parental sex has on progeny performance but also the combined effects that the two sexes may have on offspring performance...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of global urban development is increasing opportunities for wildlife to forage and become dependent on anthropogenic resources. Wildlife using urban areas are often perceived dichotomously as urban or not, with some individuals removed {{in the belief that}} dependency on anthropogenic resources is irreversible and can lead to increased human-wildlife conflict. For American black bears (Ursus americanus), {{little is known about the}} degree of bear urbanization and its ecological mechanisms to guide the management of human-bear conflicts. Using 6 years of GPS location and activity data from bears in Aspen, Colorado, USA, we evaluated the degree of bear urbanization and the factors that best explained its variations. We estimated space use, activity patterns, survival, and reproduction and modeled their relationship with ecological covariates related to bear characteristics and natural food availability. Space use and activity patterns were dependent on natural food availability (good or <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> years), where bears used higher human density areas and became more nocturnal in <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> years. Patterns were reversible, i. e., individuals using urban areas in <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> years used wildland areas in subsequent good food years. While reproductive output was similar across years, survival was lower in <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> years when bears used urban areas to a greater extent. Our findings suggest that bear use of urban areas i...|$|R
40|$|Many {{animal species}} face periods of chronic {{nutritional}} stress {{during which the}} individuals must continue to develop, grow, and/or reproduce despite low quantity or quality of food. Here, we use experimental evolution to study adaptation to such chronic nutritional stress in six replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for the ability to survive and develop within a limited time on a very <b>poor</b> larval <b>food.</b> In unselected control populations, this <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> resulted in 20 % lower egg-to-adult viability, 70 % longer egg-to-adult development, and 50 % lower adult body weight (compared to the standard food on which the flies were normally maintained). The evolutionary changes associated with adaptation to the <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> were assayed by comparing the selected and control lines in a common environment for different traits after 29 - 64 generations of selection. The selected populations evolved improved egg-to-adult viability and faster development on <b>poor</b> <b>food.</b> Even though the adult dry weight of selected flies when raised on the <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> was {{lower than that of}} controls, their average larval growth rate was higher. No differences in proportional pupal lipid content were observed. When raised on the standard food, the selected flies showed the same egg-to-adult viability and the same resistance to larval heat and cold shock as the controls and a slightly shorter developmental time. However, despite only 4 % shorter development time, the adults of selected populations raised on the standard food were 13 % smaller and showed 20 % lower early-life fecundity than the controls, with no differences in life span. The selected flies also turned out less tolerant to adult malnutrition. Thus, fruit flies have the genetic potential to adapt to <b>poor</b> larval <b>food,</b> with no detectable loss of larval performance on the standard food. However, adaptation to larval nutritional stress is associated with trade-offs with adult fitness components, including adult tolerance to nutritional stress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. Dietary {{conditions}} affect {{cognitive abilities}} of many species, {{but it is}} unclear to what extent this physiological effect translates into an evolutionary relationship. 2. A reduction of competitive ability under nutritional stress has been reported as a correlated response to selection for learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we test whether the reverse holds as well, i. e. whether an evolutionary adaptation to <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> conditions leads to a decrease in learning capacities. 3. Populations of D. melanogaster were: (i) not subject to selection (control), (ii) selected for improved learning ability, (iii) selected for survival and fast development on <b>poor</b> <b>food,</b> or (iv) subject to both selection regimes. 4. There was no detectable response to selection for learning ability. 5. Selection on <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> led to higher survival, faster development and smaller adult size as a direct response, and to reduced learning ability as a correlated response. This study supports the hypothesis that adaptation to poor nutrition is likely to trade off with the evolution of improved learning ability...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster is used {{extensively}} for studies of life-history trade-offs involving acquisition and allocation of nutritional resources. Yet {{we know very}} little about the effects of level of parental nutrition on offspring fitness traits, and whether parental and offspring nutrition interact in their effect on offspring phenotype, although such interactions are known in other organisms. We looked for such parental effects and interactions by assaying pre-adult survivorship and dry weight at eclosion on individuals from a long-standing laboratory population of D. melanogaster subjected to four combinations of maternal (rich or <b>poor</b> <b>food)</b> and offspring (rich or <b>poor</b> <b>food)</b> nutritional environments. We saw no effect of maternal food level on offspring dry weight at eclosion. On average, females were heavier than males, and flies given rich food as larvae were heavier than those raised on <b>poor</b> <b>food</b> as larvae. Levels of maternal and offspring food interacted significantly in their effect on pre-adult survivorship, with the highest survivorship being seen in individuals from the combination of poor maternal and rich offspring food; survivorship did not differ significantly among the other three treatments.
