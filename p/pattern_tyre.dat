Above a steady forward vehicle speed of 40 km/h this is the dominant noise source of a modern car in good working condition, and is a significant contributor to the overall radiated noise during acceleration. In order to determine the noise produced by a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> rolling on a rough road surface, the vibration characteristics of the tyre must be known. A method has been presented by O'Boy and Dowling [Tyre/road interaction noise: a 3 d viscoelastic multilayer model of a tyre belt, Journal of Sound and Vibration, volume 322, issues 4 - 5, 22 May 2009, pages 829 - 850] which provides these vibration characteristics for a tyre belt composed of multiple viscoclastic layers, each layer having a different thickness and material properties. In this paper, we use this model of the tyre belt to determine the parameters of an equivalent simple bending plate model which can be adapted to yield the response of a tyre which includes sidewalls. A method is then described which uses this response to determine the acceleration of the tyre surface as it rolls over a rough road. These accelerations are then used to predict the far-field radiated noise for a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> on two rough road surfaces. Comparisons with experimental data are provided at each stage.

Smooth road surfaces in the database highlight contributions in the low and medium frequency domain not related to the enveloped road texture and suggest to also considering the <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> for the <b>tyre</b> belt radiated noise level prediction. Due to the essentially different road and tyre tread roughnesses, 2 D profiles are no longer suitable and therefore a 3 D envelopment procedure is proposed to account for a combined road and tyre roughness. This 3 D procedure is tested on a database which includes 3 D texture and noise measurements performed on a set of impervious road surfaces within the DEUFRAKO ODSurf project. Noise measurements with a slick <b>tyre</b> and a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> are considered. The results are compared with those obtained with the 2 D envelopment procedure...|$|R

40|$|Traffic noise {{has become}} an {{important}} issue for mental health. Tyre/road noise, caused by the interaction between tyre and road surface, is a significant contributor to road traffic noise. Current tyre regulation aims at noise abatement. In order to predict tyre/road noise accurately, advanced numerical models are needed. Most current tyre/road noise models, however, are not accurate enough to predict tyre/road noise based on physical models. Hence, a new method has to be proposed. A numerical tyre/road noise model has been built based on physics. It consists of a structural vibration model using finite elements and a sound radiation model using boundary elements; both models are coupled by the tyre vibrations. The numerical model, which takes into account structural mechanisms only, has been validated for a slick tyre rolling on various road surfaces at different speeds. For the experimental validation, a device has been developed by which tyre/road noise can be measured on a moving car. The simulation results are {{in accordance with the}} measurement results in a sense that they show the same trends. The numerical model can be used to develop more silent tyres and roads. Due to its modular built-up the model is applicable for <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> as well...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between tyre/road noise levels measured by the Coast-By (CB) and the Close-ProXimity (CPX) methods. For that purpose, tyre/road noise was measured for a passenger car fitted with four identical <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> rolling {{on a set of}} 15 impervious road surfaces. The CPX and CB measurement methods have been used simultaneously on each road surface at vehicle speeds ranging between 50 km/h and 110 km/h. A very good correlation between overall CPX and CB noise levels recomposed between 400 Hz and 4000 Hz was observed which is consistent with previous results of the literature. With the whole set of road surfaces and frequencies, a fairly good correlation between the CPX and CB spectral noise levels was also observed. Taking each road surface individually, an excellent spectral correlation was observed, leading to a very accurate estimation of the overall CB noise levels from the CPX noise levels. Considering each one-third octave band frequency, the correlations between CPX and CB spectral noise levels were also good and enable to estimate the overall CB noise levels with the same accuracy as when using the correlation between the overall CPX and CB noise levels. As a perspective, the results could help to compare different tyre/road noise prediction models which have been calibrated or validated with different testing method (pass-by or close-proximity) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> design for optimum wet grip performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of tread pattern geometry. The performance of a particular tread pattern is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern tread patterns are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved wet grip. Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the tyre contact patch have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre wet grip performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved wet grip. However, some conclusions are made as to possible features which could be utilized in future tyre designs...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{there is}} no tread <b>pattern,</b> slick <b>tyre</b> tread does not deform much under load. The reduced {{deformation}} allows the tyre to be constructed of softer compounds without excessive overheating and blistering. Modern day slick tyres have now developed particular performance qualities in a specific window of temperatures, becoming [...] "sticky" [...] when accumulating enough heat, and thus give much greater adhesion to the road surface, {{but it also has}} a lower treadwear rating; i.e. it wears out much more quickly than the harder rubber tyres used for driving on the streets. It is not uncommon for drivers in some auto sports to wear out multiple sets of tyres during a single day's driving.|$|R

40|$|High {{frequency}} (above 1 kHz) {{noise generation}} from the tyre/road interaction {{is still not}} fully understood and accurately modelled. Two noise generation mechanisms previously suggested in the literature are reviewed: air pumping and noise generation cased by adhesive effects between the tyre tread and road surface. These mechanisms are located in and near the tyre/road contact zone, and a deterministic description of these mechanisms requires a tyre model that is able to describe the high frequency behaviour of the tyre, including local deformation in both the radial and tangential directions. A three-dimensional two-layer plate tyre model based on the elastic field equations is suggested as a model that would fulfil these requirements. This model was developed earlier [1], and is now extended to allow for comparison to mobility measurements on real tyres. The overall agreement between the model and measurements is surprisingly good {{in view of the}} simplicity of the model. However, some limitations of the model are also presented. The tyre model is used in two investigations focusing on the dynamic behaviour of tyres in both the radial and tangential directions in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 4 kHz; (i) investigation of the dynamic behaviour of smooth and <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> at high frequencies for both radial and tangential directions, and (ii) a parameter study investigating the relation between internal tyre parameters and the response at the outermost surface. It was found that the radial point mobility is greatly influenced by properties of the local deformation at high frequencies and/or small excitation areas. The tangential point mobility is affected by local deformation in almost the whole frequency range. Hence, it is mainly the properties of the tread cap and the pattern that determine the response at high frequencies and in the tangential direction. The radial response is determined by the combined properties of the belt and the tread cap at medium frequencies, while it is the dimension and the pre-tension in the plies that determines the low frequency response...|$|R

Two sites {{have recently been}} tested in France, the first one paved with a five years old VTAC 0 / 4 and the second one paved {{with a one year}} old VTAC 0 / 6. The measurement campaign included tyre/road noise testing as well as assessment of road surface properties like 3 D texture and sound absorption. Close-ProXimity (CPX) and Coast-By (CB) tyre/road noise measurements were performed simultaneously over a distance of 20 meters long. The test vehicle was a passenger car fitted with <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres.</b> Several runs were performed at steady speed from 40 km/h up to 110 km/h, leading to the estimation of CPX and CB noise levels and spectra at different reference speeds. The 3 D texture of the road surfaces was evaluated with a newly developed device involving a 2 D laser sensor. The texture sample size was about 0. 35 m by 1. 5 m with a sampling interval of 0. 1 mm. A specific protocol was used to record four aligned texture samples with overlapping zones, leading to a final complete surface of about 6 m by 0. 35 m. Texture data were processed to get the height probability densities, the mean texture depth as well as the raw and the enveloped longitudinal texture spectra. Sound absorption was also measured following ISO 13472 - 1 leading to absorption peaks around 1000 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 4 and around 800 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 6. The CPX and CB noise results of the tested road surfaces are compared to results for reference road surfaces, i. e. a VTAC 0 / 6 and a DAC 0 / 10 located on a reference test track. Noise performances of the optimized VTAC are finally discussed with regards to texture and sound absorption properties...|$|R
50|$|Later, and better, {{patterns}} were the Dunlop 'Traction' tread pattern of 1922 and the 'Triple stud' pattern of 1927. These {{followed the same}} principle of a solid central rib with square-edged blocks, but were developed to improve tread wear. The central rib became a thin and almost vestigial rib between square blocks. The side blocks were now isolated from the centre, although linked by another narrow rib, and their {{leading and trailing edges}} formed a trapezium rather than a square. This triple square stud pattern was a successful <b>pattern</b> for narrow <b>tyres,</b> including motorcycles, and remained popular from several manufacturers into the 1950s.|$|R

Multivariate experimentation techniques were used involving five variables: slip angle, camber, vertical load, <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern</b> and land or furrow operation. The results are presented as three force and three moment components; other methods of represen-tation are discussed briefly. Although the side or cornering force depends on many factors, particularly the soil surface, and is therefore difficult to predict, {{it is suggested that}} the draught force (i. e. resistance in the direction of motion) can be expressed as a function of slip for all surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Rolling resistance, noise generation, {{and wear}} are all {{determined}} by the interaction process between the rolling automotive vehicle tyre and the road. A deep understanding of the interaction process is needed for optimisation aiming at reducing these effects. Details in the tyre/road contact interface are considered in the presented work; non-linear contact stiffness and adherence forces at the interface are investigated and modelled. A description of the tyre structure and especially its tread layer is required for contact modelling. The dynamic responses of smooth and <b>patterned</b> passenger-car <b>tyres</b> are experimentally investigated. Experimental results are used to validate a high-frequency tyre model based on the elastic field equations, which includes the local deformation of the tread. The separation process when tyre tread blocks are rapidly separated from road surfaces is investigated in an experiment. This process is described {{with the aid of}} the total contact force and noise generation. Based on the experimental results, a model for the adherence force as a function of load, load duration, and unloading rate is proposed. Optimisation of the tyre/road interaction including interfacial details requires time-domain contact models including a wide range of length-scales. The strategy is to divide the contact problem into different ranges of length-scales. A model based on statistical description of the contact geometry is used on the smallest length-scales. A tread block in contact with the road surface is modelled on intermediate length-scales, and on the largest length-scales is a contact model of the complete tyre structure rolling over the road surface. The two latter models use a numerical time-domain contact formulation with a discretised contact geometry. These three models are connected via constitutive relations between contact pressure and relative displacements, incorporated as non-linear springs between the contact elements. The modelling approach is still under development but preliminary results are presented...|$|R

SSR states that the mean of many <b>patterns</b> of dynamic <b>tyre</b> force applied to a pavement surface is similar for a fleet of trucks of a given type. A model which can accurately predict patterns of SSR could subsequently be used in whole-life pavement deterioration models {{as a means of}} describing pavement loading due to a fleet of vehicles. This paper presents a method for predicting patterns of SSR, {{through the use of a}} truck fleet model inferred from measurements of dynamic tyre forces. A Bayesian statistical inference algorithm is used to determine the distributions of multiple parameters of a fleet of quarter-car heavy vehicle ride models, based on prior assumed distributions and the set of observed dynamic tyre force from a `true? fleet of 100 simulated models. Simulated forces are noted at 16 equidistant pavement locations, similar to data from a multiple sensor weigh-in-motion site. It is shown that the fitted model provides excellent agreement in the mean pattern of dynamic force with the originally generated truck fleet. It is shown that good predictions are possible for patterns of SSR on a given section of road for a fleet of similar vehicles...|$|R
40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the AASHTO Road Test many researches have been carried out regarding material and pavement performance, both in laboratory and in situ. Many methods for pavement evaluation and design were obtained based on empirical or empirical-mechanistic approaches. Nowadays these methods are used in pavement analysis and design supported by a set of shift factors which consider the variables not included in their definition. At the present time, the development of economical electronic sensors has made possible a successful full-scale instrumentation of pavements. This paper focuses on the problems and solutions related to instrumentation and its integration in the research of pavements in situ to collect relevant data for pavement modelling. The instrumentation includes monitoring environmental conditions (rainfall, air temperature, solar radiation, UV radiation and wind), pavement state (temperature, moisture and groundwater level), pavement response (displacement, tensile and compression strains, shear effects, deformations and pressures) and vehicle characteristics (classification, axle configuration, tyre types and pressures, speed, weight by axle at high speed and the driving transversal shift, i. e. the wheel distance from the pavement border). The definition of the instrumentation for pavement response was based on conventional pavement analysis using numerical modelling in which the sensors position was chosen to ensure reliable measurements. The external parameters evaluation, such as the vehicle classification, where the contact area and the <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern</b> are included, was considered by sample-collection...|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, many bicycle tyres {{made for}} street use are slick. Aquaplaning does not present {{a problem for}} {{bicycles}} due to their narrower width, higher pressure, lower speed, and circular cross section (due {{to the need to}} lean the bicycle in turns); the bicycle tyre can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily. In practice, grooved bicycle tyres do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads. However, many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial tread depth, because the bicycles are designed with off-road excursions in mind: in dirt, gravel or sand, the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction. In addition, high-performance bicycle tyres, although designed for road use only, often have a very fine tread pattern, which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre-wear indicator. This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres, but also {{from the fact that the}} texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread <b>pattern</b> on these <b>tyres.</b> Some grooveless designs have small [...] "holes" [...] or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre-wear indicator. This is similar to automobile tyre-wear indicator bars, which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount, making the tyre noisy on the road.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. Tyres, and mostly rims, {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study the effects of tyre geometry (tyre profile and tyre tread) on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different tyre profiles, treads, rim designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from the tyre manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of the generic tyre resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to the tyres obtained from the manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to the conclusion that tyre profile, as well as <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern,</b> are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be separated from the tyre itself...|$|R
40|$|Tyre/road {{noise is}} the main {{contributor}} to road traffic noise at speeds above 40 km/h for passenger cars and above 70 km/h for heavy trucks. Research {{has been carried out}} during the last thirty years in order to understand and quantify the generation mechanisms responsible for tyre/road noise. However, there is still substantial work remaining until tyre/road noise can be reduced substantially if at all. The work presented in this thesis concerns the modelling the tyre/roads interaction and the resulting vibrations of the tyre structure. The model is supposed to calculate the time varying forces when the road roughness is indenting the tyre tread during rolling. To achieve this, a contact model is developed, implemented and validated against measurements. The contact model is formulated in the time domain and considers a three-dimensional contact. An elastic half-space is used as a tool to describe the deformation of the tyre tread, and an iterative algorithm is utilised in order to solve the contact problem for each time step of the calculation. In parallel, an alternative quasi-three-dimensional contact model is also presented. Good agreement of calculated and measured tyre vibrations is found for different tyres and road surfaces. Additionally to the tyre vibrations air-pumping is included in the model {{in the form of the}} local deformations of the tyre tread due to road roughness indenting at the contact patch. The local deformation is believed to be a main contributor to tyre/road noise about 1 kHz. In this work, the local deformation is calculated from the deformation of the elastic half-space used for the contact problem. Preliminary qualitative results shows that the sound radiated due to local deformation dominates above 1 - 2 kHz whereas the sound radiated by the tyre structure vibrations dominates below 1 - 2 kHz. The model developed in this thesis is used to study the coupling between vibration <b>pattern</b> on the <b>tyre</b> and radiated sound. It is shown, that mainly the low order modes are contributing to the radiation and that the coupling between modes with respect to the radiated sound is essential...|$|R
