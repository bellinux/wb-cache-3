40|$|An {{empirical}} model was generated to estimate diversity gain on Earth-space propagation paths {{as a function}} of Earth terminal separation distance, link frequency, elevation angle, and angle between the baseline and the <b>path</b> <b>azimuth.</b> The resulting model reproduces the entire experimental data set with an RMS error of 0. 73 dB...|$|E
40|$|A "no-flow-sensor" wind {{estimation}} algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is presented. It {{is based}} on ground speed and flight <b>path</b> <b>azimuth</b> information from the autopilot's GPS system. The algorithm has been tested {{with the help of}} the simulation option in the Paparazzi autopilot software using artificial wind profiles. The retrieval accuracy of the predefined profiles by the wind algorithm and its sensitivity to vertical aircraft velocity, diameter of the helical flight pattern and different data sampling methods have been investigated. The algorithm with a correspondingly optimized set of parameters is then applied to various scientific flight missions under real wind conditions performed by the UAS SUMO (Small Unmanned Meteorological Observer). The SUMO wind profiles are compared to measurements of conventional atmospheric profiling systems as radiosondes and piloted balloons. In general, the presented "no-flow-sensor" wind estimation method performs well in most atmospheric situations and is now operationally used in the post-processing routine for wind profile determination from SUMO measurements...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{to compute}} accurate distances over grid cells crossed by seismic surface wave paths by Rudoe’s formula is proposed. The intersection coordinates between paths and the geodetic grid are also computed, which data are exhibited in an azimuthal equidistant projection {{to check the}} results. GRS- 80 is the adopted ellipsoidal Earth model. The algorithm computes the intermediate intersections, from both forward and reciprocal normal sections given by Rudoe’s method, which separation may be greater than the cell size. It was tested on a data set including 3, 269 source-station paths, which seismic events were recorded at 23 IRIS stations. The epicentral distances range from 1, 634 km to 16, 400 km, which the grid spreads over 149 °E x 21 °W, and 50 °N x 90 °S. The {{results show that the}} estimated intersections accuracy depends on the <b>path</b> <b>azimuth</b> and latitude, which influence may be significative for very long distances as in teleseismic applications, which argues for the algorithm application...|$|E
30|$|The stripmap and {{spotlight}} modes {{are the two}} well-known SAR operating schemes. In the stripmap mode, antenna azimuth beam {{points along}} a fixed direction {{with respect to the}} flight <b>path,</b> while <b>azimuth</b> beam is steered during the whole acquisition interval in the spotlight mode. In this section, both acquisitions geometries and echo characteristics in the sliding spotlight mode are compared with conventional stripmap and spotlight modes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{examined}} whether {{there may be}} preferred <b>azimuths</b> for earth-satellite <b>paths</b> along which fading and space diversity statistics are influenced differently than along other azimuths. Such preferred directions may exist if individual rain cells are statistically elongated along them for the given climatological region. The analysis is performed using the rain reflectivity data base obtained at Wallops Island during June, July and August 1973 using a high resolution radar. It is found that {{in the vicinity of}} Wallops Island increased attenuation and poorer diversity gains exist along <b>paths</b> whose <b>azimuths</b> and base lines lie in the NE-SW quadrants as compared to the NW-SE sectors. This result suggests the dominance of the major axis of rain cells in these quadrants...|$|R
50|$|To avoid calling {{excessive}} {{attention to}} this unique vehicle, its orbital path was similar to one then being used by U. S. photo satellites. Since launch from Vandenberg AFB near midday meant that the initial orbit began as a descending (southbound) leg during daylight, all later descending legs did likewise and all ascending (northbound) legs occurred during darkness. At U.S. imaging latitudes, those ascending legs proceeded along <b>paths</b> at <b>azimuths</b> between 018° T and 022° T, more northerly than north-northeasterly, becoming slightly more easterly within that region as each path went to higher north or south latitudes. The azimuths of the descending (southbound) legs during imaging times were similarly between 162° T and 158° T. Unlike its downward-looking photo-satellite cousins, Quill looked northeasterly during descending legs and northwesterly during ascending ones.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>path</b> <b>azimuth</b> on fade and space diversity statistics associated with propagation along earth-satellite paths at a frequency of 18 GHz is examined. A radar rain reflectivity data base obtained {{during the summer}} of 1973 is injected into a modeling program and the attenuation along parallel earth-satellite paths are obtained for a conglomeration of azimuths. Statistics are separated into two groupings: one pertaining to earth-satellite paths oriented in the northwest-southeast and the other in the northeast-southwest quadrants using a fixed elevation angle of 45 deg. The latter case shows fading to be greater with a degraded space diversity suggesting rain cells to be elongated along this direction. Cell dimensions are analyzed for both sets of quadrants and are found to have average values larger by 2 km in the northeast-southwest quadrants; a result consistent with the fade and space diversity results. Examination of the wind direction for the 14 rain days of data analyzed shows good correlation of the average or median wind directions with the directions of maximum fading and degraded space diversity...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{waves in}} the Very Low Frequency (VLF) band (3 - 30 kHz) are {{reflected}} from the lowest part of the ionosphere, the D-region. Due to their relative stability and low attenuation they are utilized for navigation, timing and frequency comparisons. Any changes in D-region electron density structure are known to influence the phase velocity of VLF waves. Both regular diurnal and irregular behaviour have been extensively reported. A comparison of theoretical techniques is presented, demonstrating the influence of changes in radio frequency, ground conductivity, geomagnetic <b>path</b> <b>azimuth</b> and latitude. Described in this thesis is {{an analysis of the}} experimentally determined performance, within the U. K., of the VLF navigation system 'Omega'. The system relies on the stability of the phase velocity of the transmitted signals to provide a navigation fix. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in signal phase are investigated while the effects of modal interference and ionospheric disturbances are noted. In order to reduce errors resulting from regular variations in phase velocity, a prediction technique has been developed by the Omega Navigation System Operations Detail (ONSOD). An assessement of the validity of ONSOD predictions within the U. K. is presented and it is apparent that a number of differences exist between them and the experimental data. Major errors are evident at dawn over certain near north-south paths and marked differences may occur between data collected at particular sites. The relevance of these differences to Differential Omega is noted and an investigation into the performance of an Omega/Satellite combined system is conducted. The variations within the U. K. are not completly accounted for by changes in propagation path length although theoretical investigations indicate the importance of changes in electron density structure along the whole path. It is evident that the sunrise schedules of the ONSOD prediction program require modification...|$|E
40|$|A FORTRAN coded {{computer}} program is described which calculates orbital inclination error statistics using a closed-form solution. This solution uses a data base of trajectory errors from actual flights {{to predict the}} orbital inclination error statistics. The Scott flight history data base consists of orbit insertion errors in the trajectory parameters - altitude, velocity, flight <b>path</b> angle, flight <b>azimuth,</b> latitude and longitude. The methods used to generate the error statistics are of general interest since they have other applications. Program theory, user instructions, output definitions, subroutine descriptions and detailed FORTRAN coding information are included...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a neural network assisted entry guidance law {{that is designed}} by applying Bézier approximation. It is shown that a fully constrained approximation of a reference trajectory {{can be made by}} using the Bézier curve. Applying this approximation, an inverse dynamic system for an entry flight is solved to generate guidance command. The guidance solution thus gotten ensures terminal constraints for position, flight <b>path,</b> and <b>azimuth</b> angle. In order to ensure terminal velocity constraint, a prediction of the terminal velocity is required, based on which, the approximated Bézier curve is adjusted. An artificial neural network is used for this prediction of the terminal velocity. The method enables faster implementation in achieving fully constrained entry flight. Results from simulations indicate improved performance of the neural network assisted method. The scheme is expected to have prospect for further research on automated onboard control of terminal velocity for both reentry and terminal guidance laws...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} directional-based MIMO channel {{model is}} presented which takes multipath clustering into account. The directional propagation <b>path</b> parameters include <b>azimuth</b> of arrival (AoA), azimuth of departure (AoD), delay, and power. MIMO measurements {{are carried out}} in an indoor office environment using the virtual antenna array method with a vector network analyzer. Propagation paths are extracted using a joint 5 D ESPRIT algorithm and are automatically clustered with the K-power-means algorithm. This work focuses on the statistical treatment of the propagation parameters within individual clusters (intracluster statistics) and the change in these parameters from one cluster to another (intercluster statistics). Motivated choices for the statistical distributions of the intracluster and intercluster parameters are made. To validate these choices, the parameters' goodness of fit to the proposed distributions is verified using a number of powerful statistical hypothesis tests.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out in the 14 by 14 ft Ames transonic wind tunnel on a turret model. The aerodynamic parameters measured were steady and unsteady pressures (static and total fluid pressures), local mean velocities, and local mean densities at selected locations along the optical beam <b>path</b> for the <b>azimuth</b> look angles of 90, 120, and 150 degrees from the turret. The test stream Mach numbers considered are 0. 55, 0. 65 and 0. 75, and the Reynolds number per meter is in the range of 10 million. The results indicate that severe optical degradation can be expected at aft look azimuth, angles, this degradation in optical performance increases as the azimuth angle is increased. The ratio of rms static pressure to the local mean static pressure peaks in the range of 0. 07 to 0. 12 and the ratio of rms total pressure to the local mean total pressure peaks in the range of 0. 02 to 0. 04. These values depend on the Mach number and the aft look azimuth angle. The scale lengths obtained from correlation considerations are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Fractures {{constitute}} some of {{the most}} permeable groundwater migration pathways. The directional regularity of fracture sets largely determines the hydraulic anisotropy (single- or multi-directional) of fractured rocks. Knowledge of the preferential directions of possible water flow and pollutant migration <b>paths</b> along fracture-controlled <b>azimuths</b> is useful for understanding the flow patterns and spread of pollutants in a given aquifer. Yet systematic regional fracture mapping is still rare in hydrogeological studies. To assist in ongoing predictive modelling of mine water pollution plume migration within the Magnesian Limestone Aquifer (Permian) in County Durham, U. K., a survey was undertaken of basic fracture characteristics, including angles of dip, strike directions, aperture and frequency. These parameters were measured both in natural exposures and working quarries across the outcrop of the aquifer in the study area. Scrutiny of the measurements reveals the presence of two major fracture sets, one oriented WNW to NNW and the other oriented NNE to ENE. These are likely to be extensional joints, with perhaps a few minor faults, that form reasonably consistent conjugate sets distributed across the Permian outcrop, and suggest that the permeability tensor in the aquifer is also likely to have axes oriented with maxima trending NNE to ENE. This is only slightly oblique to the general eastward trend of groundwater flow towards the coast, suggesting a mild tendency to sinistral preference in transverse dispersivity...|$|R
40|$|Shear wave {{splitting}} {{observed in}} microearthquake data at {{the axis of}} the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 35 °N has a fast polarization direction that {{is parallel to the}} trend of the axial valley. The time delays between fast and slow S wave arrivals range from 35 - 180 ms, with an average of 90 ms, and show no relationship with ray <b>path</b> length, source-to-receiver <b>azimuth,</b> or receiver location. The anisotropy is attributed to a shallow distribution of vertical, fluid-filled cracks, aligned parallel to the trend of the axial valley. Joint modeling of the shear wave anisotropy and coincident P wave anisotropy results, using recent theoretical models for the elasticity of a porous medium with aligned cracks, suggests that the crack distribution that causes the observed P wave anisotropy can account for at most 10 ms of the shear wave delay. Most of the shear wave delay likely accrues within the shallowmost 500 m (seismic layer 2 A) and the percent S wave anisotropy within this highly fissured layer is 8 - 30 %. Isolated, fluid-filled cracks at 500 m- 3 km depth that are too thin or too shallow to be detected by the P wave experiment may also contribute to the shear wave delays. The joint analysis of P and S wave anisotropy is an important approach for constraining the crack distributions in the upper oceanic crust and is especially suited for seismically active hydrothermal systems at slow- and intermediate-spreading mid-ocean ridges. ...|$|R
40|$|Dual {{frequency}} GPS measurements cannot fully compensate {{higher order}} ionospheric refraction effects {{and lead to}} a residual error in the so-called “ionosphere free” L 3 linear phase combination. Due to the dependency on the geomagnetic field, the second-order residual error is highly variable with elevation and azimuth angles and difficult to model. However, based on ionospheric simulations using the Chapman function and a superposed exponential decay for describing the vertical electron density distribution, we developed a correction formula for the second-order residual phase error. Analysis shows that our proposed correction formula limits the second-order propagation effect less than 2 mm residual range error for GNSS users in Germany. Due to the dispersive nature of the ionosphere, the first-order propagation error may fully be corrected by differencing the signal at two spaced frequencies. But whereas the first order effect may be completely removed, the higher order effects are not fully compensated by the difference method. The second-order residual error can vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters depending on the elevation angle, the geographic location and solar-terrestrial relationships. For reasons of simplicity, the ray path bending effect is ignored in the computation of the second-order ionospheric refraction effects i. e. the effects are computed {{along the line of}} sight propagation (LoS). This procedure is justified because the second-order effect of another higher order effect will be less than the computational accuracy of the ray-tracing technique and can be neglected. The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model is used to compute the magnetic induction B along the ray path. The IGRF observations are translated into the generalized geocentric XYZ coordinate system to compute Θ, the angle between the wave propagation direction and the geomagnetic field vector. The proposed correction formula can be implemented in real-time applications as it does not require the knowledge of the geomagnetic field or the electron density distribution in the ionosphere along the signal path; only the total electron content (TEC) and geometrical parameters defining the ray <b>path</b> such as <b>azimuth</b> and elevation angles are required. It is expected that the correction will enable a more accurate positioning by using carrier phase measurements...|$|R
