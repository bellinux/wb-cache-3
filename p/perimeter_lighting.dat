5000|$|Brentford {{was one of}} {{the first}} clubs to {{recognise}} the potential of floodlit football and in 1954, a sum of £5,345 was spent on erecting <b>perimeter</b> <b>lights</b> the length of the Braemar Road and New Road stands. With the Football League banning competitive games under floodlights, a number of friendly matches were arranged to increase revenue, with one match against an International Managers XI attracting 21,600 spectators. By the time the Football League's ban on competitive floodlit football was lifted in February 1956, the club had received over £10,000 in gate receipts from the friendly matches. The original <b>perimeter</b> <b>lights</b> were replaced in August 1963 with pylons located at each corner of the ground, at a cost of £17,000. The current floodlight lamps on the pylons were purchased from West London neighbours Chelsea in 1983. Electronic scoreboards have been attached to two of the pylons since 2004. The floodlights were upgraded from 590 to 1000 lux during the 2015 off-season.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} 4 channel chase which {{is seen in}} a theater Marquee <b>perimeter</b> <b>{{lighting}}</b> and other lighting animation applications consists of 4 channel wired light bulbs and an electronic chaser.The electronic chaser turns channel #1 ON while all the other Channels remain OFF. Then after an adjustable period of time it turns OFF channel #1 while turning ON channel #2, then turn OFF channel #2 while turning ON channel #3, then turn OFF channel #3 while turning ON channel #4, then repeat.This creates the illusion that the lights are moving in one direction.Some digital lighting chasers are made to do the above described single light chase pattern along with other combinations of Turning ON and OFF of the light to create different sequences like forward light chase, backward light chase, bouncing, dark chase (1 channel OFF while all 3 others ON), etc...Also, more than 4 channel chasers are used to create more effects and to animate illuminated objects.|$|E

5000|$|To conduct {{nighttime}} {{operations at}} a heliport {{it must have}} lighting installed that meets specific aeronautical standards. Heliport perimeter lights are generally installed around the TLOF area an may be flush mounted on the TLOF itself or mounted just off the TLOF perimeter on short metal or concrete extensions. One alternative to lighting the TLOF if certain criteria is met is to light {{the area of the}} FATO instead. Some locations, due to environmental conditions, illuminate the TLOF and FATO. Lighting should never constitute an obstruction that a helicopter may impact and for this reason in the U.S. heliport lighting is not allowed to extend above the TLOF or FATO more than 2 inches. Current standards recommend that all <b>perimeter</b> <b>lighting</b> be green. Prior standards recommended amber lighting for perimeter lights however this wavelength has been shown to interfere with night vision goggle (NVG) operations when used with older incandescent lighting. In the past lighting has been traditionally incandescent but increasingly light emitting diodes (LEDs) are being incorporated due to lower power requirements and increased life. While flood lights may be used to enhance surface operations they should not interfere with flight crew night vision and should be kept off during flight operations and only used when conducting ground movement operations. To conduct night operations a lighted wind cone is also required. At ground-based heliports, lead-in lights may be incorporated to identify the preferred approach/departure direction [...] Visual slope guidance systems (such as HAPI, PAPI, etc.) are recommended options in both ICAO and FAA document. While airports commonly use 6.6A direct current power, [...] heliport lighting is normally AC powered. Radio control of the lighting by the pilot via an automated ground-based controller is also common.|$|E

40|$|Summary An {{important}} function of <b>perimeter</b> security <b>lighting</b> is to enable guards {{to detect and}} recognise possible intruders. The experiments presented here were designed to systematically assess the performance of guards at these two tasks. The behaviour of intruders was also studied. Two experiments were undertaken on a large open field on four clear, moonless nights. In the first experiment, eighteen guards tried to detect and to recognise one of four intruders walking along a known path. In the second experiment the guards tried to detect an intruder moving in an unspecified manner across the open field. In the first experiment, the intruders provided data on the locations where they believed they had been detected and recognised. Their ability to see an acuity target located at the guard’s position was also assessed. In the second experiment the intruders simply reported when they believed they had been detected. Both experiments were performed {{in the dark and}} under four different <b>perimeter</b> security <b>lighting</b> installations. Two light sources, low-pressure sodium and high-pressure sodium, and two lighting distributions, floodlighting and street lighting, were employed. The distances at which the guards detected and recognised the intruders were measured. The distances at which the intruders believed they had been detected and recognised were also measured.

5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would <b>light</b> up and <b>perimeter</b> <b>lights</b> around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|R

Meanwhile, a small Australian standing patrol that had deployed forward of the company main defensive position {{under the command of}} Private Walter Brunalli, observed the lights moving closer, east of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters. Two tanks had been positioned forward of the American positions, with a squad of infantry on the eastern approaches, and by midnight they had also reported sounds of movement and intermittent flashes of light through the trees. In the early morning of 24 February, just after midnight, sporadic firing was heard throughout the area. The forward American listening posts had detected small groups of Viet Cong moving outside the perimeter, killing two and forcing the remainder to withdraw into the darkness after one of the sentries opened fire. Glotzbach waited for the Viet Cong main effort, however, and withheld the bulk of the firepower at his disposal.|$|R
