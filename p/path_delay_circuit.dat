Pipelined interconnects have been proposed to address this problem, where long distance routes are pipelined using registers available in the configurable interconnect architecture.

We propose a test enrichment procedure that increases significantly the number of faults associated with the next-to-longest paths that are detected by a (compact) test set. This is achieved by allowing the underlying test generation procedure the flexibility of detecting or not detecting the faults associated with the next-to-longest paths.

It has been shown that the logic circuits used in the implementation of cryptographic algorithms leak side-channel information inspite of masking, which can be exploited, in differential power attacks. The phenomenon in CMOS circuits responsible for the leakage of masked circuits is known as glitching. Motivated by this fact, the authors analyse the effect of glitches in CMOS circuits against masked implementation of the AES S-box. The authors explicitly demonstrate that glitches do not affect always. There exists a relation between combinational <b>path</b> <b>delay</b> of the <b>circuit</b> and timing difference of input vectors to the circuit, which has a bearance on the amount of information leaked by the masked gates.

In this dissertation, I propose a high-precision and low-overhead embedded test structure, called REBEL, for measuring <b>path</b> <b>delays</b> in the <b>circuit</b> context. REBEL is minimally invasive to the design, as it leverages the existing scan structures, and easy to integrate because it can be completely automated within the DFT synthesis flow. The proposed embedded test structure and two of it's applications, namely <b>path</b> <b>delay</b> variability characterization and hardware Trojan detection, are verified in silicon. REBEL architecture for both level sensitive scan design (LSSD) and MUX-D scan designs are proposed and verified in 90 nm ASICs and 130 nm FPGAs respectively. The LSSD-based REBEL structure is integrated into a 32 -bit pipelined floating point unit (FPU), implemented in IBM's 90 nm technology, and the <b>path</b> <b>delay</b> measurements from 62 copies of the chip are used to analyze die-to-die and within-die variations. The MUX- D-based REBEL is integrated into a pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) design and wrapped with random built-in self test (BIST) architecture. The system is then implemented in Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro FPGAs and the data collected from 30 copies of FPGA are used to analyze the variability in <b>path</b> <b>delays.</b> As a second application, REBEL's effectiveness for detecting delay anomalies introduced by Hardware Trojans is demonstrated. Trojan emulation circuits, designed to model internal wire loads introduced by a hardware Trojan, are inserted into the design at multiple places. The emulation cell incorporates an analog control pin to allow a variety of hardware Trojan loading scenarios to be investigated. Using the hardware data collected from 62 chips fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, I demonstrate that REBEL can detect the small delay anomalies introduced by hardware Trojans. I evaluate the detection sensitivity of REBEL for detecting hardware Trojans using linear regression analysis, which deals with the chip-to-chip variation effectively and improves the detection sensitivity.
