25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the number of cunning folk across Britain had dropped markedly from that of a century before, and by the 1940s they had essentially vanished from the country. Despite this, other professional practitioners of popular magic, such as astrologers and fortune tellers, continued to remain popular. The historian Owen Davies believed that the primary reason for the decline in the cunning craft was the declining belief in the existence of malevolent witchcraft in the country (something brought about by modernization and increasing education and literacy rates), and therefore the collapse of any need for the anti-witchcraft measures that the cunning folk offered as their <b>primary</b> <b>service.</b> Whilst many of their magical practices continued to be used, being performed by folk and ceremonial magicians or being absorbed into new religious movements that used magic such as Wicca, Davies concluded that the actual profession itself died out. Historian Ronald Hutton however believed that it was more accurate to state that the cunning craft, rather than dying out, [...] "changed character" [...] by being absorbed into other magical currents. The decline of the cunning craft in Britain was not however indicative of other European nations: in Italy for example, cunning practitioners continued operating right into the early twenty-first century.|$|E

40|$|Background To {{develop a}} method to use survey data to {{establish}} catchment areas of primary care or <b>Primary</b> Care <b>Service</b> Areas. <b>Primary</b> Care <b>Service</b> Areas are small areas, the majority of patients resident in which obtain their <b>primary</b> care <b>services</b> from within the geography. Methods The data are from a large health survey (n = 267, 153, year 2006 - 2009) linked to General Practitioner service use data (year 2002 - 2010) from New South Wales, Australia. Our methods broadly follow those used previously by researchers in the United States of America and Switzerland, with significant modifications to improve robustness. This algorithm allocates post code areas to <b>Primary</b> Care <b>Service</b> Areas that receive the plurality of patient visits from the post code area. Results Consistent with international findings the median Localization Index or the median percentage of patients that obtain their primary care from within a <b>Primary</b> Care <b>Service</b> Area is 55 % with localization increasing with rurality. Conclusions With the additional methodological refinements in this study, Australian <b>Primary</b> Care <b>Service</b> Areas have great potential to be of value to policymakers and researchers...|$|R
