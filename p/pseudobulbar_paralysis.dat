40|$|Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), a {{neurologic}} disorder caused {{most frequently}} by rapid correction of hyponatremia, {{is characterized by}} demyelination that affects the central portion of {{the base of the}} pons. Central pontine myelinolysis occurs frequently in alcoholism and chronic liver disease. Clinical features usually reflect damage to the descending motor tracts and include spastic tetraparesis, <b>pseudobulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> and the locked-in syndrome. Cerebellar ataxia with out weakness and pyramidal signs is extremely unusual. There are only very few reports of central pontine myelinolysis presenting as cerebellar ataxia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} clinical data of 6 {{patients with}} {{central pontine myelinolysis}} (CPM). Among them 4 cases were male, 2 cases were female, with age 24 to 55 years old and average age 36 years old. Serious somatic diseases occured in all 6 cases. The main clinical manifestations included disturbance of consciousness, <b>pseudobulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> and flaccid paralysis. Cranial MRI showed all of the patients appeared symmetrical lesions in central pontine. After intravenous drip of glucocorticoids, 5 patients were improved.     DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 08. 013 </p...|$|E
40|$|Pathological {{laughter}} {{is defined as}} laughter arising with non-specific stimuli in absence of a corre-sponding change in affect, of a voluntary control of the extent or duration of the episode and of a corresponding change in mood lasting beyond the actual laughing (1). This condition has been described to date only {{as a consequence of}} central nervous system (CNS) lesions in several neurologi-cal disorders such as motor neuron disease, vas-cular <b>pseudobulbar</b> <b>paralysis,</b> extrapyramidal disorders, demyelinating diseases, gelastic epilepsy and fou rire prodromique (1). Lesion localization includes ventral and tegmental brainstem, hypo-thalamus, frontal and temporal cortex, striatocap-sular regions, basal ganglia, corticobulbar moto...|$|E
40|$|The opercular {{syndrome}} {{is also known}} as Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome and also as facio-labio-pharyngo-glosso-laryngo-brachial paralysis or the cortical type of <b>pseudobulbar</b> <b>paralysis.</b> This rare neurological entity generally develops secondary to cerebrovascular accidents affecting the bilateral opercular regions, usually as a result of subsequent strokes. In this paper, we describe a 74 -year-old woman who presented with acute onset of inability to speak and swallow. Neurological examination revealed bilateral palsy of lower motor cranial nerves with preservation of reflex and automatic movements. Magnetic resonance images of the brain demonstrated an acute left opercular infarction. This syndrome usually occurs due to bilateral opercular lesions, nevertheless, the typical features of the syndrome may develop as a result of unilateral opercular lesion.
