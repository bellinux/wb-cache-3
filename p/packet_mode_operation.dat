The SR/CA problem is often the bottleneck of any DS-SS-CDMA system operating in spread-Aloha random access mode for the common access channel or when <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> is envisaged. The single ASIC implementation provides a reliable, high-performance, low-cost, low-power consumption solution to such a problem. In particular, this paper explains how a parallel acquisition circuit can be effectively implemented on a single chip with a 1. 0 μm CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) technology, complying with the specifications of the ESA (European Space Agency) /Inisel Ku-band CDMA VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) system...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wireless network technologies, such as cellular networks, {{the demand for}} wireless data access is becoming a reality. Third-generation (3 G) technologies are set to enter {{the market in the}} very near future, allowing increased bandwidth and marking a shift from the circuit-switch mode characteristics of first and second-generation cellular networks to <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> <b>operation.</b> Future wireless networks (such as a future 4 G cellular system) are expected therefore to move towards an all-IP network, so that wireless networks {{become a part of the}} global Internet. Such an all-IP network has the potential to provide cost savings through simplified integration among different networks and enhanced service capabilities to a wide base of consumers. Given the wide deployment of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as the Transport Layer protocol in wired networks and the desire to allow internetworking between wired and wireless networks with minimal intervention from intermediate nodes, so that information can be accessed at any time without incurring major changes in existing infrastructure or disruption in performance, it makes sense to use TCP not only in the wired Internet but also in the wireless network. However, TCP is based on assumptions that are not valid in wireless environments, which leads to poor performance in wired-wireless networks. TCP performance problems exist not only due to the wireless channel characteristics but also due to mobility in cellular-based networks, as the mobile host (MH) hands off from one cell coverage area to the next. A considerable effort has been made in recent years to modify TCP for wireless and mobile environments. The protocol behaviour dependence on the particular packet loss characteristics (e. g. short duration vs long duration) and frequency of losses encountered makes the solutions studied to be targeted to the characteristics of a particular environment. Furthermore, the underlying network characteristics call for different approaches to be used depending on the level of support that can be obtained from the components of the network and its characteristics. Some works have shown that the TCP performance degradation is particularly serious in cases where a connection is lost for extended periods. Although a broader discussion of TCP performance problems and solutions is presented, it is on this specific type of problem that we focus our attention in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the issue of {{transferring}} diverse kinds of information through information-centric networks (ICNs). We argue that the one request per <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>operation</b> suggested in the early development of ICN applications is not a good fit for some types of traffic, such as media streams and real-time notifications. To efficiently deliver all kinds of information, we argue that an ICN should not only identify information by its name, it should also be aware of the nature of its traffic. We classify information traffic types based on two characteristics: a) reliable vs. unreliable transfer and b) real-time vs. on-demand delivery. The combination of these two characteristics leads to three broad categories: a) channels, b) on-demand documents and c) real-time documents. To handle all traffic types, we propose two extensions to the CCN architecture: Persistent Interests and Reliable Notifications. We describe how these additions, together with a careful selection of information names, can efficiently support these three categories of information traffic types...|$|R

However, it has been found that the power consumed during test <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> is often much higher than during normal <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> [1]. This is because most of the consumed power results from the switching activity in the nodes of the circuit under test (CUT), which is much higher during test mode than during normal <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> [1]–[3].

40|$|This thesis reports {{research}} {{undertaken to}} address the deficiencies that existing standardised cryptographic constructs exhibit when securing <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> wireless communication in WSN. The {{aim of the research}} is to devise innovative cryptographic frameworks, which will facilitate design and implementation of light-weight symmetric cryptographic modular constructs. Four cryptographic frameworks have been devised and block cipher based light-weight constructs using the frameworks have been designed and benchmarked against contemporary standard constructs. The constructs introduced in this dissertation, proved to be better suited to providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> data communication, in applications utilising wireless networks consisting of characteristically constrained nodes. The four proposed frameworks are: - The Zone-based framework for data packet integrity and authentication security services is proposed and described. The Quicker Block Chaining (QBC) family of message authentication constructs designed using the framework, are shown, via software simulation, to operate with better efficiency (i. e. uses fewer instruction cycles) than similar contemporary standard constructs and with a comparable level of security. - The Hybrid Encryption Mode (HEM) framework for data packet confidentiality security service is proposed and described. The HEM framework facilitated the design of constructs that provide probabilistic, randomising and tweakable encryption. - The Joint Cypher Mode (JCM) framework for authenticated encryption with associated-data (AEAD) security service is proposed and described. The range of constructs designed using the JCM framework, are shown, via software simulation and practical deployment, to Design and Analysis of Light-weight Symmetric Cryptographic Frameworks and Constructs for Secure <b>Packet</b> <b>Mode</b> Wireless Communication operate with better efficiency (i. e. uses fewer instruction cycles) than contemporary standard constructs. - The Joint Authenticated Combined Mode (JACM) framework for authenticate authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AAEAD) security service is proposed and described. The new AAEAD secure packet paradigm addresses a limitation and cryptographic protection failure of the standardised AEAD secure packet paradigm, in communication scenarios when untrustworthy intermediary forwarding nodes are utilised to authenticate and relay packets. The outcomes of the research undertaken are relevant to practitioners and cryptographic engineers that require symmetric cryptographic light-weight constructs for providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> communications. It is shown that the resulting light-weight symmetric cryptographic constructs are better suited to providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> wireless networked communication...|$|R

The gasifier-engine system is operated on diesel and on esters of vegetable oil of hingan in liquid fuel <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> and then on liquid fuel and producer gas combination in dual fuel <b>mode</b> <b>operation.</b> The performance and emission characteristics of the CI engine is analyzed by running the engine in liquid fuel <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> and in dual fuel <b>mode</b> <b>operation</b> at different load conditions with respect to maximum diesel savings in the dual fuel <b>mode</b> <b>operation.</b> It was observed that specific energy consumption in the dual fuel <b>mode</b> of <b>operation</b> is found to be in the higher side at all load conditions.

As the first theme, we investigate whether or not the fluid model based simulation is effective in simulating IEEE 802. 11 -operated wireless LANs, and to develop a fast simulation framework to expedite simulation, while not compromising the fidelity of simulation results. In spite of its effectiveness in terms of reducing the execution time, fluid model based simulation is not well-suited for studying the network behavior under light and/or sporadic traffic, as it is built upon the assumption {{of a large number of}} active flows in the network. To address the issue, we contrive network calculus based simulation as another main theme in the thesis. We firstly characterize how TCP congestion control interacts with AQM strategies with network calculus theory, and then determine a set of scheduling rules to regulate TCP traffic, and finally incorporate the rules into a network simulation engine to improve simulation performance. Although both fluid model based simulation and network calculus based simulation indeed give encouraging results, they cannot provide the packet level dynamics, such as the instantaneous queue length and packet dropping probability, due to the use of abstract simulation units, i. e., fluid rate and traffic amount. In order to address this issue, we propose hybrid simulation techniques, called mixed mode simulation, to discover packet level details of one <b>packet</b> <b>mode,</b> foreground flow, approximating all the other flows with theoretical model based, background flows. In the mixed <b>mode</b> framework, <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> simulation co-exists with theoretical model based simulation within one simulation framework, and therefore analytical models of specifying the interactions should be devised. Lastly, we also contrive a new rescaling simulation methodology (RSM) to simulate large scale IP networks with TCP and/or UDP traffic. Even though mixed mode simulation can produce packet level details, there exist the cases that all the network behaviors, inclusive of all the flows and all the networking points, should be inspected. The underlying idea of RSM based simulation is to reduce the computational cost by scaling down the network to tractable one that can be simulated for a short time interval to produce sufficient results at <b>packet</b> <b>mode,</b> and then to extrapolate the results expected from the original network with the obtained those. In order to give a guideline for both down- and up-scaling or to explain how to preserve the network properties unique in the original network within the down-scaled network, a rescaling model is contrived and presented...|$|R
