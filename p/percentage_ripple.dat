30|$|From Fig.  11, we can {{see that}} the active power ripple {{experienced}} by the proposed charger increases with the magnitude of the net active power of the grid. However, the reactive power ripple of the system does not exhibit similar characteristics as that of the active power ripple and its ripple fluctuates in a more random manner. Nevertheless, both active and reactive power ripples are relatively small, less than 700 W and 600 var respectively for maximum ripple experienced by the charger. Accordingly, the maximum active and reactive power <b>ripple</b> <b>percentages</b> are less than 7 % and 8 % respectively throughout all operating conditions, demonstrating the good performance of the charger and the MPC in place.

40|$|Abstract—A {{closed-loop}} {{scheme of}} high-conversion-ratio switched-capacitor (HCRSC) converter is proposed based on pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control for step-up conversion and regulation. In the HCRSC, there are totally 4 sets of seriesparallel SC cells between source Vs and output Vo, where each cell has 3 capacitors.

40|$|Abstract—A {{closed-loop}} {{scheme of}} high-conversion-ratio switched-capacitor bidirectional (HSCB) DC-DC converter is proposed based on pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control for step-up/down conversion and bidirectional power flow. In the HSCB DC-DC converter, {{there are two}} 3 -stage SC cells between HV bus (high-voltage DC side) and LV bus (low-voltage DC side), where each 3 -stage SC cell has 3 pumping capacitors and 6 bidirectional switches. One SC cell can provide the voltage gain of 3 (or 1 / 3) at most via capacitors charging in parallel (series) and discharging in series (parallel) cyclically. Based on the connection of these two SC cells, plus control of bidirectional power flow, this converter is able to boost the voltage at HV side up to 3 × 3 times voltage of LV supply source (step-up mode), or convert the voltage at LV side into 1 /(3 × 3) times voltage of HV supply source (step-down mode). In addition, the controller of HSCB converter contains HV/LV PWM block and phase generator. Here, PWM technique is adopted {{in order to enhance}} the output regulation for the different desired output.

40|$|The thesis {{has three}} main themes: {{analysis}} and optimal design of Cuk DC-DC converters; integration of Cuk DC-DC converters with photovoltaic (PV) modules to improve operation during partial shading; and an artificial intelligence {{model for the}} PV module, permitting an accurate maximum power point (MPP) tracking in the integrated system. The major contribution of the thesis is the control of an integrated photovoltaic module and DC-DC converter configuration for obtaining maximum power generation under non-uniform solar illumination. In place of bypass diodes, the proposed scheme embeds bidirectional Cuk DC-DC converters within the serially connected PV modules. A novel control scheme for the converters has been developed to adjust their duty ratios, enabling all the PV modules to operate at the MPPs corresponding to individual lighting conditions. A detailed analysis of a step-down Cuk converter {{has been carried out}} leading to four transfer functions of the converter in two modes, namely variable input - constant output voltage, and variable output - constant input voltage. The response to switch duty ratio variation is shown to exhibit a non-minimum phase feature. A novel scheme for selecting the circuit components is developed using the criteria of suppressing input current and output voltage <b>ripple</b> <b>percentages</b> at a steady state, and minimising the time integral of squared transient response errors. The designed converter has been tested in simulation and in practice, and has been shown to exhibit improved responses in both operating modes. A Neuro-Fuzzy network has been applied in modelling the characteristics of a PV module. Particle-Swarm-Optimisation (PSO) has been employed {{for the first time as}} the training algorithm, with which the tuning speed has been improved. The resulting model has optimum compactness and interpretability and can predict the MPPs of individual PV modules in real time. Experimental data have confirmed its improved accuracy. The tuned Neuro-Fuzzy model has been applied to a practical PV power generation system for MPP control. The results have shown an average error of 1. 35 % compared with the maximum extractable power of the panel used. - v - The errors obtained, on average, are also about four times less than those using the genetic-algorithm-based model proposed in a previous research. All the techniques have been incorporated in a complete simulation system consisting of three PV panels, one boost and two bidirectional Cuk DC-DC converters. This has been compared under the same weather conditions as the conventional approach using bypass diodes. The results have shown that the new system can generate 32 % more power.

40|$|The {{switching}} frequency of DC-DC conversion becomes higher as demands for downsizing andfast-response increase. At present, the {{switching frequency}} of an isolated DC-DC converter isabout 300 kHz to 500 kHz. PWM controllers are realized by using analog control ICs and someanalog parts. In recent years, {{the demands for}} more functions and capabilities are widelydiversified and sophisticated. To satisfy these demands, digitization of controllers has beenconsidered in academic and industrial worlds. In the practical use of DC-DC converters,characteristics of startup transient responses and dynamic load responses as well as output voltageresponses when the input voltage changing are of importance. Furthermore, in many applicationsof DC-DC converters, the loads and the input voltages cannot be specified in advance. Therefore,robust characteristics against loads and input voltage changes are necessary. Generally, the PIDcontrol {{is used for the}} digitization of the controller. The PID control is designed by trial and error,hence it is difficult to realize the robust characteristics. On the other hand, the H-infinity robustcontroller is of high-order, and its algorithm becomes too complex to implement. The robustcontroller with a simple algorithm is necessary for DC-DC converters. In this paper, an approximate 2 -degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) system is considered for controllers ofDC-DC converters. This system is obtained by constituting a model matching system and anapproximated inverse system and a first-order filter. The startup transient response is determinedby assigning dominant poles of model matching systems. The transfer characteristics from thedisturbance to the output are determined by one coefficient of first-order filter. Thus, the 2 DOFsystem is approximately realized. This system has robust characteristics, which can be realized bya simple algorithm. When applying this approximate 2 DOF controller to DC-DC converters, it isnecessary to improve the degree of approximation for stronger robustness. In this study, thecontrolled object is a forward converter whose switching frequency is 300 kHz. We propose adesign method for improving the degree of approximation of both first-order and second-orderapproximate models. The approximate 2 DOF digital controller is actually implemented on a DSPand is connected to the DC-DC converters. We make some simulations and experiments forexamining the startup transient responses and dynamic load responses as well as the output voltage responses when the input voltage changing. A good approximate 2 DOF controller isobtained by placing the poles of the approximate 2 DOF system so as not to approach the dominantpoles of model matching systems. It turns out that the characteristics are almost the same againstload changes and input voltage changes, and also that the experimental results are almost the sameas the simulation ones. The specifications are satisfied with the experiments and simulations. Thecontrol algorithm of the first order model is simpler than that of the second-order model. On theother hand, the second-order approximate model may improve the degree of approximation more. Therefore, the second-order approximate model may be used for the severer specifications. A higher switching frequency of DC-DC conversion is necessary so as to take fast-response andbetter robust characteristics. The resolution of digital PWM generators becomes lower as theswitching frequency becomes higher. Here exists an important problem of digitization ofcontrollers. Digital dither and delta-sigma modulation methods are proposed to improve thisproblem. These methods improve the resolution by averaging some switching periods. Therefore,low frequency ripples that are determined by a dither-pattern are superposed on the output voltage. The output voltage of the DC-DC converter must exist in a range of several <b>percentage</b> pointsincluding <b>ripple</b> noises, dynamic load responses, etc. Therefore, lower frequency ripples bydigitization should be as small as possible. In this study, the digital PWM resolution is improved by controlling the delay time of the PWMsignal. A delay time control system is realized by pulse-composite-circuits with two digital PWMgenerators. A method for determining control signals of two PWM generators is presented. It turnsout that the algorithm for designing both control signals are simple. The amplitude ofpulse-composite-circuits has a limit that is determined by the maximum duty cycle and switchingfrequency. In the case where the maximum duty cycle is 0. 6 and the switching frequency is 400 kHz, the amplitude is obtained as 1 / 32. The relationship between the PWM resolution and theA-D converter resolution is examined. If the PWM resolution is lower than the A-D converterresolution, the output voltage oscillates {{in the shape of a}} limit cycle, and big noises occur. Whenthe pulse composition technique is applied to the DPWM generator built-in DSP, an experimentalmodel is designed and manufactured. It turns out that the PWM resolution is improved up to 1 / 32 when the max duty cycle is 0. 6 and the switching frequency is 400 kHz, and that the limit cyclenoises disappear because the PWM resolution is higher than that of A-D resolution (10 bit). 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} thesis addresses the improvement of both rotor position sensored and sensorless Field Oriented Control (FOC) of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM) intended for Electric Vehicle (EV) propulsion applications. Three main contributions have been done on this subject. The details of each of them are given below. The first contribution {{is the development of}} a novel algorithm based on polynomial approximations (PA) for an efficient position error compensation of magnetic analog encoders (MAE) used in PMSMs for EV traction. The proposed PA algorithm requires a negligible memory space compared to a very high-resolution look-up table (LUT). The use of polynomials allows compensating every possible input rotor position without carrying out an interpolation or a rounding to the nearest quantized value. Advantageously, the polynomial coefficients are deduced from a calibration procedure that does not require an accurate and high-resolution position sensor for comparison and error-calculation purposes. The PA algorithm has been implemented to work in real time on a TM 4 EV drive controlling an 80 kW PMSM. The performance of the algorithm has been validated at 6000 and 9000 r/min under + 85 and ± 55 Nm of torque, respectively. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects have been minimized using a type- 2 phase-locked loop (PLL). The proposed PA algorithm assisted with the PLL is capable of reducing the total position error to a range as small as ± 0. 2 mechanical degrees. This error has been measured under steady state conditions. However, the transients from the PMSM operation do not deteriorate the achieved compensation given that the only parameters input to the PA algorithm are the voltage samples of the sine and cosine signals from the uncompensated encoder and they are independent of the operating point of the machine. The combination of the PA algorithm and the type- 2 PLL is a promising solution for compensating the position error from low-cost MAEs, thus allowing to achieve high-performance field-oriented control of PMSMs in EV applications. The characteristics of this high-performance PMSM-drive are the development of 1) Average torque with a small plausibility range for reducing the torque variation 2) Maximum torque with optimal stator currents to avoid wasting the energy from the battery and thereby extending the vehicle autonomy and 3) Small torque ripple generation for maximizing the torque-speed curve. By reducing the torque oscillations, the voltage ripple produced in the DC bus becomes smaller and the defluxing current variations are reduced, thus the DC bus voltage percentage utilization is increased and the based speed as well as the maximum operating speed are also extended. The higher the accuracy of the rotor position sensor, the lower the voltage, current and torque ripples and hence the closer to the full capacity and optimal operation of the machine-drive. The second contribution is the modeling and the analysis of the effects from the rotor position error in the performance of FOC-PMSMs for EV applications. A special focus is given to the torque ripple generated along the characteristic trajectories in the different operating regions of the PMSM. An extended and generalized model of the torque ripple produced by the PMSM {{as a function of the}} rotor position error has been analytically deduced. An infinite-speed interior-(I) PMSM drive and a finite-speed surface-mounted (SM) -PMSM drive are considered for the simulations carried out in MATLABSimPowerSystems. The experimental results have been validated with a TM 4 EV drive controlling an 80 kW SM-PMSM. The torque ripple has been evaluated for both motoring and regenerative braking operation modes under maximum torque conditions varying from 100 Nm at 1000 r/min up to 55 Nm at 9000 r/min. The obtained simulation and experimental results demonstrate the good accuracy of the proposed model for evaluating the torque ripple produced in PMSMs due to the error from the rotor position sensor. The simulation and experimental results obtained from the time- and frequency- domain analysis show that the influence of the rotor position error in the torque ripple generation is much significant than other causes such as the current sensor inaccuracy, the finite word-length (FWL) effect, the finite PWM resolution, the PWM switching, the inverter dead-time, the asymmetric stator phase resistance, the cogging effect, and the nonsinusoidal air-gap flux density. The compensation of the error from the rotary position sensor mounted on the 80 kW SMPMSM from TM 4 allowed reducing the equivalent torque <b>ripple</b> <b>percentage</b> to an interval between 1...|$|R
