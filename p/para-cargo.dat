50|$|The Croses EC-9 <b>Para-Cargo</b> is a 1960s French six-seat tandem-wing cargo-carrying homebuilt {{aircraft}} {{designed by}} Emilien Croses.|$|E
50|$|Developed {{from the}} earlier two-seat EC-6 Criquet and three-seat EC-8 Tourisme, the <b>Para-Cargo</b> was a cargo-carrying {{aircraft}} with a tailwheel landing gear and a tandem wing similar to the Mignet Pou-du-Ciel family. It could carry up to six persons or 450 kg (990 lb) of freight and was intended especially for carrying skydivers: the aircraft was equipped with a large side door that hinged inward and upward to facilitate skydiver egress. Another door {{at the rear of}} the fuselage was provided to allow oversize loads to be carried. Unlike other Croses tandem-wing designs that only used the Mignet Pou-du-Ciel system in which there was no aileron control but rather the rudder-driven yaw coupled through the dihedral to cause banking, some <b>Para-Cargo</b> aircraft had a conventional three-axis flight control system. At least two examples (F-ACVC and F-PYBC) had been built by 1965.|$|E
