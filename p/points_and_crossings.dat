40|$|This paper bounds the {{computational}} cost {{of computing}} the Kauffman bracket of a link {{in terms of}} the crossing number of that link.

From this it follows that the computation of the Kauffman bracket of the link takes time and memory a polynomial in n times 2 ^C√(n). ...|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{understanding}} the photophysics and photochemistry of thiated nucleobases has been awakened because of their possible involvement in primordial RNA or their potential use as photosensitizers in medicinal chemistry. The interpretation of the photodynamics of these systems, conditioned by their intricate potential energy surfaces, requires the powerful interplay between experimental measurements and {{state of the art}} molecular simulations. In this review, we provide an overview on the photophysics of natural nucleobases’ thioanalogs, which covers the last 30 years and both experimental and computational contributions. For all the canonical nucleobase’s thioanalogs, we have compiled the main steady state absorption and emission features and their interpretation in terms of theoretical calculations. Then, we revise the main topographical features, including stationary <b>points</b> <b>and</b> interstate <b>crossings,</b> of their potential energy surfaces based on quantum mechanical calculations and we conclude, by combining the outcome of different spectroscopic techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, with the mechanism by which these nucleobase analogs populate their triplet excited states, which are at the origin of their photosensitizing properties...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of obtaining a {{geometrical}} model of the wire frame of stent grafts, we propose three tracking methods to segment the stent's wire, and compare them in an experiment. A 2 D test image was created by obtaining a projection of a 3 D volume containing a stent. The image was modified to connect {{the parts of the}} stent's frame and thus create a single path. Ten versions of this image were obtained by adding different noise realizations. Each algorithm was started at the start of each of the ten images, after which the traveled paths were compared to the known correct path to determine the performance. Additionally, the algorithms were applied to 3 D clinical data and visually inspected. The method based on the minimum cost path algorithm scored excellent in the experiment and showed good results on the 3 D data. Future research will focus on establishing a geometrical model by determining the corner <b>points</b> <b>and</b> the <b>crossings</b> from the results of this method. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{backbone}} of the Estonian national route system, national main routes (põhimaanteed) make up a network of 1602 kilometres of road, amounting to 10% of the total road network. The traffic numbers however make up nearly 50% of the Estonian road network's traffic volumes. The highest AADT's are around Tallinn, on the T1 between Loo and Maardu, on the T2 between Tallinn and Jüri, and on the T4 between Laagri and Kanama (the highest AADT on Estonian national routes at 31 000).A main route {{is defined as a}} highway, that connects the capital with other large cities, connects large cities and the capital with major ports, railway <b>points</b> <b>and</b> border <b>crossings.</b> Currently there are 12 separate main routes. The main routes are marked with 1-2 white digits on a red shield. The main roads have no special prefix, as all Estonian roads have the prefix T.

40|$|Motivated by the Double Gyroid {{nanowire}} network {{we develop}} methods to detect Dirac <b>points</b> <b>and</b> classify level <b>crossings,</b> aka. singularities in {{the spectrum of}} a family of Hamiltonians. The approach we use is singularity theory. Using this language, we obtain a characterization of Dirac <b>points</b> <b>and</b> also show that the branching behavior of the level crossings is given by an unfolding of $A_n$ type singularities. Which type of singularity occurs can be read off a characteristic region inside the miniversal unfolding of an $A_k$ singularity. We then apply these methods in the setting of families of graph Hamiltonians, such as those for wire networks. In the particular case of the Double Gyroid we analytically classify its singularities and show that it has Dirac points. This indicates that nanowire systems of this type should have very special physical properties. Comment: 31 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The error is referred to as SCH phase and is expressed in degrees of subcarrier phase. For PAL, the definition of SCH phase is slightly different due to the more complicated relationship between the sync and subcarrier frequencies — the SCH phase relationship for a given line repeats only once every eight fields. Therefore, PAL SCH phase is defined, per EBU Technical Statement D 23-1984 (E), as “the phase of the +U component of the color burst extrapolated to the half-amplitude point of {{the leading edge of the}} synchronizing pulse of line 1 of field 1.” ...|$|R

40|$|The COLUMBUS Program System allows {{high-level}} quantum chemical calculations {{based on}} the multiconfiguration self-consistent field, multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles, and the multireference averaged quadratic coupled cluster methods. The latter method includes size-consistency corrections at the multireference level. Nonrelativistic (NR) and spin-orbit calculations are available within multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). A prominent feature of COLUMBUS is the availability of analytic energy gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for NR MRCI. This feature allows efficient optimization of stationary <b>points</b> <b>and</b> surface <b>crossings</b> (minima on the crossing seam). Typical applications are systematic surveys of energy surfaces in ground and excited states including bond breaking. Wave functions of practically any sophistication can be constructed limited primarily {{by the size of}} the CI expansion rather than by its complexity. A massively parallel CI step allows state-of-the art calculations with up to several billion configurations. Electrostatic embedding of point charges into the molecular Hamiltonian gives access to quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics calculations for all wave functions available in COLUMBUS. The analytic gradient modules allow on-the-fly nonadiabatic photodynamical simulations of interesting chemical and biological problems. Thus, COLUMBUS provides a wide range of highly sophisticated tools with which a large variety of interesting quantum chemical problems can be studied. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{leading to}} dual fluorescence in substituted benzene derivs. is discussed using N-Ph pyrrole (PP) {{as a test}} mol. A model based on the quasi-Jahn-Teller distortion of the charge transfer (CT) state of PP, {{similar to that of}} the benzene anion radical, is presented. The model helps to locate stationary points on the S 1 singlet excited state potential surface, and to construct an energy level diagram. The energy and structure of the quasi Jahn-Teller degeneracy which is between S 3 and S 2 are computed, as well as those of three conical intersections connecting S 1 and S 2. The findings indicate a complex nature of the S 1 state electronic state, contg. several local min., stationary <b>points</b> <b>and</b> surface <b>crossings.</b> The major structural change responsible for the stabilization of the CT state is the ring quinoid deformation which is a main component of the energy difference gradient vector in the branching space of all S 1 /S 2 conical intersections. In the resulting charge transfer state (which is of quinoid structure) the pyrrole ring can either rotate to form a stabilized twisted species, or remain planar depending on substitution. This result holds also for DMABN and other mols. in which the donor is a substituted amine moiety. It is concluded, in line with a recent study on DMABN that the TICT and PICT models are not mutually exclusive, but two different manifestations of the same phys. reality...|$|R
