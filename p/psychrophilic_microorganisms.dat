The <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> exhibit an optimum temperature of less than 25 degreesC. The anaerobic purification takes place as single- or two-step methanization process. The biomass is suspended in the wastewater and is immobilized in a bioreactor (111). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The municipal wastewater purification comprises anaerobic biological purification of the wastewater by using a biomass (15 - 100 g/l) from <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> concentrating the sludge by separating the wastewater and feeding back the sludge into the anaerobic biological purification. The <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> exhibit an optimum temperature of less than 25 degreesC. The anaerobic purification takes place as single- or two-step methanization process. The biomass is suspended in the wastewater and is immobilized in a bioreactor (111). The sludge is concentrated through micro filtration by means of rotation disk filters. Phosphorus precipitates and nitrogen are eliminated from the wastewater after the supply into the anaerobic biological purification. The nitrogen elimination takes place via exchange of the ammonium nitrogen at the zeolite. The zeolite loaded with ammonium-nitrogen is regenerated with regeneration solution. The ammonium-nitrogen {{is removed from the}} regeneration solution through air stripping and ammonia is received from the solution. The regeneration solution is again used partly after the air stripping for the regeneration of the zeolite. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a procedure for the production of biogas from wastewater; and (2) a device for the anaerobic biological purification of wastewater. USE - For purifying municipal wastewater. The <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are useful for the production of biogas in the wastewater purification and for anaerobic biological wastewater purification (claimed).

Until recently, {{most of the research}} on polar microorganisms was confined to studies of polar diatoms, yeast, fungi and cyanobacteria. However, within the past three decades, extensive studies have been conducted to understand the bacteria and archaea that inhabit the Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice, glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost and the cryptoendolithic, cryoconite and ice-bubble environments. These investigations have resulted in the discovery of many new genera and species of anaerobic and aerobic microbial extremophiles. Exotic enzymes, cold-shock proteins and pigments produced by some of the extremophiles from polar environments have the potential to be of great benefit to Mankind. Knowledge about microbial life in the polar regions is crucial to understanding the limitations and biodiversity of life on Earth and may provide valuable clues to the Origin of Life on Earth. The discovery of viable microorganisms in ancient ice from the Fox Tunnel, Alaska and the deep Vostok Ice has shown that microorganisms can remain alive while cryopreserved in ancient ice. The psychrophilic lithoautotrophic homoacetogen isolated from the deep anoxic trough of Lake Untersee is an ideal candidate for life that might inhabit comets or the polar caps of Mars. The spontaneous release of gas from within the Anuchin Glacier above Lake Untersee may provide clues to the ice geysers that erupt from the tiger stripe regions of Saturn s moon Enceladus.

Para tanto, foram empregadas técnicas de tipagem visando a diferenciação das espécies e subespécies envolvidas neste tipo de deterioração. Foram analisadas 36 amostras tufadas de carnes brasileiras, 6 amostras tufadas oriundas do Reino Unido e 12 amostras experimentais tufadas de carne de cervo provenientes da Ilha Norte da Nova Zelândia. Foram utilizados três pares de primers, o RFP/RRP, o 16 SEF/ 16 SER e o par EISRF/EISRR para C. estertheticum estertheticum e Clostridium estertheticum like e um para C. gasigenes (16 DBF/ 16 DBR). As amostras com os resultados positivos ao PCR foram enviadas para a microbiologia convencional para isolamento do Clostridium estertheticum.

Three pairs of primers, the RFP / RRP, the 16 SEF/ 16 SER and the pair EISRF / EISRR were used for C. estertheticum estertheticum and Clostridium estertheticum like, and one for C. gasigenes (16 DBF/ 16 DBR). The samples with the PCR results were sent to a microbiology laboratory for conventional isolation of Clostridium estertheticum. It was concluded that Clostridium estertheticum estertheticum is responsible for the deterioration of meat and hence the blown pack in the UK. Samples of blown pack Brazilian meat have Clostridium estertheticum like as primary causal agent. The typing was carried out in isolates and strains - donated by Mirinz Center / Ruakura Agresearch / Hamilton / New Zealand - together with two isolates from Brazil, involved in this type of deterioration. The selected techniques AFLP and RFLP - PCR were able to distinguish species and subspecies of psychrophilic and psychrotrophic clostridia. However, the AFLP showed the highest discriminatory power, being able to distinguish 100 % of the species - C. estertheticum, C. frigoris, C. bowmani, C. lacusfryxellense and C. psychrophylum - and also the subspecies C. estertheticum estertheticum, C. estertheticum laramiense, C. estertheticum like k 21 and k 24. Through the technique of RFLP, it was possible to differentiate the species of clostridia psychrotrophic, psichrophilic and also the subspecies C. estertheticum estertheticum and Clostridium estertheticum like, along with the use of four restriction endonucleases - AluI, CfoI, TaqI and HaeIII. The HaeIII provided greater variety of fragments and the ability to differentiate the species of clostridia psychrophilic and psychrotrophic, whereas TaqI was the only enzyme capable of differentiating the subspecies of C. estertheticum estertheticum and C. estertheticum laramiense of C. estertheticum like. The Brazilian samples isolated fit into the group of Clostridium estertheticum like, although there is no confirmation of the absence of Clostridium estertheticum estertheticum in the country...|$|R

In anoxic methane- and sulphide-rich environments, microbes may have unique adaptations for metal acquisition and utilization because of decreased bioavailability {{as a result}} of metal sulphide precipitation. However, micronutrient cycling is largely unexplored in cold (≤[*] 10 °C) and sulphidic (>[*] 1 [*]mM ΣH_(2) S) deep-sea methane seep ecosystems. We investigated trace metal geochemistry and microbial metal utilization in methane seeps offshore Oregon and California, USA, and report dissolved concentrations of nickel (0. 5 – 270 [*]nM), cobalt (0. 5 – 6 [*]nM), molybdenum (10 – 5600 [*]nM) and tungsten (0. 3 – 8 [*]nM) in Hydrate Ridge sediment porewaters. Despite low levels of cobalt and tungsten, metagenomic and metaproteomic data suggest that microbial consortia catalysing anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) utilize both scarce micronutrients in addition to nickel and molybdenum. Genetic machinery for cobalt-containing vitamin B_(12) biosynthesis was present in both anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate-reducing bacteria. Proteins affiliated with the tungsten-containing form of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase were expressed in ANME from two seep ecosystems, the first evidence for expression of a tungstoenzyme in <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Overall, our data suggest that AOM consortia use specialized biochemical strategies to overcome the challenges of metal availability in sulphidic environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{photosynthetic}} microorganisms from the Lake Untersee samples showed dispersed distribution of phototrophs within ~ 80 m water column. Lake Untersee represents a unique ecosystem that experienced complete isolation: sealed by the Anuchin Glacier for many millennia. Consequently, its biocenosis {{has evolved over}} a significant period of time without exchange or external interaction with species from other environments. The major producers of organic matter in Lake Untersee are represented by phototrophic and chemolithotrophic microorganisms. This is the traditional trophic scheme for lacustrine ecosystems on Earth. Among the phototrophs, diatoms were not found, which differentiates this lake from other known ecosystems. The dominant species among phototrophs was Chlamydomonas sp. with typical morphostructure: green chloroplasts, bright red round spot, and two polar flagella near the opening. As expected, the physiology of studied phototrophs was limited by low temperature, which defined them as obligate <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> By the quantity estimation of methanogenesis in this lake, the litho-autotrophic production of organic matter is competitive with phototrophic production. However, pure cultures of methanogens {{have not yet been}} obtained. We discuss the primary producers of organic matter and the participation of our novel psychrophilic homoacetogen into the litho-autotrophic link of biomass production in Lake Untersee...|$|E
40|$|Cold-adapted enzymes are {{generally}} derived from <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> and have features {{that make them}} very attractive for industrial and biotechnological purposes. In this work, we identified a 50 kDa extracellular protease (MP 10) from the Antarctic isolate Pseudomonas sp. AU 10. The enzyme was produced by recombinant DNA technology, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and partially characterized. MP 10 is an alkaline thermosensitive serine-metallo protease with optimal activity at pH 8. 0 and 40 ℃, {{in the presence of}} 1. 5 mM Ca 2 +. MP 10 showed 100 % residual activity and stability (up to 60 min) when incubated with 7 % of non-ionic surfactants (Triton X- 100, Tween- 80 and Tween- 20) and 1. 5 % of the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. The 3 D MP 10 structure was predicted and compared with the crystal structure of mesophilic homologous protease produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 01 (reference strain) and other proteases, showing similarity in surface area and volume of proteins, but a significantly higher surface pocket area and volume of MP 10. The observed differences presumably may explain the enhanced activity of MP 10 for substrate binding at low temperatures. These results give insight to the potential use of MP 10 in developing new biotechnologically processes active at low to moderate temperatures, probably with focus in the detergent industry...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione (GSH) is {{the major}} {{antioxidant}} molecule in most living organisms. Besides its protective role in contrasting oxidative free radical species and in the removal of toxic metals, GSH is involved in redox homeostasis and cell signaling; furthermore, {{it is essential to}} maintain cellular proteins in their reduced state and acts as a post-translational regulator of protein function. The synthesis of GSH from its constituent amino acids involves two ATP-requiring enzymatic steps catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GshA) and glutathione synthetase (GshB), respectively. Its biosynthetic route has been described in details for a variety of organisms; however, nothing is known about this process in <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> In particular, although various GshBs have been purified and sequenced, none of these enzymes belong to an organism living at low temperatures. Very recently, a recombinant form of GshB from the cold-adapted bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhGshB) has been purified. The activity of PhGshB was assayed through a direct method, measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from radiolabelled ATP. PhGshB is active at 10 °C and its activity significantly increases with temperature, at least up to 30 °C; the Km for ATP ranges between 0. 14 and 0. 25 mM in the 10 – 30 °C interval. The crystal structure of PhGshB has been determined and refined at 2. 3 Ǻ resolution. Structural information is combined with a characterization of the thermal stability of the enzyme performed by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. A comparison between our data and those obtained for the closely related GshB from the mesophilic Escherichia coli [1 - 3], sharing 69...|$|E
40|$|The {{inability}} of <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> {{to grow at}} moderate temperatures (> 20 degrees C) presently represents an unresolved thermodynamic paradox. Here we report for the psychrophilic yeast Rhodotorula aurantiaca A 19, isolated from Antarctic ice, that the inability to grow at temperatures close to 20 degrees C is associated with profound alterations in cell morphology and integrity. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the intracellular acyl-CoA esters revealed an abnormal accumulation of myristoyl-CoA (C 14 -CoA) in cells cultivated close to the nonpermissive temperature. Its concentration (500 microm) {{was found to be}} 28 -fold higher than in cells cultivated at 0 degrees C. If one considers its ability to disrupt membrane bilayers and to inhibit many cellular enzymes and functions, intracellular myristoyl-CoA accumulation in the psychrophile R. aurantiaca represents one of the principal causes of growth arrest at moderate temperatures. Intracellular acyl-CoA concentrations are believed to be regulated by thioesterase activity. Thus in an attempt to explore the mechanism by which temperature disrupts myristoyl-CoA metabolism, we isolated and characterized a long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase. The monomeric 80 -kDa thioesterase from the psychrophilic yeast shows a very strong specificity for myristoyl-CoA. The affinity for substrate and the catalytic efficiency of the thioesterase are optimal below 5 degrees C (temperatures habitually experienced by the strain) and dramatically decrease with increasing temperature. The loss of affinity for substrate is related to the intracellular increase of myristoyl-CoA concentration. Our observations reveal one of the probable mechanisms by which temperature fixes the limit of growth for this psychrophilic yeast. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Two novel genes {{encoding}} {{for heat}} and solvent stable lipases from strictly anaerobic extreme thermophilic bacteria Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus (LipTth) and Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. tengcongensis (LipCst) were successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity by heat precipitation, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography. Unlike the enzymes from mesophile counterparts, enzymatic activity was measured at a broad temperature and pH range, between 40 and 90 °C and between pH 6. 5 and 10; the half-life of the enzymes at 75 °C and pH 8. 0 was 48  h. Inhibition was observed with 4 -(2 -aminoethyl) -benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and phenylmethylsulfonylfluorid indicating that serine and thiol groups {{play a role}} in the active site of the enzymes. Gene sequence comparisons indicated very low identity to already described lipases from mesophilic and <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> By optimal cultivation of E. coli Tuner (DE 3) cells in 2 -l bioreactors, a massive production of the recombinant lipases was achieved (53 – 2200  U/l) Unlike known lipases, the purified robust proteins are resistant against a large number of organic solvents (up to 99 %) and detergents, and show activity toward a broad range of substrates, including triacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols, esters of secondary alcohols, and p-nitrophenyl esters. Furthermore, the enzyme from T. thermohydrosulfuricus is suitable for the production of optically pure compounds since it is highly S-stereoselective toward esters of secondary alcohols. The observed E values for but- 3 -yn- 2 -ol butyrate and but- 3 -yn- 2 -ol acetate of 21 and 16, respectively, make these enzymes ideal candidates for kinetic resolution of synthetically useful compounds...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{widespread}} diffusion of areas characterized by permanent low temperatures (e. g. deep-sea waters, mountains and polar regions), <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> {{have the largest}} terrestrial distribution. Adaptation of microbial life at low temperatures requires some changes, mainly {{at the level of}} cell membrane components (including transport systems), proteins and nucleic acids. Psychrophilic organisms produce enzymes functioning in coldenvironment and simply denaturing at high temperature. Suchcold-active enzymes have a more flexible structure to undergo the conformational changes necessary for catalysis with a lower energy demand. Owing to their high catalytic activity at low temperatures, low thermostability and unusual specificities, cold-active enzymes offer novel opportunities for biotechnological exploitation. The enormous potential of biocatalysts for the production of enantiopure products of industrial interest remains to beexploited, especially in the area of enantioselective alkene reductions, due to their marked regio- and stereo-selectivity. One of the emerging reductive chemistry is the asymmetric reductionof alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds through microbialwhole-cells rich in enoate reductase (ER), a flavin-dependentenzyme belonging to the ‘old yellow enzyme’ (OYE) family. Even though massive screenings for yeasts as reducing catalystshave been carried out so far, there is still a need for new biocatalysts able to performing highly stereoselective reactions. Consequently, the potential of yeast biocatalysis appears to be still far from being fully explored. In this study we report the results of a screening on facultative psychrophilic yeasts (belonging to the species Cryptococcus gilvescens and Cryptococcus gastricus) for new cold-adapted enoate reductases using (4 S) -(+) -carvone as a model substrate. The preliminary results obtained using growing cells demonstrate that the ERs activities are apparently expressed to a greater extent inpsychrophilic yeasts with respect to the mesophilic ones. In particular, C. gastricus exhibited the better biocatalytic performances. The results obtained by using other catalytic forms (resting orlyophilized cells) will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Temperature has {{critical}} {{impact on}} food quality and safety within food supply chain, therefore, food {{should be kept}} at the defined storage temperature range. Final consumer should be assured when buying food about actual temperature and thermal history of the selected food product {{and this is why}} it should be indicated on the packed or prepacked item. The chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain was prepared from suitable active material packed in the properly structured holder. When temperature rises above the defined storage temperature, the active material changes colour and physical state (solid/liquid). Simultaneously, special packaging structure enables irreversible recording of the time exposed to the elevated temperature. The active material was made of thermochromic composite, consisting of dye, developer and solvent. It changes colour at its melting point, being coloured below and discoloured above it. The temperature is called activation temperature of the composite. Its value was adjusted by appropriate solvent and additives used for preparation of the composite, to reach the desired value. The temperature dependent colour change of the composite was determined by colorimetric measurements. The conditions for best observation of the change by naked eye were also examined. The structure of the active material’s holder was analyzed for best displaying of the time spend at high temperature (above the activation temperature). Functioning of the indicator was examined with growth of pathogens as a function of migration of the active material at temperature above the required storage temperature of the food. It was found out that the described chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain shows the thermal history of food storage by colour-, phase- and migration changes of the active composite material and consequently would be reliable as indicator in cold food chain to indicate temperature abuse and would disclose potential growth of <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>microorganisms...</b>|$|E
