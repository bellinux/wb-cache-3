40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological studies {{worldwide}} {{have shown}} that A. fumigatus exhibits important phenotypic and genotypic diversity, and these findings have been of great importance in improving the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases caused by this fungus. However, few studies have been carried out related to the epidemiology of this fungus in Latin America. This study´s aim is to report on the epidemiology of the fungus by analyzing the phenotypic variability of Aspergillus section Fumigati isolates from different Latin American countries and the relationship between this variability, the geographical origin and genotypic characteristics. Methods We analyzed the phenotypic characteristics (macro- and micromorphology, conidial size, vesicles size, antifungal susceptibility and thermotolerance at 28, 37 and 48 °C) of A. section Fumigati isolates from Mexico (MX), Argentina (AR), <b>Peru</b> (<b>PE)</b> and France (FR). The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison test to detect significant differences. Two dendrograms among isolates were obtained with UPGMA using the Euclidean distance index. One was drawn for phenotypic data, and the other for phenotypic and genotypic data. A PCoA was done for shown isolates in a space of reduced dimensionality. In order to determine the degree of association between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics AFLP, we calculated the correlation between parwise Euclidean distance matrices of both data sets with the nonparametric Mantel test. Results No variability was found in the macromorphology of the studied isolates; however, the micromorphology and growth rate showed that the PE isolates grew at a faster rate and exhibited the widest vesicles in comparison to the isolates from MX, AR and FR. The dendrogram constructed with phenotypic data showed three distinct groups. The group I and II were formed with isolates from PE and FR, respectively, while group III was formed with isolates from MX and AR. The dendrogram with phenotypic and genotypic data showed the same cluster, except for an isolate from FR that formed a separate cluster. This cluster was confirmed using PCoA. The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic data of the isolates revealed a statistically significant association between these characteristics. Conclusions The PE isolates showed specific phenotypic characteristics that clearly differentiate them {{from the rest of the}} isolates, which matches the genotypic data. The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics showed a statistically significant association. In conclusion, phenotypic and genotypic methods together increase the power of correlation between isolates. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rainbow trout is a {{globally}} important {{fish species}} for aquaculture. However, fish for most farms worldwide {{are produced by}} only a few breeding companies. Selection based solely on fish performance recorded at a nucleus may lead to lower-than-expected genetic gains in other production environments when genotype-by-environment (G × E) interaction exists. The aim was to quantify the magnitude of G × E interaction of growth traits (tagging weight; BWT, harvest weight; BWH, and growth rate; TGC) measured across 4 environments, located in 3 different continents, by estimating genetic correlations between environments. A total of 100 families, of at least 25 in size, were produced from the mating 58 sires and 100 dams. In total, 13, 806 offspring were reared at the nucleus (selection environment) in Washington State (NUC) and in 3 other environments: a recirculating aquaculture system in Freshwater Institute (FI), West Virginia; a high-altitude farm in <b>Peru</b> (<b>PE),</b> and a cold-water farm in Germany (GER). To account for selection bias due to selective mortality, a multitrait multienvironment animal mixed model was applied to analyze the performance data in different environments as different traits. Genetic correlation (rg) of a trait measured in different environments and rg of different traits measured in different environments were estimated. The results show that heterogeneity of additive genetic variances was mainly found for BWH measured in FI and PE. Additive genetic coefficient of variation for BWH in NUC, FI, PE, and GER were 7. 63, 8. 36, 8. 64, and 9. 75, respectively. Genetic correlations between the same trait in different environments were low, indicating strong reranking (BWT: rg = 0. 15 to 0. 37, BWH: rg = 0. 19 to 0. 48, TGC: rg = 0. 31 to 0. 36) across environments. The rg between BWT in NUC and BWH in both FI (0. 31) and GER (0. 36) were positive, which was also found between BWT in NUC and TGC in both FI (0. 10) and GER (0. 20). However, rg were negative between BWT in NUC and both BWH (– 0. 06) and TGC (– 0. 20) in PE. Correction for selection bias resulted in higher additive genetic variances. In conclusion, strong G × E interaction was found for BWT, BWH, and TGC. Accounting for G × E interaction in the breeding program, either by using sib information from testing stations or environment-specific breeding programs, would increase genetic gains for environments that differ significantly from NUC...|$|R
