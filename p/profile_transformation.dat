40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work has been to {{investigate}} how well transformation methods work as a method to get realistic inlet boundary conditions to a draft tube without using excessive amounts of computational resources. The mesh supplied for the Francis- 99 workshops was cut and modified to prepare it for the use with ANSYS CFX transformation methods. Transient simulations at BEP were conducted on the modified mesh containing one guide vane, one runner blade + splitter and the draft tube using the <b>profile</b> <b>transformation</b> method. The results were compared to results from a simple draft tube simulation, a TRS simulation, LDV measurements and experimental pressure measurements.

Current model transformation languages provide appropriate support for standard MDE scenarios such as model-to-model transformations specified between metamodels. However, for other transformation scenarios often the escape to predefined APIs for handling specific model manipulations is required such {{as is the case}} for supporting UML <b>profiles</b> in <b>transformations.</b> Thus, the need arises to extend current transformation languages for natively supporting such additional model manipulations. In this paper we report on extending ATL for natively supporting UML <b>profiles</b> in <b>transformations.</b> The extension is realized by providing an extended ATL syntax comprising keywords for handling UML profiles which is reduced by a preprocessor based on a Higher-Order Transformation (HOT) again to the standard ATL syntax. In particular, we elaborate on our methodology of extending ATL by presenting the extension process step-by-step as well as reporting on lessons learned. With this experience report we aim at providing design guidelines for extending ATL as well as stimulating the research of providing further extensions for ATL...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{velocity}} {{has been}} recognized as a key variable in thermoplastic injection molding. Its closed-loop control is, however, difficult due {{to the complexity of}} the process dynamic characteristics. The basic requirements of the control system include tracking of a predetermined injection velocity curve (defined by a velocity profile), load rejection, and robustness. It is difficult for a conventional control scheme to meet all of these requirements. Injection velocity dynamics are first analyzed in this paper. Then, a novel double-controller scheme is adopted for the injection velocity control. This scheme allows an independent design of set-point tracking and load rejection and has good system robustness. The implementation of the double-controller scheme for injection velocity control is discussed. Special techniques such as <b>profile</b> <b>transformation</b> and shifting are also introduced to improve the velocity responses.

In the research process of the precessional gears profile appeared the problem of finding the geometrical error between fabricated profile and the ideal one after grinding process.

Processing technology of these specific gear wheels is one that still has many unknowns, therefore will be researched the part that {{is related to the}} occurrence of deviations from the ideal profile. The manufacturing of processing device and its elements also lead to geometric deviation of the profile, which will lead to adverse effects during operation.

The computational method is to find a better methodology to transform a file obtained from 3 D scan (precessional gear wheel), which can be used only as a “copy”, into a file with functional extension.

Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 The contact {{mechanics}} of a tire {{in contact with}} randomly rough surfaces {{has been the subject}} of intensive investigations during the last century because of the dependence of wear to parameters such as temperature, humidity or loading. The purpose of this research has thus been to study the behavior of four different rubber compounds to four parameters, namely the shearing rate, the loading, the ground roughness and the sculpture, by the means of compression/shear tests. The testing environment has been simplified by considering only a rubber tread block and by neglecting the flattening effect during tire rolling of the tire. Because of the complexity of a 3 D FEA model would require, a numerical 2 D model of the test has been proposed so as to simulate and replicate the behavior of these rubber compounds, where both the viscoelastic and hyperelastic response of the materials are considered and where a meticulous analysis has been conducted on the 3 D- 2 D ground <b>profile</b> <b>transformation.</b> Validation of the model’s hypotheses have been obtained by direct comparison with the experimental set up results and show to be in good agreement.

40|$|The linearized time-harmonic Navier-Stokes solver LINNEA {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} the forcing of a rotor blade in the transonic compressor Hulda, at part speed. Hulda is a 1 ½ stage demonstrator compressor consisting of a variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV), rotors, stators and outlet guide vanes (OGV). The forcing of the rotor is evaluated for different setting angles of the VIGV. The mesh study shows that, for this computational setup, a mesh independent solution was obtained in RANS simulation using CFX and in the linearized Navier-Stokes solver LINNEA for the same grid resolution. The results obtained using LINNEA are compared to results from three URANS simulations using CFX. The first URANS case uses scaled geometries and rotational periodic boundary conditions. The second and third case use the true geometry in conjunction with rotational periodic boundary conditions: “profile transformation” and with time-lagged periodic boundary conditions: “time transformation” in CFX’ nomenclature, which corresponds to time-inclined computational planes. LINNEA is run with two different boundary conditions at the inlet to the rotor domain, obtained from a RANS and URANS simulation, respectively. The forcing is evaluated at engine orders 15, 30 and 45, corresponding to VIGV passing frequency and multiples thereof. The results show that the amplitude of the tangential force variation calculated with the different methods and boundary conditions, is within a 1. 3 % interval based on the total tangential force for the nominal (0 degree) VIGV setting and within a 3. 3 % interval for the VIGV setting angle of 30 degrees at engine order 15. Using a linear time-harmonic Navier-Stokes solver to calculate forcing of a rotor blade interacting an upstream component is shown to be a possible and attractive alternative to URANS calculations. A linear harmonic simulation is less computationally demanding than a URANS simulation. The mean flow solution required by the linearized solver does not incur any additional computational effort since it is usually already available from general performance calculations. Further is shown that for URANS analyses a scaling of the model can be neglected since results obtained for a scaled model are in good agreement with results obtained for an unscaled model using <b>profile</b> <b>transformation</b> (PT) to handle the variation of pitch between components...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence and genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in faecal Escherichia coli isolates from healthy broiler chickens and compare these data with isolates obtained from hospitalized patients in Jamaica. Results Eighty-two E. coli strains isolated from faecal samples of broiler chickens and urine and wound specimens of hospitalized patients were analyzed by agar disc diffusion to determine their susceptibility patterns to 11 antimicrobial agents. Tetracycline resistance determinants were investigated by plasmid <b>profiling,</b> <b>transformations,</b> and amplification of plasmid-borne resistance genes. Tetracycline resistance occurred at a frequency of 82. 4 % in avian isolates compared to 43. 8 % in human isolates. In addition, among avian isolates there was a trend towards higher resistance frequencies to kanamycin and nalidixic acid (p E. coli. Tetracycline resistance was mediated by efflux genes tet B and/or tet D. Conclusion The present study highlights the prevalence of multiple drug resistant E. coli among healthy broiler chickens in Jamaica, possibly associated with expression of tetracycline resistance. While there did not appear to be a common source for multiple drug resistance in the strains from avian or human origin, the genes encoding resistance are similar. These results suggest that genes are disseminated in the environment and warrant further investigation of the possibility for avian sources acting as reservoirs for tetracycline resistance. </p...|$|R
