5000|$|Syndicated {{programs}} {{broadcast by}} KSBI [...] include Law and Order: Criminal Intent, The King of Queens, Supreme Justice with Judge Karen, Access Hollywood Live, King of the Hill and Dr. Phil. In {{addition to its}} primary affiliation with the MyNetworkTV programming service, KSBI is designated as an alternate CBS affiliate, and carries network programs that KWTV-DT must <b>preempt</b> <b>to</b> carry extended breaking news or severe weather coverage or special event programming (the station is not currently used to run select CBS programs that are not cleared to air on KWTV's main channel, with that responsibility continuing to be delegated to its parent station's News 9 Now subchannel). Since the programming service consists of off-network reruns, KSBI may also broadcast MyNetworkTV programs on tape delay to air in the late prime time or late fringe slots (to fulfill contractual advertising makegoods), {{in the event that}} the station carries CBS network programs normally carried on KWTV or sporting events.|$|E
50|$|On July 24, 2012, Hearst Television and Weigel Broadcasting {{announced}} that the former had renewed its existing affiliation agreement to carry the Weigel-owned classic television network MeTV; in addition to maintaining relationships with eight existing Hearst-owned affiliates through 2015, Hearst also agreed to add the network on digital subchannels of KOCO-TV and its sister stations in Boston, Baltimore, Sacramento and Greensboro. In preparation, Family Broadcasting Group, then-owner of independent station KSBI (channel 52, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), acquired the local rights to the This TV affiliation. Although KSBI began carrying the network on its DT2 subchannel on September 17, 2012, it was forced to share the Oklahoma City affiliation rights to This TV with KOCO-DT2, as the latter's contract to carry MeTV was not set to begin for another two weeks. KOCO-DT2 formally became a MeTV affiliate on October 1, 2012, at which time, KSBI became the market's exclusive This TV affiliate. KOCO-DT2 is also designated as an alternate ABC affiliate, and carries network (and occasionally, syndicated) programs that KOCO must <b>preempt</b> <b>to</b> carry extended breaking news or severe weather coverage or special event programming on its main channel (due to technical limitations, ABC and syndicated programs shown on KOCO-DT2 are transmitted in an anamorphic 16:9 image within the subchannel's 4:3 aspect ratio).|$|E

40|$|In many situations, {{timing is}} crucial [...] {{individuals}} face a trade-off between gains from waiting versus {{the risk of}} being <b>preempted.</b> <b>To</b> examine this, we offer a model of clock games, which we then test experimentally. Each player's clock starts upon receiving a signal about a payoff-relevant state variable. Since the timing of the signals is random, clocks are de-synchronized. A player must decide how long, if at all, to delay his move after receiving the signal. We show that (i) delay decreases as clocks become more synchronized, and (ii) when moves are observable, players "herd" immediately after any player makes a move. Our experimental results are broadly consistent with these two key predictions of the theory. Clock games Experiments Currency attacks Bubbles Political revolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Round Robin (RR), one of {{the oldest}} CPU {{scheduling}} algorithms has found its importance in time sharing systems. In an ideal RR an equal quantum time is allocated to each process residing in the ready queue. A process which is assigned a CPU may run to completion if and only if its quantum time is greater than its CPU burst. Otherwise, after the process exhausted its quantum time the process must be <b>preempted</b> <b>to</b> take turn in the next round. Some major challenges in classical RR are: poor response time, unnecessary context switching and poor multiprogramming. Using Half Life Variable Quantum Time Round Robin (HLVQTRR), variable quantum time is used to eliminate those challenges. All dataset used for the evaluation are generated using normal distribution function...|$|R

In this paper we investigate {{the effectiveness of}} preemptive disk-scheduling algorithms to achieve better quality of service (QoS) in RAID systems. We present an architecture for QoS-aware RAID systems that use Semi-preemptible IO for servicing internal disk IOs. We show when and how <b>to</b> <b>preempt</b> IOs <b>to</b> improve the overall performance of the RAID system. We evaluate the benefits and estimate the overhead of our approach using a preemptible RAID simulator that we have implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One common {{approach}} to self-adaptive systems is to incorporate a control layer that monitors a system, supervisorily detects problems, and applies adaptation strategies to fix problems or improve system behavior. While such approaches {{have been found}} to be quite effective, they are typically limited to carrying out a single adaptation at a time, delaying other adaptations until the current one finishes. This in turn leads to a problem in which a time-critical adaptation may have to wait for an existing long-running adaptation to complete, thereby missing a window of opportunity for that adaptation. In this paper we improve on existing practice through an approach in which adaptations can be <b>preempted</b> <b>to</b> allow for other time-critical adaptations to be scheduled. Scheduling is based on an algorithm that maximizes timerelated utility for a set of concurrently executing adaptations. self-adaptation; preemption; utility; concurrency I...|$|R
