In the past, pump <b>port</b> <b>cap</b> fasteners were installed to a torque of 33 Nm (300 in-lb). However, the structural analyses used a significantly higher nut factor than indicated during tests conducted by Boeing Space Systems. When the torque values were reassessed using Boeing's nut factor, the fastener preload had a factor of safety of less than 1, with potential for overloading the joint. This paper describes how behavior was determined for a preloaded joint with a steel bolt threaded into steel inserts in aluminum parts. Finite element models were compared with test results. For all initial bolt preloads, bolt loads increased as external applied loads increased. For higher initial bolt preloads, less load was transferred into the bolt, due to external applied loading. Lower torque limits were established for pump <b>port</b> <b>cap</b> fasteners and additional limits were placed on insert axial deformation under operating conditions after seating the insert with an initial preload...|$|R

30|$|For {{accurate}} {{monitoring of}} ICP via the EVD system, the mounted transducer must be positioned and maintained {{at the level}} of the foramen of Monroe or, anatomically, the external auditory meatus (EAM) (Zhong et al. 2003). The accuracy of ICP readings therefore becomes dependent upon patient positioning in relation to the transducer (Zhong et al. 2003; Brain Trauma Foundation 2007). Accuracy of readings also depends upon periodically opening the transducer to atmospheric pressure and returning it to a zero reference point (Schimpf 2012). Hospital protocols differ in the frequency with which EVDs need to be zeroed, but the zeroing procedure typically occurs during each patient care shift, following patient transport, and as a troubleshooting measure when ICP readings or associated waveforms are in question.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the appearance, temperature distribution, and NOx emission index of two inverse diffusion flames, one with circumferentially arranged <b>ports</b> (<b>CAPs)</b> {{and the other with}} co-axial (CoA) jets, both burning LPG with 70 % butane and 30 % propane. Flame appearances were investigated first with a fixed fueling rate at different airflow rates equivalent to air jet Reynolds numbers (Re) of 1000 to 4500; and then at a fixed airflow rate with different fueling rates equivalent to overall equivalence ratios (Φ) of 1. 0 to 2. 0. The CAP flame is found to consist of two zones: a lower entrainment zone and an upper mixing and combustion zone. The CoA flame in most cases is similar to a diffusion flame. The two-zone structure can be observed only at Re larger than 2500. The temperature distributions of the flames are similar at overall equivalence ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 2 for Re= 2500, except that the corresponding CoA flame is longer. The flame temperature is higher in the CAP flame than the CoA flame at higher overall equivalence ratios. A measurement of centerline oxygen concentrations shows that the oxygen concentration reaches a minimum value at a flame height of 50 mm in the CAP flame but decreases more gradually in the CoA flame. It can be concluded that there is more intense air-fuel mixing in a CAP flame than the CoA flame. Investigation of the emission index of NOx (EINOx) for both flames at Re= 2500 and overall equivalence ratios of 1. 0 to 6. 0 reveals that the EINOx curve of each flame is bell-shaped, with a maximum value of 3. 2 g/kg at Φ= 1. 2 for the CAP flame and 3 g/kg at Φ= 2. 2 for the CoA flame.

40|$|Solar Turbines Gas Compressor Engineering Division of San Diego, California {{called upon}} the Mechanical Engineering {{students}} of California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo to provide recommendations for optimization of compressor end <b>cap</b> <b>port</b> design. Various sizes of compressors have end <b>caps</b> with numerous <b>ports</b> that exchange fluids between {{the inside and}} outside of the working fluid pressure vessel. Because so many ports must exist on the end caps, unusual flow paths are created to supply the appropriate location within the compressor. These flow paths commonly consist of a drilled inlet hole which intersects with a sudden expansion. The sudden expansion is deemed the “fly cut” because of its semicircular shape. Sudden expansions in general cause very high energy losses in fluid flow. This is one of the primary concerns when designing the compressor end <b>cap</b> <b>port</b> layout. Due to the unusual nature of the fly cuts found in Solar Turbines’ end caps, published information on the pressure losses for this particular flow path do not exist. For this reason, Solar Turbines were required to base their port design on the best information available, including: historical compressor design methods, conservative design analysis estimates, and computational fluid mechanics software. Of these options, the computational method could provide the best estimate but only if validated experimentally. In response to this problem, PreFlow Systems was formed and investigated the solution of designing, building, and testing a scaled experimental test apparatus. This report outlines the details involved in every aspect of the project, including: technical specifications and objectives, design conceptualization, engineering analysis, manufacturing, testing, and results. Each of these phases was crucial in creating the final flow test apparatus which simulated the gas port flow of Solar Turbines’ compressor end caps.

Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet <b>port</b> on <b>cap</b> opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|R
40|$|The thermoresistometer Mastia {{consists}} of a main vessel in which thermal treatments are applied, a motor to enable the homogenisation of the heating medium, a main control unit to control heating, sampling and agitation, an external pressure source and a fraction collector to allow for sampling in short duration experiments. The main control unit consists in a program logic controller (PLC). The main vessel, of 400 ml capacity, is built in stainless steel (8, 5 cm outer diameter × 12 cm high) with a screw cap with O-ring. This cap has an agitation shaft with a teflon (PTFE) friction bearing with a propeller, and 8 <b>ports</b> with screw <b>caps</b> to hold: the pressure source (N 2); the inoculum injection port with a gas chromatography septum; the sampling tube; a thermocouple (Pt 100) to monitor the temperature during heat treatment; two ports to hold the two branches of the electric heating element; and another two ports to hold the two branches of the coil of the cooling system. Inside the vessel, attached to the removable cap {{there is also a}} deflector screen to improve turbulence. The agitation shaft is powered by a variable speed agitation motor, wired to the PLC. The sampling tube is also built in stainless steel. There are interchangeable tubes of different inner diameter, from 0. 5 to 2 mm. The sampling tube is prolonged on its end by a silicone tube, that is closed in the outer extreme by means of a solenoid valve, that was also wired to the PLC. The opening time of the sampling valve can be controlled by a timer through the PLC. Keeping a constant pressure inside the vessel and a constant opening time of the sampling tube along an experiment, enables to get samples of the same volume through all the experiment The control of the temperature inside the thermoresistometer is also done by the PLC, by means of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) connected to the electric heating element, to a solenoid valve that regulates the flow of water through the cooling system, and to the Pt 100. When the PID detects that the temperature is below the setpoint, the PLC powers the electric heating element; when is above the setpoint, the PLC acts on the solenoid valve to control the flow of cold water through the coil. The instrument can be programmed to perform isothermal experiments, non-isothermal experiments at a linearly increasing or decreasing temperature and more complex, industry-like experiments, composed of several steps combining isothermal and non-isothermal periods. The PLC is connected to a tactile screen, that allows communication with the PLC and can be connected to a computer provided with Scada software that enables to program and/or register temperature profiles. The main vessel may be pressurised to permit sample extraction at low internal pressure (below 100 ºC) or when medium is too viscous. To overcome the pressure when the microorganisms are injected inside the vessel, a Hamilton-type syringe may be used. The fraction collector enables to take samples at time intervals lower than 2 seconds. Collector speed can be adjusted, allowing for up to 32 samples per second. for each treatment time are collected (by pressing a switch in the tactile screen) manually into sterile test tubes. The timer in the PLC has been previously set at an appropriate aperture time of the sampling valve (according to the pressure into the main vessel and the required sample volume). Samples are then appropriately diluted and immediately plated and incubated. The instrument can also be operated in continuous. This operating mode consistes in preheating the thermoresistometer with water at a preset temperature and circulating the microbial suspension through the coil, by means of a peristaltic pump at a controlled flow. For this purpose the coil is sterilised in situ previously. Temperature of the sample is taken {{at the end of the}} coil. In this way, very rapid heating ramps, and heating ramps followed by a holding period, similar to those on continuous food sterilisation and pasterisation treatments, can be performed. In this mode only end-point determinations can be performed. The thermoresistometer Mastia has been developed in the laboratories of the Food Technology group at the Technical University of Cartagena. The thermoresistometer Mastia enables to estimate heat resistance under isothermal and non-isothermal heating conditions as well as more complex heating profiles, like those usually applied in the food industry. Its design allows to work with liquid heating media such as buffers, liquid foods or foods containing small particles. It also allows to inoculate microorganisms or compounds and to obtain samples in order to study the changes on the quantity or the quality of these substances along with the thermal treatment. In this way, the intensity of the thermal treatments applied can be calculated and, as a consequence, the microbiological safety and nutritional quality of the food produces obtained can be estimated. With this technological offer we try to collaborate with licence agreement and comercial agreement with technical assistance. Improvements in the thermoresistometer Mastia enable simulation of complex heating and cooling profiles, continuous and in batch, with monitoring of the temperature. It enables to estimate heat resistance of other components of foods or additives, apart from microorganisms. The main application of this technology is for the food industry, to study the heat resistance of microorganisms involved in the spoilage of heat treated foods, such as canned foods, fruit juices, milk, baby products, ect. In this sense, it can be used to test if heat treatments applied to foods are sufficient to ensure their stability and safety. It can also be used to test nutritive quality of heat treated foods. Eventually, it could be of interest for other industries that deal with liquid media exposed to thermal treatment...|$|R
