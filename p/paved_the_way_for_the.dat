5|$|The Birmingham {{campaign}} {{was a model}} of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South.

The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E

Bhima Kavi's work, a biography of Basavanna, is an important Veerashaiva purana. It was inspired by earlier biographies of Basavanna by the Hoysala poet Harihara (the author of the first biographical narrative poem of the protagonist's life called Basavaraja Ragale) and the Telugu writings of Palkuriki Somanatha of the 13th century. Bhima Kavi humbly acknowledges and eulogises his predecessors in a writing full of well-known personalities.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E

In the Olive Grove of Kountouras in Messenia, they confronted an army of around 5,000 Peloponnesian Greeks {{under the command of}} a certain Michael. In the ensuing battle, the Crusaders emerged victorious, forcing the Byzantines to retreat and crushing resistance in the Peloponnese. This battle <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foundation of the Principality of Achaea.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{served as}} {{chancellor}} at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term {{coincided with a}} relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students' freedom of expression that had begun under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the University had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted.

5|$|The 1915 mutiny was a {{watershed}} {{event in the}} way that the British viewed security in their Malayan colonies. More importance than ever was placed on political intelligence, espionage, and the surveillance of potential subversives. Following the mutiny, a political intelligence bureau was established in Singapore under direct command and control of Major General Dudley Howard Ridout, General-Officer-Commanding (GOC) Singapore. This eventually <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Criminal Intelligence Department (Special Branch) was set up in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of coal {{by the community}} in the early 19th century <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed Erie Canal. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840. Local industrialist David Tod, who was later Ohio governor during the Civil War, persuaded Lake Erie steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.|$|E

5|$|A new Belarusian {{constitution}} {{enacted in}} early 1994 <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Six candidates {{stood in the}} first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform. Shushkevich and Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zyanon Paznyak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes. Lukashenko won {{the second round of}} the election on 10 July with 80.1% of the vote. Shortly after his election, he addressed the State Duma of the Russian Federation in Moscow proposing a new Union of Slavic states, which would culminate in the creation of the Union State in 1999.|$|E

5|$|After {{a troubled}} {{pre-production}} characterized by legal disputes, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures emerged with the franchise's property rights in early 1990. This <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{completion of the}} screenplay by a Cameron-led production team, and the October 1990 start of a shortened 186-day filming schedule. The production of Terminator 2 required a $102 million budget making it the most expensive film made up to that point. Much of the film's massive budget was spent on filming and special effects. The film was released on July 3, 1991, {{in time for the}} U.S. Independence Day weekend. In 2017, Terminator2 was re-released in 3D, 4K resolution for AMC and Cineplex theaters. The re-released debuted at number one in the United Kingdom during the weekend of its release.|$|E
5|$|Avril Lavigne is {{considered}} a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Hey Monday, among others as being a direct result. She was compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and {{earned a reputation as}} the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and also as one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style. Songs like Sk8er Boi, He Wasn't and Girlfriend are frequently listed {{as one of the best}} pop-punk songs of all time, by different critics.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt.

5|$|From 25–30 July, the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council (HVO) troops {{attacked}} Serb-held territory {{north of}} Mount Dinara, capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč during Operation Summer '95. That offensive <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> military recapture of occupied territory around Knin, as it severed the last efficient resupply route between Banja Luka and Knin. On 4 August, Croatia started Operation Storm, {{with the aim}} of recapturing almost all of the occupied territory in Croatia, except for a comparatively small strip of land, located along the Danube, at a considerable distance from the bulk of the contested land. The offensive, involving 100,000 Croatian soldiers, was the largest single land battle fought in Europe since World War II. Operation Storm achieved its goals and was declared completed on 8 August.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood itself did {{not open}} until October 2004, after lengthy {{construction}} delays and running over budget. The Scottish Parliament has {{a form of}} proportional representation (the additional member system), which normally results in no one party having an overall majority. The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved this in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The success of the SNP in achieving {{a majority in the}} Scottish Parliament <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence.

5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass <b>paved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
