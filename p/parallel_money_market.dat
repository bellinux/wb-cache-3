Indeed, bank regulation so far has largely been by “suasion”, with no formal framework for bank examination and inspection. There seems now, however, to be an awakening interest {{in the possibility of}} a more comprehensive regulation of financial institutions, {{due in part to the}} splitting off a “secondary” banking system, and the emergence of a complex of <b>parallel</b> <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> The present work analyses the regulation and control of the banking and financial structure in the United Kingdom. The author first briefly considers the extent of relevant legislation that is currently found on the statute books. The main objectives of any comprehensive legislation to regulate banks and similar financial institutions are then outlined. Finally, the appropriate legislation to achieve such objectives is considered. JEL: G 18, G 28 </div...|$|R

40|$|Since 2007, the {{financial}} crisis and the credit crunch had a big impact {{in the global world}} on the <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> Most <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates rose rapidly and became unstable such as London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Most central banks and governments made some series of monetary policies to control and affect their <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates. Moreover, a number of papers documented and concluded the close relationship between some monetary factors and <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates. These factors were used as intermediary instruments by central banks to control and affect <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> However, there was no analysis about the detailed relationship and strength between them. And there was no comparison about different <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> Which factors were the efficient instruments to transmit the central banks’ expectations of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates was valuable to figure out. In different <b>money</b> <b>markets,</b> those factors were same or different to the <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates. This dissertation chose two of the world’s most powerful economies. One is the UK {{which is one of the}} oldest and strongest developed countries. The other is the China which is the younger and fast economic developing countries. There must be some similarities and differences in their <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> and monetary policies. This dissertation used OLS method to estimate time series regression for analysing the relationship between the interbank rate and its determinants. This dissertation selected the observations for the time period from 2007 to 2011 which is the global financial crisis. Finally, this dissertation found that official central-bank benchmark rate was a significant and powerful factor to determine and affect the interbank rate in both UK and China. Furthermore, UK’s <b>money</b> <b>market</b> was more independent than China’s <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> There were less factors to determine and affect the UK’s interbank rate (LIBOR) than the China’ interbank rate (SHIBOR). In the future, the central banks not only intervene in their <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> at some special time but also keep their money markets’ independence at most usual time. Thus, the <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> will have a positive and healthy development. Therefore, China has a long way to pass in financial system and monetary policy compared with UK...|$|R

40|$|Large {{banks and}} dealers use and reuse {{collateral}} pledged by nonbanks, which helps lubricate {{the global financial}} system. The supply of collateral arises from specific investment strategies in the asset management complex, with the primary providers being hedge funds, pension funds, insurers, official sector accounts, <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> and others. Post-Lehman, {{there has been a}} significant decline in the source collateral for the large dealers that specialize in intermediating pledgeable collateral. Since collateral can be reused, the overall effect (i. e., reduced ?source'' of collateral times the velocity of collateral) may have been a $ 4 - 5 trillion reduction in collateral. This decline in financial lubrication likely has impact on the conduct of global monetary policy. And recent regulations aimed at financial stability, focusing on building equity and reducing leverage at large banks/dealers, may also reduce financial lubrication in the nonbank/bank nexus.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} examine the {{operation}} of an Islamic inter-bank <b>money</b> <b>market</b> (IIMM), within a dual banking system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes Malaysia's Islamic IIMM. It then examines {{some of the key}} risks associated with <b>money</b> <b>market</b> functions. An empirical examination {{of the extent to which}} yields in the IIMM are correlated with conventional <b>money</b> <b>market</b> yields is undertaken. The implication of this on interest-rate exposure for the Islamic financial sector is discussed. Finally, the paper looks at some of the challenges and offers conclusions. Findings – The paper argues that even though an Islamic <b>money</b> <b>market</b> operates in an interest-free environment and trades Shariah-compliant instruments, many of the risks associated with conventional <b>money</b> <b>markets,</b> including interest-rate risks are relevant. The empirical evidence, based on Malaysian data, points to Islamic <b>money</b> <b>market</b> profit rates/yields that are highly correlated and move in tandem with conventional <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates. Given the dynamics of fund flows and cross-linkages, an IIMM operating within a dual banking system cannot sterilize itself from interest-rate risks. In fact, the paper argues that such an IIMM may actually enhance interest-rate risk transmission to the Islamic banking sector, by providing additional channels of transmission. Ironical as it may be, the operations of an IIMM in a dual banking system may serve to bring the Islamic banking sector into closer orbit with the conventional sector. Originality/value – The paper offers insights into the IIMM, focusing on Malaysia. Banking, Islam, Malaysia, <b>Money</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
