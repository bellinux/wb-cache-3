5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff conceded eight runs—Goddard's {{boundary}} and {{the four}} no-balls—from his solitary over and the tourists were eventually out for 346. Meckiff did not bat in the second innings of the weather-interrupted match; Australia declared at 1/144 before South Africa reached 1/13 when the match ended as a draw. After his single over, Meckiff's participation in the match was limited to his fielding, during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings. He retired from all forms of cricket {{at the end of}} the game, but continued to <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> his bowling action was fair.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to the balcony and start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor into his face. The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies {{on the ground in}} her own blood as the photographers continue take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> her career is over. According to Rolling Stone this scene pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E

25|$|Jeremiah {{was called}} to prophetic {{ministry}} c. 626BC. Jeremiah was called by YHWH to give prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction that would occur by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had been unfaithful {{to the laws of}} the covenant and had forsaken God by worshiping Baal. The people of Israel had even gone as far as building high altars to Baal in order to burn their children in fire as offerings. This nation had deviated so far from God that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> the nation of Judah would be faced with famine, plundered and taken captive by foreigners who would exile them to a foreign land.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Later Cholas, there are alleged to have been {{instances}} of intolerance towards Vaishnavites especially towards their acharya, Ramanuja. Kulothunga CholaII, a staunch Shaivite, is said to have removed a statue of Vishnu from the Shiva temple at Chidambaram, though there are no epigraphical evidences to support this theory. There is an inscription from 1160 that the custodians of Shiva temples who had social intercourses with Vaishnavites would forfeit their property. However, this is more of a direction to the Shaivite community by its religious heads than any kind of dictat by a Chola emperor. While Chola kings built their largest temples for Shiva and even while emperors like Rajaraja CholaI held titles like Sivapadasekharan, in none of their inscriptions did the Chola emperors <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> their clan only and solely followed Shaivism or that Shaivism was the state religion during their rule.|$|E

Wei Jiansu was severely injured and nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion and refused to leave, even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to disperse. Chen publicly urged him to put Consort Yang to death — which he initially declined. After Wei Jiansu's son Wei E (韋諤) and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally agreed. He had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangle her. After he showed the body to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the soldiers finally dispersed and prepared for further travel. Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong's wife Pei Rou (裴柔), son Yang Xi (楊晞), the Lady of Guo, and the Lady of Guo's son Pei Hui (裴徽) tried to flee, but were killed. Consort Yang was buried at Mawei, without a coffin, but with masses of fragrance wrapped in purple blankets.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the '30s FUPDM {{concentrated}} on social programs {{that would benefit}} lower-class women, advocating for rent reductions of market stalls, and lowered taxes and utility rates. These programs earned the group a large following and their pressure, {{with the support of}} President Lázaro Cárdenas, resulted in the ratification in 1939 by all 28 Mexican states of an amendment to Article 34 of the Constitution granting enfranchisement to women. The Mexican Congress refused to formally recognize the ratification or <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> the change was in effect. The years from 1940–1968 were predominantly a period of inactivity for feminists as World War II shifted the focus to other concerns. There were scattered gains, most specifically, women finally acquired the right to vote. In 1952, the FUPDM had organized the Alianza de Mujeres Mexicanas (Mexican Women's Alliance) and made a deal with candidate Adolfo Ruiz Cortines that they would support his presidential bid in exchange for suffrage. Ruiz consented to the arrangement if Alianza could secure 500,000 women's signatures on a petition asking for enfranchisement. When Ruiz was elected, Alianza delivered the signatures and as promised, women were granted the right to vote in federal elections in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E

25|$|Emma {{learns that}} Merida needs the wisp {{in order to}} restore her family’s kingdom and save her triplet younger {{brothers}} who were kidnapped by the United Clans of her country after they refused to let her rule as queen. After they make camp for the night, the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tries to guide Emma into betraying Merida once they reach {{the home of the}} wisps. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tells Emma that once Merida speaks into the Wisp, it will continue to do her bidding until she dies, and thus, the only solution would then be for Emma to kill her. Merida overhears the conversation, and sneaks off to the Hill of Stones by herself. Emma catches up with her in the morning and is goaded by Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, against her better judgment and good nature, to rip Merida's heart out. Before Emma can crush the heart, Hook appears with the others and stops her. Once everything has settled down, Mary Margaret hands Emma the dagger; however, Emma, believing that carrying the dagger would give her too much power, wants someone else to possess it. She decides to give the dagger to Regina, since she would be the only one capable of killing Emma if necessary. Moments later, King Arthur and some of his knights arrive on horseback in order to <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> they have been awaiting Emma's arrival. Arthur believes that Emma will be able to reunite them with Merlin, and everyone involved joins forces on their quest en route to Camelot.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, Emperor Xuanzong's train reached Mawei Station (馬嵬驛, {{in modern}} Xianyang, Shaanxi). The {{imperial}} guards were not fed and were angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen {{also believed that}} Yang Guozhong provoked this disaster and planned to kill him—and reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng's eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitated and gave no approval. Meanwhile, though, emissaries of the Tibetan Empire, who had followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong and complaining that they were also not fed. The imperial guard soldiers took this opportunity to <b>proclaim</b> <b>that</b> Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tibetan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (楊暄), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was also nearly killed, but was spared {{at the last moment}} with severe injuries.
