Methods The present study was a descriptive, retrospective and cross-sectional study. The data of the study were obtained by retrospectively reviewing records of written complaints to <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> units and on-site solutions between 2004, the year of establishment of these units, and 2008. Results The incidence of written and verbal complaints were calculated to be 23. 1 in 100 000 and 137. 9 in 100 000, respectively. The increase was 102. 2 % for on-site solutions, whereas it was calculated as 97. 8 % for written applications. It was noticed that the rate of violation judgements was high (42. 5 % (17 / 40)) in the first year the Edirne State Hospital <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> committee was established. Conclusions Possible problems encountered during the presentation of health services can be solved by the implementation of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> under the legislative guarantee. The implementation of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> should be considered as reflections of a socialised government on health services. The focus of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> is to provide health services to individuals using their health rights under circumstances that are in conformity with human rights. Health-related rights can be summarised as the right of sustaining and improving well-being and regaining lost health. This is one of the main elements of health rights. 1 e 3 <b>Patient</b> <b>rights</b> date back to theMagna Carta when <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> were considered to be an extension of human rights.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> in healthcare, special {{attention has been given}} to the concept of <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran. Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter has been compiled with a novel and comprehensive approach. This charter aims to elucidate rights of recipients of health services as well as observing ethical standards in medicine. This paper presents the Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter. Based on a study done from 2007 to 2009, the charter has been finalized through an extensive consultation involving all stakeholders, patients, physicians, nurses, lawyers, patient associations and health policy makers. The developed charter was adopted by the Ministry of Health in December 2009. Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter has been formulated in the framework of 5 chapters and 37 articles including vision and an explanatory note. The five chapters concern right to receiving appropriate services, right to access desired and enough information, right to choose and decide freely about receiving healthcare, right to privacy and confidentiality, and finally right to access an efficient system of dealing with complaints which have been explained in 14, 9, 7, 4 and 3 articles, respectively.   The paper concludes that, adopting the <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter is a valuable measure to meet patient's rights; however, a serious challenge is how to implement and acculturate observing <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> in practice in our healthcare system in Iran...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the level of}} knowledge of inpatients at Erciyes University Hospitals on <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> and the impacts of some factors on this level. Material and Methods: A sample group of 733 adult patients was randomly selected from various clinics of Erciyes University Hospitals except psychiatry and paediatrics clinics. These patients were visited at the clinics by the researchers and were applied a face to face questionnaire which was prepared by the researchers. Results: Only 27. 6 % of the study group was aware of Regulation on <b>Patient</b> <b>Rights</b> and 5 % stated that they read this regulation. The least known <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> were; to change health personnel, to refuse the interventions, to stop the intervention which he/she accepted before and to forbid to give information to the relatives about the illness. Mean knowledge score on <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> was 70. 4 ± 16. 7. The knowledge levels were higher among males than females, among secondary or over educated patients than lower educated individuals and among the patients who read the Regulation than the patients who didn't read.

40|$|Summary Objective: <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> {{are defined}} as the rules of conduct between the people who benefit from health {{services}} and the health institutions and personnel who provide them. As the protection and provision of these rights {{are closely related to}} the nursing trade, these professionals must have thorough knowledge about this issue. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the acquaintance and attitudes of working nurses in Corum/Turkey regarding <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> and to create the basis for a planned educational program. Methods: sample selection was not performed in this study, but all nurses (n= 939) who were working in the course of this study constituted the sample. Survey forms were used as data collection tools. Results: the study revealed that 92. 3 % had received education about <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> 2. 2 % had never heard anything about this term and 86. 6 % became aware of it through sources from outside of school. It was established that the attitudes of nurses regarding <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> differ for every patient and that this rate ranges from 35. 8 to 98. 1 %. Conclusion: there is a requirement for more studies on the subject of <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> as they play an important role in the development of health services. In that regard, <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> centers should be established and carried out according to the foreseen model set by national and international health systems. Studies aiming to teach health personnel, patients and their relatives about <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> must be carried out...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nowadays, <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> {{particularly}} receiving favorable {{health care}} based on modern knowledge, informed consent, and privacy, are important issues {{in health care}} delivery systems. Organizational learning is considered an important factor influencing health care quality and <b>patient</b> <b>rights.</b> However, {{there is little evidence}} regarding this issue. Objective: The present study was conducted to explore the role of organizational learning in <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> from clinical nurses’ viewpoint. Design: This qualitative study was conducted through conventional content analysis. In total, 18 nurses who met the inclusion criteria participated in this study through purposive sampling with maximum variation. Data were gathered through 20 in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation was achieved. Data collection also included constant and simultaneous comparative analyses.

40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Patient’s</b> <b>rights</b> {{are one of}} the pivots {{to define}} the {{standard}} clinical care programs. <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter has been compiled and applied for defending human rights, protecting honor and dignity of patient, and ensuring that patients receive treatment without discrimination especially in case of medical emergencies. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contents of <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter with those of the Holy Quran and Ahadith. Methods: To conduct this library, descriptive study, first, the principles of the Charter were drawn and then the Quran and relevant literature indexed in different databases were reviewed. Then, the points in question were written down, classified, and compared to those of the Charter. Results: In general, the principles of the Charter represented in nine terms which were consistent with several verses of the Quran and Ahadith. These terms consisted of human dignity, justice and avoidance of injustice, beneficence, knowledge value, moral virtue, privacy and confidentiality, ownership, authority, and life-saving and life-sustaining. Conclusion: All of the concepts of <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter can generally conform to the verses of Holy Quran and Ahadith. Since religious beliefs can play effective role in performance of health care professionals regarding <b>patient's</b> <b>rights,</b> it is recommended to apply the Quranic proofs of the <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter, which are in line with the Charter, for better performance.  ...|$|R
