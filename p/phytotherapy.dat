25|$|Prostatitis is {{inflammation}} of the prostate gland. There are primarily four different forms of prostatitis, each with different causes and outcomes. Two relatively uncommon forms, acute prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis, are treated with antibiotics (category I and II, respectively). Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome (category III), which comprises about 95% of prostatitis diagnoses, is treated by a large variety of modalities including alpha blockers, physical therapy, psychotherapy, antihistamines, anxiolytics, nerve modulators, <b>phytotherapy,</b> , surgery, and more. More recently, a combination of trigger point and psychological therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well.

40|$|Malaria, {{caused by}} parasites {{of the genus}} Plasmodium, {{is one of the}} leading {{infectious}} diseases in many tropical regions, including Nigeria, a West African country where transmission occurs all year round. Many of the inhabitants use plants as remedies against fever and other symptoms of acute malaria, as reported herein. Some of these plants have their antimalarial efficacies scientifically demonstrated and the active compounds isolated with their probable mechanisms of action studied. Medicinal plants are used to treat diseases also where the biodiversity of plants occur in parallel with endemic transmission of malaria. This review focuses on medicinal plants which are used to treat malaria in Nigeria, and on antimalarial testing of extracts and purified compounds from plants. Some show intense activity against malaria parasites in vitro and in experimentally infected mice. The search for new drugs based on plants is important due to the emergence and widespread of chloroquine-resistant and multiple drug-resistant malaria parasites, which require the development of new antimalarials. An acquaintance with antimalarial plants may be a springboard for new <b>phytotherapies</b> that could be affordable to treat malaria, especially among the less privileged native people living in endemic areas of the tropics, mostly at risk of this devastating disease...|$|R
40|$|The term “aristolochic acid nephropathy” (AAN) is used {{to include}} any form of toxic {{interstitial}} nephropathy that is caused either by ingestion of plants containing aristolochic acids (AA) as part of traditional <b>phytotherapies</b> (formerly known as “Chinese herbs nephropathy”), or by the environmental contaminants in food (Balkan endemic nephropathy). It is frequently associated with urothelial malignancies. Although products containing AA have been banned in most of countries, AAN cases remain regularly reported all over the world. Moreover, AAN incidence is probably highly underestimated given the presence of AA in traditional herbal remedies worldwide and the weak awareness of the disease. During these two past decades, animal models for AAN {{have been developed to}} investigate underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in AAN pathogenesis. Indeed, a more-in-depth understanding of these processes is essential to develop therapeutic strategies aimed to reduce the global and underestimated burden of this disease. In this regard, our purpose was to build a broad overview of what is currently known about AAN. To achieve this goal, we aimed to summarize the latest data available about underlying pathophysiological mechanisms leading to AAN development with a particular emphasis on the imbalance between vasoactive factors as well as a focus on the vascular events often not considered in AAN.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{critical}} review of 27 herbal medicines and formulas in treating {{a broad range of}} psychiatric disorders (in addition to anxiety and depression), including obsessive-compulsive, seasonal affective, bipolar depressive, psychotic, phobic and somatoform disorders. Ovid Medline, Pubmed and the Cochrane Library were searched for pharmacological and clinical evidence of herbal medicines with psychotropic activity. A forward search of later citations was also conducted. Whilst substantial high-quality evidence exists for the use of kava and St John 2 ̆ 7 s wort in the treatment of anxiety and depression respectively, currently there is insufficient robust clinical evidence for the use of many other herbal medicines in psychiatric disorders. <b>Phytotherapies</b> which potentially have significant use in psychiatry, and urgently require more research are Rhodiola rosea (roseroot) and Crocus sativus (saffron) for depression; Passiflora incarnata (passionflower), Scutellaria lateriflora (scullcap) and Zizyphus jujuba (sour date) for anxiety disorders; and Piper methysticum (kava) for phobic, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders. While depression and anxiety are commonly researched, the efficacy of herbal medicines in other mental disorders requires attention.

40|$|Abstract Background "Fright" is an English-speaking Caribbean idiom for an illness, or ethnomedical syndrome, of {{persistent}} distress. A parallel ethnopsychiatric idiom {{exists in the}} French Antilles as sésisma. Fright is distinct from susto among Hispanics, though both develop {{in the wake of}} traumatic events. West Indian ethnophysiology (ethnoanatomy) theorizes that an overload of stressful emotions (fear, panic, anguish or worry) causes a cold humoral state in which blood coagulates causing prolonged distress and increased risks of other humorally cold illnesses. Methods Qualitative data on local explanatory models and treatment of fright were collected using participant-observation, informal key informant interviews and a village health survey. Ethnobotanical and epidemiological data come from freelist (or "free-list") tasks, analyzed for salience, with nearly all adults (N = 112) of an eastern village in Dominica, and a village survey on medicinal plant recognition and use (N = 106). Results Along with prayer and exercise, three herbs are salient fright treatments: Gossypium barbadense L., Lippia micromera Schauer, and, Plectranthus [Coleus] amboinicus [Loureiro] Sprengel. The survey indicated that 27 % of village adults had medicated themselves for fright. Logistic regression of fright suffering onto demographic variables of age, education, gender, parental status and wealth measured in consumer goods found age to be the only significant predictor of having had fright. The probability of having (and medicating for) fright thus increases with every year. Conclusions While sufferers are often uncomfortable recalling personal fright experiences, reporting use of medicinal plants is less problematic. Inquiry on fright medical ethnobotany (or <b>phytotherapies)</b> serves as a proxy measurement for fright occurrence. Cross-cultural and ethnopharmacology literature on the medicinal plants suggests probable efficacy in accord with Dominican ethnomedical notions of fright. Further, the cultural salience and beliefs about these medicines may give these medications extra psychoneuroimmune (i. e. mind-body) benefits, or placebo-like effects, for this stress-related folk illness. </p...|$|R

40|$|Context: This review {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} among sexual dysfunction (SD), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and related therapies. Objective: We reviewed the current literature to {{provide an overview of}} current data regarding epidemiology and pathophysiology of SD and LUTS. Moreover, we analysed the impact of currently available therapies of LUTS/BPH on both erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction and the effect of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 -Is) in patients with ED and LUTS. Evidence acquisition: We conducted a Medline search to identify original articles, reviews, editorials, and international scientific congress abstracts by combining the following terms: benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Evidence synthesis: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of more relevant general population-based and BPH/LUTS or SD clinic-based trials and evaluated the common pathophysiologic mechanisms related to both conditions. In a further step, the overall impact of current BPH/LUTS therapies on sexual life, including <b>phytotherapies,</b> novel drugs, and surgical procedures, was scrutinized. Finally, the usefulness of PDE 5 -Is in LUTS/BPH was critically analysed, including preclinical and clinical research data as well as possible mechanisms of action that may contribute to the efficacy of PDE 5 -Is with LUTS/BPH. Conclusions: Community-based and clinical data demonstrate a strong and consistent association between LUTS and ED, suggesting that elderly men with LUTS should be evaluated for SD and vice versa. Pathophysiologic hypotheses regarding common basics of LUTS and SD as discussed in the literature are (1) alteration of the nitric oxide (NO) -cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, (2) enhancement of RhoA-Rho-kinase (ROCK) contractile signalling, (3) autonomic adrenergic hyperactivity, and (4) pelvic atherosclerosis. The most important sexual adverse effects of medical therapies are ejaculation disorders after the use of some alpha-blockers and sexual desire impairment, ED, and ejaculatory disorders after the use of alpha-reductase inhibitors. Minimally invasive, conventional, and innovative surgical treatments for BPH may induce both retrograde ejaculation and ED. PDE 5 -Is have demonstrated significant improvements in both LUTS and ED in men with BPH; combination therapy with PDE 5 -Is and alpha 1 -adrenergic blockers seems superior to PDE 5 -I monotherapy.

40|$|Intermittent fevers {{caused by}} Plasmodium parasites {{have been known}} for millennia, and have caused untold human suffering. Today, {{millions}} of people are afflicted by malaria each year, and hundreds of thousands die. Historically, the most successful synthetic antimalarial drug was chloroquine, as it was safe, inexpensive, and highly efficacious. However, plasmodial resistance to chloroquine now greatly limits its utility. Previously in our laboratories {{it has been shown that}} attachment of a 2 ̆ 2 reversal agent moiety 2 ̆ 2 to the side chain of chloroquine can result in the restoration of activity against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum malaria. In the first part of the work presented here, a study has been made of the importance of the quinoline ring substitution pattern to the activity of such reversed chloroquines. The compounds presented here include those bearing a substituent in the 2 -, 5, 6 -, 7 -, and/or 8 - position, and include those with chloro, bromo, iodo, fluoro, nitro, trifluoromethyl, methyl, and methoxy substituents. For reversed chloroquines, 2 -, 5 -, and 8 - substituents have been found to decrease in vitro antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum relative to 7 -chloro substitution, whereas 6 - and 7 - substituted compounds with various substituents have in many cases similar activity to that of 7 -chloro substituted compounds. Little difference has been observed between 6 - and 7 - substitution, or between chlorine and a methyl group in position 6. In most cases these effects on activity are directionally similar to those observed for chloroquine analogs without an attached reversal agent, but the magnitude of the effect is generally smaller, suggesting that the activities of reversed chloroquines are less affected by modifications to the quinoline ring system than is true for chloroquine analogs without an attached reversal agent. The second portion of this work presents an asymmetrical bis-quinoline (PL 241) that is highly active against P. falciparum malaria, with an IC 50 of less than 0. 1 nM for all strains tested. Mechanistic studies have been performed in which the substitution patterns of the two quinoline rings of PL 241 are modified in ways that indicate that either ring system is equally capable of participating in the antimalarial activity of these compounds. The excellent in vitro antiplasmodial activity of PL 241 makes this a compound of great interest for further development as a potential antimalarial drug. In the third part of this work, a survey has been made of antimalarial treatments recommended in the European medical literature from the time of Pliny the Elder (active in the first century A. D.) through the advent of modern malaria chemotherapy in the early twentieth century. In the fifteen primary sources utilized in this study, 251 distinct substances - primarily plants - were identified as having likely been used in the treatment of malaria. Of the 38 substances that were described in three or more sources, at least fifteen have been examined by other workers for antiplasmodial activity; in many cases, they were found to have antiplasmodial activity in vitro or in vivo. However, the majority of the <b>phytotherapies</b> for malaria identified in this project have not yet been tested against Plasmodium species, and may provide valuable leads in the search for new compounds active against drug-resistant malaria...|$|R
