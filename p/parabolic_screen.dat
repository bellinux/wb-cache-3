40|$|This report {{details the}} outcome of tests carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the University of California, Davis to assess the {{performance}} of three alternative Gross Solids Removal Devices (GSRDs) developed by Caltrans to remove litter and solids from storm water runoff. These devices were: the Linear-Radial GSRD, the <b>parabolic</b> <b>screen</b> (Type 1) GSRD and the straight screen (Type 2) GSRD. A large-scale test facility was designed and built specifically {{for the purpose of}} testing full scale devices under conditions of flow rates and litter-loading percentages that correspond to those actually encountered in Caltrans drainage facilities. The litter used in the tests was manufactured in accordance with the results of previously commissioned studies by Caltrans on the characterization of highway litter. The main conclusions to emerge from the present study are as follows. The litter-capture efficiency of the Linear-Radial device is very high, with insignificant volume of litter having dimensions greater than 0. 25 inches square leaving th...|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual <b>parabolic</b> projection <b>screen</b> and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{empirical}} {{understanding of how}} young children’s screen engagement links to their well-being. Data from 19, 957 telephone interviews with parents of two- to five-year-olds assessed their children’s digital screen use and psychological well-being in terms of caregiver attachment, resilience, curiosity, and positive affect in the past month. Evidence did not support implementing limits (< 1 or < 2 hours per day) as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, once variability in child ethnicity, age, gender, household income, and caregiver educational attainment were considered. Yet, small <b>parabolic</b> functions linked <b>screen</b> time to attachment and positive affect. Results suggest a critical cost-benefit analysis {{is needed to determine}} whether setting firm limits constitutes a judicious use of caregiver and professional resources...|$|R
40|$|Space-based {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) necessarily involves imaging through the ionosphere. At low frequencies (VHF, UHF and L-band) the ionosphere will degrade the SAR image. Previous work {{has shown that the}} amount of image degradation strongly depends on the integrated strength of ionospheric turbulence, C k L. The focusing, sidelobes and integrated sidelobe ratio all depend on C k L in a manner that can be directly predicted by a simple analytic theory, which is reviewed and extended to cover any {{synthetic aperture}} length. Simulations of the ionosphere, using a thin phase <b>screen</b> <b>parabolic</b> equation approach, are performed under different ionospheric conditions for a number of possible SAR systems and the results compared with the analytic theory. It is concluded that, provided that the scattering is weak, the theory represents a good predictor of SAR performance, even at UHF. The known statistics of C k L can therefore be used to predict the performance of any trans-ionospheric SAR without performing a simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of transionospheric VHF and UHF radars requires knowledge of amplitude and phase scintillation due to ionospheric scattering. Phase coherence is of particular importance where long coherent integration periods and large bandwidths are required. A thin phase <b>screen,</b> <b>parabolic</b> equation based, Trans-Ionospheric Radio Propagation Simulator (TIRPS) is described. Modeled channel scattering functions (CSFs) are compared to experimental VHF and UHF data derived from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Long-range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar on Kwajalein Island (9. 4 °N, 166. 8 °E). TIRPS quantitatively reproduces the experimental results, including the quasi-parabolic profile observed in the measured CSFs under strong turbulence conditions. Variations in the simulated CSF with ionospheric phase screen parameters are also presented. Under conditions of high integrated strength of turbulence (CkL), a low phase spectral index (p = 1), indicating relatively dense small-scale irregularities, produces pronounced range spreading. Conversely, when the spectral index is high (p = 4), indicative of strong focusing/defocusing by large-scale irregularities, there is increased Doppler spreading and, when the outer scale of irregularities is large, a greater likelihood of asymmetry of the CSF about the zero Doppler axis...|$|R
