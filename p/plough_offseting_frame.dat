40|$|AbstractDirect {{displacement}} based design (DDBD) {{has been}} widely applied in several structural systems including moment resisting frame (MRF), {{the most common type}} of structures used in design practices. Due to architectural demand, recently many buildings involving some out-of-plane <b>offset</b> of <b>frames</b> in MRF system. The existence of out-of-plane <b>offset</b> in <b>frame</b> system raises differences force distribution among frames compared with the regular one without the offset. This study will observe the effect of out-of-plane <b>offset</b> of <b>frame</b> in a concrete regular MRF designed using DDBD method for two different earthquake level. Nonlinear time history analysis is used to verify the structural performance based on three parameters: story drift, damage indices and structural failure mechanism. The <b>offset</b> <b>frame</b> is assumed to be in-plane with the adjacent frame, the existence of offset is ignored, and the structure is designed as a regular MRF. The study shows that the main structural problem arises from the beams at the offset area due to high shear demand. DDBD procedure enable to adjust the ductility demand of these beams in order to improve the structural performance without involving design repetition as usually done in traditional seismic resistant design. In conclusion, DDBD performed well in predicting the seismic demands of the MRF system with out-of-plane <b>offset</b> of <b>frame.</b> The existence of <b>offset</b> <b>frames</b> in MRF system can be ignored during the design process as long as the ductility demands of beams at the offset area is well adjusted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCognitive {{judgments}} about an object’s location are {{distorted by the}} presence of a large <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> left or right of an observer’s midline. Sensorimotor responses, however, seem immune to this induced Roelofs illusion, with observers able to accurately point to the target’s location. These findings have traditionally been used as evidence for a dissociation of the visual processing required for cognitive judgments and sensorimotor responses. However, a recent alternative hypothesis suggests that the behavioral dissociation is expected if the visual system uses a single frame of reference whose origin (the apparent midline) is biased toward the <b>offset</b> <b>frame.</b> The two theories make qualitatively distinct predictions in a paradigm in which observers are asked to indicate the direction symmetrically opposite the target’s position.

40|$|Abstract. The two visual systems {{hypothesis}} in neuroscience {{suggests that}} pointing without visual feedback {{may be less}} affected by spatial visual illusions than cognitive interactions such as judged target location. Our study examined predictions of this theory for target localization on a large-screen display. We contrasted pointing interactions under varying levels of visual feedback with location judgments of targets that were surrounded by an <b>offset</b> <b>frame.</b> As predicted by the theory, the frame led to systematic errors in verbal report of target location but not in pointing without visual feedback for some participants. We also found that pointing with visual feedback produced a similar level of error as location judgments, while temporally lagged visual feedback appeared to reduce these errors somewhat. This suggests that pointing without visual feedback may be a useful interaction technique in situations described by the two visual systems literature, especially with large-screen displays and immersive environments. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} variable <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> (VFO) coding, a {{new method}} of achieving variable rate in speech coding for packet switched networks. The method has been {{implemented in the}} widely used AMR narrow-band coder. Most speech coders used in packet switched networks were originally designed for circuit switched networks and limited to transmit frames at regular time intervals. VFO coding exploits the possibility in packet switched networks of sending frames at more irregular time intervals. The start of frame n {{does not have to}} coincide with the end of frame n − 1, but can be delayed in time. This creates time gaps, or offsets, of variable length between the frames, which re-sults in a decreased rate of transmitted frames. A decreased frame rate does not only decrease the average bitrate of the encoded speech, but also the network overhead. A <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> is concealed by the decoder through extrapolation of the preced-ing frame. This extrapolation is similar to concealing lost speech frames and can therefore be handled by the error concealment unit (ECU), already present in the decoder. By also implementing the concealment of the <b>frame</b> <b>offsets</b> in the encoder, the encoder knows how a <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> of a certain length would be concealed by the decoder. The encoder can use this information to decide the lengths of the <b>frame</b> <b>offsets</b> such that they can be concealed without significant quality loss by the decoder. A speech signal locally stationary {{after the end of the}} frame gives a long offset, while distinct transitions give a short offset or an offset of zero length. PESQ and MUSHRA measurements show that VFO does not result in higher quality than conventional AMR coding at corresponding bitrates, but if the overhead from a standard IP network is taken into account VFO coding gives significantly higher quality at corresponding gross bitrates. This is due to the reduced frame rate of VFO coding. ii...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for temporally calibrating multiple cameras by image processing operations. Existing multi-camera algorithms {{assume that the}} input sequences are synchronized either by genlock or by time stamp information and a centralized server. Yet, hardwarebased synchronization increases installation cost. Hence, using image information is necessary to align frames from the cameras whose clocks are not synchronized. Our method uses image processing to find the <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> between sequences {{so that they can}} be aligned. We track foreground objects, extract a point of interest for each object as its current location, and find the corresponding location of the object in the other sequence by using projective invariants in P 2. Our algorithm recovers the <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> by matching the tracks in different views, and finding the most reliable match out of the possible track pairs. This method does not require information about intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters, and thanks to information obtained from multiple tracks, is robust to possible errors in background subtraction or location extraction. We present results on different sequences from the PETS 2001 database, which show the robustness of the algorithm in recovering the <b>frame</b> <b>offset.</b> 1...|$|R

30|$|In the VAD {{procedure}} of MSE, each frame in an utterance is always classified as either speech or non-speech. Therefore, no frame will {{be classified as}} a “transient frame”, {{as is the case}} for some more delicate VAD processes. In fact, the transient frames that exist in the short region between two connected acoustic units (which are often called “short pauses”) are quite often classified as non-speech in MSE, and thus their magnitude spectrums are assigned as very small. For this reason, the VAD in MSE is unlike some conventional end-point detectors, in which only the onset and <b>offset</b> <b>frames</b> of an utterance are decided, while the inter-word or inter-syllable frames that often possess lower energy are not processed. However, we find that further processing of these detected short pauses between the onset and offset times for utterances is quite helpful in speech recognition, especially when the SNR is low. To demonstrate this phenomenon, a simpler form of MSE is designed, in which we only process the first and the last detected non-speech segments (the corresponding frames are assigned to have very small magnitude spectra) and treat the remaining non-speech segments as speech (the magnitude spectra of the corresponding frames are weighted as in Equation (24)). This method is called “MSE(s)” here for simplicity, and we compare it with the original MSE with respect to speech recognition performance.|$|R

A nested RANSAC framework on these putative matches is then used to firstly recover the <b>frame</b> <b>offset</b> and ratio of frame rates of the two sequences, then either a homography or a fundamental matrix relating the two views, {{depending on the type}} of motion contained within the sequences. No camera calibration or object tracking is required. Real sequences containing motion either on a plane or in free space are synchronized and it is demonstrated that this approach is successful in recovering the ratio of frame rates, the <b>frame</b> <b>offset,</b> and the homography or fundamental matrix relating the two sequences. ...|$|R
40|$|Facial micro-expression {{analysis}} has {{attracted much attention}} from the computer vision and psychology communities due to its viability in {{a broad range of}} applications, including medical diagnosis, police interrogation, national security, business negotiation, and social interactions. However, the micro and subtle occurrence that appears on the face poses a major challenge to the development of an efficient automated micro-expression recognition system. Therefore, to date, the annotation of the ground-truths (i. e., emotion label, onset, apex and <b>offset</b> <b>frame</b> indices) are still performed manually by psychologists or trained experts. This thesis briefly reviews the conventional automatic facial microexpression recognition methods and their related works. In general, an automatic facial micro-expression recognition system consists of three basic steps, namely: image preprocessing, feature extraction, and emotion classification. This thesis mainly focuses on the enhancement of the first two steps over conventional methods in the literature. Specifically, a hybrid facial regions selection for pre-processing is proposed. This method is able to eliminate some parts of the face that are irrelevant to any facial emotions. Then, an effective feature descriptor, namely, optical strain, is utilized to capture the variations in characteristics and properties of the micro-expressions in the video. Next, a feature descriptor is developed to encode the essential expressiveness of the apex frame because the information of a single apex frame exhibits the highest variation of motion intensity, which is adequate to represent the emotion of the entire video. Finally, this thesis is concluded by highlighting its contributions and limitations, as well as suggesting possible future directions related to micro-expression recognition system...|$|R
