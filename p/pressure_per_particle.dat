40|$|Using {{confocal}} microscopy, {{we measure}} the packing geometry and interdroplet forces {{as a function}} of the osmotic pressure in a 3 D emulsion system. We find that the nonlinear elastic response of the pressure with density is not a result of the anharmonicity in the interaction potential, but of the corrections to the scaling laws of the microstructure away from the critical point. The bulk modulus depends on the excess contacts created under compression, which leads to the correction exponent α= 1. 5.

40|$|A {{kinetic theory}} of {{relativistic}} gases in a two-dimensional space is developed {{in order to}} obtain the equilibrium distribution function and the expressions for the fields of energy <b>per</b> <b>particle,</b> <b>pressure,</b> entropy <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> and heat capacities in equilibrium. Furthermore, by using the method of Chapman and Enskog for a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation the non-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor and the entropy production rate are determined for a universe described by a two-dimensional Robertson-Walker metric. The solutions of the gravitational field equations that consider the non-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor - associated with the coefficient of bulk viscosity - show that opposed to the four-dimensional case, the cosmic scale factor attains a maximum value at a finite time decreasing to a "big crunch" and that there exists a solution of the gravitational field equations corresponding to a "false vacuum". The evolution of the fields of pressure, energy density and entropy production rate with the time is also discussed. Comment: 23 pages, accepted in PR...|$|R

40|$|The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) experiment, an {{instrument}} suite to be flown on Mars Surveyor 2001, {{will include a}} tool for doing simple mineralogical scratch and streak tests on particles from the Martian regolith. The Abrasion Tool will be applied to particles that adhere themselves to highly polished substrates of various hardnesses. Granular soil components will be subjected to a compressive force of about 3 N using a leaf spring. The spring will be applied with a paraffin actuator capable of a 0. 76 mm throw to achieve a maximum displacement of about 7. 5 mm {{at the tip of}} the tool. The pressure per grain will be dependent on the grain size, the number of grains that adhere to the substrate and the number of grains in compression. The <b>pressure</b> <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> is expected to be on the order of 100 MPa - 1 GPa. The MECA sample wheel containing the substrates will be rotated after the particles are placed in compression to produce scratches or pits. A primary goal of the Abrasion Tool is to identify quartz (Mohs' hardness = 7) using substrates of varying hardnesses. Quartz is considered hazardous to future human explorers of Mars because it can cause silicosis of the lungs if it is of respirable size. It is also hazardous to machinery, structures, and space suits because of its ability to abrade and scratch surfaces. Since large quantities of minerals harder than quartz are not expected, any scratches produced on polished quartz substrates might be reasonably attributed to quartz particles, although there may be minerals such as impact metamorphic diamond in the soils. Careful calibration of the tool will be necessary to ensure that grains are not overloaded; for example, a steel ball pressed into glass will produce a Hertzian fracture, even though it is softer than glass. Other minerals, such as magnetite (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5) have been shown to scratch glass ceramics such as Zerodur (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5). Thus, minerals can be differentiated: note that regardless of the mineral species, if any particle is harder than 6. 5 it will certainly be an interesting discovery for both planetary geology and human exploration concerns. The scratches will be identified using the 6 X optical microscope and profiled with the atomic force microscope included in the MECA instrument suite. Analysis of the scratch morphology will yield evidence concerning the shape of the particle responsible for producing each scratch. For example, angular grains should leave vertical cracks with microconchoidal lateral chipping, while rounded grains might leave chatter marks, or nested partial Hertzian cracks. Particle shape can thus be inferred from these indentation modes, as well as material hardness. In addition, particle size information may also be available if pits caused by rolling particles can be identified. Converse to scratching, the minerals may be crushed at their contact points, and be smeared onto the target substrates to leave what geologists refer to as "streaks". These are cold-welded trails of mineral material that have structure and color indicative of mineral composition. The AFM will determine the morphology of these streaks, while the microscope will ascertain the color. On the harder substrates, we might expect streaking to dominate; on the softer substrates, scratching may dominate. Progressions of material interactions across the substrate selection will be a valuable source of data for mineral discrimination. It should also be noted that many minerals have coatings (such as iron oxides), and these will have to be differentiated from the host mineral grains; laboratory tests will establish the effects of such coatings on the scratch results. Finally, we note that the microscope will provide corroborative data regarding likely mineral species by grain shapes, fracture patterns, surface textures, color, and UV fluorescence reactions.

To prove Bose-Einstein condensation of the mixture three steps are needed. First, we integrate the all-particle density matrix, employing a four-parameter matrix recurrence relations, down to the lowest-order intra-species and inter-species reduced density matrices of the mixture. Second, the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (mean-field) equations of the mixture are solved analytically. Third, we analyze the mixture's reduced density matrices {{in the limit of}} an infinite number of particles of both species 1 and 2 (when the interaction parameters, i. e., the products of the number of particles times the intra-species and inter-species interaction strengths, are held fixed) and prove that: (i) Both species 1 and 2 are 100 % condensed; (ii) The inter-species reduced density matrix <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> is separable and given by the product of the intra-species reduced density matrices per particle; and (iii) The mixture's energy <b>per</b> <b>particle,</b> and reduced density matrices and densities <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> all coincide with the Gross-Pitaevskii quantities. Finally, when the infinite-particle limit is taken with respect to, say, species 1 only (with interaction parameters held fixed) we prove that: (iv) Only species 1 is 100 % condensed and its reduced density matrix and density <b>per</b> <b>particle,</b> as well as the mixture's energy <b>per</b> <b>particle,</b> coincide with the Gross-Pitaevskii quantities of species 1 alone; and (v) The inter-species reduced density matrix <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> is nonetheless separable and given by the product of the intra-species reduced density matrices <b>per</b> <b>particle.</b> Comment: 31 page...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{a general}} {{expression}} for the entropy <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> {{as a function}} of chemical potential, temperature and gap magnitude for the single layer transition metal dichalcogenides. The electronic excitations in these materials can be approximately regarded as two species of the massive or gapped Dirac fermions. Inside the smaller gap there is a region with zero density of states where the dependence of the entropy <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> on the chemical potential exhibits a huge dip-and-peak structure. The edge of the larger gap is accompanied by the discontinuity of the density of states that results in the peak in the dependence of the entropy <b>per</b> <b>particle</b> on the chemical potential.
