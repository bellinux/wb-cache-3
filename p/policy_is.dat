Physical activity <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> identified at the national level and for six of eight state/territories.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of life insurance policies in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. Life insurance <b>policies</b> however <b>are</b> not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> deemed to be assets for estate duty purposes. In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the policy proceeds. When life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent life insurance <b>policies</b> should <b>be</b> included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these <b>policies</b> must <b>be</b> reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R
