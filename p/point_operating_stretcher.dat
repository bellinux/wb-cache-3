40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{based on}} a SPICE-like simulator that searches for multiple <b>operating</b> <b>points</b> automatically, with no user intervention required, is presented. This algorithm, which exploits the asymmetrical properties of nonlinear mappings that describe multistable circuits, has been implemented into a program which automatically finds multiple (in most cases, all) <b>operating</b> <b>points</b> of a circuit. In addition to finding multiple <b>operating</b> <b>points,</b> this method offers another feature: {{it is capable of}} detecting the stability of a particular <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> Another useful feature of this method is that it allows the user to gauge how close a particular circuit is to possessing multiple <b>operating</b> <b>points.</b> For circuits known to possess multiple <b>operating</b> <b>points,</b> this method allows the user to specify which <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is encountered first. Unlike other continuation methods, circuit element models are not modified; only augmenting resistors are required. Hence, this approach lends itself well as an "add-on" to existing circuit simulators. A number of circuit examples are given...|$|R
30|$|DSSR and its {{boundary}} {{have three}} characters [17]: 1) the security boundary is linear and composed of some hyperplanes, {{which can be}} fast calculated. 2) DSSR is dense inside. Thus, if the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is inside the DSSR, it is secure. Otherwise, it is insecure. Moreover, the location of an <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> in DSSR can be expressed as {{the distance from the}} <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> to all the security boundaries, abbreviated as SD (security distance). If SD is positive, the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is secure. Otherwise, it’s insecure. The greater the positive SD is, the securer the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is. Also the greater the negative distance is, the more insecure the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is. 3) The dimension of the DSSR can be reduced to 2 or 3 by DSSR visualization technology, which makes the location of the <b>operating</b> <b>points</b> visualized. So operators can supervise the security state of the grid and the security margin of each direction conveniently [18].|$|R

40|$|Abstract- It {{is shown}} in this {{contribution}} that besides the classical dynamics caused by reactance elements, each DC resistive circuit has its special hidden so-called virtual dynamics which contains information about the DC <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> stability. Virtual eigenvalues can be attached to each linear model of resistive circuit linearized around its DC <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> Corresponding virtual trajectories describe motion of <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> in the virtual space beeing deflected from the equilibrium state and they help {{to decide whether the}} <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is stable...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} identifying the Pareto front for multiple objectives from a finite set of <b>operating</b> <b>points.</b> Sampling an <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> gives a random vector where each coordinate corresponds {{to the value of}} one of the objectives. The Pareto front is the set of <b>operating</b> <b>points</b> that are not dominated by any other <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> in respect to all objectives (considering the mean of their objective values). We use a confidence bound algorithm to approximate the Pareto front, and we prove problem specific lower and upper bounds, showing that the sample complexity is characterized by some natural geometric properties of the <b>operating</b> <b>points.</b> Experiments confirm the reliability of our algorithm. For the problem of finding a sparse cover of the Pareto front, we propose an asymmetric covering algorithm of independent interest. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The pulsed {{compression}} reactor {{promises to}} be a compact, economical and energy efficient alternative to conventional chemical reactors. While its design and operation {{is similar to that of}} a free piston internal combustion engine, it does not benefit from any controllability through the load. Experimental data and simulation results are presented in this article. They form the basis for an approach that describes the functioning, controllability and run-away possibility of the pulsed compression reactor. The approach demonstrates that two <b>operating</b> <b>points</b> can be identified: a stable <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> and an unstable <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> For any process performed in the pulsed compression reactor, there will either be no <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> in which case it will not be able to sustain this process in the reactor, there will be only a stable <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> in which case the process will automatically converge to this point once initiated, or there will be both a stable and an unstable <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> in which case the process can be sustained at the stable <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> but not at or beyond the unstable one...|$|R
