This study examined the effectiveness of mesh bag covers on culture units for spat of the blacklip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera. It assessed spat retention and growth in culture units without mesh bags (REMOVE) and in those where mesh bags were replaced weekly (REPLACE), washed weekly (WASH) or left unwashed (NO WASH) {{for the duration of}} the six-week experiment. Culture units in the REPLACE treatment had the greatest number of spat at the end of the experiment and 41 % more spat than in the REMOVE treatment. Grading of the spat from each treatment at the end of the experiment showed that the REPLACE treatment had the highest number of spat in large and medium size classes with mean (± SE) dorso-ventral height of 23. 9 ± 0. 5 mm and 17. 4 ± 0. 5 mm, respectively. Mean wet weight of the mesh bags at the end of the experiment differed between treatments with bags from the WASH and NO WASH treatments having significantly greater mean wet weights than those from the REPLACE treatment. The results show that the presence of a mesh bag around spat culture units may improve retention of spat by between 18 - 41 %. However, <b>protective</b> <b>mesh</b> bags may foul quickly and, to maximise retention and spat growth, weekly replacement of mesh bags should be undertaken. © 2008 EDP Sciences IFREMER IRD...|$|E

These investigations involved examining sharks landed by recreational fishing and <b>protective</b> beach <b>meshing</b> {{off the coast of}} New South Wales (NSW). The historical catch records were examined from these fisheries as well as from commercial fishing. Genetic techniques were successfully used to develop a DNA fingerprint database and complemented morphological methods in identifying whaler sharks Carcharhinus spp. to species level. This had not been previously undertaken in official catch records for <b>protective</b> beach <b>meshing</b> nor recreational gamefishing since their inception in NSW Stomach content analysis was undertaken on the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier caught off NSW and indicated that the species is a non-selective predator, with birds being a major prey item during the study. The first age and growth study of tiger and shortfin mako sharks in Australia was undertaken. Analysis of vertebral growth ring counts indicated no difference in the age and growth rates of G. cuvier between females and males, with the oldest tiger shark sampled being 21 years old. Age and growth differences were observed between the genders in shortfin mako sharks lsurus oxvrinchus, with the oldest male sampled being 7 years old and oldest female sampled being 10 years old. The first-ever comparative assessment was undertaken on the long term catches of major pelagic shark species caught by the various fisheries operating off NSW Noticeable declines in the number of sharks landed by recreational gamejishing have been offset by the larger number of sharks being tagged and released. Examination of data from recaptured tagged sharks indicate large scale movements of blue sharks Prionace glauca and shortfin mako sharks around the Southwestern Pacific Ocean. When catches from all fisheries are examined, an increase in the total relative abundance of sharks off NSW is evident.

Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the [...] "Evolution" [...] special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, giving a total production of 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the <b>protective</b> honeycomb <b>mesh</b> to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 [...] "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular [...] "Nismo" [...] logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors.

40|$|China {{currently}} {{occupies the}} world’s leading Electric bicycle (e-bike) market. However, {{the popularity of}} e-bikes is accompanied by massive numbers of injuries and deaths due to accidents involving e-bikes. As a result, the safety of e-bikes has recently received much attention from {{the public and the}} government and researchers have concentrated on improving the safety features of e-bikes with innovative technologies. It has been shown that well-designed protective shells can protect a driver involved in an e-bike accident. However, {{there is a lack of}} criteria on which to base the design of an effective protective shell for e-bikes. Therefore, this research focuses on the development of a design criterion based on the specific case of Roly-Poly stability. This stability criterion can be formulated for one curved surface as r > h, which is in a stable stability configuration - one of a number of static stability configurations. In this study, static stabilities are configured based on knowledge of potential energy (PE). In order to verify the design criteria, three types of protective shells are designed with different stability conditions. The first type follows the design criterion (r > h), while the remaining two do not (r = h and r < h). A finite element model of an e-bike is constructed with key components, such as the main frame, CoM (the position of which is obtained by a plumb line experiment), and the designed <b>protective</b> shells. The <b>meshed</b> models are produced and employed to determine the contact parameters using the frictionless penalty method. The corresponding results of sideways falling simulation successfully demonstrate the validity of the design criterion...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{specialized}} {{simulation software}} for filter elements {{has proven to}} be an effective tool for the optimization of the design of filter elements. The complex interplay of fluid flow, dust transport and deposition and flow-induced deformation of the media has to be described in terms of mathematical models and treated with appropriate numerical algorithms. The center of these considerations is the final filter element and therefore, the approach relies on material and model parameters (e. g. flow resistance and stiffness of the filter media) that are either known or that can be obtained from measurements. However, many media are composed of several layers such as filtering nonwovens, <b>protective</b> fleeces, stabilizing <b>meshes</b> etc. The amount of possible or promising combinations can be quite large, so there is a growing interest in finding an optimal layer design in terms of flow resistivity and mechanical stability by using suitable simulation techniques. In general however, knowing the material properties of the components is not sufficient to deduce the corresponding effective material properties of the multi-layered medium. Most manufacturing processes involve compression, stretching and shearing of the materials (e. g. pleating). In particular, when combining nonwovens with meshes, the production process can lead to localized and (at least partially) irreversible changes of the solid volume fraction of the nonwoven layer(s). If the compression is sufficiently strong, this leads to a change in the permeability distribution, and the effective flow resistivity of the resulting medium cannot be assumed to be equal to the sum of the flow resistances of the components. In this paper, we present a simulation technique for the prediction of influences of the production process on multi-layered filtering media with the focus on nonwovens combined with meshes. In a first step, the mechanical interaction between a porous filtering material and the supporting mesh under compression is simulated for a representative elementary volume (REV) of the heterogeneous medium. The influence of the compression on the local flow resistivity distribution in the REV is reflected by models essentially based on the local volume fraction in the porous medium. A flow simulation on the compressed REV is used to compute the effective permeability...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to develop and}} evaluate a practical dust removal method for livestock housing using electrostatic precipitation techniques. Laboratory and animal housing studies were conducted;High voltage negative ionizing electrodes and positive collectors were used to charge and remove airborne dust particles from the air. Different negative ionizing electrodes, protective enclosures, and collectors were investigated in the laboratory. Ionizing equipment was compared in a test chamber with a measured dust sample introduced into the chamber before each trial. Particle count data were collected;Needlepoint and wire ionizing electrodes were compared and no {{significant difference was found}} between dust decay rates. Because of the electrical shock hazard with high voltage electrodes, protective enclosures with and without forced air movement were investigated. Enclosure type affected the level of corona discharge and ion distribution. Ion distribution was controlled by the electric field forces rather than movement of the forced air. Therefore, a 58 % open plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>protective</b> enclosure was used. Area tube collectors with and without an insulating coating to reduce the shock hazard were also investigated. The coating reduced the dust removal rate by about 24 %;Prototype tests were conducted in an animal production unit to obtain a quantitative estimate of dust removal under typical operating conditions. Two animal chambers with similar ventilation, temperature control, and management were used. Each chamber housed 48 nursery pigs;Particle count and mass samples were collected. Particle size ranges collected were the same between the animal study and laboratory study [...] 0. 5 - 1. 0 micron, 1. 0 - 2. 0 micron, 2. 0 - 5. 0 micron, 5. 0 - 10. 0 micron, and greater than 10. 0 micron. Mass samples were taken with a 0. 8 micron filter and vacuum pump. All systems evaluated in this study resulted in a significant reduction in airborne dust concentration. Without ionization, typical particle counts were between 76 and 169 million particles per cubic meter (mppcm). With ionization dust control, particle counts were between 38 and 86 mppcm. Percent reductions of 57 % to 66 % of all dust particles were achieved with ionization. Comparing particle count and mass data indicates that particles greater than 2. 0 micron are removed more effectively than particles less than 2. 0 micron...|$|R
