40|$|Dental pulp is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} mesenchymal tissue that has a limited regeneration capacity due to anatomical arrangement and post-mitotic nature of odontoblastic cells. Entire <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> followed by pulp space disinfection and filling with an artificial material cause loss of {{a significant amount of}} dentin leaving as life-lasting sequelae a non-vital and weakened tooth. However, regenerative endodontics is an emerging field of modern tissue engineering that has demonstrated promising results using stem cells associated with scaffolds and responsive molecules. Thereby, this article reviews the most recent endeavors to regenerate pulp tissue based on tissue engineering principles and provides insightful information to readers about the different aspects involved in tissue engineering. Here, we speculate that the search for the ideal combination of cells, scaffolds, and morphogenic factors for dental pulp tissue engineering may be extended over future years and result in significant advances in other areas of dental and craniofacial research. The findings collected in this literature review show that we are now at a stage in which engineering a complex tissue, such as the dental pulp, is no longer an unachievable goal and the next decade will certainly be an exciting time for dental and craniofacial research...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effects of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as a pulp dressing after coronal <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> (pulpotomy) in primary molars, (2) to compare the effects of MTA and formocresol in pulpotomized primary teeth. Sixty primary mandibular molars of thirty healthy children aged between 5 - 8 years were treated by conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth on the right side are assigned to MTA (Group A) and the left side for the Formocresol (Group B). The children were examined clinically and radiographically every 6 months over a period of 36 months. Results of present study revealed that both MTA and Formocresol has the same effect on the first as well as second primary molars, with chi-square value being 1. 1483 (P ≥ 0. 05). None of the teeth in either group showed any clinical pathology, showing 100 % success rate but radiographically formocresol group showed one case of internal resorption that was regarded as failure in the present study. MTA seems to be more promising predictable with positive response in vital pulp therapy in future than formocresol pulpotomy except for the cost factor...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Low-level {{laser therapy}} (LLLT) has been {{increasingly}} in use {{over the last}} few decades in both medicine and dentistry. It has been suggested that LLLT may be helpful in pulpal wound healing following pulp exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to comparethe effectiveness of LLLT and formocresol (FC) application in healing of remaining pulp following <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> in primary molars. Materials and Methods: A total of 23 contralateral pairs of teeth from 11 children aged 4 to 7 years were selected and matched using clinical and radiographic criteria. One toothfrom each pair was randomly assigned to the LLLT pulpotomy and the to FC pulpotomy group. During a 6 -month follow-up period, the teeth were examined clinically and radiographically. Eight patients (four in each group) completed six-month and 6 patients (threein each group) completed one-year follow-up. Results: Clinically, no complication was observed in the teeth. However, radiographic assessment revealed signs of periradicular radiolucency in two teeth in LLLT group. Conclusion: Findings of this investigation show that LLLT can be used successfully as a complementary step to pulpotomy procedure in order to help the healing of amputated pulp. Longer follow-up periods are recommended to investigate long-term effect of LLLTpulpotomy on pulp...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of digital pulp defects {{is still a}} challenge in hand surgery. Several reconstructive techniques are available, but in some cases, their advancement capacities are not sufficient for the flap to cover the whole defect. The Gigogne flap is a new, very simple and safe technique. It consists of harvesting two cutaneous flaps successively on the same neurovascular digital palmar bundle. The first plasty may be chosen among the well-known flaps usually applied in pulp reconstruction. The second plasty, the Gigogne flap, is an advancement VY plasty done on the main cutaneous paddle of the first proximal flap. We performed 15 Gigogne flaps in 13 patients, who suffered zone II and III digital <b>pulp</b> <b>amputations.</b> The Gigogne flap increased the advancement capacity of the proximal flap as well as restoring the physiological pulp fatty pad, thus reconstructing a functional and aesthetic fingertip...|$|R
40|$|Rather easy to perform, pulpotomy of the {{deciduous}} teeth is {{the most}} frequent endodontic treatment performed on children, but also the most controversial. Based on the <b>amputation</b> of the <b>pulp</b> chamber and the conservation of the inflammation-free root canals, the clinical results can be good, depending on the materials used. In this, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) as well as zinc-oxide-eugenol (ZOE) have been proven very inflammatory whereas Formocresol (FC) remains the reference even if its clinical toxicity is still reported in literature on a very controversial way. Nevertheless, this was sufficient to trigger and stimulate a search for alternatives, {{and led to the}} proposition to use ferric sulfate and even more recently MTA as new bases for the treatment of the pulp stumps after <b>pulp</b> chamber <b>amputation.</b> English AbstractJournal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Captive {{and wild}} African {{elephants}} frequently suffer tusk fractures. Several institutions shorten the tusks of captive elephants to reduce fractures and injury {{as a result}} of behaviour within enclosures. Fracturing or coronal <b>amputations</b> that expose <b>pulp</b> lead to pain for the elephant. Estimating coronal pulp lengths may thus help to minimise the risk of <b>pulp</b> exposure during <b>amputations.</b> We aimed to determine the length of the pulp beyond the lip margin from an external tusk characteristic. Tusks collected from elephants in Namibia and the Kruger National Park had similar morphological relationships. This statistical property allowed us to correct for missing data in our data sets. Pulp volume and pulp length correlated with tusk circumference at the lip. Even so, the circumference at the lip could not predict the length of the pulp in the crown external to the lip. Our findings suggest that tusks, irrespective of sex or age, amputated further than 300 mm from the lip should not expose pulp...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pulpotomy is {{a regular}} {{procedure}} {{in the management of}} inflamed primary teeth. Diverse materials have been reviewed for the pulpotomy, some of them being formocresol, glutaraldehyde, ferric sulfate, and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Aims: The aim was to evaluate and compare clinically and radiographically the effects of MTA as a pulp dressing after coronal <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> (pulpotomy) in primary molars. Settings and Design: Sixty primary molars of thirty healthy children using split mouth design aged between 4 and 6 years were treated by pulpotomy technique. Subjects and Methods: Sixty primary mandibular molars of thirty healthy children aged between 4 and 6 years were treated by pulpotomy technique. The teeth on the right side were assigned to MTA (Group A) and the left side for the formocresol (Group B). The children were then examined clinically and radiographically every 6 months. Statistical analysis used: Chi-square test using the SPSS version 19. 0 was used to compare between the two groups. Results: Results showed that both MTA and formocresol have the same outcome on the primary molars, with Chi-square value being 1. 1483 (P ≥ 0. 05). None of the teeth in any children in the study showed any clinical pathology. Conclusion: The principle conclusions of this study are that there are no significant differences in MTA and formocresol. The success rate of MTA and formocresol pulpotomy can be considered comparable till this therapy influences the development and growth of the permanent teeth...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preservation of pulp {{vitality}} is {{of utmost}} importance to the normal physiological functioning of tooth in situ and physiological process of exfoliation in a tooth affected by disease or trauma. Pulpotomy serves such a purpose using various medicaments applied directly on vital pulp. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effects of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and formocresol (FC) as a pulp dressing after coronal <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> (pulpotomy) in primary molars prospectively over a period of 1 year. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three healthy children, aged between 5 and 8 years, requiring pulp therapy were selected after clinical and radiographic assessment. A total of 50 maxillary and mandibular primary molars were treated by the conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth were divided into two equal groups. In Group A, FC was used as the pulp dressing agent, and in Group B, MTA was used before restoration with stainless steel crowns. The research employed was a prospective study. The teeth treated were assessed postoperatively after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The observations were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: Clinically, both the groups showed 100 % success at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At 3 months, the radiographic success rates of FC and MTA were 92 % and 96 %, respectively, and at 6 and 12 months, the radiographic success rates of FC and MTA were 88 % and 96 %, respectively. Conclusion: MTA showed a higher success rate than FC and may be a favorable material for pulpotomy in primary molars whose pulps have been compromised by a carious or mechanical pulp exposur...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Emdogain Gel (Biora AB, Malmo, Sweden), consisting of a enamel matrix derivative (EMD) in a propylene glycol alginate (PGA) vehicle, on experimentally exposed human pulps and to register postoperative symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Nine pairs of contralateral premolars scheduled for extraction on orthodontic indications were included. Following a superficial <b>pulp</b> <b>amputation</b> performed with a small (016) diamond bur, either EMDgel or a mix of calcium hydroxide and sterile saline was placed at random {{in contact with the}} pulp wound. The subjects made records of symptoms and were also interviewed about pain/discomfort by a blinded examiner. After 12 weeks the teeth were extracted, prepared and subjected to light microscopic examination in which the inflammation and newly formed hard tissue in the pulp were analysed. Immunohistochemistry was performed using affinity-purified rabbit anti-EMD polyclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Postoperative symptoms were less frequent in the EMDgel-treated than in the calcium hydroxide-treated teeth, especially during the first six weeks. In the EMDgel-treated teeth, new tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by the gel and hard tissue was formed alongside the exposed dentine surfaces and in patches in the adjacent pulp tissue. EMD was detected in the areas where new hard tissue had been formed. The wound area of the EMDgel-treated teeth exhibited inflammation in the majority of the teeth whereas less inflammation was seen in the calcium hydroxide-treated teeth where the hard tissue was formed as a bridge. CONCLUSIONS: In the EMDgel-treated teeth, postoperative symptoms were less frequent and the amount and pattern of hard tissue formation were markedly different than in the teeth treated with calcium hydroxide. However, the operative procedure and the formulation with EMD in a PGA vehicle {{do not seem to be}} effective for the formation of a hard tissue barrier...|$|E
40|$|The author, {{using the}} {{staining}} methods of Bielschowski, Gross, Beckwith, Weigert-Pal and Cajal in frozen and serial paraffin and celloidin sections, has investigated the dental innervations of man, monkey, dog, cat, and guinea-pig {{in health and}} disease. He discusses the anatomy and physiology of the dental innervation {{and the effect of}} section of the inferior dental nerve on the trophic, vasomotor, protective, and sensory functions, with special reference to the relation between dental disease and neuropathies. He describes the innervation of the tooth germ {{and the nature of the}} growing fibrils seen before calcification in the dentinal papilla and draws attention to the innervation of the periodontal membrane. He has found that these nerves anastomose across the crest of the interdental septa with their fellows and demonstrates coiled sub-cemental nerve-endings. He has been unable to find any difference in the eruption and casting of teeth after section of the inferior dental nerve, and does not find degeneration of the nerves of deciduous teeth prior to casting to be inevitable. He discusses the effect of local anæsthesia on the dental pulp, some of the causes of odontalgia and neuralgia and the effect of old age and general disease on the dental innervation. He has failed with lethal or continued sublethal doses of ethyl and methyl alcohol, lead or tetanus and diphtheria toxins, using the oral, gastric, subcutaneous and intravenous route, to produce dental neuronic change. The effects of fracture of teeth and jaws, the introduction of arsenic into the <b>pulp</b> chamber and <b>amputation</b> and extirpation of the pulp are examined. The vital resistance of the pulp and the significance of granulomata as a protective mechanism are discussed. The author has found that after extraction although there is at first degeneration of the nerve-fibres concerned, there may subsequently be regeneration, sometimes in the form of plexiform neuroma. He has produced degenerative changes in both the nerves and the Gasserian ganglia on both the operated and unoperated sides by the introduction of tetanus and diphtheria toxins into extraction sockets, where the neuronic involvement is proportionate to the degree of trauma with which the extraction is effected. The rôle of innervation in tooth movement during eruption and orthodontic correction, and after the extraction of anterior teeth, has been investigated, the latter by roentgencinematography...|$|R
