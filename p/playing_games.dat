5|$|Children {{have always}} played games. It is {{accepted}} {{that as well}} as being entertaining, <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games, painted in 1560.

5|$|The console {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} stochastic participation in game on the emer-gence of cooperation in Demographic Donor-Recipient Game. In usual model set-ting, players are supposed to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> actually with probability one if they are faced to <b>play</b> <b>games.</b> But sometimes players may want to <b>play</b> <b>games,</b> and some-times may not. We incorporate this tendency to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> into usual De-mographic model by assuming that players <b>play</b> <b>game</b> actually with their inherit-ing probabilities if they are faced to <b>play</b> <b>games.</b> In Demographic Donor-Recipient game, players are initially randomly distributed in square lattice of cells. In each period, players move locally to random cell in neighbors or globally to random unoccupied cell in the whole lattice, and face to <b>play</b> multiple <b>games</b> against local neighbors or against randomly selected global players. In each game, one player is selected as Donor and the other as Recipient randomly and they <b>play</b> the <b>game</b> ac-tually with the product of two Donor's and Recipient's probabilities of participa-tion.

5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E

5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to following the main storyline, the player character will witness {{and can take}} part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if {{a group of people}} ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E
5|$|The {{ballpark}} for the New York {{team was}} constructed between 165th and 168th Streets, on Broadway in Manhattan. Formally known as American League Park, it was nicknamed Hilltop Park {{because of its}} relatively high elevation. The team {{did not have an}} official nickname; it was often called the New York Americans in reference to the AL. Another common nickname for the club was the Highlanders, a play on the last name of the team's president, Joe Gordon, and the British military unit, the Gordon Highlanders. The team acquired players such as outfielder Willie Keeler and pitcher Jack Chesbro. The player-manager was Clark Griffith, obtained from the Chicago White Sox. On April 22, 1903, the Highlanders began their season with a 3–1 loss to the Washington Senators; eight days later, they won their first game in Hilltop Park, defeating the Senators 6–2. New York fell out of contention for the AL pennant in May, falling to seventh place after <b>playing</b> <b>games</b> away from Hilltop Park for a 24-day period while construction on the stadium concluded.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates pre-service teachers’ {{experience}} about <b>playing</b> technology <b>games</b> and their opinions about using contemporary technology to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> as an instructional tool. The participants are 272 pre-service teachers from {{a university in}} Middle Anatolia. The present study used mixed methods. The data was collected through an online survey that {{was created by the}} authors. The survey contains demographic questions about the participants` gender, major, whether they <b>play</b> technology <b>games</b> or not, and questions about which technology <b>games</b> they <b>play,</b> their opinions about using technology (IWBs and tablets) to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> for instruction, and for which instructional purposes they plan using technology to <b>play</b> <b>games.</b> Following research questions were investigated for the current study: 1. Whether pre-service teachers <b>play</b> technology <b>games</b> or not? If yes, which technology <b>games</b> they <b>play?</b> 2. Whether pre-service teachers plan to use interactive white boards and tablets that were distributed by the government under FATIH project to <b>play</b> technology <b>games</b> for educational purposes? 3. Whether pre-teachers’ opinions about using the IWBs and tablets to <b>play</b> instructional <b>games</b> associated with their gender and <b>playing</b> technology <b>games?</b> 4. For which instructional purposes pre-service teachers plan to use IWBs and tablets to <b>play</b> instructional <b>games?</b> For the second and third questions descriptive statistics and crosstabs were conducted. For the first and fourth questions content analysis was applied. Fifty-four percent (n= 148) of the pre-service teachers agreed to use the IWBs and tablets to <b>play</b> technology <b>games</b> for educational purposes while 46 % (n= 124) did not. There is no statistically significant association between gender and plans using the IWBs and tablets to <b>play</b> instructional <b>games.</b> There was a statistically significant association between who <b>Playing</b> Technology <b>Games</b> and Plans Using IWBs and Tablets to <b>Play</b> Instructional <b>Games.</b> Pre-service teachers who <b>play</b> technology <b>games</b> reported higher scores than the ones who do not <b>play</b> technology <b>games.</b> The participants suggested that using IWBs and tablets to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> would make learning fun and easy. The study has implications for teacher education and K- 12 education policy.
