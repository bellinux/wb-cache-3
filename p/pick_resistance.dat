40|$|Modified {{yeast protein}} {{could be used}} for paper coating, but some {{properties}} such as IGT <b>pick</b> <b>resistance,</b> wet pick and wet rub resistance were not so good as that of milk casein. In order to improve these characteristics, sodium arginate, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose or milk casein was used, The addition of milk casein (modified yeast protein 10 %: milk casein 5 %) showed the best result with a flow curve, less non-Newtonian such as weak thixotropic flow, near to that of milk casein and the IGT <b>pick</b> <b>resistance,</b> wet pick or wet rub resistance were greatly improved compared with modified yeast protein itself. Wet <b>pick</b> <b>resistance</b> varied from 1. 5 to 3. 6, very near to that of milk casein (3. 5), and wet rub resistance was from 7 - 10 to lo- 13 compared with that of milk casein which was 12. The IGT <b>pick</b> <b>resistance</b> was from Ill- 121 to 155, while milk casein was 238. In the case of milk casein addition, the 2 hrs modification (10 % yeast protein, 1 % NaOH, 60 ℃) was clearly most suitable method for mixing with milk casein, the loss of protein which could not be recovered by acidprecipitation was 23 %. The modified yeast protein obtained with this method was good in color, purity and very transparent when dissolved in alkali solution. And from the flow curve of modified yeast protein and milk casein mixture solution, it was obvious that this sample was more appropriate applied with a roal coater than a brush or air knife coater...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has examined the}} adhesive binding of paper, with {{particular attention to the}} action of the fiber/adhesive interface. The efforts of this research were concentrated on relating properties of the paper to strength of the resultant binding. To simulate the problems of economical binding styles, uncoated groundwood paper and hot melt adhesives were studied. Although the hypotheses assumed that a strong interfiber bond within the sheets would lead to a strong binding, {{it was found that the}} most critical factor was not the strength of the sheet, but the availability of the fibers to the adhesive. The strength of the sheet was measured by several tests. These tests were: tensile strength, internal bond, tear resistance, and <b>pick</b> <b>resistance.</b> None of these measures of paper strength correlated with binding strength. Other factors, specifically caliper, absorbency, and low <b>pick</b> <b>resistance</b> proved to be the significant factors leading to a strong binding. The general conclusion is that the greater the surface area of the fibers exposed to the glue, the greater the adhesive bond. Greater caliper, absorbency, and low <b>pick</b> <b>resistance</b> lead to increased exposure of fibers and therefore to a stronger binding for newsprint -grade papers. Previous studies with both coated and uncoated papers had indicated that roughness is the most important paper quality for a good binding with hot melt adhesives. This study finds that roughness is not a significant factor, and the thickness and low <b>pick</b> <b>resistance</b> are the most significant factors leading to a good binding with uncoated groundwoods. Acidity was tested for effects on binding strength. Even with accelerated aging, no evidence was found that the acidity of the sheet affects the strength of the adhesive binding. Binding strength was measured by page pull and flex tests. Both can be valuable tests, and in this case correlated well with each other...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Dublin (S. Dublin) in clinical submissions from calves and temporal and farm-type trends in antimicrobial resistance {{patterns of the}} isolates. A total of 300 isolates of S. Dublin were obtained from fecal or internal organs of calves fewer than 120 days of age originating from 84 dairies and 18 calf ranches from July 1998 to December 2002. The isolates were susceptibility tested to a panel of 10 antimicrobials using the disk diffusion assay. Temporal and farm-type trends in individual antimicrobial inhibition zone sizes were assessed and antimicrobial resistance patterns were described using cluster analysis. Isolates obtained from calf ranches compared with dairies exhibited decreased susceptibility to florfenicol, gentamicin, neomycin, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline. During the years 1998 - 2002, decreasing susceptibility was seen for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. There were 20 different antimicrobial resistance patterns in the isolate set, indicating that S. Dublin {{has the ability to}} transfer and <b>pick</b> up <b>resistance</b> genes with relative ease.

40|$|Due to the {{improved}} standard of living, watercolor paintings are {{very popular in}} Taiwan. However, most of the famous Taiwanese watercolorists have used a lot of imported watercolor papers. Unfortunately, there is still lack of high-grade watercolor paper domestically made. The {{aim of this study}} which was sponsored by the Council of Agriculture intended to produce high-grade watercolor paper that might be comparable to Arches watercolor paper made in France since 1492. The main characteristics of Kosh watercolor paper we made by hand on a laboratory scale were described as follows : * Density : 0. 5 - 0. 6 g/cm 3 * Water absorbency : > 28 g/m 2 (Cobb test) * Brightness : High brightness makes the color more brilliant. * Rough paper surface : Considerable luminosity and brilliance are created by the contrast between the reflective luster of the raised surface of a granular paper and the depth and richness of the heavily loaded color in the hollows. * Good color hold-out : Colored pigments should properly level on the paper surface. * Permanence : Alkaline sized and cotton-containing watercolor paper showed the greatest permanence. Comparing to the painting properties of Arches paper, Kosh paper showed some defects in the following respects : (i) White specks occurred on the painted paper surface after drying. (ii) Not easy to be painted in 2 nd brushing (painting). In order to solve these problems, we carried out this experiment "Improvement of the quality of Kosh watercolor paper " since 1995. We proposed " Cobb testing method " to determine the color hold-out i. e., the tendency of painting color held or retained on the paper surface after paint drying, for all watercolor papers. The color (expressed as CIELAB) and color difference of each test paper were determined according to respective TAPPI Methods, thus the coloring strength of each specimen can be ob Because of roughness affecting the painting properties of watercolor paper, Arches paper with lower roughness has an easy access of leveling the watercolor paint and no white specks presented on the painted paper surface compared with Kosh paper. Thus the white specks usually presented on the painted Kosh watercolor paper surface can be diminished by lowering its roughness. The experimental result of FTIR analysis revealed that gelatin which might present in Arches paper promoting the painting strength and <b>picking</b> <b>resistance</b> in the following paint brushing for watercolorists. In general, painting test results of Kosh paper indicated that a high-grade watercolor paper could be made domestically from appropriate formula i. e., cotton fiber, dry strength agent, alkaline size, CaCO 3, painting aid, and surface size by handmaking technique. 水彩畫作的表現，紙質所扮演的角色非常重要。一般畫家常以畫紙之空白 部分來表現亮度，紙面以天然白色最為理想。水彩紙需具適當之吸水性、 紙質結實、紙面粗糙度適中且富光澤、刷塗不起毛以及易於修改等特性， 而優良的顯色性更是不可或缺的必要條件。 為期客觀評估自製Kosh水彩紙之顯色性，吾人自創利用Cobb測試儀進行測 試水彩紙之顯色性。將此法著色之紙樣利用測色儀測定水彩紙著色部分之 顏色值，以CIELAB表示之。比較各種水彩紙之顏色值差異，即可客觀偵知 水彩紙之顯色性。又利用Cobb測試儀，將黃色水彩顏料覆蓋於藍色水彩顏 料之重疊顯色(綠色) 法，可客觀地模擬水彩重疊上色之重疊顯色性。 自製Kosh水彩紙與法國Arches水彩紙之性質相較，Kosh水彩紙尚有著色後 之紙面有小白點及第二次上色不易之缺點，故繼續從事品質改良之工作。 由測定水彩紙表面粗糙度結果知，法國Arches水彩紙之較平滑表面相較 Kosh水彩紙易著色且不會有白斑出現; 故經改變Kosh水彩紙表面之粗糙 度即可消除上色水彩紙表面之白斑缺點。又利用FTIR技術對紙面進行組成 份性質分析及由文獻中知法國Arches水彩紙表面塗有動物膠，此種成分對 水彩紙之繪畫性及重疊顯色性均有甚大之助益。試驗至此，吾人可謂國人 已可自行生產高品質Kosh水彩紙矣...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistant}} zoonotic pathogens {{present on}} food constitute a direct risk to public health. Antimicrobial resistance genes in commensal or pathogenic strains form an indirect risk to public health, as they increase {{the gene pool}} from which pathogenic bacteria can <b>pick</b> up <b>resistance</b> traits. Food can be contaminated with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and/or antimicrobial resistance genes in several ways. A first way {{is the presence of}} antibiotic resistant bacteria on food selected by the use of antibiotics during agricultural production. A second route is the possible presence of resistance genes in bacteria that are intentionally added during the processing of food (starter cultures, probiotics, bioconserving microorganisms and bacteriophages). A last way is through cross-contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria during food processing. Raw food products can be consumed without having undergone prior processing or preservation and therefore hold a substantial risk for transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans, as the eventually present resistant bacteria are not killed. As a consequence, transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria after ingestion by humans may occur. Under minimal processing or preservation treatment conditions, sublethally damaged or stressed cells can be maintained in the food, inducing antimicrobial resistance build-up and enhancing the risk of resistance transfer. Food processes that kill bacteria in food products, decrease the risk of transmission of antimicrobial resistance. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{abattoir}} {{workers who}} carry out eviscerate do <b>pick</b> up <b>resistance</b> from broiler enteric organisms. To test this hypothesis, {{the prevalence of}} and the association of antimicrobial drug resistance between enterococci from broilers and workers who carry out evisceration, washing and packing of broiler intestines were investigated. Broiler caecae (n = 240) from 6 farms were collected after slaughter. Caecal content as well as faeces from 29 abattoir workers and 28 human controls were selectively cultured for E. faecium and E. faecalis. The micro-dilution broth method {{was used to determine}} MICs for selected antimicrobials. Broilers carried higher levels of resistance for certain antimicrobials compared to the two human groups. Percent resistance and MIC 90 for enrofloxacin and bacitracin and MIC 50 for doxycycline showed that abattoir workers carried higher levels of resistance compared to the control group for antimicrobials used in poultry production. Resistance levels in the isolates from broilers and abattoir workers exhibited an association for certain drugs. Overall, the level of resistance in the two human populations did not exhibit a significant difference (p> 0. 05). Usage of antimicrobials as feed additives fuels resistance among broiler isolates. Abattoir workers are more likely to carry higher levels of resistance than the general public. However, this study did not demonstrate that carrying out evisceration, washing and packing of intestines of broilers fed antimicrobial feed additives significantly influences the level of resistance in abattoir workers.

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{has become}} a concern of the architectural industry as it causes aesthetical effects to urban buildings. Thus, {{the development of a}} coating which contains self-cleaning behavior plays {{a crucial role in the}} achievement of more competitive architectural coatings and to curb the cost of high maintenance. This preliminary study wish to test the effectiveness of Nano TiO 2 as an additive prior more developments and formulations can be done. Due to the ability to accelerate degradation of many organic contaminants, nanometric titanium dioxide (TiO 2) has been selected as the promising photocatalytic material. Nano TiO 2 were pre-synthesized in dispersed form before it is incorporated into the acryllic based coating system, the existing formula of exterior paint Nippon Weatherbond colour bases i. e. Pastel Base and Deep Base. The nanometric size of nano TiO 2 were experimentally examined by using SEM and the optimal dosage of the nano TiO 2 in the coating will be determined from the experiments. Physical properties such as opacity, whiteness and colour were determined by using the right tools. A series of coating properties tests e. g. application test, harsh weather resistance test, UV irradiation resistance, dirt pick-up test and etc were carried out to study the properties of self-cleaning coating in terms of wet paint and dry paint film. Paint film surface morphology such as hydrophilicity and contact angle were being studied as well.
