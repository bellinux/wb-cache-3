40|$|Purpose: Hearing loss {{can lead}} to a number of disabilities and can reduce quality of life. Noise-induced hearing losses have become more common among {{adolescents}} due to increased exposure to personal music players. We, therefore, investigated the use of <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>player</b> among Korean adolescents and the relationship between hearing threshold and usage pattern of portable music players. Materials and Methods: A total of 490 adolescents were interviewed personally regarding their use of portable music players, including the time and type of player and the type of headphone used. Pure tone audiometry was performed in each subject. Results: Of the 490 subjects, 462 (94. 3 %) used personal music players and most of them have used the <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>player</b> for 1 - 3 hours per day during 1 - 3 years. The most common type of portable music player was the MP 3 player, and {{the most common type of}} headphone was the earphone (insert type). Significant elevations of hearing threshold were observed in males, in adolescents who had used portable music players for over 5 years, for those over 15 years in cumulative period and in those who had used earphones. Conclusion: Portable music players can have a deleterious effect on hearing threshold in adolescents. To preserve hearing, adolescents should avoid using portable music players for long periods of time and should avoid using earphones...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades, there has been {{increasing}} interest in the effects of music listening on hearing. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review published studies that detail the noise levels, the potential effects (e. g. noise-induced hearing loss), and the perceptions of those affected by music exposure in occupational and non-occupational settings. The review employed Medline, PubMed, PsychINFO, and the World Wide Web to find relevant studies in the scientific literature. Considered in this review are 43 studies concerning the currently most significant occupational sources of high-intensity music: rock and pop music playing and employment at music venues, as well as the most significant sources of non-occupational high-intensity music: concerts, dicotheques (clubs), and <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>players.</b> Although all of the activities listed above have the potential for hearing damage, the most serious threat to hearing comes from prolonged exposures to amplified live music (concerts).

40|$|Context: Distortion product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) {{may indicate}} preclinical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in adolescents from unsafe <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>player</b> (PMP) use. Aims: The objective, therefore, was to observe preclinical signs of NIHL in 9 th grade adolescents with clinically normal hearing by comparing DPOAE signals between {{different levels of}} A-weighted equivalent PMP exposure. Settings and Design: Subjects were recruited from all secondary-level schools located {{in the city of}} Regensburg, Germany during two academic years 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011. Subjects and Methods: A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLs) for a 40 -hour work week (LAeq, 40 h) were estimated from questionnaire responses on output and duration of PMP use of the previous week. Subjects were then categorized into four levels of exposure: 85 to < 90, and ≥ 90 A-weighted Decibel [dB(A) ]. DPOAE signals were collected by trained audiological staff, applying a standard optimized protocol, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital Regensburg. Statistical Analysis Used: Mean DPOAE signals were compared between levels by unpaired t test. Novel linear regression models adjusting for other leisure noise exposures and with outcome variables DPoutcome and 4 kilo Hertz (kHz) DPOAEs estimated effects between levels. Results: A total of 1468 subjects (56 % female, mostly aged 15 or 16 years) were available for analysis. Comparison of DPOAE means by PMP exposure typically showed no greater than 1 [*]dB difference between groups. In fact, comparisons between ≥ 90 dB(A) and < 80 dB(A) presented the least differences in magnitude. Both DPoutcome and 4 [*]kHz linear regression models presented a weak association with the 4 -level PMP exposure variable. An expected dose-response to PMP exposure was not observed in any analyses. Conclusions: DPOAE signal strength alone cannot indicate preclinical NIHL in adolescents...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tinnitus affects about 10 - 15 % of {{the general}} {{population}} and risks for developing tinnitus are rising through increased exposure to leisure noise through listening to <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>players</b> at high volume.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A recent {{lawsuit filed}} against Apple Computers, Inc. has aroused public {{concern about the}} {{potential}} role of <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>players</b> (MPs) {{in the development of}} hearing loss. In order to determine if such devices are used at levels likely to damage hearing, typical MP use levels were recorded from a sample of Northern Illinois University students. The average sound pressure level (Leq) was measured for each music sample. These levels were compared with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommendations for maximum daily noise exposure. While previous research has indicatJ that MPs are capable of producing sound output levels that can damage hearing, from the data collected in the present study, it did not appear that the students were listening to their MPs at levels that were likely to cause noise-induced hearing loss. However, since the effects of noise exposure are cumulative it is possible that, when combined with exposure to other noise sources, the use of personal MPs could contribute to overall hearing loss. In addition, the majority of the students who volunteered their <b>music</b> <b>players</b> for use in this study were communicative disorders majors. Since it is likely that they were well informed about the risks of excessive noise exposure, it is possible that increased public awareness about such dangers will be of great benefit in preventing noise-induced hearing loss in the future.

40|$|AbstractTinnitus {{has been}} linked to noise exposure, a common form of which is {{listening}} to music as a leisure activity. The relationship between tinnitus and type and duration of music exposure is not well understood. We conducted an internet-based population study that asked participants questions about lifetime music exposure and hearing, and included a hearing test involving speech intelligibility in noise, the High Frequency Digit Triplets Test. 4950 people aged 17 – 75 years completed all questions and the hearing test. Results were analyzed using multinomial regression models. High exposure to leisure music, hearing difficulty, increasing age and workplace noise exposure were independently associated with increased tinnitus. Three forms of music exposure (pubs/clubs, concerts, <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>players)</b> did not differ in their relationship to tinnitus. More males than females reported tinnitus. The objective measure of speech reception threshold had only a minimal relationship with tinnitus. Self-reported hearing difficulty was more strongly associated with tinnitus, but 76 % of people reporting usual or constant tinnitus also reported little or no hearing difficulty. Overall, around 40 % of participants of all ages reported never experiencing tinnitus, while 29 % reported sometimes, usually or constantly experiencing tinnitus that lasted more than 5  min. Together, the results suggest that tinnitus is much more common than hearing loss, but that there is little association between the two, especially among the younger adults disproportionately sampled in this study...|$|R

This dissertation focuses on the development of low-frequency vibration energy harvesters. First, a wide-bandwidth, meandering piezoelectric vibration energy harvester targeted for wireless sensor node applications is presented. The device achieves a low resonant frequency and wide bandwidth due to its closely spaced modes, enabling it to more effectively harvest energy from the commonly occurring low ambient vibration frequencies (20 Hz and higher). Second, a magnetic levitation electromagnetic energy harvester is developed and optimized for harvesting kinetic energy from human movements while walking or running, where most of the acceleration content is below 10 Hz. The device design and optimization is presented along with real-world measurements from human subjects. ...|$|R

Spearman′s rank-order correlations and multiple logistic regressions were performed with variables related to behavior and habits as independent ones and tinnitus as a dichotomized dependent variable. Tinnitus was reported by 99 students (12. 8 %), more frequently among girls compared with boys (P = 0. 009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis in boys revealed a significant independent effect of a regular drug abuse on the onset of tinnitus. The chances of tinnitus were 13 times higher among drug addicts compared with non-drug users (odds ratio [OR] and 95 % confidence interval [CI] for tinnitus = 13. 072; 1. 335 - 127. 946). In girls, the significant independent effect on tinnitus was found for daily duration of exposure to SHS (OR and 95 % CI for tinnitus = 1. 328; 1. 073 - 1. 644 /per 2 hours of exposure/) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary Hard-disk Drive’s (HDD) {{were invented}} {{as a form}} of {{portable}} storage to be used in various forms of electrical devices ranging from <b>personal</b> <b>music</b> <b>players</b> to laptops. Being portable, HDD’s have to be shock resistant and resilient to vibration as those were its factors of failure. A HDD fails when it encounters a head slap; contact between the slider and the disk-platter resulting in damage to either component. It is unlikely that a direct head slap occurs when a magnitude of shock is large enough. A head slap usually happens when a sufficiently large shock causes separation at the dimple point, affecting the balance between the forces of the preload and the air-bearing interface leading to an eventual head slap. When the Hitachi 1. 8 ” HDD was tested against the designed shock of 500 G at 2 ms pulse-width, no separation was detected at the dimple point hence it was highly unlikely that a head slap occured. Testing with an increased magnitude of shock was done and the HDD eventually failed at 1000 G, this being used as the benchmark of the HDD’s limit. A parametric study was then performed by changing the loadbeam’s material property to prevent failure at a shock of 1000 G. The larger the decrease in the loadbeam’s density, the more resistant the HDD was to separation at its dimple point as well as a head slap. A reduction of 50 % percent was sufficient to prevent the HDD from failure at 1000 G at a 2 ms pulse width. ii/...|$|R
5000|$|A 2005 book {{stated that}} after Apple Computers entered the music industry, within ten years {{it became the}} {{dominant}} seller of portable digital audio <b>music</b> <b>players</b> (its iPod line), [...] "...while former giant Sony (maker of the portable Walkman and CD Discman was struggling." [...] This market change was initiated in 1998, when the first portable digital audio player, the Rio <b>personal</b> digital <b>music</b> <b>player,</b> was introduced. Portable MP3 players like the Rio competed with portable CD players. The 64 MB version of the Rio MP3 player enabled users to store about 20 songs on the player. One {{of the benefits of}} the Rio over portable CD players was that since the Rio had no moving parts, it offered skip-free playback. Since 1998, the price of portable digital audio players has dropped and the storage capacity has increased significantly. In the 2000s, users can [...] "carry their entire music collection in a audio player the size of a cigarette package." [...] The 4 GB iPod, for example, holds over 1,000 songs.|$|R
