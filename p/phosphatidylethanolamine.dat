5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of <b>phosphatidylethanolamine,</b> phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E

S-Adenosyl methionine can subsequently methylate the amine of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> to yield phosphatidylcholines. It can mainly be found in the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the lipid bilayer.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vasopressin}} on the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholines and <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> {{was investigated in}} freshly isolated rat hepatocytes in suspension. Treatment of hepatocytes with vasopressin inhibits the incorporation of [Me- 14 C]choline into phosphatidylcholines in a dose-dependent manner. The hormone {{does not affect the}} uptake, phosphorylation or oxidation of choline. Pulse-chase studies indicate that CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase might be subject to hormonal regulation by vasopressin. In contrast with the inhibitory effect of vasopressin on the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines, this hormone stimulates the incorporation of [1, 2 - 14 C]ethanolamine into <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Pulse and pulse-chase studies with labelled ethanolamine show that the conversion of ethanol-aminephosphate to CDPethanolamine as well as the formation of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> from CDPethanolamine and diacylglycerol are enhanced. Determination of the effect of vasopressin on the activity of the enzymes of the synthesis de novo of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> demonstrates an increase of the activity of ethanolaminephosphotransf erase, probably {{as a result of the}} increased amount of diacylglycerol in vasopressin-treated cells...|$|R

5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E

40|$|Exosomes {{are small}} vesicles {{secreted}} from multivesicular bodies, which {{are able to}} stimulate the immune system leading to tumour cell eradication. We have analysed lipids of exosomes secreted either upon stimulation from rat mast cells (RBL- 2 H 3 cells), or constitutively from human dendritic cells. As compared with parent cells, exosomes displayed an enrichment in sphingomyelin, but not in cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine content was decreased, but an enrichment was noted in disaturated molecular species as in <b>phosphatidylethanolamines.</b> Lyso(bis) phosphatidic acid was not enriched in exosomes as compared with cells. Fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated an increase in exosome-membrane rigidity from pH 5 to 7, suggesting their membrane reorganization between the acidic multivesicular body compartment and the neutral outer cell medium. NMR analysis established a bilayer organization of exosome membrane, and ESR studies using 16 -doxyl stearic acid demonstrated a higher flip-flop of lipids between the two leaflets as compared with plasma membrane. In addition, the exosome membrane exhibited no asymmetrical distribution of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines.</b> Therefore exosome membrane displays a similar content of the major phospholipids and cholesterol, and is organized as a lipid bilayer with a random distribution of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines.</b> In addition, we observed tight lipid packing at neutral pH and a rapid flip-flop between the two leaflets of exosome membranes.

One such metabolite, 15-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (15-HETE), is released intracellularly, where it conjugates to <b>phosphatidylethanolamine,</b> a phospholipid component. 15-HETE-PE induces expression of the mucin MUC5AC.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} can produce choline by {{methylation}} of <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> by N-methyltranferase (PEMT) to form phosphatidylcholine in the liver, {{or it may}} be consumed from the diet. It has been demonstrated that both de novo production and dietary consumption are necessary, as humans eating diets lacking choline develop fatty liver, liver damage, and muscle damage. However, because of the close interplay between choline, folate, methionine, and vitamin B12, (whose pathways overlap), the function of choline can be complex.|$|E

While NAPE-PLD is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing said release of N-acylethanolamine (NAE) from N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), this specific subtype of phospholipase D is {{not responsible for the}} formation of the anandamide.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of lipids in the intraocular lens is important for understanding the physiology and biochemistry of this unique tissue and for gaining a better insight into the mechanisms underlying diseases of the lens. Following our previous study showing the {{spatial distribution of}} sphingolipids in the porcine lens, the current study used ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) to provide the whole lipidome of porcine lens and these studies were supplemented by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) of the lens using ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) to determine the spatial distribution of glycerophospholipids. Altogether 172 lipid species were identified with high confidence and their concentration was determined. Sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, and <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> were the most abundant lipid classes. We then determined the spatial and concentration-dependent distributions of 20 phosphatidylcholines, 6 <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> and 4 phosphatidic acids.

40|$|Interaction {{between the}} {{bioactive}} compounds nicotinamide and picolinamide and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines and <b>phosphatidylethanolamines)</b> was investigated {{by a combined}} approach using dipole potential measurements and quantum chemical calculations. It is shown that nicotinamide and picolinamide interactions with phosphatidylcholines are of two main types: (i) specific interactions with the phosphate group of the lipid, for which H-bonding between NH 2 group of the substrate and the phosphate plays a dominant role, (ii) conjugated less specific weaker interactions involving both the phosphate and carbonyl groups of the head group, which propagate to the lipid alkyl chains and increase their conformational disorder. For <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> picolinamide was found to decrease the dipole potential of the membrane {{in a similar way}} as for phosphatidylcholines, while nicotinamide is ineffective. These findings are correlated with the specific properties of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> (reduced exposure of phosphate groups) and structural differences in the two substrates, in particular: different separation of the nitrogen atoms in the molecules, existence of a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in picolinamide (NH [...] . N (ring)), which is absent in nicotinamide, and non-planarity of nicotinamide molecules, in contrast to picolinamide ones. Additional information on the lipid/substrate interactions was extracted from the analysis of the changes produced in the relevant vibrational frequencies of the lipid and substrate upon binding. The present study gives molecular support to the argument that changes of dipole potentials are due to effects on the constitutive dipolar PO and CO groups. In addition, it is also shown that according to the specific binding of the substrate to one or both of those, the conformational state of the acyl chains may be affected. These entropy effects may be in the origin of the well-known interdependence of the properties of one monolayer with respect to the other in bilayer membranes...|$|R

LC3/ATG8 is cleaved at its C terminus by ATG4 protease to generate the cytosolic LC3-I.

25|$|In {{the fusion}} process, the lipid head group {{is not only}} {{involved}} in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent {{of the effects of}} ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close apposition more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly curved bridge must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted micelle phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a curved structure present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E

Negatively charged {{species such as}} phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, sulfatides, and the zwitterionic <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> are major components of the cytoplasmic surface of the cellular membrane lipid bilayer and {{play a key role}} in several receptors signaling functions. Lipids are not just involved in metabolic and neurological diseases; negatively charged lipids in particular play crucial roles in physiological events such as signal transduction, receptors, and enzymatic activation, as well as storage and release of therapeutic drugs and toxic chemicals in the body. Due to the importance of their role in signaling, the field of lipidomics has rapidly expanded in recent years. In the present study, direct probing of tissue slices with negative ion mode matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was employed to profile the distribution of lipids in the brain. In total, 32 lipid species consisting of <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylserines, and sulfatides were assigned.

40|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{amino acids}} of two moderately halophilic Bacillus isolates (BST and BSF) varied according to medium salinity. Cystine and proline were mostly effected. In both isolates {{growing in the}} presence of 6 and 18 % NaCl there were more dicarboxylic amino acids than basic amino acids which makes the cell envelope proteins quite acidic. The concentrations of the cell-associated cations (Na+, K+, and Mg 2 +) were high in both isolates, and varied according to the NaCl concentration. The two isolates contained glucosamine and muramic acid in their cell walls. The amounts of these two sugar derivatives, however, varied with the NaCl concentration. Thin-layer chromatography of phospholipids revealed the presence of cardiolipins, phosphatidylglycerols and <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> in the two isolates irrespective of medium salinity. Phosphatidylglycerols and the <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> increased on increasing the NaCl concentration of the growth medium.

25|$|In {{this study}} {{there are several}} atomic-scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulations created to illustrate how ethanol affects biomembranes containing phospholipids. The phospholipid membrane systems are comparable to the model membranes above but it only consists of one phospholipid which is palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE). The primary difference between the phosphatidlycholine (PC) and <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (PE) is that the three methyl groups attached to the Nitrogen atom for the PC structure is replaced by three hydrogen groups. The overall {{purpose of this study}} is similar to the study described above determining the effects of ethanol on biomembranes and how it is able to increase disorder in the membrane interior region forming non-lamellar phases in phospholipids. The experimental method and analytical technique is quite different. In the previous study, it emphasized the NNR technique using a set of host phospholipids, exchanging lipids, ethanol, and cholesterol to create model membranes. An aqueous solution containing 5% ethanol (v/v) was maintained but the concentration of cholesterol was varied to prove how this sterol compound can inhibit the effects of ethanol (inducing a liquid-disorder phase or non-lamellar phases) which is depicted in the different plots of the equilibrium constant (K) versus the mol% of cholesterol for each model membrane. In this study, phospholipid membrane is comparable to the model membrane which consists of POPC, ethanol, water and in some cases the addition of monovalent ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−) that are transported throughout the membrane in the presence of ethanol. The concentration of ethanol varies ranging from 2.5 to 30nbsp&mol% in an aqueous solution but there is no addition of any sterol compound. The atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to monitor the changes in the phospholipid membrane. All the simulations are carried out using GROMACS simulation suite software along with other methods that are essential to perform the simulations. The temperature and pressure are controlled at 310K and 1bar. The simulations are measured at various time frames which include ficoseconds (fs), picoseconds (ps), and nanoseconds (ns). A typical simulation is composed of approximately 128 POPC lipids and 8000 solvent molecules which include water and ethanol. In each simulation ethanol molecules, water molecules, head group regions, acyl chains, and the monovalent ions are all color-coded which aids in interpreting the results of the simulations. The concentrations of ethanol are 2.5, 5.0, 15.0 and 30nbsp&mol%. The amount of ethanol molecules depend on the concentration of ethanol present in the phospholipid membrane. Force field parameters are measured for the POPC lipids and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−), which are very important. A summary of the atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations is then provided which contains important information as followed: 1) a system number that corresponds to a particular phospholipid simulation 2) the concentration of ethanol mol% used in a particular simulation 3) the concentration of ethanol (v/v%) used for the simulation 3) the ethanol/lipid ratio that is derived from the simulation 4) the area (nm2) of the phospholipid membrane which details the expansion of the membranes as the concentration of ethanol is increased 5) the thickness of the membrane which is based on the distance between the average positions of the phosphorus atoms on opposite sides of the phospholipid membrane and 6) the tilt of the head group of the POPC lipid based on changes in the angle towards the interior region of the phospholipid membrane which was surprisingly not very significant.|$|E

500|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} {{steps in the}} fusion process. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step. One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion. Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved [...] "stalk" [...] must form between the two bilayers. Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why <b>phosphatidylethanolamine,</b> a highly curved lipid, promotes fusion. Finally, in the last step of fusion, this point defect grows and {{the components of the}} two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact.|$|E
40|$|Surface tensions, {{critical}} micelle concentrations (CMCs), {{contact angles}} on hydrophobic polyethylene, and foaming characteristics of phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylcholines, <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> and phosphatidylglycerols were measured {{to determine their}} suitability as substitutes for traditional surfactants. These phospholipids have fatty acid chains of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a range over which they are soluble at room temperature. Their surface tensions decrease with increasing concentrations until their CMCs are reached, above which their plateau surface tensions are as low as 21 mN/m, indicating excellent surface activities. In general, plateau surface tensions decrease with increasing chain length within each phospholipid type. The classical relationship for In CMC vs. chain length is followed with slopes typical of anionic surfactants for phosphatidic acids and phosphatidylglycerols and resembling zwitterionic surfactants for phosphatidylcholines and <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> consistent with the charge on the hydrophilic group. The wetting capabilities of aqueous solutions on polyethylene are good and foam heights and stabilities are high, the latter two properties being comparable to traditional anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate) and nonionic (octylphenol polyethoxylate) surfactants. Some anomalies are observed regarding the effect of chain length on wetting and foaming, {{probably due to the}} depletion effect. Many phospholipids slowly degrade in aqueous solution. We conclude that short-chain phospholipids exhibit excellent surfactant properties and may be useful in many applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractN-acyl <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> (NAPEs) {{are natural}} lipid {{components}} of many organisms. N-acylation of unsaturated <b>phosphatidylethanolamines</b> with a {{saturated fatty acid}} converts them from non-lamellar organizing lipids into lamellar organizing, acidic lipids which can interact with cations and potentially return to non-lamellar structures. These special properties make NAPEs candidates for fusogens. We tested the fusogenicity {{of one of the}} NAPEs, N-dodecanoyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-C 12 -DOPE) mixed with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) in liposomes. Binding and fusion to erythrocyte ghosts in the presence of 3 mM Ca 2 + required at least 60 mol% of N-C 12 -DOPE. Fusion was not observed when phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylserine was substituted for N-C 12 -DOPE, indicating specificity for properties of this lipid. Binding of N-C 12 -DOPE/DOPC (70 : 30) liposomes required 1 mM Ca 2 + while 1. 25 mM Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were sufficient for lipid mixing and delivery of encapsulated dextrans to erythrocyte ghosts. These liposomes also bound and possibly mixed lipid with nucleated U- 937 cells in a Ca 2 +- and endocytosis-dependent manner. Low pH-dependent fusion with ghosts was observed {{in the absence of any}} divalent cation, indicating that fusion with U- 937 cells could result after endocytosis into the acidic endosomes.

This analytical methodology is applied for the detailed lipidomic characterization of ten patients with the goal to find the statistically relevant differences between tumor and normal tissues. This strategy is selected for better visualization of differences, because the breast cancer tissue is compared with the surrounding healthy tissue of the same patient, therefore changes in the lipidome are caused predominantly by the tumor growth. A large increase of total concentrations for several lipid classes is observed, including phosphatidylinositols, <b>phosphatidylethanolamines,</b> phosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylcholines. Concentrations of individual lipid species inside the abovementioned classes are also changed, and in some cases, these differences are statistically significant.

Its average contact angles are larger than {{in the case of}} egg phosphatidylcholine but, as there, do not depend on tension within the one or two powers of ten covered by the observations. Certain cerebrosides form needles and fibres when the bilayers are in the solid phase...|$|R
