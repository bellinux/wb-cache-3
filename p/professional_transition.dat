40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{critically}} examine, within the context of professional practice and learning, diverse theoretical approaches that are currently prominent in researching transitions and to propose future directions for research. Much research to date on <b>professional</b> <b>transitions</b> has focused on predicting them and then preparing individual practitioners to navigate transitions as sites of struggle. The article begins by describing work contexts integral with professional transitions: regulation, governance and accountability; new work structures; and knowledge development. The discussion then examines transitions research in developmental psychology, lifecourse sociology, and career studies. These perspectives are compared critically in terms of questions and approaches, contributions to understanding <b>professional</b> <b>transitions,</b> and limitations. The implications for educators are a series of critical questions about research and education directed to support <b>transitions</b> in <b>professional</b> learning and work. Future directions and questions for research in <b>professional</b> <b>transitions</b> are suggested in the final section, along with implications for supporting professional learning in these transitions. The article is not intended to be comprehensive, but to identify issues for the reader’s consideration in thinking about various forms of transition being experienced by professions and professionals.

The research presented in this article aimed to identify whether and how boundaryless careers are manifested in the management of the <b>professional</b> <b>transition</b> of these workers. The methodological approach was quantitative, submitting a closed questionnaire to a random proportionate sample, stratified into two groups: those who remained in the institution following privatization and those who accepted voluntary redundancy in 2001. The assumption raised by hypothesis 3 that the two groups’ responses would differ, was rejected. The results, which led to the acceptance of hypothesis 2, indicated that the way in which one manages one’s career while employed by a stable organization influences the personal management of one’s <b>professional</b> <b>transition,</b> and also influences the manifestation of boundaryless careers. It was impossible to establish a pattern for this manifestation during the professional transition; thus, hypothesis 1 was accepted.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{findings from}} a qualitative longitudinal study which explored {{the process of}} leaving long-stay institutional state care in Romania during 2002 – 4, a period {{at the heart of}} accelerated EU enforced childcare reform. 28 young people were interviewed before leaving care and 17 were tracked up to 8 months after discharge. 18 practitioners were also interviewed. The findings confirmed Pinkerton's (2006) emphasis on the impact of global and national factors on the individual experience of leaving care. This study took place in a country undergoing widespread change. The care leavers' irreversible transition took place within the simultaneous <b>professional</b> <b>transition</b> of their carers and that of the community with which they needed to integrate. This insight is widely relevant in the current context of public funding cuts and changes in welfare policy in many countries, including the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Bridges (2009) was used to understand the experiences of care leavers and their carers. Bridges stresses the role of the leader in creating protective conditions for traversing three unavoidable transition stages: 1. ending old identity/behaviour; 2. a neutral zone of deconstruction and transformation; and 3. a new beginning. Preparation for leaving care can be viewed as learning to end care, followed by the neutral zone which begins at discharge. When lacking family support, formal carers are the young people's main transition guides. However, their <b>professional</b> <b>transition</b> also needs management. Because of top-down, accelerated childcare reforms, the Romanian carers' transitions appeared stuck in the neutral zone, affecting preparation for leaving care. Yet, the availability of learning opportunities after discharge changed the nature of the neutral zone for most of the sample who did better than expected at follow-up. This, supported by Bridges' proposal that learning during transition influences future coping, offers a foundation for new theory...|$|E

Firstly, {{the aim of this}} study was to describe the nursing students’ experiences while participating in HFS, and secondly to describe faculty teachers’ reflections about nursing students’ need in HFS and the related teaching challenges. METHOD: Data was collected in focus group discussions and individual interviews, analyzed using thematic qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The nursing students’ experienced HFS as being thrown into an uncertain, exposure situation. This were for some, reason for reluctance. The teachers challenge was motivating and coaching the students throughout a demanding teaching situation. DISCUSSION: Students’ ability to perform in HFS is influenced by self-perceived efficacy, own attitudes and responsibility for one’s learning, which are a challenge for the teachers. CONCLUSION: HFS methodology can be useful to identify gaps and strengths in students’ <b>professional</b> <b>transition</b> towards becoming registered nurses. Overcoming reluctance towards HFS is a mutual challenge for faculty teachers and nursing students.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored {{the experience of}} <b>professional</b> <b>transition</b> from student to practitioner among six Canadian occupational therapists {{in the first year}} of their career, with a focus on how beginning practitioners learn about doing practice. A sociocultural theory of learning provided the framework to understand the role of context and activity in learning. Data collection consisted of two semi-structured interviews and a series of journal entries. An initial interview was conducted with each participant beginning in their third to fifth month of practice to discover their perception of transition, their learning needs, and the role of collaborative interactions in supporting their learning. Each participant then maintained a journal of their experience of transition and their learning experiences for one month A second interview was held with the participants in their eighth to tenth month of practice, which focussed on their change in knowledge and skills. The transitional experiences of the research participants revealed that the support of colleagues and peers was critical to their learning and eased their adjustment to practice. They preferred to learn from an experienced occupational therapist, and the availability of this support influenced the new practitioners' choice of their first job. In their initial months of practice they struggled with their lack of practical experience, responsibilities of client care, challenges to client-centred practice and competing work demands. Their relationship with clients was particularly valuable to the participants' learning and professional identity. Mentoring and implementing practical learning experiences in the university curriculum were suggested as strategies for easing the transition from student to therapist.

Through a cross-case analysis of the qualitative data, categories related to the process of professional change emerged and were cross checked with the responses on the quantitative scales. ^ The results supported the following six conclusions: (1) Teachers are more likely to implement changes in their instructional practice if they have a strong personal and professional motivation to change. (2) Instructional changes {{are more likely to be}} rehearsed and sustained if teachers readily perceive improved achievement in their students.

By comparison with persons employed under unstable work contracts (fixed-term contracts, temping, subsidized jobs), the unemployed are more mobile and workers on open-ended contracts are less so. Gender and marital status have a measurable impact as well. Residential and occupational mobility are often linked. Two-thirds of migrations between employment areas coincide with a job change.

40|$|The {{succession}} {{of economic and}} financial crises {{has led to the}} development of multiple categories of jobs ranging from unemployment and precarious jobs to full-time salaried positions (Schmid, 2015). Between these two “extreme” situations, a “grey zone” of hybrid work categories is developing, with jobs supported by public authorities, temporary jobs, integration programs via internships and intensive training, incubators for new entrepreneurs, franchising, contract work, etc. The main common feature of such hybrid categories is a progressive transformation of the traditional employment relationships towards “multilaterality” (Countouris, 2007). If a context of nonstandard work arrangements (Cappelli & Keller, 2013) paves the way to nonstandard forms of <b>professional</b> <b>transitions,</b> it may also drive dissatisfaction, as the growing grey zone of hybrid statuses may be associated with cumulated precariousness, without counterparts (Kalleberg, 2009). <b>Professional</b> <b>transitions</b> through alternative work arrangements raise many questions in terms of job security, continuity of wage, skills development, integration into the social security system, etc. (Davidov, 2004; Havard et al., 2009; Keller & Seifert, 2013; Wears & Fisher, 2012). Who should take care of these issues? If individuals are no longer following a classical organisational and/or professional career, to what extent must their career path be automatically considered as their own responsibility and a result of their entrepreneurial capabilities? Between the “hierarchical” steering of organisational careers and the free “market” interplay specific to boundaryless careers (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996), there is a place for median formulas, seeking to both relieve individuals of the administrative difficulties linked to a discontinuous series of different statuses, while offering them new services that meet simultaneously their demands for flexibility and security. Our paper explores the extent to which such Labour Market Intermediaries (LMIs) can effectively secure nonstandard career paths. In order to characterize their roles, we created a multidimensional grid made up of 6 criteria: 1) partnership logic, 2) responsibility for matchmaking, 3) prevailing regulatory framework, 4) HR packages offered, 5) availability of information produced and 6) innovativeness. We illustrate this analytical framework via several case studies of LMIs operating in Belgium. Beyond the creation of an original multidimensional grid, our results outline two ideal-typical ways of securing nonstandard careers paths. Some LMIs reconstruct internal labour markets and operate as “quasi-employers”. Others suggest more disruptive solutions in which workers are supported while becoming fully responsible for their career as “self-employers”. Between these two extreme situations, many other possibilities may emerge according the variations of each criterion. Our multidimensional grid is an attempt to enrich existing typologies provided by the literature (Autor, 2008; Benner, 2003; Bonet et al., 2013). At the end of our analysis, a challenging hypothesis emerges from our empirical material. Once the support offered by LMIs goes away from the traditional employment patterns, a radical shift seems to occur in the purpose of career management: it is no longer a question of securing the employment relationship itself but rather a question of smoothing over welfare entitlements and incomes through <b>professional</b> <b>transitions.</b> It probably reflects more profound changes in the labour market, under the aegis of an active welfare State (Van Berkel et al., 2011) …Peer reviewe...|$|R
