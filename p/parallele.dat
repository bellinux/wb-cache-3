25|$|During his {{promotion}} of agricultural reform, Lamarque published a mémoire sur Les avantages d'un canal de navigation <b>parallèle</b> à l' Adour (1825) {{in which he}} emphasised the need for strategic investment and criticised short-term profit seeking. Lamarque believed that a canal in the country linking the Garonne and l'Adour would bring long-term economic benefits.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Heart of Darkness, O'Regan's chamber {{opera in}} one act, with an English-language {{libretto}} by artist Tom Phillips, {{based on the}} novella {{of the same name}} by Joseph Conrad was premiered at the Linbury Theatre of the Royal Opera House. The idea for the opera first came to O'Regan in 2001. It received wide critical attention and marked his first foray into operatic writing. A suite for orchestra and narrator was extrapolated from the opera and was given its London premiere by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and actor Samuel West in April 2013. In May, 2015, Heart of Darkness received its North American premiere in a production by Opera <b>Parallèle,</b> presented by Z Space in San Francisco, California. Since the opera, O'Regan composed several pieces influenced by North Africa, which include his first collaborations with both the Dutch National Ballet and the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Recently some of his output has formed the focus of festivals such as the 2014 Vale of Glamorgan Festival and New Music for New Age from The Washington Chorus. O'Regan's first full-length ballet score (Mata Hari, based on the life of Margaretha Zelle MacLeod), commissioned by the Dutch National Ballet with choreography by Ted Brandsen, opened on February 6, 2016 in Amsterdam. On September 30, 2016 Mata Hari was released in DVD and Blu-ray formats by EuroArts, distributed by Warner Classics; the ballet will be revived for a further run in October, 2017. In February, 2017, O'Regan's first album of orchestral music, A Celestial Map of the Sky, performed by The_Hallé under the direction of Sir Mark Elder and Jamie Phillips, was released on the NMC label. The album entered the British Official Charts at number seven in the Specialist Classical Chart and number 18 in the Classical Artist Albums Chart. In the same year he was elected both to an Honorary Fellowship of Pembroke College, Oxford, and to the board of Yaddo.|$|E

500|$|Rivette {{originally}} {{began to}} make Marie et Julien, {{as it was then}} titled, in 1975 with producer Stéphane Tchalgadjieff as part of a series of four films he first called Les filles du feu and later Scènes de la Vie <b>Parallele.</b> Rivette said in 2003 that the film was based on the true story of a woman who committed suicide. He first shot Duelle (...) in MarchApril and Noroît (...) in May, although the latter was not released, and the fourth film, a musical comedy meant to star Anna Karina and Jean Marais, was never shot. Filming began on Marie et Julien that August, with Albert Finney and Leslie Caron in the lead roles and Brigitte Rouan as Madame X, but after two days Rivette gave up filming due to nervous exhaustion. He later used the names of the lovers, Marie and Julien, in his 1981 film Le Pont du Nord.|$|E

2500|$|Caramitru {{starred in}} over 30 feature films, making his debut with a {{supporting}} role in Ciulei's Forest of the Hanged (1964). [...] Among his best-known roles are Vive in Dimineţile unui băiat cuminte (1966), Gheorghidiu in Între oglinzi <b>parallele</b> (1978), Ştefan Luchian in Luchian (1981), and Socrate in the Liceenii series (1985–1987). Later in life, Caramitru has had minor roles in foreign films: he was an anarchist in the 1991 Kafka, Tatevsky in Citizen X (1995), Zozimov in [...] (1996), Count Fontana in Amen. (2002), and a Bulgarian immigrant to Ireland in Adam & Paul (2004).|$|E
2500|$|Rivette then {{conceived}} and obtained {{funding for a}} series of four films, Scènes de la vie <b>parallèle.</b> With each film revolving around two female characters, part one was to be a love story, part two a fantasy, part three an adventure and part four a musical comedy. According to Rivette, his intention for the film series was [...] "to invent a new approach to film acting where speech, pared down to essential phrases, precise formulas, would play the role of poetic punctuation. Neither a return to silent cinema nor a pantomime, nor choreography: something else, where the movements of the bodies, their counterpoint and inscription in the space of the screen, will be the basis of [...] mise-en-scene." [...] The tetralogy, reflecting the political situation in France (including the conservative backlash after May '68 and the election of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), would be tied together by improvised musical scores. Rivette collaborated on the scenarios with de Gregorio and Parolini.|$|E
2500|$|According to the director, it {{took over}} a year to recover from his breakdown. Producer Stéphane Tchalgadjieff had renegotiated the {{contract}} for the Scènes de la vie <b>parallèle</b> series to require only one more film, the intended first or fourth part. Rivette decided {{that he wanted to}} film both or neither and made an unrelated film, Merry-Go-Round. Tchalgadjieff had told him that Maria Schneider wanted to make a film with him and actor Joe Dallesandro and Rivette agreed. Shot in 1978 but not completed until 1981, the film is a detective story about a missing sister and inheritance. Rivette relied on improvisation during its production, which he described after a few days as [...] "going very badly". Although Schneider was also recovering from an illness and she and Rivette wanted to abandon the project, they were persuaded to continue by the cast and crew. Rivette said, [...] "There were two people in poor health during filming, and there wasn’t any money at all". Over a year after filming was completed, he added footage of the film's composers, Barre Phillips and John Surman, in performance despite its lack of relation to the plot or characters. Merry-Go-Round, theatrically released in 1983, received mediocre reviews.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. At {{the latter}} part of this period, another sulcus, the [...] "posterio-parietal," [...] or [...] "Fissure of Rolando" [...] is developed, and it is followed, {{in the course of the}} sixth month, by the other {{principal}} sulci of the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. There is, however, no clear evidence that one of these constantly appears before the other; and it is remarkable that, in the brain at the period described and figured by Ecker (loc. cit. pp. 212-213, Taf. II, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), the antero-temporal sulcus (scissure <b>parallele)</b> so characteristic of the ape's brain, is as well, if not better developed than the fissure of Rolando, and is much more marked than the proper frontal sulci.|$|E
60|$|In like manner, {{the brain}} of a human foetus, at the fifth month, may {{correctly}} be said to be, not only {{the brain of}} an ape, but that of an Arctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, with their great posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian and the calcarine, present the characteristics found only {{in the group of}} the Arctopithecine Primates. But it is equally true, as Gratiolet remarks, that, in its widely open sylvian fissure, it differs from the brain of any actual marmoset. No doubt it would be much more similar to the brain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset. But we know nothing whatever of the development of the brain in the marmosets. In the Platyrrhini proper, the only observation with which I am acquainted is due to Pansch, who found in the brain of a foetal Cebus Apella, in addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure, only a very shallow antero-temporal fissure (scissure <b>parallele</b> of Gratiolet).|$|E
