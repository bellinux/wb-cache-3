As Liechtenstein’s Persons and Companies Act included a <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> in favour of the Landesbank, the government at the time rejected the application by stating the following: [...] "Inasmuch as the founding of a private bank would have a strong impact on {{the interests of the}} Liechtensteinische Landesbank and encroach upon the business field, the petition has been turned down." ...|$|E
60|$|Uncle John {{had secured}} {{considerable}} information from Mr. Watson, and this {{enabled him to}} act comprehensively. The advertising sign business {{in this part of}} the state was controlled by two firms, who contracted directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces secured from the farmers by their wide-awake agents. These signs were contracted for by the year, but the firms controlling the spaces always inserted protective clauses that provided for the removal of any sign when certain conditions required such removal. In such cases a rebate was allowed to the advertiser. This <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> was absolutely necessary in case of fire, alteration or removal of buildings or destruction of fences and sign-boards by weather or the requirements of the owners. It was this saving clause in the contracts of which Uncle John had decided to take advantage. The contracting sign painters were merely in the business to make money.|$|E

40|$|Government {{contracts}} for services typically include terms requiring contractors {{to comply with}} minimum labour standards laws. Procurement contract clauses specify reporting procedures and sanctions for non-compliance, implying that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce minimum labour standards within contract performance management. In this article, the case of school cleaners employed under New South Wales government contracts between 2010 and 2011 is the vehicle for exploring {{the effectiveness of these}} <b>protective</b> <b>clauses.</b> We find that the inclusion of these <b>protective</b> <b>clauses</b> in procurement contracts is unnecessary in the Australian context, and any expectations that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce labour standards are misleading. At best, the clauses are rhetoric, and at worst, they are a distraction for parties with enforcement powers. 17 page(s...|$|R
25|$|In June 1876 {{a meeting}} of chiefs was held at Pakowhai, and Tomoana was its host. The meeting {{expressed}} loyalty to the Queen, but called for unification of the tribes, yearly meetings of chiefs, an increase in Māori members of Parliament, and the reform of Māori land law. Tomoana repeated his 1872 support for the continuance of the Native Land Court, and suggested that fuller use be made of existing <b>protective</b> <b>clauses</b> in Māori land law, saying that Parliament was unlikely to accept new proposals. He was supported by Karaitiana Takamoana and Henare Matua, and advised by John Sheehan, who was soon to become the native minister in government.|$|R
50|$|By {{this time}} the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company {{had been in the}} hands of the Great Western Railway for a year. There were <b>protective</b> <b>clauses</b> in the Act for both the larger companies: the LNWR had access as of right to Newport Docks. The rights only {{extended}} to traffic originating on the Sirhowy Railway, and accordingly the aspiration by the GWR to run Aberdare coal trains over the Sirhowy line was for the time being frustrated, and the planned Nine Mile Point to Caerleon line was therefore pointless, and was dropped. However an amicable agreement was made, and the Aberdare traffic did start running (from Tredegar Junction to Nine Mile Point) from 1 February 1877, and in 1883 the LNWR granted running powers permanently.|$|R

The change of status was reflected by the adoption of this new official name on 21 January 1949. Unification was ratified by a joint Jordanian National Assembly on 24 April 1950 which comprised twenty representatives each from the East and West Bank. The Act of Union contained a <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> which preserved Arab rights in Palestine [...] "without prejudice to any final settlement".|$|E
5000|$|South African {{property}} law regulates the [...] "rights {{of people in}} or over certain objects or things." [...] It is concerned, in other words, with a person's ability to undertake certain actions with certain kinds of objects in accordance with South African law. Among the formal functions of South African {{property law}} is the harmonisation of individual interests in property, the guarantee and protection of individual (and sometimes group) rights with respect to property, and the control of proprietary relationships between persons (both natural and juristic), {{as well as their}} rights and obligations. The <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> for property rights in the Constitution of South Africa stipulates those proprietary relationships which qualify for constitutional protection. The most important social function of property law in South Africa is to manage the competing interests of those who acquire property rights and interests. In recent times, restrictions on the use of and trade in private property have been on the rise.|$|E
40|$|A {{national}} {{resolution to}} alter the educational and practice requirements for nurses by 1985 has been adopted in Oregon. It has been theorized that how nurses organize their multiple roles and the degrees of role deprivation they experience will affect their views toward professional issues. Prior research suggests there be a relationship between certain demographic variables and nurses 2 ̆ 7 role organization and role deprivation. The study sought to establish the relationship of selected demographic variables and the variables of type of role organization and deprivation to nurses 2 ̆ 7 views of four facets of the 1985 Resolution. The intent {{was to examine the}} efficacy of a conceptual model of role organization and deprivation in distinguishing and explaining nurses 2 ̆ 7 views toward the resolution. As a further research contribution to nurse role theory development, the effects of nursing education preparation and length of work experience on the variables of role organization type and role deprivation were examined. The data were obtained by mailed questionnaire using 247 nurses randomly selected in Oregon. Instrumentation included a demographics sheet, a role organization tool, and a questionnaire on the resolution. The data were analyzed using Chi-square crosstabulations and Factorial ANOVA. Oregon nurses were found to be equally divided in their views on two levels of nursing practice and a bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s requirement for entry into professional practice. The majority supported inclusion of a <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> in the resolution for currently licensed nurses and development of a nurse career ladder. The relationship of selected demographic variables to nurses 2 ̆ 7 views on the resolution were examined and established. Significant differences were found among nurses when type of. basic nursing education program and level of nursing education achieved were considered. Baccalaureate nurses more frequently supported two levels of practice and a bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s requirement than did either associate degree or diploma nurses. They were found to differ significantly from associate degree and diploma nurses in their degree of opposition to a <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> in the resolution. Significant differences in views on all resolution items were found when advanced nursing education preparation was considered. As the level of nursing preparation beyond the basic program increased, the degree of support for the two levels of practice and bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s requirement increased and the greater the opposition expressed to both the <b>protective</b> <b>clause</b> and the career ladder. Subjects differed significantly in their views when type of role organization and role deprivation were examined. Nurses with high bureaucratic-high professional allegiances and nurses with low bureaucratic-high professional allegiances were more supportive of the resolution than were nurses with either high bureaucratic-low professionals allegiances or low bureaucratic-low professional allegiances. Nurses {{with a high degree of}} role deprivation were significantly more supportive of the resolution than were nurses with low role deprivation. The main and interaction effects of type of nursing preparation and length of work experience on the degrees of professional allegiance, bureaucratic allegiance, and role deprivation revealed that bureaucratic allegiance increases with work experience. No effect of the two variables on degree of role deprivation was found. Type of nursing program and length of work experience were found to interact and significantly affect the degree of professional allegiance. As length of work experience increased for associate degree and baccalaureate nurses, professional allegiance declined. Allegiance to professional ideals was found to increase with length of work experience for diploma nurses. The relationship of demographic and role organization variables to nurses• views on selected issues was established in the study. Role organization type, role deprivation, type of nursing preparation, and extent of nursing education are associated with nurses views toward the resolution...|$|E
40|$|For the European Union, the {{question}} and the Future of Social Security Law, comes at critical moment: the natural tendency for creation new barriers that is inherent for each national welfare state as an international threshold of inequity has been even enhanced by pending European integration. All mature European welfare states are restrictive and every nation has filters which separates out desirable migrants {{in terms of their}} labour market potential. This article proves that neither old member states, nor the new ones are an exception. In our comparison, German social assistance scheme (especially the special Law on Social Benefits for Asylum-Seekers) guarantees, thanks to the active Constitutional Court, better positions for migrants than respective Czech laws. Even so, German laws set forth enough <b>protective</b> <b>clauses</b> to being able marginalised asylum-seekers as in the Czech Republic or any other member state of the EEA.

5000|$|In 1919, Thérèse Vitali, comtesse de Beauchamp, {{acquired}} {{the property and}} commissioned modifications. The American architect Ogden Codman, Jr. purchased the dozen existing structures {{that made up the}} property including two peasant cottages, and began his architectural magnum opus in 1929. It was complete by 1931, however financial difficulties (and his lavish expenditures) precluded his being able to live in it, so he rented it out to various well-heeled tenants. One famous English couple tried to lease it, but insisted on making changes that were contrary to Codman's aesthetic objectives and strict list of <b>protective</b> <b>clauses.</b> Negotiations in a Paris Hotel room broke down over the many restrictions Codman imposed, and Ogden's response was: [...] "I regret that the House of Codman is unable to do business with the House of Windsor." [...] Codman's extensive designs and construction gave the estate, once a series of unrelated buildings, its current appearance. His neo-Palladian vision, coupled with his in-depth knowledge of historical precedent, resulted in the construction of a spectacular villa with extensive gardens and landscaping. Floor plans, letters, records, and stereo glass-plate views of the newly completed property still exist in the collections of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (aka [...] "Historic New England") [...] At Codman's death in 1951 the estate was sold to Izaak Walton Killam whose wife inherited the place after his death. In the later 1950s she sold it to Fiat president Gianni Agnelli (1921-2003) and Marella Agnelli.|$|R
40|$|Defense date: 27 / 11 / 2010 Examining Board: Pierre-Marie DUPUY (former EUI, Institut de hautes études internationales et du développement, Genève), Francesco FRANCIONI (Supervisor, EUI), Tom HADDEN (School of Law, Queen's University Belfast), Giovanni SARTOR (EUI) This thesis {{analyses}} {{the general}} restrictions {{to the exercise}} {{of human rights in}} three parts; dealing respectively with the limits of individual rights and the aim and specificity of general restrictions, states of emergency, and abuses of rights. It analyses the distinctive position of human rights norms in the general architecture of the international system and reconstructs the concept of individual rights along those lines. It, then, compares the different means by which states can limit their obligations under international law. It highlights the need to regard these suspiciously and not to allow them, whenever it can be prevented. The main claim is that, in view of the distinctiveness of human rights treaties, only restrictions aimed at ensuring a better protection and more stringent respect of these rights should be admissible. It argues that only the general <b>protective</b> <b>clauses</b> allowing limitations in states of emergency and prohibiting abuses of rights fulfil this purpose. In this regard, it singles out the latter general clause as the main guarantee on which rest the different conventions, as well as the only justifiable limit to recognised rights. Besides, it defends that even these dispositions should be strictly construed, in order to respect both their protective nature and the wording of the international treaties in which they are inserted. For this, they need to satisfy a number of conditions related to the exceptional measures’ trigger and the content and extent of the restrictions. Different types of guarantees must also be provided. Finally, it further studies the corollary question of the horizontal application of human rights provisions in interpersonal relations...|$|R
