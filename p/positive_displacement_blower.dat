In case of opting for air vacuum excavation, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Displacement</b> <b>Blower</b> should be {{properly}} checked because it can move great volumes of air and a malfunctioning can cause a serious accident.

50|$|Two-stroke {{diesel engine}} {{operation}} {{is similar to}} that of petrol counterparts, except that fuel is not mixed with air before induction, and the crankcase does not take an active role in the cycle. The traditional two-stroke design relies upon a mechanically driven <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>blower</b> to charge the cylinders with air before compression and ignition. The charging process also assists in expelling (scavenging) combustion gases remaining from the previous power stroke.|$|E
50|$|As a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} {{is incapable of}} natural aspiration as defined above, some method of charging the cylinders with scavenging air must {{be integrated into the}} engine design. This is usually achieved with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>blower</b> driven by the crankshaft. The blower does not act as a supercharger in this application, as it is sized to produce a volume of air flow that is in direct proportion to engine's requirement for combustion, at a given power and speed. By the Society of Automotive Engineer's definition, a mechanically scavenged two-stroke diesel engine is considered to be naturally aspirated.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of superchargers defined {{according}} to the method of gas transfer: <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> and dynamic compressors. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>blowers</b> and compressors deliver an almost constant level of pressure increase at all engine speeds (RPM). Dynamic compressors do not deliver pressure at low speeds; above a threshold speed, pressure increases with engine speed.|$|R

In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler included a Roots-style blower in a patented engine design, making the Roots-type blower {{the oldest of the}} various designs now available. Roots blowers are commonly referred to as air <b>blowers</b> or PD (<b>positive</b> <b>displacement)</b> <b>blowers,</b> and can be commonly called [...] "huffers" [...] when used with the gasoline-burning engines in hot rod customized cars.|$|R
50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors or radial compressors. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT).

The two exhaust rate curves obtained by the semi-empirical method and the simulation were compared, and the differences were analysed by showing pressure contours and velocity vectors at differentmoments in oneworking period. The simulation results showed the exhaust rate hav-ing two V-type fluctuations, whereas the semi-empirical method shows the exhaust rate having only one V-type fluctuation. These differences are due to pressure fluctuations {{and the existence of}} a vortex in the mixing zone...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests of a Power plus supercharger and a comparison of its performance with the performance previously obtained with an N. A. C. A. Roots-type supercharger. The Powerplus supercharger is a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>blower</b> of the vane type having mechanically operated vanes, the movement of which is controlled by slots and eccentrics. The supercharger was tested at a range of pressure differences from 0 to 15 inches of mercury and at speeds from 500 to 2, 500 r. p. m. The pressure difference across the supercharger was obtained by throttling the intake of a depression tank which was interposed in the air duct between the supercharger and the Durley orifice box used for measuring the air. The results of these tests show that at low pressure differences and at all speeds the power required by the Powerplus supercharger to compress a definite quantity of air per second is considerably higher than that required by the Roots. At pressure differences from 10 to 14 inches of mercury and at speeds over 2, 000 r. p. m. the power requirements of the two superchargers are practically the same. At a pressure difference of 15 inches of mercury or greater and at a speed of 2, 500 r. p. m. or greater the performance of the Powerplus supercharger is slightly better than that of the Roots. Because the Powerplus supercharger cannot be operated at a speed greater than 3, 000 r. p. m. as compared with 7, 000 r. p. m. for the Roots, its capacity is approximately one-half that of the Roots for the same bulk. The Powerplus supercharger is more complicated and less reliable than the Roots supercharger...|$|E
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump.

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps...|$|R

50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> {{pumps are}} the most {{effective}} for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{are the most}} common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|R
