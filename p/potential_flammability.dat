Alloys of magnesium were later developed to alleviate most of these problems.

When a gas {{accumulation}} is included in the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) and Upper Flammable Limit (UFL) with a presence of flame, this gas accumulation explodes and this phenomenon called eruptive fire. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} volatiles organics compounds biogenic (VOCb) form a gas accumulation in front of fire. This gas accumulation was formed by VOCb in special geographical zone. The combination of these two factors may lead up to situations with great <b>potential</b> of <b>flammability,</b> which provoke high risk for the firefighters. No less 9 cases were reported for 15 years ago in France with 16 fatalities for the firefighters. The hypothesis of our works comes from the simple fact of back experiences. Our study was realised on Pinus laricio, a important species of France. The analyses were carried out at the laboratory using an Automatic Thermal Desorber coupled coupled Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (ATD-GC/MS). The plants were warmed on ATD oven at different temperatures: 50, 80, 120, 150, 190 and 200 °C. The terpenic proportion increases when the temperature increase until it reaches a critical temperature to 175 °C. The volatile quantity was multiplied by five greater to 50 °C at 175 °C for Pinus laricio. α-pinene, the major component, was emitted 7 times more to 50 °C at 175 °C.

One of the factors required for an eruptive fire to take place is that BVOC concentrations must be between their lower flammable limit and upper flammable limit. When this accumulation of BVOCs is exacerbated by specific geographical zones (e. g. small valleys, thalwegs, canyons), the combination of these two factors can lead to situations with a very high <b>flammability</b> <b>potential,</b> representing a considerable risk for firefighters.

Simulations are conducted under constant condensing temperature/pressure and various cycle pressure ratios (PR) for 24 organic thermofluids including Hydrocarbons (HCs), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) and Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). Special attention {{is given to the}} influence of PR and fluids’ physical properties on the solar ORC performance as well as fluids’ environmental and safety impacts including global warming <b>potential</b> (GWP), <b>flammability</b> and toxicity. The simulation results indicate that when the same fluid is considered, pressure ratio of the cycle leads to various operating conditions such as collector (evaporating) pressure which results in various collector, expander and cycle efficiency. For instance, increasing the pressure ratio of the cycle enhances the net work output and the thermal efficiency of the cycle, whereas it decreases the flat plate collector efficiency. The results also indicate that the proposed system produces the maximum net work output of 210. 45 W with a thermal efficiency of 9. 64 % by using 1 -butene. Furthermore, trans- 2 -butene, cis- 2 -butene, R 600, R 600 a, R 601, R 601 a and neopentane (HC), R 227 ea and R 236 fa (HFC), RC 318 (PFC) and R 1234 ze (HFO) show promising solar ORC thermal performances. However, the flammability problem of HCs and global warming potential issue of HFCs and PFCs limit their applications, owing to the safety and environmental concerns.

The mandatory phase out of R 134 a as refrigerant in the European Union has set the stage for new systems and alternative refrigerants. While some of these refrigerants, such as R 152 a or R 290, have a low Global Warming <b>Potential,</b> their <b>flammability</b> requires secondary loop systems to be used. The added thermal mass of such systems may increase power consumption and delay cool down while benefitting thermal comfort during start/stop operation.

This research focuses on the performance evaluation of refrigerants R 152 a and R 290 during transient operation in secondary loop systems, quantification of thermal storage benefits for start/stop operation, and investigation of energy saving potentials in electric vehicles through the use of advanced air-conditioning system controls and cabin preconditioning. A test facility was built to dynamically test secondary loop systems over a wide range of pull down conditions and drive cycles using a passenger cabin model and associated controls. It was shown that R 290 is a viable alternative in secondary loop systems and system performance may be on par or better compared to R 134 a direct expansion systems. The preservation of cooling capacity and thermal comfort during off-cycle periods were quantified for a secondary loop system, as well as a combined ice storage system. System efficiency increases with longer off-cycle periods compared to direct expansion systems. Advanced compressor control strategies and the use of cabin preconditioning can make use of this characteristic and improve energy efficiency by more than 50 %. Ice storage may be used in combination with cabin preconditioning to preserve comfort for an extended driving time with reduced use of the vapor compression cycle.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composites (FRP) {{have been}} gaining much attention recently {{because of their}} use in load carrying parts of new aircraft such as Boeing 787 and in non-aerospace applications such as in ships, in retrofitting of structurally deficient bridges, and transportation. Besides this, composite structures in service are typically subjected to different environmental conditions, which may affect their mechanical performance {{as well as their}} <b>flammability</b> <b>potential.</b> Water that diffuses in to the composite ends up either in the matrix or at the interphase region. In the matrix, water would act as a plasticizer, increasing the free volume, lowering the glass transition temperature (Tg), and relieving the internal stresses that was built up during processing of the composite. In many cases failures occurs in the interface region due to chemical reactions/plasticizing when impurities (commonly water) penetrate the interface. The continuous change in interfacial chemistry and character under the influence of various environment often leads to a micro changes such as increase of internal voids of the entangling polymer chain, fiber/matrix interfacial bond failure and microcrack formation in to the matrix. Recently an active area of investigation related to this work is being explored by Temperature Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy(FTIR-Imaging),Ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV),techniques to pin down the causes for a reduce stress transmissibility at the interface. Surface treated glass fiber, carbon fiber and epoxy matrix were used to fabricate micro-composite. Change in FTIR spectra shows alternation and deviation of stoichiometry. The analysis of these suggests that there is a variation in the chemical structure of the matrix from the fiber to the polymer bulk due to different conversions arising from a gradient in the initial composition. And in TMDSC the focus has been emphasized on Tg value which increases when hygrothermal treatment duration is less because of formation of double hydrogen bond and replacing the covalent bond.

40|$|DWPF {{recently}} {{decided to}} control the <b>potential</b> <b>flammability</b> of melter off-gas by limiting the total carbon content in the melter feed and maintaining adequate conditions for combustion in the melter plenum. With this new strategy, all the LFL analyzers and associated interlocks and alarms were removed from both the primary and backup melter off-gas systems. Subsequently, D. Iverson of DWPF- T{ampersand}E requested that SRTC determine the maximum allowable total organic carbon (TOC) content in the melter feed which can be implemented {{as part of the}} Process Requirements for melter feed preparation (PR-S 04). The maximum TOC limit thus determined in this study was about 24, 000 ppm on an aqueous slurry basis. At the TOC levels below this, the peak concentration of combustible components in the quenched off-gas will not exceed 60 percent of the LFL during off-gas surges of magnitudes up to three times nominal, provided that the melter plenum temperature and the air purge rate to the BUFC are monitored and controlled above 650 degrees C and 220 lb/hr, respectively. Appropriate interlocks should discontinue the feeding when one or both of these conditions are not met. Both the magnitude and duration of an off-gas surge {{have a major impact on}} the maximum TOC limit, since they directly affect the melter plenum temperature and combustion. Although the data obtained during recent DWPF melter startup tests showed that the peak magnitude of a surge can be greater than three times nominal, the observed duration was considerably shorter, on the order of several seconds. The long surge duration assumed in this study has a greater impact on the plenum temperature than the peak magnitude, thus making the maximum TOC estimate conservative. Two models were used to make the necessary calculations to determine the TOC limit...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this project}} {{is to develop a}} hydrocarbon-based (ER 12) refrigerant that has a lower flammability limit in excess of 5 % refrigerant in air. Optimisation of the hydrocarbon content in the mixture, favourable refrigeration properties, minimal toxicity and benign environmental impact form additional constraints. A variety of compounds were considered as <b>potential</b> <b>flammability</b> reducing additives. The flammability of the various mixtures was evaluated using the tubular flame burner technique. The compounds tested in the initial screening study included CO 2, CF 3 I, CHF 2 Cl (R 22), C 3 HF 7 (R 227 ea), C 3 F 8 (R 218), C 4 F 10 (R 3110), C 4 F 8 O, SF 6, CBr 2 F 2, 1 -bromopropane, 2 -bromopropane, CH 2 Br 2 and CH 2 BrCl. Strong flammability reduction performance was observed for CBr 2 F 2, CH 2 Br 2, CF 3 I, C 4 F 10, SF 6 and C 3 F 8. Less effective compounds included CO 2, C 3 HF 7 (R 227 ea), CHF 2 Cl (R 22), C 4 F 8 O, and CH 2 BrCl. Estimation of potential non-flammable ER 12 /additive compositions based on the flammability tests revealed the best additives to be CBr 2 F 2, CH 2 Br 2 and CH 2 Br 2 each with an ER 12 content above 20 mass percent. It is concluded that a practical single additive/ER 12 mixture with higher than 20 % ER 12 content is unlikely. Compounds containing bromine and iodine possess superior chemical suppression effectiveness with the strength of that effect increasing in proportion to the level of bromination/iodination. Highly fluorinated compounds have excellent suppression efficiency due to the relatively low atomic weight of fluorine. The presence of hydrogen in an additive compound dramatically reduces the suppression efficiency. Inclusion of oxygen and sulphur in compounds can potentially give very good flammability reduction effects. The major environmental and parameters of atmospheric lifetime, ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) were compiled for the screened and targeted additive compounds, with some of the more favourable species shown to possess relatively high atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential despite having zero ozone depleting effect. The toxicological and safety aspects of the compounds are also discussed as an additional means of evaluation of potential additives...|$|E

The grouting process is exothermic, which should accelerate the rate of decomposition of TPB precipitates eventually to benzene. Because the vault is not currently outfitted with an active ventilation system, there is a concern that a mixture of flammable gases may form in the vapor space of each cell filled with the curing grout. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if passive breathing induced by the diurnal fluctuations of barometric pressure would provide any mitigating measure against <b>potential</b> <b>flammability</b> in the cell vapor space. In Revision 0 of this document, a set of algorithms were presented that would predict the equilibrium concentration of benzene in the cell vapor space as a function of benzene generation rate, fill height, and passive breathing rate. The algorithms were derived based on several simplifying assumptions so that order of magnitude estimates could be made quickly for scoping purposes. In particular, it was assumed that passive breathing would occur solely due to barometric pressure fluctuations that were sinusoidal; the resulting algorithm for estimating the rate of passive breathing into or out of each cell is given in Eq. (10). Since Revision 0 was issued, the validity of this critical assumption on the mode of passive breathing was checked against available passive ventilation data for the Hanford waste tanks. It was found that the passive breathing rates estimated from Eq. (10) were on average 50 to 90 % lower than those measured for 5 out of 6 Hanford tanks considered in this study (see Table 1); for Tank U- 106, the estimated passive breathing rates were on average 20 % lower than the measured data. These results indicate that Eq. (10) would most likely under predict passive breathing rates of the Saltstone vault. At a given fill height and benzene generation rate, under predicted breathing rates would in turn make the benzene concentration projections in the cell vapor space conservatively high, thus rendering the overall flammability assessment conservative. The results of this validation effort are summarized in Section 2. 4 of this revision. It is to be noted that all the algorithms, numerical results and conclusions made in Revision 0 remain valid. In this work, the algorithms for estimating the equilibrium benzene concentration for a given scenario were derived by combining the asymptotic solutions to the transient mass balance equations for the exhaling and inhaling modes in a 24 -hour period. These algorithms were then applied to simulate several test cases, including the baseline case where the cell was filled to the maximum height of 25 ft at the bulk benzene generation rate of 3. 4 g/hr...|$|E
40|$|Glycolic {{acid and}} sugar are being {{considered}} as potential candidates {{to substitute for}} much of the formic acid currently being added to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed as a reductant. A series of small-scale melter tests were conducted at the Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) in January 2011 to collect necessary data for the assessment of the impact of these alternate reductants on the melter off-gas flammability. The DM 10 melter with a 0. 021 m{sup 2 } melt surface area was run with three different feeds which were prepared at SRNL based on; (1) the baseline formic/nitric acid flowsheet, (2) glycolic/formic/nitric acid flowsheet, and (3) sugar/formic/nitric acid flowsheet - these feeds will be called the baseline, glycolic, and sugar flowsheet feeds, respectively, hereafter. The actual addition of sugar to the sugar flowsheet feed was made at VSL before it was fed to the melter. For each feed, the DM 10 was run under both bubbled (with argon) and non-bubbled conditions at varying melter vapor space temperatures. The goal was to lower its vapor space temperature from nominal 500 C to less than 300 C at 50 C increments and maintain steady state at each temperature at least for one hour, preferentially for two hours, while collecting off-gas data including CO, CO{sub 2 }, and H{sub 2 } concentrations. Just a few hours into the first test with the baseline feed, it was discovered that the DM 10 vapor space temperature would not readily fall below 350 C simply by ramping up the feed rate as the test plan called for. To overcome this, ambient air was introduced directly into the vapor space through a dilution air damper in addition to the natural air inleakage occurring at the operating melter pressure of - 1 inch H{sub 2 }O. A detailed description of the DM 10 run along with all the data taken is given in the report issued by VSL. The SRNL personnel have analyzed the DM 10 data and identified 25 steady state periods lasting from 32 to 92 minutes for all six melter runs (bubbled and non-bubbled runs {{for each of the three}} feeds). The steady state selection was made by limiting the standard deviation of the average vapor space temperature readings from two bare thermocouples (TT- 03 and TT- 05) to less than 5 C in most cases at a constant feed rate. The steady state data thus selected were mass and heat balanced and the off-gas data were re-baselined to assess the <b>flammability</b> <b>potential</b> of each feed under the DWPF melter operating conditions. Efforts were made to extract as much information out of the data as possible necessary to extend the applicability of the existing baseline cold cap and off-gas combustion models to the glycolic and sugar flowsheet feeds.

40|$|The Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) {{portfolio}} of projects provides the infrastructure within existing Liquid Waste facilities {{to support the}} startup and long term operation of the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF). Within SDI, the Blend and Feed Project will equip existing waste tanks in the Tank Farms to serve as Blend Tanks where 300, 000 - 800, 000 gallons of salt solution will be blended in 1. 3 million gallon tanks and qualified for use as feedstock for SWPF. Blending requires the miscible salt solutions from potentially multiple source tanks per batch to be well mixed without disturbing settled sludge solids that may be present in a Blend Tank. Disturbing solids may be problematic both from a feed quality perspective {{as well as from}} a process safety perspective where hydrogen release from the sludge is a <b>potential</b> <b>flammability</b> concern. To develop the necessary technical basis for the design and operation of blending equipment, Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) completed scaled blending and transfer pump tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. A 94 inch diameter pilot-scale blending tank, including tank internals such as the blending pump, transfer pump, removable cooling coils, and center column, were used in this research. The test tank represents a 1 / 10. 85 scaled version of an 85 foot diameter, Type IIIA, nuclear waste tank that may be typical of Blend Tanks used in SDI. Specifically, Tank 50 was selected as the tank to be modeled per the SRR, Project Engineering Manager. SRNL blending tests investigated various fixed position, non-rotating, dual nozzle pump designs, including a blending pump model provided by the blend pump vendor, Curtiss Wright (CW). Primary research goals were to assess blending times and to evaluate incipient sludge disturbance for waste tanks. Incipient sludge disturbance was defined by SRR and SRNL as minor blending of settled sludge from the tank bottom into suspension due to blending pump operation, where the sludge level was shown to remain constant. To experimentally model the sludge layer, a very thin, pourable, sludge simulant was conservatively used for all testing. To experimentally model the liquid, supernate layer above the sludge in waste tanks, two salt solution simulants were used, which provided a bounding range of supernate properties. One solution was water (H{sub 2 }O + NaOH), and the other was an inhibited, more viscous salt solution. The research performed and data obtained significantly advances the understanding of fluid mechanics, mixing theory and CFD modeling for nuclear waste tanks by benchmarking CFD results to actual experimental data. This research significantly bridges the gap between previous CFD models and actual field experiences in real waste tanks. A finding of the 2009, DOE, Slurry Retrieval, Pipeline Transport and Plugging, and Mixing Workshop was that CFD models were inadequate to assess blending processes in nuclear waste tanks. One recommendation from that Workshop was that a validation, or bench marking program be performed for CFD modeling versus experiment. This research provided experimental data to validate and correct CFD models as they apply to mixing and blending in nuclear waste tanks. Extensive SDI research was a significant step toward bench marking and applying CFD modeling. This research showed that CFD models not only agreed with experiment, but demonstrated that the large variance in actual experimental data accounts for misunderstood discrepancies between CFD models and experiments. Having documented this finding, SRNL was able to provide correction factors to be used with CFD models to statistically bound full scale CFD results. Through the use of pilot scale tests performed for both types of pumps and available engineering literature, SRNL demonstrated how to effectively apply CFD results to salt batch mixing in full scale waste tanks. In other words, CFD models were in error prior to development of experimental correction factors determined during this research, which provided a technique to use CFD models for salt batch mixing and transfer pump operations. This major scientific advance in mixing technology resulted in multi-million dollar cost savings to SRR. New techniques were developed for both experiment and analysis to complete this research. Supporting this success, research findings are summarized in the Conclusions section of this report, and technical recommendations for design and operation are included in this section of the report...|$|E
