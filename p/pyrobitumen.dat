5000|$|Some archaic {{definitions}} of <b>pyrobitumen</b> include peat and lignite, although these materials experienced little geological heating {{compared to that}} required to form fluid bitumen, let alone <b>pyrobitumen.</b> For humic-derived solids in the earth, an analogous position on the coal maturation pathway would place it at a minimum in the medium-volatile bituminous range (i.e., H/C<0.8, O/C<0.05, and vitrinite reflectance >1.0%)., [...] For petroleum systems, Mukhopadhyay states that solid bitumen starts to form when vitrinite reflectance reaches 0.45%, i.e., {{the early stages of}} conversion of kerogen to oil and gas. Bitumen also becomes more reflective with maturity, and he gives an equivalent bitumen reflectance of 0.6% for a vitrinite reflectance of 1.0%, which corresponds to the boundary between asphalt/albertite and epi-impsonite. Although the archaic definition of <b>pyrobitumen</b> includes low-maturity solid bitumens such as albertite, a definition more closely linked to the formation and destruction of oil from kerogen would define <b>pyrobitumen</b> as having an H/C ratio less than 1.0. In fact, the Biomarker Guide defines <b>pyrobitumen</b> as having an H/C ratio less than 0.5, which corresponds to vitrinite reflectance of about 2.0% and low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite coal rank. Hwang et al. found that the solubility of solid reservoir bitumens decreased below 50% for a vitrinite reflectance of 0.7% and below 20% for vitrinite reflectance greater than 1.0%, with a vitrinite reflectance of 1.1% corresponding to an atomic H/C ratio of 0.8. Warner et al. also found <b>pyrobitumen</b> in the Tengiz field with H/C of 0.8. They also quote it as having a high reflectivity, including the occurrence of mosaic reflectivity texture. Pyrolysis yielded some oil similar to that from which it was derived. Bordenave describes <b>pyrobitumen</b> as having a reflectivity of between 1.5 and 2.5% and a pyrolysis yield of less than 80 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. From these descriptions and other pyrolysis studies, it becomes clear that the H/C ratio of 0.5 given by Peters corresponds to the end of such pyrolysis yield, even though the bitumen becomes insoluble, and therefore <b>pyrobitumen,</b> prior to that maturity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{the first}} time {{anomalies}} in the behaviour of cerium and europium simultaneously among other REE are discovered in the processes of sedimentation. ” The reasons of differentiation of certain lanthanides {{in the composition of}} REE and fractioning of REE in reef deposits fractions are considered with the presence of hydrocarbons of oil and gas as the main components affecting the stabilization of an unusual valence state of certain lanthanides able to change valence depending on the oxidation-reduction conditions in sedimentary cycle. According to the recorded anomalies of certain lanthanides in the range of REE the arguments are given supporting the possibility of REE isomorphism occurrence with the displacement of Ca and Mg by Nd and Tb and yttrium by holmium. Also the possible factors are considered defining relationship of REE with the derivatives of oils and bitumoids, namely with their high-molecular compounds (tars, oils and <b>pyrobitumens</b> containing N, S and O).

50|$|The terms bitumen and <b>pyrobitumen</b> have related {{definitions}} in the earth’s {{crust and}} in the laboratory. In geology, bitumen {{is the product of}} deposition and maturation of organic matter, and the extractable organic material (EOM) by organic solvents in petroleum source rocks and reservoir rocks is defined as bitumen. Upon exposure to high regional temperatures over geological time, bitumen is converted to <b>pyrobitumen</b> {{as a result of the}} thermally activated reactions that drive off lighter oil and gas products and leave an insoluble, carbon-rich residue. <b>Pyrobitumen</b> represents a significant fraction of the ultimate fate of petroleum liquids formed from kerogen during catagenesis. In the laboratory, experiments on organic-rich rocks (oil shales and petroleum source rocks), decomposition of the initially insoluble organic matter (defined as kerogen) produces gaseous and liquid products. The soluble fluid that remains in the heated rock is defined as bitumen. Upon further thermal exposure, the bitumen continues to evolve and disproportionates into <b>pyrobitumen</b> and more oil and gas.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} not a direct {{relationship}} between the classification systems in Figures 1 and 2, one kind of <b>pyrobitumen</b> is a subset of the post-oil solid bitumen formed by thermal degradation of kerogen and oil. Of the 27 samples investigated by Curiale, the three impsonite samples had the low solubility (<3%) and low H/C ratio (<0.9) characteristic of highly mature organic matter. These samples also had lowest asphaltene, highest aromatic, and highest volatile content in the soluble fraction. Carbon deposits associated with uranium nodules also had low solubilities and H/C ratios less than 1.0 and correspond to pyrobitumens with inorganic origins. For comparison, coal tar pitch has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.8.In the petroleum geochemistry community, <b>pyrobitumen</b> is the remains of thermally altered oil that was previously generated during kerogen maturation—much of that oil migrated to and accumulated in an oil reservoir. Petrographic studies of residues of hydrous pyrolysis, which {{is considered to be a}} good laboratory simulation of natural petroleum formation, show the formation of a continuous bituminous network during the early stages of kerogen transformation, some of which is converted to <b>pyrobitumen</b> at high thermal exposure. This definition is consistent with that given for <b>pyrobitumen</b> in the Society of Petroleum Engineers Glossary: “a hard, native asphalt within the rock pores. Does not ordinarily move or enter into reaction.” [...] Hunt uses this definition of thermally mature residue to calculate material balances for the fate of oil at very high maturities, both that retained in the source rock and that from reservoirs. <b>Pyrobitumen</b> in thermally mature oil reservoirs has been characterized by Hwang. [...] More recently, the <b>pyrobitumen</b> retained in the source rock is considered to play an important role in the storage and production of shale gas. [...] In oil shale retorting, <b>pyrobitumen</b> residue has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.5 and is often called coke, which has its analog in the production of petroleum and coal cokes by destructive distillation.|$|E
50|$|While {{the primary}} {{distinction}} between bitumen and <b>pyrobitumen</b> is solubility, the thermal processes driving the molecular cross-linking also decrease the atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon from greater than one {{to less than}} one and ultimately to approximately one half. It should also be understood that both solubility and atomic H/C ratios form a continuum, and most solid bitumens have both soluble and insoluble components. The distinction between <b>pyrobitumen</b> and residual kerogen in a mature source rock is based on microscopic evidence of fluid flow within the rock fabric and is usually not determined.|$|E
5000|$|Hunt defines bitumen {{as native}} {{substance}} of variable color, viscosity, and volatility composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. He further defines petroleum {{as a form}} of bitumen that is gaseous or liquid in the reservoir and can be produced through a pipe. Other bitumens range from very viscous (e.g., Athabasca and Venezuelan heavy oils, La Brea tar pits) to solid (e.g. gilsonite, ozocerite, grahamite, impsonite). <b>Pyrobitumen</b> is formed by thermal decomposition and molecular cross-linking of bitumen. <b>Pyrobitumen</b> is distinguished from other solid bitumens extruded from early-mature kerogen-rich source rocks (e.g., gilsonite) and semi-solid bitumens in high viscosity oil sands formed by water washing and biodegradation of conventional oil (e.g., Athabasca bituminous sands), all of which are soluble in carbon disulfide.|$|E
50|$|Archaic {{classification}} {{systems for}} classifying bitumens were constructed without the extensive knowledge of organic geochemistry {{developed over the}} past 50 years. <b>Pyrobitumen</b> was originally defined a solid bitumen that is insoluble and infusible. The original classification system for solid bitumen of Abraham, as adapted from Curiale, is shown in Figure 1. Curiale says that while the historical classification scheme is useful for sorting museum collections, it is not useful for establishing genetic relationships, and he proposed the alternative classification shown in Figure 2.|$|E
50|$|Impsonite is a black, {{carbonaceous}} substance, with {{a specific}} gravity of 1.10-1.25 and a carbon content of 50-85%. It is described as an asphaltic <b>pyrobitumen.</b> It {{is believed to be}} derived from a fluid bitumen which polymerized after filling a vein.The term was coined by George Homans Eldridge in 1901, referring to the asphaltic material in the Impson Valley in southeastern Oklahoma, later known as the Jumbo mine. The asphaltic material in the Impson Valley was later reclassified as grahamite, based on solubility and chemical similarities with the type grahamite of West Virginia.|$|E
30|$|A {{study of}} {{reaction}} mechanisms and chemical kinetics of pressurized pyrolysis of Chinese Liushuhe oil shale {{in the presence}} of water were conducted using an autoclave for simulating and modeling in-situ underground thermal degradation. It was found that the oil shale was first pyrolyzed to form <b>pyrobitumen,</b> shale oil, shale gas and residue, then the <b>pyrobitumen</b> was further pyrolyzed to form more shale oil, shale gas, and residue. It means that there are two consecutive and parallel reactions. With increasing temperature, the <b>pyrobitumen</b> yield, as intermediate, first reached a maximum, then decreased to approximately zero. The kinetics results show that both these reactions are first order. The activation energy of <b>pyrobitumen</b> formation from oil shale is lower than that of shale oil formation from <b>pyrobitumen.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyrobitumen</b> {{resulting}} from the thermal cracking of crude oil is a frequent occurrence in petroleum reservoirs. Despite the detrimental implications of <b>pyrobitumen</b> for the poroperm qualities of the reservoir; {{little is known about}} the evolution of <b>pyrobitumen</b> properties as a function of increasing thermal stress. A suite of pyrobitumen-bearing reservoir cores from the carbonate Jurassic Pinda formation in offshore Angola has been studied using geochemical and petrographic techniques (including elemental analysis, Rock Eval pyrolysis, GC, FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM) in order to characterise the physical, chemical, and optical properties of the <b>pyrobitumen</b> as fully as possible. The 11 core samples contain <b>pyrobitumen</b> at reflectance values ranging from 0. 55 - 2. 24 %Ro and display varying degrees of solubility in dichloromethane from 98 % insoluble bitumen to 45 % insoluble, indicating a substantial spread of maturity. However, these indicators of maturity, and further classical maturity indicators such as the H/C and Tmax show surprisingly poor mutual agreement...|$|E
40|$|High-grade {{gold and}} uranium {{mineralization}} in the Witwatersrand basin is intimately associated with <b>pyrobitumen,</b> implying that hydrocarbons {{may have played}} a role in the genesis of these ores. The nature of the <b>pyrobitumen</b> in the Carbon Leader Reef was therefore investigated to determine if hydrocarbons were essential to the ore-forming process. The relative proportions of trace elements in <b>pyrobitumen</b> seams and nodules are, in large part, similar to those of organic-rich shales located within the sedimentary succession. This indicates a strong genetic relationship between the <b>pyrobitumen</b> and the shales. A network of veins and veinlets filled with <b>pyrobitumen,</b> and the occurrence of oil inclusions in detrital and authigenic quartz grains, provide compelling evidence that the <b>pyrobitumen</b> was derived from a mobile (liquid hydrocarbon) precursor that circulated in the Carbon Leader Reef. Uranium, Au, Sb, Pb, Ag, Te, Th, Bi, Se and W are enriched relative to their concentrations in the shales. This is particularly the case for U and Au. The pervasive and relatively homogeneous distribution of the uranium is consistent with the presence of ubiquitous, submicroscopic uraninite in the <b>pyrobitumen</b> documented in an earlier study. In contrast, the distribution of the gold is heterogeneous, indicating the presence of irregularly distributed gold micrograins. These grains are concentrated mainly in the interstices between <b>pyrobitumen</b> nodules. Secondary minerals, such as brannerite, monazite-(Ce) and galena, are also concentrated in these interstices. On the basis of this study, we propose that intrabasinal shale units of the Witwatersrand Supergroup were the source for the <b>pyrobitumen</b> in the Carbon Leader Reef. These shales produced and released liquid hydrocarbons during the burial of the sedimentary succession. Phyllosilicates enriched in trace metals were transferred from the shales into the newly produced liquid hydrocarbons and were transported stratigraphically upward by the latter into the Carbon Leader Reef. During migration, the liquid hydrocarbons dissolved detrital uraninite present in the basin, adding to the uranium budget. The liquid hydrocarbons were converted into <b>pyrobitumen</b> in response to further burial, and precipitated uraninite nanocrystals. Post-depositional, hydrothermal fluids interacted with the hydrocarbons and deposited gold by reduction on hydrocarbon surfaces. The interaction of these fluids with the hydrocarbons may have released U, Th, REE, Pb and Ti from the hydrocarbons and triggered the formation of secondary brannerite, monazite-(Ce) and galena. The results of this study provide convincing evidence that the hydrocarbon liquids that formed the <b>pyrobitumen</b> seams in the Carbon Leader Reef played an essential role in the remobilization and redeposition of uranium and gold, respectively, in the Witwatersrand Supergroup...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyrobitumen</b> is solid, {{insoluble}} bitumen {{originating from}} the thermal degradation of liquid oil (Jacob 1993). Prospecting for petroleum in deep, hot reservoirs {{increases the risk}} that the reservoir will contain <b>pyrobitumen</b> which acts as a porosity and permeability-reducing cement and is thus considered highly detrimental to reservoir quality (Lorenz 1998). Due to its relatively low density, it also leads to incorrect wireline log estimates of the oil in place (Elkins 2001). The aim of this work was to determine the <b>pyrobitumen</b> formation potential of immature, heavy type II oil and its constituents as a result of thermal cracking. Closed system gold tube pyrolysis was used to artificially mature asphaltic oil (Boscan, Venezuela) at temperatures from 300 - 550 °C for 4 hours. Samples of the same oil were fractionated into saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) components which were pyrolysed isothermally under the same conditions as for the whole oil. At 500 °C all fractions produced <b>pyrobitumen</b> although asphaltenes yield more insoluble residue (62 %wt) compared to saturates (19 %wt). In addition the asphaltene and resin fractions produced <b>pyrobitumen</b> at lower temperature than the aromatics and saturates. Petrographic analysis of the insoluble residues indicates that reflectance evolution and graphitizing potential vary according to the composition of the oil precursor. This work shows that whilst <b>pyrobitumen</b> is a natural consequence of thermal cracking disproportionation, the amount of <b>pyrobitumen</b> produced and its physico-chemical and optical properties are strongly dependent on precursor oil composition.

High-resolution scanning- and transmission-electron microscopy of pyrobitumen-hosted uraninite reveal that uraninite grains are highly porous aggregates of uniformly sized nanocrystals, and that many of their pores are filled by native gold.

In addition, this study reveals the first occurrence of rare lanarkite that engulfs the galena in the pores of the uraninite. On the basis {{of the nature of the}} uraninite and the filling of some of its pores with native gold, we propose a mineralization model for the deposition of the uranium and gold in the Carbon Leader Reef that calls upon the interaction of oil and aqueous (hydrothermal) fluids to form micro-emulsions. According to this model, uraninite nanocrystals precipitated from uranium-bearing hydrocarbon liquids and flocculated to form porous, uraninite aggregates. These liquids interacted with auriferous hydrothermal fluids in the Carbon Leader Reef, leading to the formation of a micro-emulsion at the interface between the two fluids. Gold precipitated as native metal around droplets of the oil owing to a reduction in oxygen fugacity, which destabilized the bisulfide species responsible for gold dissolution. Commonly, this process went hand in hand with the flocculation of the uraninite nanocrystals, causing entrapment of the native gold in the pores of the uraninite aggregates. The hydrocarbon liquid, which occurs as droplets in the gold and is the host to the uraninite aggregates, was transformed to <b>pyrobitumen.</b> As a result of this process, a thin <b>pyrobitumen</b> seam containing uraninite nanocrystals formed along the inner walls of the pores in the native gold.

Moreover {{at the time of}} trapping fluids were heterogeneous (effervescence) consisting at this stage of an aqueous low salinity fluid and a C 02 +H 2 S-rich gas phase.

40|$|Insoluble bitumen {{resulting}} from thermal cracking of reservoired hydrocarbons {{is a frequent}} and ubiquitous component of petroleum systems. Bitumens such as impsonite, anthraxolite, and Albertite were collectively known as pyrobitumens under the seminal bitumen classification scheme proposed by (Abraham, 1960). The <b>pyrobitumen</b> designation was, however, based uniquely on analytical criteria, namely insolubility (in CS 2), hardness, and fusibility.

In addition, high sulphur content (6 – 9.6 %) (Table  1) indicates the presence of oil-prone Type II-S kerogen. This conclusion is in line with the study by Alizadeh et al. (2016), who analysed some crude oil samples from the Early Cretaceous to Eocene reservoirs in the Abadan Plain using GC and GC–MS, and concluded that oils were derived from Kerogen Type II-S of a marine carbonate lithology. Similar conclusions were reported by English et al. (2015), Aqrawi and Badics (2015), Sachsenhofer et al. (2015), and Al-Ameri et al. (2014) for organic matter of Sargelu Formation in Iraq and Abdullah (2001) and Kaufman et al. (2002) in Kuwait. Type II-S kerogen supports organic matter derived from marine phytoplankton with high potential of hydrocarbon generation. Sulphur-rich kerogen undergoes thermal degradation at lower temperatures than any type-II kerogens (Peters and Cassa 1994; Tomić et al. 1995). The organic matter richness of these zones is due to anoxic conditions during deposition and preservation.|$|E
40|$|Late Neoproterozoic {{to early}} Cambrian intra-salt Ara {{reservoirs}} of the South Oman Salt Basin represent a unique self-charging petroleum play {{with respect to}} hydrocarbon and overpressure generation and dissipation. Reservoir bodies (termed "stringers") are isolated in salt and frequently contain low permeable dolomites that are characterised by high initial production rates due to hard overpressures. A database of more than 30 wells has been utilised to understand the distribution and generation of overpressures in intra-salt reservoirs that can be separated by up to 350 metres of salt. A temporal relationship of increasingly overpressured and compartmentalized reservoirs within stratigraphically younger units is observed, and two distinctly independent trends emerge from the Oman dataset; one hydrostatic to slightly above hydrostatic, and one overpressured from 17 to 22 kPa/m, almost at lithostatic pressures. Structural, petrophysical and seismic data analysis suggests that overpressure generation is driven by fast burial of the stringers in salt, with a significant contribution by thermal fluid effects and kerogen conversion. <b>Pyrobitumen</b> confirms local contribution by a high-temperature hydrothermal event. Structural and geometric information indicate that present day hydrostatic stringers have been overpressured in their earlier geologic evolution. Evidence for these initial overpressures in currently hydrostatic reservoirs is provided by hydrocarbon-veine...|$|E
40|$|The Century deposit {{represents}} an important ew {{member of the}} major sediment-hosted Zn-Pb-Ag deposits of the Mount Isa inlier and McArthur basin. The deposit s hosted by shales and siltstones of the Mesopro-terozoic Lawn Hill Formation. Mineralization comprises fine-grained sphalerite with minor galena nd pyrite. Most sulfides (80 - 90 %) occur as delicate replacive lamellae in black shale units, separated by siderite-rich silt-stone horizons. The remainder are present as progressively coarser-grained and more discordant fracture-filling forms, strata-bound within the ore sequence. The mineralization envelope transgresses tratigraphy, with {{the position of the}} highest-grade material migrating upward within the mineralized sequence from southeast to northwest. Despite systematic lateral variation i grades from 3 to 5 percent Zn to greater than 25 percent Zn in individual units, this grade variation occurs without concomitant changes inthickness of the host shales, suggesting that the mineralization is dominantly ofreplacement origin. The host sediments show no lateral chemical or textural changes suggestive of exhalative facies within the preserved portions of the deposit. Two principal textural varieties of strata-bound sphalerite are recognized: "porous, " which as a high pyro-bitumen content, and "nonporous, " which as a relatively ow <b>pyrobitumen</b> content. These appear to be coge-netic and almost co-abundant. Porous phalerite isinterpreted as the product of oil-mediated thermochemica...|$|E
40|$|The Middle Devonian carbonates of the Sulphur Point Formation, Rainbow South Field, northwestern Alberta, are {{secondary}} gas-producing fractured and brecciated limestones and dolostones. These rocks {{have undergone}} complex diagenetic changes, represented mainly by multiple generations of calcite cementation and dolomitization. Calcite cements include isopachous (marine), drusy (shallow burial), equant (intermediate burial) and blocky (deep burial) varieties. Four types of dolomite have been identified: dolomicrite, matrix dolomite, saddle dolomite, and fracture-lining dolomite. Dolomicrite (2 [...] 20 mum) replaced both micrite and calcite cement in the mud-supported facies prior to early compaction. Matrix dolomite formed during intermediate burial. The precipitation of saddle dolomite (0. 5 [...] 2. 0 mm) is genetically related to fractures and breccia zones where it partially to completely occludes the fractures, breccias and vugs that were developed through {{the dissolution of}} the earlier matrix dolomites. Fracture-lining dolomite (0. 2 [...] 1. 0 mm) was the last dolomite phase to precipitate, and is intimately associated with blocky calcite, quartz, sulphide mineralization, and <b>pyrobitumen.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Results from {{laboratory}} simulated pyrolyses experiments {{show that}} in addition to depth of burial, preservation of kerogen, and hence any morphologic structure in it, is also dependent on the mineral matrix with which it is associated. In the presence of clay minerals, and especially under dry conditions, extractable lipids released during kerogen decomposition are more rapidly destroyed than in the presence of calcite or chert matrices. The result is production of gas, polar bitumen and <b>pyrobitumen</b> and destruction of biomarkers. During such an early reorganization of the kerogen, the biomarker constituents can be destroyed, or unrecognizably altered. The above process of organic residues maturation appears to be inhibited in the presence of water and is significantly reduced where kerogen is hosted in limestones, dolomites or cherts. These minerals have been characteristically found to be the most reliable in yielding morphological fossils and small quantities of extractable bitumen in Archean and Proterozoic rocks. To understand the validity of chemical and morphological fossils, in the early geologic record, {{it will be necessary to}} understand the process of kerogen in sedimentary rocks. To test the role of various minerals on the preservation process, kerogen extracted from a variety of rocks has been heated together with montmorillonite, illite and calcite. The kinetics of the process has been monitored and the products quantitatively identified...|$|E
40|$|Geological {{sequestration}} of CO 2 for {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR) {{has been in}} use for decades, but it now represents a potentially economical method of mitigating anthropogenic CO 2 output. However, current understanding {{of the interaction between}} injected CO 2 and the reservoir rock is limited and prevents accurate estimation of reservoir CO 2 capacity. Delineating the diagenesis of the reservoir is useful in predicting post-CO 2 injection changes in reservoir porosity and permeability. The Albian Donovan Sand member of the Rodessa Formation, Citronelle Field, Alabama, is the subject of an ongoing Department of Energy CO 2 -EOR suitability study. The arkosic Donovan Sand is highly heterogeneous, containing conglomeratic intervals, low to extensive poikilotopic calcite cement, loose to tight grain packing, and low < 1 % to high (5 %) porosity (primary and secondary) observed in thin section. It forms the basal members of laterally discontinuous upward-fining parasequences that define a marine to brackish to fluvial delta system. The diagenesis of the Donovan Sand occurred in five stages: 1) pre-burial and compaction–formation of extensive calcite cement; 2) partial dissolution of calcite cement and framework feldspars; 3) secondary calcite cementation, localized dolomitization, and calcite and anhydrite concretion formation; 4) hydrocarbon charge; and 5) <b>pyrobitumen</b> development. Primary porosity is dominant, but substantial secondary porosity was formed during stage 2. Following injection of CO 2, water injection and oil and gas production rates dropped below modeled values. We propose that the CO 2 injection dissolved calcite cement proximal to the injection well and reprecipitated it nearby with the effect of reducing porosity and/or permeability...|$|E
40|$|Small angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) and ultra-small angle {{neutron scattering}} (USANS) {{are used to}} directly detect the processes of hydrocarbon generation in the 10 nm to 10 μm size pores in Middle Cambrian carbonate and siliciclastic rocks which contain no land-plant material suitable for conventional maturity determination by vitrinite reflectance. The method {{takes advantage of the}} pore-size-specific variation of neutron scattering contrast between the solid rock matrix and pore-space content with depth, which is caused by thermal maturation of organic matter through the oil and gas generation windows. SANS and USANS measurements were performed on bedding plane-orientated core slices, extracted from a series of 10 to 12 depth intervals for three wells CKAD 0001, MacIntyre 1 and Baldwin 1, in the southern Georgina Basin, central Australia. The depth intervals, intersecting the organic-rich basal ‘hot’ shales of the middle Cambrian Arthur Creek Formation, were selected based on Rock-Eval pyrolysis data. SANS and USANS results indicate that oil generation has occurred in the past in nanometer-sized pores in rocks that are now at depths of around 538. 4 m in CKAD 0001 and 799. 3 m in MacIntyre 1. Furthermore, in the CKAD 0001 well, the oil-wet pores extend into the larger pore-size range (at least up to 10 μm) due to the efficient expulsion of oil. At around 880 m in Baldwin 1, the influence of <b>pyrobitumen</b> reverts pore space from gas wet to oil wet. These hydrocarbons have remained in situ since the Devonian when the Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic section was exhumed in the Alice Springs Orogeny and subsequently eroded, preserving only remnants of the once extensive basin sediments.
