60|$|The {{prevalent}} natural {{philosophy of}} the present day is that which is called corpuscular, because it assumes {{the existence of a}} first matter, consisting of corpuscula or atoms, which are supposed to be definite, though extremely small, quantities, invested with the qualities of extension, impenetrability, and the like; and from certain combinations of these qualities, Life is considered, by some persons, to be a necessary result. This philosophy Mr. Coleridge combats. The supposed atoms, he says, are mere abstractions of the mind; and Life is not a thing, the result of atomic arrangement or action, but is itself an act, or process. He refutes various definitions of Life, such as, that it is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted; or, that it depends on the faculty of nutrition, or of anti-putrescence. His own definition he proposes merely as an hypothesis. Life, he says, is “the principle of Individuation,” that is to say, it is a power which discloses itself from within, combining many qualities into one individual thing. This individualising principle unites, as he conceives, with the cooperating action of magnetism, electricity, and chemistry. At least, such is the inference to be drawn from the present state of science; though it is easily conceivable that future discoveries may bring us acquainted with powers more directly connected with Life. The most general law governing the action of Life, as a tendency to individuation, is here designated polarity; for instance, the power termed magnetism (not meaning that there is necessarily an actual tangible magnet in the case) has two poles, the negative, answering to attraction, rest, carbon, &c., and the positive, answering to repulsion, mobility, azote, &c.; and as the magnetic needle which points to the north necessarily indicates thereby the south, so the power disposing to rest has necessarily a counteracting influence disposing to mobility, between which lies the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference.</b> Now this quality, to which Mr. Coleridge gives the name of polarity, is in truth nothing more than an exemplification of the doctrine of opposites, the πρός ἂλληλα ἀντικειμένω ἀντίθεσις, which the Eleatic Philosopher, in Plato’s “Sophist,” applies to the idea of existence and non-existence, and which accompanies every other idea as its shadow, whether in physics, in intellect, or in morals; for the finite is opposed to the infinite, the false to the true, the evil to the good, and so forth; which we say, not to derogate from the value of Mr. Coleridge’s application of the doctrine, of which he has very ably availed himself; but merely to explain the term polarity, by referring it, as a species, to a higher genus of intellectual conceptions.|$|E

60|$|A plan of Favouritism for our {{executory}} Government {{is essentially}} {{at variance with}} the plan of our Legislature. One great end undoubtedly of a mixed Government like ours, composed of Monarchy, and of controls, {{on the part of}} the higher people and the lower, is that the Prince shall not be able to violate the laws. This is useful indeed and fundamental. But this, even at first view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour merely defensive. It is therefore next in order, and equal in importance, that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the Monarch, whether for the execution of the laws, or for the nomination to magistracy and office, or for conducting the affairs of peace and war, or for ordering the revenue, should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds, and not on the likings or prejudices, the intrigues or policies of a Court. This, I said, is equal in importance to the securing a Government according to law. The laws reach but a very little way. Constitute Government how you please, infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of Ministers of State. Even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your Commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper; and not a living, active, effective constitution. It is possible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or design artfully conducted, Ministers may suffer one part of Government to languish, another to be perverted from its purposes: and every valuable interest of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without possibility of fixing any single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the state, far from being foreign to the purposes of a wise Government, ought to be among its very first and dearest objects. When, therefore, the abettors of new system tell us, that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power, and that therefore we are no-ways concerned in it; we must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner, that, of all things, we ought to be the most concerned, who and what sort of men they are, that hold the trust of everything that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference</b> to the nation, but what must either render us totally desperate, or soothe us into the security of idiots.

On these grounds, an economic approach to their entity (incidence and costs) and to the clinical means (surgical prophylaxis) for their containment is attempted in this article.

5000|$|The tale is the cypher of {{the extreme}} tension that, {{according}} to Perone, is in place between finite and infinite, penultimate and ultimate, [...] individual meanings and overall sense. Philosophy has {{a moral obligation to}} remain faithful to the finite. This faithfulness leads philosophy never to dismiss the historical conditions of thinking but also never to give up its own vocation to transcend such conditions by listening to the non-immediate, work, and labor. Once it has recognized modernity as its own condition, thinking cannot delude itself into believing that it can find its own position within being or sense, as if no break had occurred between finite and infinite. A flattening of thinking onto merely historical meanings, as if thinking were oblivious to the call of being, would be equally inopportune though. The necessary protection of the finite (a protection of the finite that must be exercised when necessary also against being, which must be challenged because toward that which is strong one can only be strong in turn) cannot amount to the elimination of either of the two opponents. On the threshold between finite and infinite, between history and ontology, a mediation occurs—this does not imply the reduction but rather the preservation of the distance between the two dimensions. In order to preserve the double excess of the finite over the infinite and of the infinite over the finite, one is not allowed to erase the distance between the two by either transforming it into unity or weakening it to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference.</b>|$|E

There has been little qualitative research exploring how respondents answer such questions. An SG study was designed to elicit values for the health states associated with anti-hypertensive medication, stroke and cardiovascular disease. This paper describes a qualitative study that was carried out alongside the SG exercise in order to document the thought processes respondents bring to bear in formulating their responses. Data were generated using 'think aloud' techniques and semi-structured interviews. Values were generally well-constructed: responses were thoroughly considered, and respondents made complex trade-offs and arrived at a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference.</b> However, some respondents incorporated inappropriate information into their choices, redefining the hypothetical 'Option B' resulting in problems interpreting the probabilistic information. Consideration of non-health factors was commonplace, in particular the impact of choices on others.

Second, a regime of Hand Rule Damages and ideal insurance markets put victims in the same position as a regime that makes people compensate others for exposing them to risk, which is fair by some understandings of the principle of restorative justice. Empirical evidence suggests that Hand Rule Damages are several times higher than the U. S. average for damages in automobile accident cases involving loss of life.
