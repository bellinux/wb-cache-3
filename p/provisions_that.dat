The borrower tries to avoid this provision. • A <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> creates personal liability {{to the extent of}} the lender’s loss in certain circumstances. The borrower negotiates those circumstances and endeavors to include within them the circumstances allowing revocation of the entire exculpation...|$|R

5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate.

5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing twoFrenchmen and injuring others.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their {{millions}} of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Marriage Protection Act was reintroduced to the General Assembly on January 23, 2012. The {{new version}} of the bill {{contained}} <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> more explicitly protects religious leaders, institutions, and their programs from legal action if they refuse to officiate or provide facilities for a same-sex marriage or couple as a matter of their doctrine. During the legislative process, several high-profile political figures attempted to persuade legislators to vote in favor of the bill, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Terry McAuliffe, and Ken Mehlman. The House of Delegates passed the bill with a 72–67 vote on February 17, 2012 and the Senate passed with a 25–22 vote on February 23, 2012. To secure support from some lawmakers who desired to submit the law to public referendum, the bill was amended to take effect on January 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established.

The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies {{the subjective}} test had {{with respect to}} Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|In April, Longstreet besieged Union {{forces in}} the city of Suffolk, Virginia, a minor operation, but one that was very {{important}} to Lee's army, still stationed in war-devastated central Virginia. It enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> had been under Union control. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May. Despite Lee's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, Longstreet once again came under criticism, claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee. However, from the Chancellorsville and Suffolk scenario, Longstreet brought forward the beginnings of a new Confederate strategy. These events proved that the Army of Northern Virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time, and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters. Longstreet advocated the first strategic movements to utilize rail, interior lines, and create temporary numerical advantages in Mississippi or Tennessee prior to Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by <b>provisions</b> <b>that</b> allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E
