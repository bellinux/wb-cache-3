Both are seeking, for reasons economic, philosophical, and political, to ease the strain on non-oil-blessed countries. The two presidents represented opposing sides regarding free trade at the IV Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina, but it was Fox who, on Nov. 5, signed an accord worth US$ 7 billion with the Central Americans to ease their energy woes. "With this we will have abundant energy in the region, competitive and made into a platform for development," said Fox before {{a meeting with the}} presidents of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, and the vice president of Honduras. The deal includes constructing a refinery somewhere in Central America, presumably with the technical resources of Mexico's state oil monopoly PEMEX. It {{is part of a larger}} scheme within <b>Plan</b> <b>Puebla-Panama</b> (PPP), integrating the refinery, construction of a hydroelectric project, a gas pipeline, and plants for the conversion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) (see NotiCen, 2005 - 06 - 16). Fox's offer was consistent with an October recommendation of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) for the creation of a regional energy market in Central America. The head of ECLAC's energy and natural-resources department, Fernando Cuevas, said at the presentation of a report on the petroleum industry, Istmo centroamericano: diagnostico de la industria petrolera, that the isthmus is in urgent need of competition in energy-products distribution and that PEMEX would "do the region a great service" if it authorized distribution franchises to Central America. "One important measure Mexico could adopt to help Central America would be to allow PEMEX to come in with its service stations," he said...|$|R

5000|$|The {{outcomes}} of the Programme fall short of those expected. The types of projects that appear in the development plans {{are the same as}} those promoted during the Cañadas Programme. ... Villagers in the region display much disillusionment and discontent. In fact, in most of the interviews it was affirmed that the present programme was worse than its predecessor. ... The situation suggests that the authorities did not take properly into account the difficulties that the new initiative would encounter and which are the source of its problems. ... A very important source of conflict has come from the groups that benefited most from the Cañadas Programme. These groups have fought very hard to keep their privileges and to return to the previous model, ... which has distorted the operation of the programme and led to further conflict. ... Moreover, the presence of Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in the region, which do not desire any relationship with the Mexican government and thus do not participate in the PIDSS, complicates things even further. Disputes over land are very common, and the presence of paramilitary forces confronting the Zapatistas makes the situation even more difficult.There is a lack of coordination between different government institutions, and even some divergence of objectives. The state government, for instance, seems to perceive hidden interests among the officials of the federal government for the PIDSS to fail. ... The technicians of the federal government seem to be much better prepared than the others, which allows them to dominate and impose their decisions. ... The technicians seem to have a disproportionate amount of discretionary power. This is dangerous if we take into account that the main problems of the Cañadas Programme came through the behaviour of some of the federal government technicians. And in fact our research has shown that in some communities complaints about the counter-insurgency behaviour of the technicians have began to appear.Another source of problems for the PIDSS seems to lie in the notions of participation and development pursued and those of the different actors. From the very beginning there was a general agreement that the Programme had to be participative and foster development. However, no effort was made to reach an agreement on what these concepts mean and entail. The result is that, for instance, the PIDSS has sought participation of the population in a very limited way.In the interviews with the social organisations it was also argued that their problems to participate were {{due to the fact that}} they defend a notion of development that is opposed to that of the government. They argue that the PIDSS is an element that has to be related with the wider <b>Puebla-Panama</b> <b>Plan,</b> which is a regional development plan based on the implantation of low-wage factories (maquiladoras) and similar liberal economic initiatives. In opposition to this, people in the communities talk about the importance of land and about maintaining their way of life. Again, these elements are not taken into account in the design and operation of the Programme, and as a consequence have a negative impact in its outcomes.Conclusions:# The permanent conflict in the area and past development initiatives are important determinants that should have been better taken into account and incorporated in the design of the program.# Issues regarding coordination among different levels of the administration have proved to be a source of problems. These appear at the level of objectives, but also in the day-to-day operation, with the important role of the technicians and their discretionary power as a key issue.# The underlying notions of development and participation certainly determine the nature of the initiative and peoples expectations of it, and thus have to be dealt with from the beginning. Promoting participation but then to have it managed through questionnaires in which people have no input and which are filled in by secondary school students implies an understanding of the concept that is, at the very least, problematic.http://www.drc-citizenship.org/docs/internships/2002/OM_mexico.pdf ...|$|E

Formally launched in 2001 as the <b>Puebla-Panama</b> <b>Plan</b> (PPP) with {{a strong commitment to}} sustainable development and safeguarding the environmental dimension of the regionalisation process, its current version, renamed the Mesoamerican Project (Proyecto Mesoamérica, PM), does not have the same orientation or goals. This paper addresses two questions: a) which stakeholders and discourses shaped the regional integration’s environmental policy process during its different phases? and b) how have the PPP and PM contributed to the environmental governance of the region? The findings suggest that the process has been characterised by strong intervention on the part of supra-national stakeholders that have prioritised liberalisation over the sustainable development agenda for 15 years, weakening regional environmental agencies’ ability to produce warrants to reduce the environmental impacts of regionalisation...|$|E
40|$|With {{claims of}} {{authoritative}} environmental knowledge, transnational development agen-cies are spatially redefining a “sustainable ” and “eco-efficient ” Central America. In the mid- 1990 s, the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) emerged from transnational cooperation on security, trade, and environmental protection. Despite the large {{size and scope}} of the MBC, there has been little research on its transnational structure or how it intersects with the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the <b>Puebla-Panama</b> <b>Plan.</b> In this paper I examine national corridors. Nicaraguan portions of the MBC, espe-cially the extensive Atlantic Biological Corridor (ABC), receive the most attention. The MBC has been touted as participatory, but Nicaraguan findings suggest a limited role in decision-making on the part of local governments and impacted populations. Proposed development projects in corridors would more often stimulate resource marketing and future donor lending rather than strengthening biodiversity protection. There is sporadic protection of biodiversity hotspots, but projects are riddled with tensions. As imagined, the MBC may contribute to the intensification of uneven development...|$|E
