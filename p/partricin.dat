40|$|Couchioplanes caeruleus DSM 43634 synthesises 67 – 121 C, an {{aromatic}} heptaene macrolide {{that contains}} a mannosyl-mycosaminyl disaccharide. An improved draft genome sequence was used to obtain the biosynthetic gene cluster for this antifungal. Bioinformatic analysis of the polyketide synthase indicated that extension modules 7 and 8 contain A-type ketoreductase and dehydratase domains. These modules are therefore predicted to form cis double bonds. The deduced stereostructure of the 67 – 121 C macrolactone is identical to that experimentally determined for the <b>partricin</b> subgroup of aromatic heptaenes. Some of these polyenes are N-methylated on the aminoacetophenone moiety. The C. caeruleus AceS protein was shown to methylate 4 -aminoacetophenone and esters of 4 -aminobenzoate, but not 4 -aminobenzoate. This suggests that the substrate specificity of AceS prevents it from interfering with folate biosynthesis. The methyltransferase should be valuable for chemoenzymatic alkylation of compounds that contain aminobenzoyl moieties...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} antimycotics on {{secretory}} aspartate (acid) proteinase, a virulence enzyme of Candida albicans, was investigated. The {{conditions of the}} study were such as to induce proteinase production in the stationary phase of growth (25 - 40 hours), when no antifungal tested, except the polyene derivative methyl <b>partricin,</b> significantly reduced the viability of the culture. Among azole derivatives, fenticonazole (FZ) but not miconazole, fluconazole or ketoconazole, exerted strong inhibition on proteinase, in typical dose-diphasic pattern, (0. 01 microgram/ml; 1 - 10 micrograms/ml). 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) was also inhibitory at a dose interval 1 - 10 micrograms/ml. In all cases, the inhibition concerned the synthesis of the enzyme rather that its activity as suggested by the results of comparative ELISA, SDS-PAGE and spectrophotometric methods of proteinase detection. Finally, the inhibition of proteinase production by FZ and 5 -FC mainly reflected the effect of these antimycotics on general protein synthesis...|$|E
