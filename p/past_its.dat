5|$|SR55 {{was first}} {{added to the}} state highway system in 1931, known as part of Legislative Route 43, and was routed on surface streets. It was renumbered SR55 in 1959, and the {{construction}} of the freeway portion began in the 1960s and continued until 1992. Due to congestion, several alternatives are being discussed to expand the freeway portion <b>past</b> <b>its</b> current end in Newport Beach.

5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked <b>past</b> <b>its</b> end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, {{city hall}} {{was home to}} the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the {{political}} arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County (which {{at that time was}} the largest county in the colony, extending far <b>past</b> <b>its</b> current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in city hall alongside common criminals. Following the war, city hall was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, in addition to being home to the city and county governments, the jail, courts, and local registry.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fertile {{crescent}} civilizations {{are considered the}} oldest in history, {{at the time the}} Burney Relief was made other late bronze age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible. To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already <b>past</b> <b>its</b> peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to the right-hand side of the relief.|$|E

5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end.

5|$|NY18 was {{extended}} northeastward to Rochester {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, effectively doubling the route's length. Instead of ending at the junction of Ohio and Main Streets (the latter then part of NY5) in downtown Buffalo, NY18 now overlapped with NY5 along Main Street north to Niagara Falls Boulevard, where it turned north and proceeded to Lake Ontario over NY34. At Youngstown, the route turned east, following a previously unnumbered alignment along the lakeshore to Rochester, where it ended at NY31 (now NY104) in Kodak Park. The route {{was extended}} further eastward to NY250 in Webster by the following year by way of East Ridge Road, Culver Road, and Lake Road. NY18 was never extended eastward <b>past</b> <b>its</b> junction with NY250.|$|E
5|$|Rather than direct {{involvement}} in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of tonnage and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI of England had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords <b>past</b> <b>its</b> first reading. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.|$|E

5|$|The Apache Trail {{connected}} the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an unpaved road {{as early as}} 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed the Apache Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 {{was given to the}} route by 1927, but continued <b>past</b> <b>its</b> current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. In 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus.|$|E
5|$|When Allison {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000houses in St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in Saint Bernard Parish, {{and hundreds of}} houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding.

5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract {{as a state}} highway. The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936. The route followed its current alignment to Bridgeville, where it passed through the town on Market Street and South Main Street before picking up its current alignment east of US 13. At this time, what is now DE 404 <b>past</b> <b>its</b> then-eastern terminus was designated as part of DE 18. By 1987, DE 404 was extended east to DE 1 in Five Points, following DE 18 to Georgetown and US 9 (which had replaced a portion of DE 18) from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 Alt. was created to bypass Bridgeville {{to the north and}} east by 1990, following Newton Road and US 13. The alternate route became a part of mainline DE 404 by 1999, with the former DE 404 through Bridgeville becoming DE 404 Bus.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running <b>past</b> <b>its</b> projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
