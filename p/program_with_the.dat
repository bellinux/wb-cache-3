5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded the <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant {{centered around the}} lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E

Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard was not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, {{the situation had}} become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aim {{of producing a}} replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, {{it was revealed that}} two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development <b>program</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC <b>program,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E
