5|$|Bradman {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more {{recruits}} than it could equip and train and Bradman spent {{four months in}} Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of <b>Physical</b> <b>Training</b> at Frankston, Victoria, {{to act as a}} divisional supervisor of <b>physical</b> <b>training.</b> The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.|$|E

The Raider Team enters various competitions, and won a championship in 2006–2007.|$|E
5|$|After adolescence, most <b>physical</b> <b>training</b> {{for males}} {{was of a}} {{military}} nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E

5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began <b>physical</b> <b>training</b> to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>training</b> goals {{pursued in}} {{conjunction}} with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.

5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of <b>physical</b> <b>training.</b> He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{patients}} with {{congenital heart disease}} (ConHD) do not perform regular physical exercise. Consensus reports have stated that exercise should be encouraged and regularly performed in these patients, {{but this is not}} common practise. We reviewed the literature on actual evidence for either negative or positive effects of <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training</b> programmes in children and young adults with ConHD. METHODS: Using the Medline database, we systematically searched for articles on <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training</b> programmes in ConHD. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles met all inclusion criteria; in total, 621 subjects (age range 4 to 45 years) were included. Most studies used training programmes with a duration of 12 weeks. On average, the number of training sessions was 3 times per week. In 12 studies, training intensity was set at a percentage of peak heart rate. Outcome measures reported were PeakVO 2, activity levels and muscle strength. Twenty-three studies (72 %) found a significant positive change in the main outcome measure after the <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training</b> period. None of the studies reported negative findings related to <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training</b> in ConHD. Cardiac effects have hardly been studied. CONCLUSION: In most studies, participation in a <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training</b> programme was safe and improved fitness in children and young adults with ConHD. We recommend that {{patients with}} ConHD participate in <b>physical</b> exercise <b>training.</b> Cardiac effects need to be studied more extensively...|$|R

After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for £19,500 in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The <b>physical</b> <b>training</b> in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E

40|$|The present {{pilot study}} {{investigated}} the effects of yoga training, as compared to <b>physical</b> skill <b>training,</b> on motor and executive function, physical self-concept and anxiety-related behavior in junior primary school-aged children. Twenty-four participants {{with a mean age}} of 8. 4 (± 1. 4) years completed either yoga or <b>physical</b> skill <b>training</b> twice a week for six weeks outside of regular school class time. Both forms of training were delivered in an individualized and child-oriented manner. The type of training did not result in any significant differences in movement and executive function outcomes. In terms of physical self-concept, significant group differences were revealed only for perceived movement speed such that yoga training resulted in perceptions of being slower while <b>physical</b> skill <b>training</b> resulted in perceptions of moving faster. Analysis of anxiety related outcomes revealed significant group effects only for avoidance behavior and coping strategies. Avoidance behavior increased following yoga training, but decreased following <b>physical</b> skill <b>training.</b> In addition, following yoga training, children showed an increased use of divergent coping strategies when facing problematic situations while after <b>physical</b> skill <b>training</b> children demonstrated a decrease in use of divergent coping strategies. Increases in overall physical self-concept scores were significantly correlated with increases in avoidance behavior following yoga training. In contrast, following <b>physical</b> skill <b>training</b> increased <b>physical</b> self-concept was significantly correlated with decreases in avoidance behavior. In sum, exposure to yoga or <b>physical</b> skill <b>training</b> appears to result in distinct effects for specific domains of physical self-concept and anxiety-related behavior. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous methodologies are required to further investigate the effects reported here. With respect to future studies, we address potential research questions and specific features associated with the investigation of the effects of yoga in a sample of school-aged children...|$|R

5|$|Physical {{exercises}} {{were popular}} {{with men and}} wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular <b>physical</b> <b>training</b> for commanders and their armies during peace time. Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women. Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of community-based activities {{in the form of}} engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social interaction.

5|$|Pulmonary plethysmographs {{are used}} to measure {{functional}} residual capacity. Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by <b>physical</b> <b>training</b> as much as 40%.|$|E

5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, <b>physical)</b> <b>training,</b> school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
