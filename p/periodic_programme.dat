40|$|Abstract Background Program {{coverage}} {{is likely to}} be an important determinant of the effectiveness of community interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. Rigorous examination and documentation of methods to scale-up interventions and measure coverage are scarce, however. To address this knowledge gap, this paper describes the process and measurement of scaling-up coverage of a community mobilisation intervention for maternal, child and neonatal health in rural Bangladesh and critiques this real-life experience in relation to available literature on scaling-up. Methods Scale-up activities took place in nine unions in rural Bangladesh. Recruitment and training of those who deliver the intervention, communication and engagement with the community and other stakeholders and active dissemination of intervention activities are described. Process evaluation and population survey data are presented and used to measure coverage and the success of scale-up. Results The intervention was scaled-up from 162 women's groups to 810, representing a five-fold increase in population coverage. The proportion of women of reproductive age and pregnant women who were engaged in the intervention increased from 9 % and 3 %, respectively, to 23 % and 29 %. Conclusions Examination and documentation of how scaling-up was successfully initiated, led, managed and monitored in rural Bangladesh provide a deeper knowledge base and valuable lessons. Strong operational capabilities and institutional knowledge of the implementing organisation were {{critical to the success of}} scale-up. It was possible to increase community engagement with the intervention without financial incentives and without an increase in managerial staff. Monitoring and feedback systems that allow for <b>periodic</b> <b>programme</b> corrections and continued innovation are central to successful scale-up and require programmatic and operational flexibility. </p...|$|E
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at : [URL] Copyright University of HertfordshirePeer {{assessment}} was included within a Level 4 Human Physiology module at the Univer-sity of Hertfordshire following a <b>periodic</b> <b>programme</b> review during the academic year 2006 - 2007. The peer assessment exercise was thought to be beneficial in terms of student learning as it: engaged students explicitly with marking criteria; stimulated dialogue around assessment and feedback and ensured prompt feedback. It was beneficial for staff as it reduced the marking burden and enabled students to receive prompt feedback on their work. Performance on subsequent laboratory reports supported the argument that peer assess-ment enhanced student learning and that the skills associated with data analysis and aca-demic writing can be transferred across modules. Comparison of student performance on a laboratory report (tutor assessed) submitted prior to the peer assessment activity, with a later submission of a laboratory report (tutor assessed) which took place after the peer assessment activity, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in performance on the second assignment (p< 0. 001). However, a number of possible confounding factors could also have influenced student improvement e. g. improved understanding over time; differing support provision for the two assignments, differing requirements in terms {{of the nature of the}} assignments and differing staff members teaching and assessing the assign-ments. The introduction of a reflective questionnaire to the peer assessment process, during the 2009 - 2010 academic year enabled better understanding of the student perceptions of peer assessment. Of those students who responded, 77 % indicated that peer assessment was beneficial for their learning. Over 80 % indicated that they had benefited from being engaged with the marking criteria prior to writing the report and perhaps most importantly, 83 % indicated that they felt better prepared for their next laboratory report as a conse-quence of the peer assessment activity. The feedback supports the argument that the peer assessment activity did support student learning and was beneficial for future assign-ments. Peer assessment therefore offers the potential to benefit student learning as well as being a resource efficient assessment method for staff...|$|E

Methods: Participants aged 55 and {{over from the}} population-based Rotterdam Study underwent the same ophthalmic examination at baseline (1991 - 3) and follow-up (1997 - 9), including visual field testing and simultaneous stereo optic disc photography. Of 3842 participants, 87 (2. 3 %) developed iOAG during a mean follow-up time of 6. 5 years. Of these 87 iOAG cases, 78 (90 %) were included in this study. Results: Of the 78 iOAG cases detected at follow-up, 23 (29 %) had already been detected before during regular ophthalmic care.

40|$|Education is a {{key factor}} in human {{development}} and social transformation. The problematic of women development in Nigeria traces its roots in the type of education dispensed by missionary agencies and the British colonial administration. Christian Missionaries were the first to initiate the development of western education in Nigeria. Government participation first took the form of giving limited financial assistance to voluntary agencies and gradually developed into the recognition of education as the responsibility of the Government. The present study is a historical analysis of the evolution of the development of education in Nigeria in relation to the contemporary women question it seeks to establish the place of girls’ education in the missionary and government overall plan for the education of Nigerian youth. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the significant economic, social and political implications of the government controlled education for women in Nigeria. If women still lag behind in these three key areas of human development, the history of education has had its own contributions to make.

40|$|The {{effects of}} four {{offshore}} breakwaters built between 1993 and 1995 at Sea Palling, Norfolk, UK, on beach morphology are discussed. The structures were built {{during the first}} phase of a multi-phase construction programme and are expected to provide long-term protection for Sea Palling and 6000 ha of low-lying land against tidal inundation through the provision of a wide beach in front of the existing seawall and dunes. The results presented here span all stages of breakwater construction during Phase 1. Beach level changes were monitored during the period from 1995 to 1999. A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to calculate differential surfaces between surveys in order to investigate local patterns of accretion and erosion and to determine volume changes between consecutive surveys. Additional data collected by the Environment Agency since 1991 were analysed to investigate beach and bathymetry changes prior to the construction of the breakwaters. In association with <b>periodic</b> nourishment <b>programmes</b> the scheme has been locally successful in retaining recharged sediment on the beach but the extent of the salients prevents to a great extent the south-eastward littoral drift. As a result, effects on the beaches, both down- and up-drift of the breakwaters, have been considerable.

40|$|Abstract Background Mother -to -Child {{transmission}} of hepatitis B infection remains {{a major public}} health concern particularly in Africa. Adequate knowledge of physicians and midwives is crucial in averting most of the hepatitis B viral transmissions from mothers to their new-borns. However, there is a dearth of evidence on extent of knowledge of physicians and midwives in Ghana inspite of the increasing incidence of hepatitis B infection in the country. This study therefore assessed the knowledge level of physicians and midwives regarding Mother-to-Child {{transmission of}} hepatitis B in the Eastern region of Ghana. Methods A Cross sectional survey was conducted between August to November, 2015 using semi-structured self-administered questionnaire. Study participants were recruited from five health facilities and their level of awareness and knowledge about Mother-to-Child transmission of hepatitis B were assessed. The level of statistical significance was set at 0. 05 alpha level. Results The findings showed that both physicians and midwives had good knowledge on Mother-to-Child transmission of hepatitis B infection. However, there were some knowledge gaps regarding effective hepatitis B prevention from mother to their newborns {{such as the use}} of hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin. Additionally, 49. 2  % (n[*]=[*] 62) of the participants had never attended any workshop on Mother-to-Child transmission of hepatitis B since completion of formal training. Conclusions Developing appropriate <b>periodic</b> training <b>programmes</b> on current issues of hepatitis B for physicians and midwives in Eastern region will further enhance their knowledge.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} impact of a {{comprehensive}} <b>periodic</b> health examination <b>programme</b> on health care utilisation and costs in a working population. DESIGN [...] A cohort method was used to observe the trends in health care utilisation and costs for a group of local government employees from 1 February 1986 until 31 January 1992, during which time (in 1988) a comprehensive <b>periodic</b> health examination <b>programme</b> had been introduced. Health care utilisation was measured by a claim rate per employee (number of claims in a year divided by number of employees) and a utilisation rate per 100 employees (number of employees who submitted at least one claim in a year divided by number of employees x 100). Health care costs were measured by claim costs per employee (total cost of claims divided by number of employees). National and prefectural changes in per capita health care costs were used for the adjustment of claim costs. Internal comparisons were made in relation to the intensiveness of the periodic health examinations administered before the introduction of the comprehensive programme. SETTING [...] Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. PARTICIPANTS [...] A total of 19, 146 local government employees (12, 455 men, 6691 women) who worked in small cities, towns, and villages in Fukuoka Prefecture throughout the study period participated. MAIN RESULTS [...] Both the claim and utilisation rates showed an increase in 1988 when the comprehensive programme was introduced. After adjustment for the national changes in per capita health care costs and the aging effect of the study participants, substantial increases in claim costs were noted after introduction of the comprehensive programme. The programme had a greater but short term effect of increasing the health care utilisation of those who had received less intensive periodic health examinations before 1988, but no similar effect on claim costs was noted. CONCLUSIONS [...] The comprehensive programme had some role in increasing health care utilisation and costs. Its effect on costs was confirmed when the general population or another population was used as a reference. When comparisons were made internally, the comprehensive programme was seen to have had a greater but short term effect of increasing the utilisation of those who had previously received less intensive health examinations to equalise the health care utilisation and costs within the study population...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of both the}} dimensions and main features of the foreign population in Southern European host countries (Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal) {{is not an easy}} task. In addition to the typical problems of statistics on migration flows and migrant population stocks, the presence of a sizeable and dynamic irregular component is a major hindrance. Even for the estimation of the legal presence, administrative sources are often not exhaustive, either because they capture different subsets of the whole universe of regular foreigners (as in the case of Italy) or because of very restrictive immigration policies preventing migrants from keeping legal status for long (Greece). Moving within this context, this work sets out to highlight some new evidence on the recent evolution of foreign populations in Southern Europe. 1 The approach is based on the comparison and integration of several data sources, jointly used to draw the quantitative evolution of the stock of foreigners living in the four countries in the last ten to fifteen years. Although the bulk of the analysis is focused on regular foreign presence, data from the <b>periodic</b> regularisation <b>programmes</b> are also used to stress the role of illegal migration and to emphasise the impact of such policies on the size and characteristics of the foreign population. A strong focus of this paper is on the changes in the geographical origins of recent immigrants. Some patterns shared by all Southern European countries as well as some features specific to national contexts are pointed out. By analysing the changing structures by nationality, we try to understand how the role of the Southern European host countries has changed in the European migration scenario, making them increasingly attractive destinations especially for migrants leaving Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Balkans...|$|R

New Zealand crash data, licensing data and inspection data from the warrant of fitness (WoF) scheme were merged together to evaluate the safety benefits in terms of reduced crash risk and the reductions in safetyrelated vehicle faults associated with the increase from annual to biannual inspections that occur six years after the car’s manufacture date. These were estimated to be respectively 8 % (with 95 % confidence interval 15 % to 0. 4 %) and 13. 5 % (with 95 % CI 12. 8 %- 14. 2 %).

Pre-employment values were measured in 203 men not occupationally exposed to cadmium. The overall geometric mean was 76 microgram/l (adjusted to specific gravity 1016) : a significantly higher level of 96 microgram/l was found in the specimens stored continually at - 20 degrees C after voiding, compared with 73 microgram/l in specimens that thawed during transport. Sodium azide had been added to all specimen bottles. Employees exposed to cadmium pigments at various stages of their manufacture had no evidence of raised urinary beta 2 m despite exposures above 50 microgram/m 3 for up to 11 years. This is believed to be due to the insolubility of the compounds. Five known cases of cadmium induced proteinuria whose exposure ceased up to 15 years ago had raised urinary beta 2 m concentrations. Moderately raised concentrations were found in seven others with a history of cadmium oxide exposure and in whom proteinuria has never been detected.

40|$|Abstract The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being licensed, imported and installed. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The results of STUK’s nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2016 continued to demonstrate that Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2016. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2016, the number of inspection days was significantly higher at a total of 98, owing to the system inspections carried out during the year as a part of STUK’s <b>periodic</b> inspection <b>programme.</b> In contrast to this, there was no survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, resulting in only 12 IAEA inspection days in 2016, whereas, the Commission needed 18 inspection days to fulfil its duties in 2016. A major goal of all current Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task as demonstrated twice during 2016. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2016 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, standard operational procedures were addressed within the nuclear regulator departments. At the Nuclear Materials Section, the new nuclear materials database was developed in this context. Due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site, safeguards instrumentation was under development, in particular the passive gamma emission tomography for the verification of spent fuel. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK also contributed to EU-funded projects in Tanzania and Vietnam, respectively. STUK and Finnish Customs finalised the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officer training and the updating of the technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R
40|$|This report {{constitutes}} {{the report on}} regulatory control {{in the field of}} nuclear energy which the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) is required to submit once a year to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy pursuant to section 121 of the Nuclear Energy Decree. The report is also delivered to the Ministry of Environment, the Finnish Environment Institute and the regional environmental authorities of the localities in which a nuclear facility is located. The regulatory control of nuclear safety in 2013 included the engineering, construction and operation of nuclear facilities, as well as nuclear waste management and nuclear materials. The control of nuclear facilities and nuclear waste management, as well as nuclear non-proliferation, concern two STUK departments: nuclear reactor regulation and nuclear waste and material regulation. The first parts of the report explain the fundamentals of nuclear safety regulation as part of STUK’s duties, as well as the objectives of the operations, and briefly introduce the objects of regulation. The chapter concerning {{the development and implementation of}} legislation and regulations describes changes in nuclear legislation, as well as the progress of STUK’s YVL Guide reform work. The section concerning the regulation of nuclear facilities contains an overall safety assessment of the nuclear facilities currently in operation or under construction. For the nuclear facilities currently in operation, the section describes plant operation, events during operation, annual maintenance and observations made during regulatory activities. Data and observations gained during regulatory activities are reviewed with a focus on ensuring the safety functions of nuclear facilities and the integrity of structures and components. The chapters describing the development of the plants and their safety also include summaries of the development targets established after the Fukushima accident. For the existing NPPs, the report describes the regulation and inspections of the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel, management of operating waste, and the provisions for the costs of nuclear waste management. The report also includes a description of the oversight of the operations and quality management of organisations, oversight of operational experience feedback activities, and the results of these oversight activities. The radiation safety of nuclear facilities is examined on the basis of employees’ individual doses, collective doses, radioactive releases and the results of environmental radiation monitoring. The report also includes summaries on STUK’s regulatory oversight concerning physical protection, emergency preparedness and safeguards of nuclear materials at the nuclear power plants. For the Olkiluoto 3 plant unit currently under construction, the report includes descriptions of the regulation of design, construction, manufacturing, installation, and commissioning preparations, as well as regulation of the operations of the licensee and the organisations participating in the construction project. At the end of the chapter on the regulation of nuclear facilities there is a summary of new plant projects and the regulation of the research reactor. The chapter concerning the regulation of the final disposal project for spent nuclear fuel describes the preparations for the final disposal project and the related regulatory activities. In addition, the oversight of the design and construction of the research facilities (Onkalo) currently under construction in Olkiluoto, as well as the assessment and oversight of the research, development and design work being carried out to specify further the safety case for final disposal are included in the report. In addition to actual safety regulation, the report describes safety research, regulatory indicators and the development of regulatory operations, as well as emergency preparedness, communication and STUK’s participation in international nuclear safety cooperation.

40|$|Management review In 2016, all Finnish {{nuclear power}} plants {{operated}} safely and caused no danger to their surrounding environment or employees. The collective radiation doses of employees were yet again historically low in {{almost all of the}} plant units and radioactive releases into the environment very small. The low employee radiation doses were the result of short annual outages and improvements implemented at the {{nuclear power plants}}. In spring 2016, three leaking fuel assemblies were replaced at Olkiluoto 1 during an extra refuelling outage, and then three more assemblies were replaced in connection with the annual outage due to subsequent leaks. The fuel leaks were one reason why the employee radiation doses at the plant unit were somewhat higher than in the previous years. Over the course of 2016, Fortum Power and Heat Oy (Fortum) submitted to STUK a total of 20 operational event reports. The operational events did not compromise nuclear or radiation safety. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the <b>periodic</b> inspection <b>programme</b> during the annual outage. During the annual outages, Fortum inspected – according to a programme agreed with STUK – that there was no hydrogen flaking in the reactor pressure vessel of the power plant unit 1. Hydrogen flaking could have occurred during manufacture of the pressure vessel. A similar inspection on the pressure vessel of Loviisa 2 was performed in 2014. No hydrogen flaking was detected in either of the pressure vessels. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on the Fortum’s organisation, inspecting Fortum’s management, competence, resource and procurement processes. Also in 2016, Fortum completed a major organisational renewal, and STUK oversaw its implementation and initial impact as part of its regulatory oversight. In 2016, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) submitted to STUK 11 operational event reports. Some radioactive materials were released into the environment in the case of two of the events. One of the events involved fuel leaks and the other an error during maintenance. The set limits were not exceeded and neither of the events compromised radiation safety of the population. Both events increased the radiation level inside the plant, which was taken into account when planning the work to be done by the employees. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the <b>periodic</b> inspection <b>programme</b> during the annual outage. TVO implemented a new organisation and operations model in 2015. Based on inspections by STUK, the new operations model has been largely established, but there are still some challenges pertaining to the atmosphere at the company and the adequacy of resources. STUK will continue to monitor as part of its regulatory oversight the situation and the actions taken by TVO to maintain the organisation’s safety culture during the challenging change. At both Olkiluoto and Loviisa, modifications required for improving safety continued. New main steam line safety valves were installed at Loviisa 1 during the 2016 annual outage. They will also operate in a case where water flows through them in addition to steam. A similar installation was carried out at Loviisa 2 in 2014. New main steam line radiation measuring instruments were also installed and commissioned at Loviisa 1. Of the improvement measures started after the Fukushima accident, further improvements of the flood protection and securing the cooling of the fuel pools are still remaining. Their planning proceeded in 2016. An improvement project of the diesel fuel storage and transfer system was completed in 2016. STUK continued its review of the Loviisa I&C renewal documents and supervised installation work of the renewal’s first phase during the 2016 annual outage. The first phase included a preventive safety function control and indication system as well as modernisation of the I&C status monitoring system. The rest of the I&C renewal installations will be completed during the 2017 and 2018 annual outages. As a result of the Fukushima accident, Olkiluoto will improve, for example, systems used to cool the reactor and add whole new systems for pumping water into the reactor in case of a complete loss of AC power. Another ongoing project at Olkiluoto is an upgrade of the reactor coolant pumps and the emergency diesel generators. In 2016, first of the six reactor coolant pumps in Olkiluoto 1 was replaced. TVO plans to commission the new reactor coolant pumps between 2016 and 2018. STUK continued its review of documents pertaining to the modifications and the supervision of manufacture. The installation and construction work of Olkiluoto 3 are nearing the end, and full-scale testing of the systems and components was started in 2016. Testing of the I&C systems started {{at the beginning of the}} year and the first process system tests were performed in April 2016. TVO submitted an operating licence application for the plant unit to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in April 2016. At the same time, TVO submitted the documents on the plant and its operation required by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Decree to STUK for approval. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on review of the operating licence application and on oversight of the remaining installations and the commissioning activities. While reviewing the operating licence application, STUK also prepared implementation decisions for Olkiluoto 3 of the updated YVL Guides that were published in 2013. The new YVL Guides will enter into force for Olkiluoto 3 as soon as the operating licence is granted. Due to suspected product forgeries involving manufacturers in France, STUK required reports from the power companies on whether the suspicions involve manufacture of the components used at Olkiluoto 3 or whether any components from the said manufacturers have been used at the operating nuclear power plants. The report on Olkiluoto 3 must be submitted to STUK by the end of April 2017. No forgeries have been detected at the operating plant units, but the reports on Loviisa will be supplemented in early 2017. In June 2015, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE a construction licence application for a new nuclear power plant. At the same time, Fennovoima submitted to STUK for review documents required by the Nuclear Energy Decree. Fennovoima has supplemented and will supplement the construction licence application in stages between 2015 and 2018. Delivery of documents has been delayed from the schedule of the first licensing plan due to slower organisation than expected of the project and its supply chain and due to a lack of resources in the design organisation. STUK monitored the development of Fennovoima’s management system and quality management, and assessed the company’s organisational resources to begin construction of a nuclear power plant. In September 2015, STUK launched the inspections included in the regulatory inspection programme, and a total of 15 inspections of Fennovoima and key organisations of the plant supplier were carried out in 2016. Furthermore, STUK’s experts participated as observers in audits of the plant supplier and its subcontractors, arranged by Fennovoima. The handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel and operational waste and the disposal of operational waste were implemented safely, and no events compromising safety were detected at the Loviisa or Olkiluoto nuclear power plants. Due to the successful planning of operations, the plants accumulated clearly less operational waste than nuclear power plants on average. An important positive development in the waste management of the plants was the fact that operation of a solidification facility for liquid radioactive waste at the Loviisa nuclear power plant started on 15 February 2016 after STUK had approved the related application. Fortum continued the planning of repairs of the damage observed in the outer surface of the concrete vault in the solidified waste disposal facility, which is why the disposal of solidified waste could not be started yet. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is valid until the end of 2023. VTT shut down the research reactor for financial reasons in June 2015 and has been preparing decommissioning of the research reactor ever since. STUK has conducted all the measures necessary for the oversight of the reactor that was shut down and prepared for the review of the application on the decommissioning of the reactor. VTT submitted a nuclear waste management plan for the research reactor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in September 2016. The report described all measures since the 2015 report and all planned measures up until 2022. STUK stated in its statement to the MEAE that VTT had clearly progressed with the planning of the research reactor’s decommissioning over the course of the past year. The most important open issues regarding the decommissioning of the research reactor involve the return of spent fuel to the United States and the storage and disposal of dismantling waste. After Posiva Oy received a construction licence from the Government on 12 November 2015, STUK’s oversight has focused on the construction of the encapsulation and disposal facility. The regulatory oversight during the construction stage covers design, manufacture, construction and installation of the nuclear waste facility and its safety-classified systems, structures and components. This stage also includes the nuclear waste facility’s commissioning stage, at which time STUK will oversee Posiva’s operations, review testing programmes and results, and perform commissioning inspections. In 2016, STUK’s oversight focused particularly on the assessment of Posiva’s readiness for construction after the submission of the construction licence. STUK continued to oversee construction of the underground research facility by Posiva, Posiva’s system design, activities of the Posiva organisation and development of Posiva’s safety analyses. An important stage in 2016 was the start of the construction of the disposal facility according to the construction licence. STUK comprehensively assessed Posiva’s readiness for construction before the construction work was started. In June 2016, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE its environmental impact assessment programme on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel as required in the 2010 decision-inprinciple. The submission of the EIA programme started Fennovoima’s spent fuel disposal project and the selection process of the disposal facility site. Fennovoima has proposed Sydänneva in Pyhäjoki and Eurajoki as the potential sites. The more exact research area in Eurajoki has not been determined as of yet. In its statement on the EIA programme, STUK emphasised the fact that the proposed process would last a long time, the need to regularly assess the programme to ensure that it is up to date and the fact that the exact research area in Eurajoki must be determined as soon as possible. In addition to the operation and construction of a nuclear facility, the use of nuclear energy as laid down in section 2 of the Nuclear Energy Act includes the possession, manufacture, production, transfer, handling, use, storage, transport, export and import of nuclear material. Furthermore, components, systems and information required by nuclear facilities are subject to licensing and oversight by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Act. In 2016, STUK became aware of two cases of import without the proper licence. Nuclear safeguards in Finland were implemented in compliance with the international treaties. Nuclear safeguards ensure that nuclear materials and other nuclear items remain in peaceful use in compliance with the relevant licences and declarations and that nuclear facilities and related technologies are only utilised for peaceful purposes. STUK maintains a national control system which aim is to take care of the necessary oversight of use of nuclear energy for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. STUK processed reports and declarations on nuclear materials and performed safeguards inspections together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission. STUK actively promoted with the IAEA and the European Commission the development of nuclear safeguards for the disposal of spent fuel. Key issues in this development work were the development of a new oversight model and a new fuel measuring technology...|$|R
40|$|In the {{so-called}} developed countries, where agriculture and industrial revolutions occurred {{up to two}} or more centuries ago, there was an early awareness that education should {{be related to the}} needs of the population, including farmers. This resulted in the development of agricultural societies, events for technical demonstration and judging of produce, animals and farming skills (agricultural shows), changes in school curriculum and the establishment of skills training schools. This was followed by extension-type programmes through which agricultural advisory and instructional services were offered to farmers. As a result agriculture developed, the majority of farmers prospered and national economies benefited either from developing a greater self-sufficiency in farm products, thus reducing the need for imports, or from foreign exchange generated by exports of agriculturally derived goods. This has now clearly failed in most African countries, many of which are rich in agricultural potential. There is no denying that ACP countries have had <b>periodic</b> national development <b>programmes,</b> usually designed to be completed within a specific period of time and within a financial limit. Agriculture has featured prominently in such plans. But whatever the constraint of time and money available, it has to be said that a very serious area of neglect has been in agricultural education. Moreover, the agricultural component of development in Africa has often focused attention on the adults and has failed to address (any or sufficient) agricultural educational efforts at young men and women effectively. Youth involvement in agricultural development takes place at a minimal level. In some countries there are Young Farmer Clubs and there has been some introduction of agriculture into school curricula, but it is not sufficient. The teaching of agriculture is not comprehensive enough: Young Farmers Clubs (YFC) are to be found in few schools and their scarcity begs the question whether agriculture is seen as a serious subject for the pupils. The role that YFC members can play channelling new ideas into development programmes cannot be over-emphazised, particularly where many rural adults are illiterate. In this situation parents and other relatives rely on their young people as a channel of communication. Indeed, it has been observed among the majority of farmers that they tend to trust messages on agricultural innovations from their children more than from official extension agents. Well-organized YFCs provide excellent opportunities for conducting 'method-and-result' demons/rations, either on school ground or on farms of pupils' parents. In such cases there can be very rapid adoption of new techniques or varieties by farmers. YFCs also provide the opportunity for arousing an interest in agriculture in the rising generation, and demonstrating that agriculture can be a satisfying and economically rewarding occupation. There have been examples where YFC members have been encouraged under guidance to raise small livestock (goats, rabbits) and fish in ponds, or to grow vegetables and fruit for sale. Experience has been gained of budgeting costs, of managing finances and of putting theoretical mathematics to practical use. But to reap the benefits of YFCs, a widespread participation of the youth in a country is necessary; the organization and administration of YFCs must be good and YFCs are best integrated into the school system. Two levels of educational institutions are particularly relevant to the formation and sustainable conduct of YFCs. These are the post-primary and post-secondary school levels. Formation of YFCs should be compulsory at the post-primary level in order to give all young people an introduction to agriculture and to provide them with the opportunity to put into practice what they should be learning about agriculture in the national curriculum. At the post-secondary level YFC membership may be voluntary, since by this stage some pupils will have decided on careers not connected with agriculture. Yet even these will have learned enough to understand better national rural development policies during their adult life and to tend home gardens in order to supplement income. A typical YFC should assume a simple organizational structure but should involve members in participative management of the Club. YFCs should also develop linkages with support service organizations including agricultural research, supply industries and credit institutions; and members of research stations, extension services, agro-input supply companies and banks should be invited to speak to YFCs from time to time. Some such individuals may be interested enough in youth work to play a more regular role in YFCs and to help supervise and guide the YFC office-holders who have been elected to office. Sustaining the interest of members is most important and activities must be planned that arouse and maintain interest. Interest can be sustained by the close links with institutions already mentioned, by visits to agricultural shows and film shows, by encouraging skills development and holding competitions, and by organizing social events. Agriculture must be recognized as a vital industry in Africa and it is essential that new generations are made aware both of its importance to our countries and of the basis of growing crops, raising livestock, buying and selling. YFCs can help achieve this by assisting with the rapid spread of agricultural technologies at grassroots; by enhancing the teaching of agriculture in schools; and by developing new generations of young people knowledgeable about agriculture and even motivated to take up agriculture as a career. In {{the so-called}} developed countries, where agriculture and industrial revolutions occurred up to two or more centuries ago, there was an early awareness that education should be related {{to the needs of the}} population, including farmers.

40|$|This paper investigates {{programmes}} review, {{the process}} whereby government expenditure programmes are examined from a results perspective. Drawing from international experience, the paper explores {{some of the}} main issues involved in developing a system of programme review. The aim is to promote discussion on the most appropriate ways of implementing programme review in government departments, given the government decision of 25 March 1997 to introduce a programme of comprehensive expenditure reviews. This decision enacts the commitment in Delivering Better Government (1996) to introduce regular, <b>periodic</b> reviews of <b>programmes.</b> These reviews will take place {{within the context of the}} move to multi-annual budgeting, with a three-year cycle of expenditure planning and review. A number of points are highlighted in the paper: · Programme review is not new. It is currently undertaken in the civil service, but on an ad-hoc and limited basis (section 2). · Arrangements for programme review are likely to vary from department to department, depending on the size and range of programmes they have responsibility for and the size of the department. The most common options are to locate the programme review function with line managers or with a departmental corporate staff group. Programmes may also be reviewed by independent units and by sources external to the department (section 3). · The evaluation units set up to monitor and review EU structural funds are an innovative example of programme review in one specific area of activity. The wider applicability of this model is worth further study (section 3. 3). · The location of the programme review function determines the type of issues which will be addressed. The closer the review function is to the programme Committee for Public Management Research 4 under scrutiny, the less likely it is to be able to deal with issues of impact and continuing relevance of the programme (section 3. 5). · Programme review needs to focus on a number of key attributes of the programme under scrutiny. Significant attributes include: efficiency, effectiveness, equity, cost, intrusiveness and accountability (section 4. 1). · Reviewing each programme comprehensively once every three years is a challenging task. International experience indicates that in practice, priorities will have to be set (section 4. 2). · Training and development supports will be needed; both for those conducting programme review, to develop evaluation skills; and for those commissioning and using review studies, to get the most out of them (section 5). · Encouraging effective demand to ensure that programme review findings are actively used in public expenditure decisions is a central challenge. Questions addressed in programme review should lead to improvements or to the modification or termination of unsuccessful programmes. Demand can be encouraged by effective use of the three main policy instruments: ‘sticks’, ‘carrots’ and ‘sermons’ (section 6). · Resourcing the review process and the right to ask and address the key questions are particularly important if the demand for review is to be encouraged. Specific ‘ear-marking’ of funds for review is one means of enabling review to compete with other activities for resources. Questions must include a focus on the outcomes and results of programmes if reviews are to address more than relatively minor issues (section 6). · Programme review findings do not automatically feed into budgetary and planning decisions. These links need to be developed. Formal mechanisms and processes are needed to ensure that review findings are influential (section 7). Committee for Public Management Research 1. Background Programme review refers to the process whereby government programme expenditure is examined from a results perspective. The aim is to determine whether there is a public need for the programme, and if so, can it be improved. Questions generally focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of programme expenditure, and determining whether spending is focused on the highest priorities. There are various means of reviewing programmes, of which the most common are usually manager-led reviews, audit, and evaluation (Annual Report to Parliament by the President of the Treasury Board, 1995 : 10 - 11). Programme review is specifically referred to in Delivering Better Government (1996 : 59 - 60) : The group recognise that there is a need for a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by the £ 12 billion in government resources spent annually. To this end, the group recommend [...] . agreements between the Department of Finance and individual departments on delegated authority for programme expenditures to provide for a schedule of reviews of expenditure to be carried out during the currency of the agreement, with the aim of ensuring that each programme of expenditure is subject to a thorough review at least once every three years. A government decision of 25 March 1997 enacted this recommendation, by specifying arrangements for carrying out comprehensive programme expenditure reviews. A steering committee for programme evaluation is to oversee the process. This committee will be chaired by the Secretary General, Department of Finance, and include two secretaries general of spending departments and an independent consultant. Reviews, which will be specified each year by departments, are to be carried out under joint Finance and spending department steering groups. The review programme will aim to examine all spending programmes over a three year period. Committee for Public Management Research Reports will be submitted to the steering committee, who will then report to the Minister for Finance and the minister responsible for the programme reviewed. The need for such a system of programme review is highlighted by the National Economic and Social Council report Strategy into the 21 st Century, where weaknesses in the current public expenditure control system are identified: ‘Even when new priorities and programmes emerge, expenditure on existing programmes has a strong tendency to grow. This tendency for expenditure to grow undermines the ability of policy to reflect priorities’ (NESC, 1996 : 21). These weaknesses need to be tackled if the council’s recommended approach to fiscal policy is to be pursued(NESC, 1996 : 23) : That approach must recognise that action to deliver greater employment, social inclusion and action to reduce taxation, especially personal taxes, are fundamental priorities. These priorities must be achieved in the first instance, and not as residuals when existing or ‘no policy change’ expenditure bills are met. The council wishes to stress the need to limit the growth in current public expenditure to no more than 2 per cent per annum in real terms. The council appreciates that it will be necessary to make significant savings on existing activities both to observe that limit and to find room for the costs of the council’s social action programme. The council believes that there is scope for greater efficiency and effectiveness in many areas of public expenditure. The council thus identifies as a key requirement for successful public finance management the review and development of the systems of public expenditure management and control, within the context of the council’s strategy and the Strategic Management Initiative (SMI) (NESC, 1996 : 22). This paper aims to explore {{some of the main}} issues involved in developing a system of programme review. A number of key questions arise from plans to develop programme review: how comprehensive can coverage be; what skills and resources Committee for Public Management Research are needed to undertake reviews; how can review be linked to budgetary decisionmaking;what should the respective roles of the Department of Finance and line departments be? These questions are addressed, using lessons learnt from international experience with programme review. In capturing this experience, this paper draws heavily on the emerging findings of a study into evaluation capacity building being undertaken by an International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS) working group on policy and programme evaluation (Boyle and Lemaire (eds), forthcoming). Section 2 of this paper outlines current practice with regard to programme review inthe Irish civil service. In section 3, possible alternative locations for the programme review function are discussed. Section 4 looks at what should be covered by programme review. Section 5 outlines the skills and competencies needed for conducting and using programme review. Section 6 explores the incentives and sanctions available to help institutionalise programme review. Section 7 investigates the linking of programme review and budgeting. Finally in Section 8, some conclusions and issues for consideration are outlined...|$|R
