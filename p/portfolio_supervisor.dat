40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} 2004 Post Program Monitoring Discussions for the Philippines. The {{authorities}} are formulating a significant package of tax measures. IMF staff {{argued that the}} bulk of the additional revenues should be saved, thereby front-loading the medium-term deficit reduction effort. Such a strategy would boost market confidence and exploit the likely greater potential to enact tax measures {{at the beginning of the}} new administrationâ€™s term. The authorities are now also considering the power sector reforms.

40|$|This paper assesses how {{various types}} of {{financial}} risk such as credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk affect banking stability in the ten countries that joined the European Union most recently, and eight neighboring countries. It also examines how the quality of supervisory standards may have mitigated the vulnerabilities arising from these risk factors. Using panel data, the study finds substantial variation in the impacts of financial risks, the macroeconomic environment, and supervisory standards on banks'' risk profile across different country clusters. Credit quality is of general concern especially in circumstances where credit growth is accelerating.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} key {{findings of}} the Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes on Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency, Banking Supervision, and Payment Systems for the Kyrgyz Republic. Though the Kyrgyz Republic has made progress in addressing macroeconomic imbalances in recent years, its financial system remains small and at a fairly low level of development. Thus, most financial vulnerabilities should be viewed {{more in terms of}} their threat to financial sector development than their threat to macroeconomic stability.
