25|$|Optimization {{can reduce}} {{readability}} and add code {{that is used}} only to improve the performance. This may complicate programs or systems, making them harder to maintain and debug.

25|$|Prior to playing, the timpanist must {{clear the}} heads by {{equalizing}} the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to {{exactly the same}} pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of relative pitch and must develop techniques to tune in an undetectable manner and accurately {{in the middle of}} a <b>performance.</b> <b>Tuning</b> is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.|$|E
