40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> for fissile mass estimation, {{relying on}} {{neutrons}} coming from spontaneous fission events, {{is considered a}} standard NDT procedure in the nuclear safeguard and safety community. Since most structure materials are (relatively) transparent to neutron radiation, <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> is considered highly effective {{in the analysis of}} dirty, poorly characterized samples. Since a typical passive interrogation assembly is based on 3 He detectors embedded in a moderating medium, neutrons from additional neutron sources (mainly (alpha, n) reactions and induced fissions in the tested sample) {{can not be separated from}} the main spontaneous fission source through energetic spectral analysis. There for, applying the passive interrogation methods requires the implementation of Neutron Multiplicity Counting methods (NMC) for separation between the main fission source and the additional sources. Applying NMC methods requires a well characterized system, in the sense that both system die away time and detection efficiency must be well known (and in particular, both parameters must be independent of the tested sample). Hence, the implementation of standard <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> methods on poorly characterized systems (say, systems with a large uncertainty on the position of the sample), or on samples containing neutron absorbers, is not practical. In the present study we introduce a new NMC method, in which the detection efficiency is computed directly through the measurement itself, without the need of a prior calibration. In particular, since we do not need to a priory know the system efficiency, the method might prove extremely useful in the above mentioned cases. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
40|$|Tension {{metastable}} fluid states offer unique {{potential for}} radical transformation in radiation detection capabilities. States of tension metastability {{may be obtained}} in tailored resonant acoustic systems such as the acoustic tension metastable fluid detector (ATMFD) system or via centrifugal force based systems such as the centrifugal tension metastable fluid detector (CTMFD) system; both under development at Purdue University. Tension metastable fluid detector (TMFD) systems {{take advantage of the}} weakened intermolecular bonds of liquids in sub-vacuum states. Nuclear particles incident onto sufficiently tensioned fluids can nucleate critical size vapor bubbles which grow from nanoscales and are then possible to see, hear, and record with unprecedented efficiency and capability. Past work has shown the ability of TMFD systems to detect neutrons with energies spanning eight orders of magnitude with 95 %+ intrinsic efficiency while remaining insensitive to gamma photons and also giving directional information on the source of the radiation. ^ This dissertation describes research results with acetone-based CTMFD systems for use in the detection of key actinide isotopes constituting special nuclear material (SNM) via their alpha decay signatures and neutron emission. The ability of CTMFD systems to conduct alpha spectroscopy over the range of ∼ 4 - 6 MeV which spans the alpha decay energies from the actinides of interest in spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing was demonstrated. Along with demonstrated spectroscopic capabilities, tests in CTMFD systems developed and used for this work have demonstrated the ability to detect, differentiate,and accurately determine alpha-decay activity (at ∼ 100 % efficiency) of Pu- 238 and Pu- 239 at concentrations of ∼ 0. 05 ppt and ∼ 15 ppt respectively (which is unprecedented and x 10 to x 100 more sensitive than from our state-of-the-art Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation spectrometer). ^ An inherent capability of TMFD systems concerns on demand tailoring of fluid tension levels allowing for energy discrimination and spectroscopy. This appears especially useful to detect the key isotopes of U as well as isotopes of the transuranic elements Pu, Np, Am, and Cm that are at different stages of SNF reprocessing (i. e., UREX+). The work of this dissertation has also demonstrated the capability of the TMFD technology for differentiating the alpha emission signature of Pu- 238 from Am- 241; this is transformational since most alpha particle detectors can not differentiate between the 5. 49 MeV and 5. 485 MeV alpha decay energies of these two isotopes which, unfortunately, build up together. ^ A detailed set of ORIGEN-S code based modeling simulations were conducted and successfully benchmarked against post-irradiation-examination data of SNFs. Simulations were conducted for deriving estimates and trends of isotopic buildup in SNF as a function of power history, burnup, enrichment, and cooling times. Key figures of merit for trends were derived to use together with TMFD technology for successful real-time detection of actinides at various stages of reprocessing, including at the crucial front-end. ^ An algorithm for general application in SNF reprocessing plants has been developed along with a framework for field implementation. This framework combines the use of TMFD technology (for active interrogation of actinide bearing streams for their alpha activity, together with <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation)</b> with continually refined analytic assessments using the ORIGEN-S code in real-time to determine the various quantities of isotopes of Am, Cm, and Pu. ...|$|E
40|$|The Sellafield DryPac Plant (SDP) {{is a new}} {{facility}} {{for the treatment of}} Intermediate Level Waste (ILW), prior to long term storage in a future Nirex repository. A current Nirex requirement is that the fissile content of waste packages shall not exceed a predefined post closure case criticality limit. In order to police this limit the plutonium content of each SDP product drum will be measured by <b>Passive</b> <b>Neutron</b> Coincidence Counting (PNCC), using a pair of custom-designed assay chambers. These instruments have already been assembled and subjected to works and customer acceptance tests.

We consider an 11 -layer security system consisting of shipper certification, container seals, and a targeting software system, followed by <b>passive</b> (<b>neutron</b> and gamma), active (gamma radiography), and manual testing at overseas and domestic ports. Currently implemented policies achieve a low detection probability, and improved security requires passive and active testing of trusted containers and manually opening containers that cannot be penetrated by radiography. The annual cost of achieving a high detection probability of a plutonium weapon using existing equipment in traditional ways is roughly several billion dollars if testing is done domestically, and is approximately five times higher if testing is performed overseas. Our results suggest that employing high-energy x-ray radiography and elongating the <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> tests at overseas ports may provide significant cost savings, and several developing technologies, radiation sensors inside containers and tamper-resistant electronic seals, should be pursued aggressively.

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to design an active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> system to search for conventional explosives. The work began with {{a review of the}} current methods for explosives detection, with a particular focus on active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation.</b> The next step was to design a layered shield for an isotopic neutron generator that limited the influence of unattenuated neutrons at undesirable angles. The final shielding design was then adapted for neutron and gamma ray detector collimation in an active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> system, and a modular shielding arrangement was proposed. Focus then shifted to improving the flexibility of the active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> system via introduction of a method to reliably vary the energy from nearly monoenergetic sealed-tube deuterium-deuterium or deuterium-tritium neutron generators. This was accomplished through single neutron elastic scatter off a target of known composition, resulting in neutrons with predictable energies that can be adjusted through manipulation of the interrogation target location relative to the scatter target and neutron generator. This neutron elastic scatter system was optimized through the adoption of a neutron time-of-flight (TOF) method, where the hydrogen nuclei in the start detector (scatter target) also served as the scattering medium, signaling neutron scatter and allowing for discrimination of neutrons that did not interact in the scatter target. Laboratory measurements and simulations were performed to characterize the new variable energy neutron elastic scatter (VENES) system and evaluate its effectiveness in performing fast neutron resonance radiography. Preliminary investigations on the application of VENES to fast neutron analysis and neutron backscatter were also conducted to direct future work. There was a particular interest in combining all three active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> methods with the VENES system and proposed shield designs, allowing for investigations across multiple different neutron energies in the MeV range. The VENES system permits for reliable alteration of neutron energy in active interrogation systems, using relatively cheap, portable, and easily operated components that are either currently, or soon-to-be, commercially available.

40|$|The glaring need {{to develop}} methods for {{detecting}} and interdicting illicit nuclear trafficking {{has resulted in the}} exploration of various methods for active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation,</b> specifically for the presence of special nuclear material (SNM) in cargo containers. The proposed system aims to defeat the ability of terrorists to import SNM into the United States via maritime shipping, thus greatly reducing the possibility of a successful nuclear terrorist attack. The proposed system uses 60 - 100 keV neutrons, produced by the 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction in a linear accelerator and kinematically beamed into various targets. In the event that fissile material is present, highly energetic neutrons will be emitted from the fissioning of a nucleus and some of these neutrons will eventually radiate from the container. Inevitably, high energy photons will also radiate from the target due to the interactions of neutrons and host materials. Utilizing a neutron detection system that is able to discriminate low energy neutrons, high energy gamma rays and the high energy neutrons from fission enables the detection of fissile material in various containers. An increase in discriminated high energy neutron events during active <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> selectively indicates the presence of SNM, since neutron energies on the order of 1 MeV are required for the SNM-equivalent fissioning potential when incident upon U 238 and other high-Z nuclei. Furthermore, neutrons with less than approximately 100 keV do not undergo nuclear processes such as (n, 2 n) and (n,n'), but rather lose their energy through kinematic collisions. (cont.) Results obtained validate this proof-of-concept, in that observed high energy neutron events increase significantly in the presence of gram-quantities of SNM. Further, attempts made to shield the SNM from active interrogation do not defeat the proposed system's ability to identify the presence of SNM.

40|$|In nuclear {{material}} processing facilities, {{it is often}} necessary to balance the competing demands of accuracy and throughput. While <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity counting is the preferred method for relatively fast assays of plutonium, the presence of low-Z impurities (fluorine, beryllium, etc.) rapidly erodes the assay precision of <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> counting techniques, frequently resulting in unacceptably large total measurement uncertainties. Conversely, while calorimeters are immune to these impurity effects, the long count times required for high accuracy can be a hindrance to efficiency. The higher uncertainties in <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> measurements of impure material are driven by the resulting large (>> 2) {alpha}-values, defined as the ({alpha},n) :spontaneous fission neutron emission ratio. To counter impurity impacts for high-{alpha} materials, a known-{alpha} approach may be adopted. In this method, {alpha} is determined for a single item {{using a combination of}} gamma-ray and calorimetric measurements. Because calorimetry is based on heat output, rather than a statistical distribution of emitted neutrons, an {alpha}-value determined in this way is far more accurate than one determined from <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> counts. This fixed {alpha} value can be used in conventional multiplicity analysis for any plutonium-bearing item having the same chemical composition and isotopic distribution as the original. With the results of single calorimeter/passive neutron/gamma-ray measurement, these subsequent items can then be assayed with high precision and accuracy in a relatively short time, despite the presence of impurities. A calorimeter-based known-{alpha} multiplicity analysis technique is especially useful when requiring rapid, high accuracy, high precision measurements of multiple plutonium bearing items having a common source. The technique has therefore found numerous applications at the Savannah River Site. In each case, a plutonium (or mixed U/Pu) bearing item is divided into multiple containers. A single item from that batch is then selected for both neutron and calorimetric measurements; all remaining items undergo a neutron measurement only. Using the technique mentioned above, the 'true' {alpha} value determined from the first (calorimeter and <b>passive</b> <b>neutron</b> measured) item is used in multiplicity analysis for all other items in the batch. The justification for using this {alpha} value in subsequent calculations is the assumption that the chemical composition and isotopic distribution of all batch items are the same, giving a constant ({alpha},n) :spontaneous fission ratio. This analysis method has been successfully applied to the KIS Facility, significantly improving measurement uncertainties and reducing processing times for numerous items. Comprehensive plans were later developed to extend the use of this method to other applications, including the K-Area Shuffler and the H-Area Pu-Blending Project. While only the feasibility study for the Shuffler has been completed, implementation of the method in the H-Area Pu-Blending Project is currently in progress and has been successfully applied to multiple items. This report serves to document the details of this method in order to serve as a reference for future applications.

In some cases, especially for U- 235, active methods (<b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation)</b> are needed for clear identification. It is possible to detect nuclear warheads in a distance of some ten meters in case no countermeasures (severe shielding or radiation) are made...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>neutron</b> <b>interrogation</b> {{techniques}} exists for {{the identification and}} characterization of fissile materials. Typically the sample is irradiated continuously or in pulses, and the neutron or gamma response is used to for the characterization. Active neutron coincidence counting {{is one of these}} techniques, based on the detection of correlated prompt neutrons from induced fission in 235 U, in order to quantify uranium. Typically AmLi neutron sources are used for the interrogation so far. In this study we used {{for the first time a}} guided cold <b>neutron</b> beam for <b>interrogation,</b> which is a far more intense source of uncorrelated neutrons. A pilot neutron coincidence setup was installed at a neutron beam of the Budapest Neutron Centre, and samples of small volumes and various uranium contents were measured. It was proven that the detection of fission events (Doubles) is feasible even for micrograms of 235 U and the detector response is proportional to the fissile content of the sample. JRC.
