5000|$|By 1830 over 300 shallow pits {{had been}} sunk {{including}} some at Wardley near the Preston to Manchester road, most were short-lived. Abbot's Fold <b>pit</b> <b>worked</b> the Worsley Four Foot mine and was linked by an underground level to Ingles pit at Worsley and possibly had a tramway to the canal. To the north Mather's Field <b>pit</b> <b>worked</b> the Bin mine and coal was wound by a steam engine. In the 1830 the Burgess Land pit was sunk to the Bin mine north of Ellenbrook, it employed 35 [...] "men and boys" [...] in 1852 and {{was linked to}} the canal by a tramroad. Shude Hill pit had a steam winding engine. The City and Gatley pits at New Manchester north of Mosley Common were sunk in the 1840s and linked to the navigable levels and a horse-drawn tramroad to Mathers Fold. These <b>pits</b> <b>worked</b> the Brassey mine at 262 feet and the Rams mine at 360 feet and employed 64 workers in 1852. An explosion of firedamp in 1838 and a roof fall in 1843 caused two deaths. The Bridgewater Trustees began sinking deep shafts closer to the Ellenbrook in 1862 and the pits became known as Mosley Common Colliery. The area has been opencasted.|$|R

50|$|For the Busch Series race at Memphis in 2001, Gold and Jarrett {{called the}} race for NBC, while Sheheen did the <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> because the regular {{broadcast}} team of Allen Bestwick, Wally Dallenbach, and Benny Parsons were in Martinsville, waiting out a rain delay that ended up delaying the race until the next day, making them unavailable to call the race.|$|E
5000|$|... 2000: Paul Tracy started 17th, but {{steadily}} {{climbed to}} the front of the field, taking the lead on lap 62 to win at Long Beach for the second time. Tracy benefited from strong pit strategy, swift <b>pit</b> <b>work,</b> and an aggressive charge, and managed to put himself in third on lap 58. On a restart with rookie Takuya Kurosawa leading, Roberto Moreno second, and Tracy third, Moreno suddenly slowed with gearbox trouble. Tracy muscled past Kurosawa four laps later, and held off Hélio Castroneves for the victory.|$|E
50|$|That day 349 workers {{descended the}} No 3 bank <b>pit</b> shaft to <b>work</b> in the Plodder, Yard and Three Quarters mines. Of those, only four survived {{to be brought}} to the surface. One died {{immediately}} and one the next day. The two survivors were Joseph Staveley and William Davenport. In addition one man died in the Arley Mine of No. 4 Pit, bringing the total to 344. There was a final fatality that day, William Turton, who died while fighting a fire in No. 3 pit. The men who were working the other mines in the <b>pit</b> <b>worked</b> from No.4 shaft were unharmed.|$|R

50|$|By March 1874 the Raspberry Gully shaft had yet {{to strike}} the aimed for Borehole Seam of coal, so the {{directors}} of the Waratah Coal Company decided to sink a shaft closer to existing working collieries where the seam was known to exist and was being worked. This shaft was adjacent to the route of the railway line being constructed to the Raspberry Gully mine, and was known as Stuart's <b>Pit.</b> <b>Work</b> on this colliery stopped soon after the Borehole seam was struck as the coal seam was only 0.431m thick.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter {{until the}} 1950s Ginzler split {{his time between}} <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> and {{ghosting}} arrangements mainly for Walker and other composers (e.g. Irving Berlin’s Miss Liberty). Ginzler was a fast worker sometimes orchestrating as much as two-fifths of popular scores such as The Music Man and Wonderful Town. He specialized in jazzy dance numbers for the up-and-coming Bob Fosse, notably “Steam Heat” and “Whatever Lola Wants,” both penned by the composing team of Adler and Ross. Occasionally Ginzler might receive assistant credits {{at the back of}} the Playbills for these shows.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998: Swift <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> {{during the}} second round of pit stops put Dario Franchitti in the lead on lap 30. Franchitti took the lead from polesitter Michael Andretti, and led the rest of the way. Andretti lost second place on the final lap when he blew a tire and crashed hard in turn 3. It was Franchitti's first career Indy car win, and the first win for car owner Barry Green since 1995. Bryan Herta {{narrowly}} escaped injury after spinning out on lap 10, and Alex Barron crashed and landed on top of his car.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s Shude Hill Pit had a steam winding engine. City Pit and Gatley Pit were in {{operation}} by 1838 {{linked to the}} Worsley Navigable Levels and a horse-drawn tramroad to Mathers Fold. The tramway was extended to link several pits to Bridgewater Canal at Boothstown Basin. These <b>pits</b> <b>worked</b> the Brassey mine (coal seam) at 262 feet and the Rams mine at 360 feet, employed 64 workers in 1852, and were closed in 1877. The area has been opencasted.|$|R

5000|$|... 2016: Hélio Castroneves led 49 of {{the first}} 51 laps. During {{the second round of}} stops, Scott Dixon was able to pass Castroneves with quick <b>pit</b> <b>work.</b> However, Simon Pagenaud's pit stop was even faster, and he emerged with the lead of the race. Controversy followed, as Pagenaud placed two tires over the blend line at the exit of pit lane while trying to beat Dixon to turn one. IndyCar {{officials}} let Pagenaud off with a warning for the incident, despite protests from Chip Ganassi Racing. Pagenaud held off Dixon by 0.3032 seconds, the closest finish in Long Beach history.|$|E
50|$|At Le Mans, Audi won {{for their}} third {{consecutive}} {{time with the}} R10. The #2 car driven by Rinaldo Capello, Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen took the chequered flag on lap 381 ahead of the #7 Peugeot, with a margin of just over 4 minutes. The other two Audi entries finished fourth and sixth overall. Peugeot brought their seasoned 908 HDi FAP and qualified within the 3:18 range while Audi struggled to get under the 3:23 mark. In the race itself the Peugeot was still up to 3.5 seconds a lap faster but quick <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> by Audi and the superior performance by the R10 in the rain saw Audi winning Le Mans.|$|E
50|$|Several early sawmills in England {{were burned}} by sawyers who were fearful {{of losing their}} livelihoods. However, the {{increased}} efficiency of the sawmill, and the back-breaking nature of the saw <b>pit</b> <b>work,</b> resulted in saw pits generally going out of use in the United Kingdom {{at the time of}} the industrial revolution. Old OS maps circa 1860 often show the location of saw pits, but by the start of the 20th century very few remained and most are no longer in use. Roy Underhill tells the tall tale, or tongue-in-cheek story, that, after the development of steam-powered sawing machines, saw pits were unnecessary, and therefore were cut up and sold as post-holes.|$|E

5000|$|Lead {{and zinc}} mines have {{existed in the}} central part of the Mechernich region since ancient times during the Roman occupation. Since the 13th century the most {{prevalent}} product brought to the surface has been lead. The main ore minerals galena, sphalerite and cerussite are disseminated in nodular impregnations (Knotten) and veinlets in the region in and surrounding Mechernich. Mining activities at the Mechernich lead line in 1882 saw almost 4,500 people engaged in <b>pit</b> <b>work.</b> And as late as 1952 the lead mine and its mills were still worked from numerous mines and open cuts south and southwest of Mechernich and were responsible for 20% of lead production in West Germany. But mining proved more and more expensive and mining ceased in 1957 ...|$|E
50|$|The race began under rain conditions, so {{everyone}} went for wet tyres. Lauda was fastest at the start, while Pryce had {{a slow start}} and was passed by Jarier; the Frenchman soon attempted to pass Lauda in an ill-advised overtaking manoeuvre, and hit the barriers at the Mirabeau; his car was damaged in the collision and handled badly, which caused him to hit the wall again at the chicane and then retire. Peterson went into the second place with Vittorio Brambilla third, until Pryce hit the Italian's wheel. Regazzoni stopped to change a tyre and the nosecone of his car, and James Hunt stopped to change onto slick tyres, anticipating a drying of the track surface. However, his team's slow <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> cost him {{a substantial amount of}} time.|$|E

50|$|Tests in 1948 by Paul Strieff, a {{graduate}} student from Michigan, revealed evidence of Archaic deposits. The site {{was to become a}} parking lot, and grading the soil in the spring of 1949 exposed a number of <b>pits.</b> <b>Work</b> was halted for a brief investigation, which proved the site was so rich that archaeological work continued through the summer, with five trenches excavated. From September to December the site was excavated by Barton Wright from the University of Arizona; he was able to grasp the stratigraphy and separate the Middle Archaic Guilford level from the Late Archaic Savannah River level.|$|R

5000|$|Saw pits were {{a crucial}} {{component}} of shipbuilding, for which planks of wood were {{necessary for the}} construction of all classes of vessels. The logs of wood to be sawn were placed over a pit on planks of wood called [...] "dogs" [...] in naval jargon. The senior sawyer stood on top of the plank. The junior one had to go into the pit, which was often partially filled with water, with sawdust constantly 'raining down,' so he stood in a layer of sawdust as a result. One theory of the origin of the terms 'top dog' and 'underdog' is that they come from saw <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> practices (however, others cite documentary evidence that these terms more likely arose from dog fighting). Cutting from underneath a suspended log is sometimes called [...] "underbucking." ...|$|E
5000|$|Racing resumed on lap 19, where Josef Newgarden {{was able}} to get around Will Power on track. The next lap however, Power {{attempted}} to pass him back, but in the process clipped the rear bumper pod on Newgarden's car, forcing Newgarden to pit for a rear wing assembly change for the second consecutive race. Up front, Montoya continued to lead until lap 25, when he finally made his first pit stop. The lead was handed to one of the drivers on the alternate pit stop strategy, Mikhail Aleshin, who began to pull away from the field. Aleshin maintained his lead through the second pit stop sequence, but behind him, the Team Penske duo of Power and Pagenaud moved into second and third thanks to quick <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> from their teams. The gap to Aleshin, though, remained large.|$|E
5000|$|Racing resumed on lap 6, {{with the}} running order up front {{remaining}} unchanged. However, Newgarden began to gain ground and, {{only a few}} laps after the restart, was able to pass Pagenaud for fourth. Hinchcliffe managed to move into fifth in the same move after Pagenaud lost momentum from being forced out wide by Newgarden. The first round of green flag pit stops followed, during which Newgarden was able to jump up to second thanks to quick <b>pit</b> <b>work</b> from his team and the slowing pace of Castroneves and Dixon, who had gone the farthest on their first stint. Dixon was also able to get around Castroneves during the sequence, allowing him to maintain his third position. Further back in the field, Alexander Rossi, despite a poor qualifying result, had managed {{to move into the}} top ten and was continuing to improve.|$|E
