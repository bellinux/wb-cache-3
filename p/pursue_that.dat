Its {{stomach was}} muscular, and could distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey {{in the general direction}} of an individual waiting in ambush. Trappers reported it as an ambush predator.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of development, Vicious Cycle wanted players on all three consoles {{to be able to}} play against each other online. [...] This option was ultimately not implemented for the DS. [...] Lead designer Dave Ellis said [...] "...development time and platform limitations didn’t permit our DS developers to <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> option, so the DS version was ultimately limited to Wi-Fi and online play with other DS players." [...] The PSP and PC versions allow players to use the same matchmaking system, and the game's code is linked so that if one platform is patched, the other must be as well. [...] Players with a PC can download and use the online component of the game for free.|$|E

500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> power.|$|E
2500|$|While Renkse {{experimented with}} clean, melodic vocals over metal {{instrumentation}} {{as early as}} the 1994 recording of the track [...] "Scarlet Heavens" [...] (later released in very limited capacity on Katatonia/Primordial in 1996), the band did not feel ready to <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> sort of sound at the time. However, after the band's 1997 releases, due to a desire to create more emotive and evolving music, the band decided to move in that direction. The first of said releases was an EP entitled Saw You Drown, released in early 1998, which also contained the first wide release of [...] "Scarlet Heavens". Later in 1998, the band released their first full-album of this style, titled Discouraged Ones.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Emperor Wenzong {{summoned the}} senior officials, {{including}} {{the heads of}} the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them as to what they opined. [...] A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (崔玄亮), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (王質), Lu Jun (盧均), Shu Yuanbao (舒元褒), Jiang Xi (蔣係), Pei Xiu (裴休), and Wei Wen (韋溫), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. [...] Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. [...] Cui bowed and wept, stating, [...] "One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor." [...] Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. [...] Niu then stated, [...] "The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. [...] If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, and why would he <b>pursue</b> <b>that?</b> [...] Surely that was not what he was planning." [...] Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled.|$|E

2500|$|British {{political}} writer George Monbiot decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as {{an example}} of state persecution and the erosion of civil liberties in the United States, while journalist Amy Goodman characterized it as evidence of [...] "a new McCarthyism". Charles C Haynes, senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, also situated the controversy {{in the context of the}} freedom of expression debate, criticising the school for allowing a [...] "heckler's veto" [...] to censor Sierra and the school district for spending [...] "more than US$75,000 fighting to keep her quiet". A New York University drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, United We Stand, inspired by Sierra's actions. The Thomas Jefferson Center, an organization dedicated to the protection of freedom of expression, highlighted the controversy in 2002 and awarded the Kanawha school board and principal Forest Mann with their annual [...] "Jefferson Muzzle" [...] award. Highlighting a quote by Katie Sierra ("There are many types of anarchy. I want us to unite as one instead of having some government over top of us.") the center wrote, [...] "While school officials have the authority to prevent disruption of school activities, such authority should not be used as a pretext to stifle expression with which they disagree. Moreover, a high school student who shows an active interest in the important issues of the day and who takes the initiative to form a club to <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> interest should be commended." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote to}} Laurence on 22 February 1797 {{that he did}} not wish for a change in {{government}} lest it [...] "lead to a change in the constitution" [...] but agreed that a [...] "reform in the abuses of executive government" [...] was needed and that Fox would carry on the war [...] "for the same reason , and peace would be made by him more to advantage, because, made by him, there would be virtually a saving of the country's honour—made by Mr Pitt, the country is beat into it' made by Mr Fox it is a measure of choice". In March 1797 he looked with sympathy on a scheme by MPs and peers to form a government without Pitt and wrote a Memorial on the state of Ireland in which he called for Emancipation and the sacking of anti-Catholic members of the Irish government, which would reconcile Catholics to British rule and halt the spread of Jacobinism. He spoke in the Lords to put forward these proposals but it was rejected by 72 votes to 20. Fitzwilliam wrote on 2 April that he was [...] "the most isolated individual in politics in the king's dominions...a person who approves of nothing doing and therefore of no set of men whatever". The government had abandoned its principles and the Foxites were [...] "more hostile in ten times in my opinion, and more decided to act upon principles contrary to my views, than the Ministry". On 30 May Fitzwilliam met Burke at his home in Beaconsfield during his last illness before his death. Burke reported to Laurence that Fitzwilliam had [...] "a strong predilection to Mr Fox" [...] and [...] "influenced, too much so in my opinion, though very naturally and very excusably, by a rooted animosity against Mr Pitt". Fitzwilliam returned to his previous independence when the scheme for a [...] "third party" [...] collapsed and Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 July (the day of Burke's death) that Burke had said on his deathbed: [...] "Inform Lord Fitzwilliam from me that it is my dying advice and request to him, steadily to <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> course in which he now is. He can take no other that will not be unworthy of him". Laurence said [...] "this was almost if not quite the last thing which he said on public affairs".
