5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many {{of its leaders}} continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up {{in some areas of}} Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E

5|$|A <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of Roman loss {{in battle}} was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E

5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is the <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff's {{friendliness}} {{toward other}} characters varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers {{him to be}} the <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of an outstandingly good driver. Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is treated with respect by her in spite of his slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E

Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b> The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat has {{two large}} and {{remarkable}} churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith's Church {{is the oldest}} and a <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of Romanesque architecture. Its design is related to similar buildings both in the Rhine region and in Lorraine. It was built {{during the second half}} of the 12th century to replace an earlier building. The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found during this work. It is often attributed to Hildegard of Eguisheim, founder of the church, and is now displayed in a crypt.|$|E
5|$|The Vimala Temple is {{considered}} one of the Shakti Pithas, the most sacred temples of the Hindu Goddess, identified with Parvati or Durga as consort of the god Shiva.

It is customary to worship Shiva at each Shakti Pitha in the form of Bhairava, the male counterpart or guardian of the presiding goddess of the Shakti Pitha.|$|E

5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater is a <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

5|$|Taft is now better {{remembered for}} his books, such as The History of American Sculpture (1903), {{regarded}} as the first comprehensive work on the subject. However, in his day he was well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture, of which Fountain of Time is a <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b> It was produced in the period following his assignment to design sculptures for William Le Baron Jenney's 1893 Horticultural Building for the World's Columbian Exposition. During this period he designed several large-scale public works, including Fountain of the Great Lakes. Taft resided in Illinois {{for most of his}} life and worked in the Midway Studios starting in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become a <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began {{to change in the}} 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{courts of}} the emperor's palace {{were filled with}} his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist {{as well as a}} patron of the arts. A <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.|$|E
