40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{regional}} economic impacts of a prolonged period of recurrent droughts. The model used for analysis is TERM-H 2 O, a dynamic successor to the bottom-up, comparative static TERM (The Enormous Regional Model). We concentrate on the regions of the southern Murray-Darling basin. Large change simulations are a challenge for modellers. Drought brings substantial inward supply shifts for farm sectors. This paper outlines various theoretical modifications undertaken to improve the modelling of drought in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework and then applies them to the period from 2005 – 06 on. In particular, we apply a theory of sticky capital adjustment to downstream processing sectors, whereby processors temporarily retire capital in response to scarcer farm products, limiting upward price movements in farm outputs and resulting in more realistic modelling of drought. Results are explained using a back-of-the-envelope approach. This framework allows us to estimate the economic impacts of allowing water trade. In addition, the approach provides some estimate as to the impact of prolonged drought on structural change in <b>predominantly</b> <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> of south-eastern Australia.

In addition, they are also expected to promote a sustainable and balanced development of their land, also in areas where production conditions are difficult. Yet, despite the relevance of the sector, the use of land for agriculture purposes is not very sustainable. Among other issues, there is a serious problem in respect of the abandonment of agricultural land.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{the divorce}} rate in the Czech Republic after the year 1989. The first chapter {{is devoted to the}} definition of basic terms. Divorce is the legal dissolution of marriage during the life of spouses. Divorce is the dissolving of the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law. Divorce is a social phenomenon reflecting the family stability, there is a transformation of traditional behavioural patterns, moral criteria and economic incentives. Since 1989 till present {{the divorce rate}} in the Czech Republic is at a high level. The second chapter of the theoretical part evaluates the development and current situation of divorce rate in our country. It is divided into three subsections: Influencing factors of divorce, causes of divorce and divorce rates in Europe. The aim of this diploma thesis is the evaluation of the development of causes of the divorce in the Czech population, capturing the specifics of the development of divorce in the new socio - economic conditions after 1989. With regard to the objective of the diploma thesis I set three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Compared with other EU countries in the Czech Republic the divorce rate persists at a high level after 1989. Hypothesis 2 : The divorce rate varies by region in the Czech Republic. It is the highest in regions undergoing restructuring of the economy, with high unemployment rate and social problems. Hypothesis 3 : The divorce rate is high in big cities and on the contrary low in traditional, <b>predominantly,</b> <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> with a stable population. I conducted a quantitative research in the form of data analysis. The main source of the data was the Czech Statistical Office and Eurostat. I have analysed and compared the data which reveal the divorce rate in the Czech Republic and the EU in 2011 and the development of divorce from the year 1989. The data were analysed by correlation and spatial analysis and to compare the data I used the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results show that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic in comparison with other EU countries after 1989 remains at a high level. Crude divorce rate since 1989 is around 3. 0 divorces per 1000 inhabitants, which represents one of the highest divorce rates among EU countries. The divorce rate in the Czech Republic {{was one of the few}} demographic processes that were the least affected by the economic and social transformations after 1989. According to the results of the data analysis for the year 2011 I have verified, that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic is territorially differentiated, varies in different regions, cities and rural areas. High crude divorce rate is in districts undergoing restructuring of the economy and as a result there is a high rate of unemployment and social problems are emerging. The highest divorce rate in 2011 was in Česká Lípa. Conversely, the lowest crude divorce rate is the less populated districts, with a stable population and a high proportion of religious people. In 2011, the lowest crude divorce rate was in the district of Jihlava. Religion had the most statistically significant effect on the divorce rate. In districts with a higher proportion of religious people the crude divorce rate is lower than in districts with a lower proportion of religious people...|$|E

Among serranos, there is a division between the various indigenous groups and “mestizos” or people of mixed European-indigenous ethnicity. Mestizos are strongly segregated from the indigenous and found mostly in the urban municipal seats, especially Zacatlán, Chignahuapan, Tetela de Ocampo, Zacapoaxtla, Cuetzalan, Teziutlán, Zaragoza, Zihuateutla and Tlatlauquitepec, with the indigenous in the more rural areas. Indigenous language and traditions are considered inferior or “not modern” by the mestizos and many indigenous because of the poverty associated with indigenous life. Social and economic organizations are best developed among the Nahuas and the Totonacs to promote the communities’ interests. Most of these are Nahua and based in Cuetzalan. One of the first organizations of this kind was the Cooperativa Agropecuaria Regional Tosepan Titataniske (CARTT) in the 1970s, with the aim of improving the prospects of small agricultural producers.|$|R

In terms of natural terrain and climatic conditions Japan is a diverse country. There are also differences in the history, life styles and dietary habits {{of people living in}} different parts of Japan. This paper investigates the relationship between the consumption of beef and income, prices, and selected socio-economic factors in nine Japanese regions. The analysis found that consumption of beef at the regional level is influenced to differing degrees by income and by the prices of substitutes. In the heavily populated Kanto region, for example, containing the metropolises of Tokyo and Yokohama, the demand for beef was found to be not very responsive to changes in income, compared to the <b>predominantly</b> <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> of Hokkaido. This suggests that changes in income will have a relatively small impact on beef consumption in the Kanto region, compared to its effect on beef consumption in Hokkaido. A more general conclusion that can be drawn from the results is that programs designed to increase beef consumption in one part of Japan may need to be modified for {{other parts of the country}} if this same objective is to be achieved...|$|R

" As a participant in this program, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has developed a "breast cancer profile" for a seven-county, <b>predominantly</b> <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> of northwestern Pennsylvania. Community hospitals {{in the area are}} collaborating with the health department to develop interventions to enhance screening mammography. The availability of the profiles allowed hospitals to compare local breast cancer risk and screening activities with those of the State and nation, to target interventions, and to establish a baseline to measure changes over time. The data generated great interest among health professionals in northwestern Pennsylvania because, contrary to their expectations, the region was quite similar to the State and nation. While the proportion of women ages 40 and older who had ever had a mammogram was relatively high (66 percent), the proportion with more than one mammogram was considerably lower (43 percent), suggesting that hospitals focus on promoting regular mammography. Although it is feasible to develop data-based interventions for local areas, the effort is not trivial. State and national agencies must cooperate to ensure comparability of data collection and reports so that comparisons of local, State, and national data can be produced routinely...|$|R
