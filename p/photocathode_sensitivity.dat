40|$|The {{combination}} of two complementary technologies developed independently at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) has demonstrated feasibility of target detection and image capture in a highly light-scattering, medium. The technique uses a compact SNL developed Photoconductive Semiconductor Switch/Laser Diode Array (PCSS/LDA) for short-range (distances of 8 to 10 m) large Field-Of-View (FOV) target illumination. Generation of a time-correlated echo signal is accomplished using a photodiode. The return image signal is recorded with a high-speed shuttered Micro-Channel-Plate Image Intensifier (MCPII), declined by LANL and manufactured by Philips Photonics. The MCPII is rated using a high-frequency impedance-matching microstrip design to produce 150 to 200 ps duration optical exposures. The ultra first shuttering producer depth resolution of a few inches along the optic axis between the MCPII and the target, producing enhanced target images effectively deconvolved from noise components from the scattering medium in the FOV. The images from the MCPII are recorded with an RS- 170 Charge-Coupled-Device camera and a Big Sky, Beam Code, PC-based digitizer frame grabber and analysis package.

Other hole-multipliers with patterned electrodes (Micro-Hole and Strip Plates) and improved ion-blocking properties are discussed; these permit reducing considerably photon- and ion-induced secondary effects. Photon detectors with other electron-multiplier techniques are briefly described, among them GPMs based on Micromegas, capillary-plates, Thick-GEMs and resistive Thick GEMs. The two latter techniques, robust and economically produced, are particularly suited for large-area GPM applications, e. g. in RICH.
