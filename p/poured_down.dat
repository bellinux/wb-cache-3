5|$|During the La Course by Le Tour de France {{the rain}} <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> {{and made the}} course and cobbles slippery. Van Dijk was {{involved}} {{by one of the}} many crashes. She broke het collarbone and had to abandon the race. At home she had installed a high-altitiude tent, and with a speedy recovery she went with Iris Slappendel to Switzerland to train at high altitude. Six weeks after her crash she could race again and started in the 2015 Boels Rental Ladies Tour on 1 September. She rode in the stage race stronger every day and finished second in the time trial, two seconds behind of Lisa Brennauer. She moved to the third place in the general classification and was able to keep this position.|$|E
5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} is <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> the bore. This {{is followed}} by a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E

5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced the {{difficult}} task of fording the large moat standing between them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E

Near Catterick, North Yorkshire, a 17-year-old soldier on a training exercise from Catterick Garrison died after being swept away whilst crossing Risedale Beck, Hipswell Moor.

25|$|The {{run-up to}} the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> on Houston {{a couple of days}} before the concert, {{destroying}} much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments. Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to come crashing down.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{from the}} late Bronze Age, a {{peculiar}} type of circular structure with a central basin and benches located all around the circumference of the room start to appear in Nuragic settlements, {{the best example of}} this type of structure is the ritual fountain of Sa Sedda e Sos Carros, near Oliena, where thanks to a hydraulic implant of lead pipes water was <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> from the ram shaped protomes inside the basin. Some archaeologists interpreted these buildings, with ritual and religious function, as thermal structures.|$|E
25|$|For Alaungpaya, {{the worry}} was that French {{reinforcements}} would soon arrive. He {{decided that the}} time had come for the fortress to be stormed, now.

He called for volunteers and then selected 93, whom he named the Golden Company of Syriam, a name that would find pride of place in Burmese nationalist mythology. They included guards, officers, and royal descendants of Bayinnaung. The afternoon before, as the early monsoon rains <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> in torrents outside the makeshift huts, they ate together in their king's presence. Alaungpaya gave each a leather helmet and lacquer armor.|$|E

25|$|After Africa XI {{had been}} bowled {{out for a}} measly 106, rain <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> {{steadily}} on Kingsmead, and the umpires eventually declared that play was not possible. The rain had already caused {{the start of the}} game to be delayed for two hours, before Shoaib Akhtar and Zaheer Khan unleashed their fast bowling on the African side. When Tatenda Taibu departed for 10, the score was 51 for 7, and only good hitting and running from Shaun Pollock, who hit 44 not out, carried Africa past 100. Steve Tikolo, the top-scorer from the last match, was intriguingly dropped. Then, Dale Steyn and Shaun Pollock ripped out the two Asian openers Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi, and, with the score eight for 2, the weather intervened. No further play was possible, and thus the two continents shared the title.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the attack}} {{the storm had}} {{continued}} and the rain had <b>poured</b> <b>down,</b> {{so that it was}} no small comfort to the weary soldiers when Jean Francois pointed out to them the storehouse, where they all obtained dry clothes, and where a ration of bread and wine with lard and pork was served out to each of them. Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Menéndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonnière from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonnière had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured.|$|E
25|$|Where possible, {{the tunnel}} routes avoided granite and instead they were routed through looser shale rock formations; this speeded up {{construction}} and was less labour-intensive, {{but it could}} also be dangerous due to an increased risk of rockfalls. The tunnels were dug by the traditional method of drilling and blasting. When the tunnels were bored out, they were lined with concrete. First, the floor was lined, followed by the walls, and, finally, the roof. The walls were concreted using wooden shuttering, the space between the shuttering and the rock face was filled with concrete, and the shuttering subsequently removed. The roof was made in the same way, but using curved shuttering balancing on the concrete walls. Concrete was <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> the escape shafts rather than through the tunnel entrances to avoid contamination with the rock leaving the tunnel; these chutes can still be seen in many of the tunnels.|$|E

25|$|With the {{completion}} of the assault ramp, Vespasian ordered a battering ram brought up against the wall. Various stratagems were used by the defenders against the ram, including lowering sacks filled with chaff to receive its blows (until these were torn away by the Romans) and sallying forth and setting fire to the ram. Josephus also chronicles an incident in which one of the defenders, renowned for his strength, cast a huge stone on the ram from above, breaking off its head. Nevertheless, the attempts to batter down the wall continued. When Vespasian himself was wounded by a defender's dart, the Romans were so incensed that they continued their bombardment of the wall throughout the night. By morning a breach had been created and the Romans were ready to assault the walls. The besieged, however, charged through the breach, and when the Roman attempted to scale the walls, scalding oil was <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> upon them from above and they were beaten back.|$|E
25|$|Rain <b>poured</b> <b>down</b> on {{the area}} all night on March 29 and {{continued}} the following day, which limited the fighting on that day. Sheridan later stated that Grant thought about suspending operations altogether until the weather cleared and the ground dried but Sheridan convinced him to press ahead. On March 30, half of Sheridan's cavalry under Brigadier General Thomas Devin skirmished with Confederate cavalry under Fitzhugh Lee. As they approached Five Forks, a patrol of the 6th United States Cavalry Regiment under Major Robert M. Morris encountered Fitzhugh Lee's troopers and lost 3 officers and 20 men in the encounter. The Confederates also suffered some casualties, including Brigadier General William H. F. Payne who was wounded. Skirmishing with and reacting to feints from Union patrols from the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Charles L. Leiper delayed Pickett's force from reaching Five Forks until 4:30p.m. Rosser's and Rooney Lee's cavalry divisions arrived even later.|$|E
