5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> concerned.|$|E
5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that it was my father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E

5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{ethnicity}} of the Castellieri {{civilization is}} uncertain, {{although it was}} most likely of Pre-Indoeuropean stock, coming from the sea. The first castellieri were indeed built along the Istrian coasts and present the same Megalithic appearance characterizing in the Mycenaean civilization at the time. Hypotheses about an Illyrian origin of the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Adena {{crops are}} part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. They grew squash, {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus), sumpweed, goosefoot, knotweed, and maygrass. Gourds were grown for containers and rattles. What might be a small bird pen found at one Adena site suggests limited animal domestication, but Adena <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> known for animal husbandry.|$|E

25|$|In {{traditional}} flamenco, young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{considered to}} have the emotional maturity to adequately convey the duende (soul) of the genre. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional early {{to take advantage of}} youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> only {{capable of}} {{learning}} about the spatial layout of their surroundings, {{but they can also}} piece together novel routes and new spatial relations through inference. Yet, this field has traditionally been hampered by confounding variables, such as cost and the potential for previous exposure to an experimental environment. Thankfully, technological leaps have opened a new, albeit virtual, world to psychologists.|$|E
25|$|From two to {{four years}} of age {{children}} find themselves using symbols to represent physical models of the world around them. This is demonstrated through a child's drawing of their family in which <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> drawn to scale or accurate physical traits are given.

25|$|Adults with language-learning disabilities {{exhibit a}} much smaller McGurk effect than other adults. These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as {{influenced}} by visual input as most people. Therefore, people with poor language skills will produce a smaller McGurk effect. A reason for the smaller effect in this population is {{that there may be}} uncoupled activity between anterior and posterior regions of the brain, or left and right hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|Ir{{religious}} {{people in}} Iran have less rights then religious people, for example President of Iran by constitution must be religious. While Jews, Christians {{and other minorities}} {{have the right to}} take part in University entrance exams and can become members of parliament or city councils, irreligious <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> granted even their basic rights. Most irreligious people, however, hide their beliefs and pretend to be Muslims.|$|E
25|$|This {{has led the}} Guardians of the Cedars to {{maintain}} that Lebanese <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> Arabs. The political consequence of this stance advocates the 'de-Arabization' of Lebanon. Similarly, followers draw a distinction between Arabic and 'Lebanese', aiming to restore the form created by Lebanese philosopher Said Akl. The Guardians of the Cedars have adopted positions hostile to Pan-Arabism. This {{is believed to be}} the main reason why they did not grow as a party in Lebanon outside the Maronite community.|$|E

25|$|Justification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} where God pardons the sin of those who believe in Christ. It is historically held by Protestants {{to be the most important}} article of Christian faith, though more recently it is sometimes given less importance out of ecumenical concerns. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> on their own able even to fully repent of their sin or prepare themselves to repent because of their sinfulness. Therefore, justification is held to arise solely from God's free and gracious act.|$|E
25|$|But, {{while the}} disease's {{geographical}} range is broad, {{it is not}} continuous. The disease clusters around areas of drought, famine, and high population density. In Africa, this has meant a knot of infection centers mostly in Sudan, Kenya, and Somalia. Living conditions here have changed {{very little in the}} past century, and the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> normally very mobile. Parts of the Sudan, in particular the Upper Nile region, are almost totally cut {{off from the rest of}} the country, and most people tend to remain at their place of birth.|$|E
25|$|A month earlier, President of Defend International {{dedicated}} her 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award to the Yazidis, Christians and {{all residents}} of Kobane because, she said, {{facts on the}} ground demonstrate that these peaceful <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> safe in their enclaves, partly because of their ethnic origin and/or religion and they are therefore in urgent need for immediate attention from the global community.
