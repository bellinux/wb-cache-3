25|$|A {{problem in}} most {{scenarios}} of abiogenesis {{is that the}} thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is {{in the direction of}} separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of <b>polyphosphates.</b> <b>Polyphosphates</b> are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO4−3. Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. <b>Polyphosphates</b> cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.|$|E

In low-phosphate medium, <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulated whenever nucleic acid synthesis ceased due to a nutritional deficiency, regardless of its nature. In high-phosphate medium <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulation was induced only by sulfur starvation. <b>Polyphosphate</b> accumulation could thus be induced or suppressed at will by manipulation of the sulfur and phosphorus content of the medium. The specific requirement for sulfur starvation was traced to the presence of an intracellular inhibitor of <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulation. This was depleted during sulfur starvation and replenished when sulfate was restored. The inhibitor was identified as oxidized glutathione or a closely related compound. Suppression of <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulation required the simultaneous presence of a high exogenous phosphate concentration and a high intracellular glutathione level. Suppression of <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulation resulted in a constant <b>polyphosphate</b> level, due to a steady state of <b>polyphosphate</b> synthesis and degradation.

The synthetic and degradative phases of <b>polyphosphate</b> metabolism could be completely dissociated by inhibitors of energy generation.
