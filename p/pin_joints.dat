2500|$|A truss that {{is assumed}} to {{comprise}} members that are connected by means of <b>pin</b> <b>joints,</b> and which is supported at both ends by means of hinged joints or rollers, is described as being statically determinate. Newton's Laws apply to the structure as a whole, {{as well as to}} each node or joint. In order for any node that may be subject to an external load or force to remain static in space, the following conditions must hold: the sums of all (horizontal and vertical) [...] forces, as well as all moments acting about the node equal zero. Analysis of these conditions at each node yields the magnitude of the compression or tension forces.|$|E
2500|$|Tower 4 {{was plagued}} with {{structural}} problems from the start. It stood in much deeper water {{than the other}} two (185 feet, compared to 80 feet for Tower 2), and it was held that the simple cylindrical leg design would not be sturdy enough given the length of the legs. Therefore, three sets of cross braces were added between the legs, attached with <b>pin</b> <b>joints.</b> These made it impossible to tow the platform on the level; instead, the structure was laid on its side for transport and then tipped upright at the site. These braces proved to be frail and the joints prone to loosening: two braces broke loose during transport, and a third was lost when the tower was being placed on the bottom. Divers were brought in several times to inspect the structure and to perform repairs, and an additional set of crossbraces was installed immediately below the platform, above the waterline, in 1960.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{finite element model}} (FEM) to analyse the structural deformation, strength properties and delamination fracture behaviour of composite T-joints reinforced with z-pins. The FE modelling involves multi-level analysis of a <b>pinned</b> <b>joint</b> using unit cell and macro-scale structural models. Unit cell model {{is used to calculate}} the crack bridging traction loads generated by the elastic and interfacial friction (pull-out) stresses of a single pin within a representative unit cell of the joint. Macro-scale analysis involves modelling delamination crack growth in the <b>pinned</b> <b>joint</b> using a cohesive zone model, which is based on the traction load analysis of a single pin. The FE model was validated using experimental results for a pinned carbon fibre/epoxy T-joint subjected to tensile (stiffener pull-off) loading.

40|$|There are an innumerable {{number of}} {{precision}} automotive assemblies which use <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> for alignment. Many of these suffer from poor performance and cost/quality issues because <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> are inherently over-constrained. This paper introduces the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC) {{as a solution}} for precision (better than 10 microns) automotive assemblies. For these applications, QKCs require fewer parts, have a lower total cost, and provide sub-micron repeatability. This paper covers design and manufacturing considerations for automotive QKCs. Proof of concept is demonstrated via a case study on the block-main bearing assembly of a Ford six cylinder engine. Repeatability tests yield average QKC bearing center line repeatability of 0. 65 microns at the outer journal bearings as compared to 4. 85 microns for <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> This QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, costs 36 % less, and allows feature size and placement tolerance ranges which are twice as wide {{as those of the}} previous <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> NOMENCLATURE Gmax Maximum gap between block and bedplate Gmin Minimum gap between block and bedplate Ka Stiffness in axial direction Kc Stiffness perpendicular to bearing center line Ra Repeatability in axial direction Rc Repeatability perpendicular to bearing center line δa Alignment error in axial direction δc Alignment error perpendicular to bearing center line δGMS Gap margin of safety δv Controllable gap variatio...|$|R

40|$|Layer-based rapid {{fabrication}} {{technologies have}} two distinct advantages: (1) build parts without geometry restriction; (2) build sub-systems (static or mobile) {{without the need}} for assembly. Many previous papers have reported various applications that could benefit from the first advantage. Yet, very limited researches have investigated the applications that can benefit from the second advantage. One of the major reasons is the limited accuracy of current layer-based fabrication technologies that can only make mechanism joint with large clearance. This limitation has prohibited the fabrication of sensible joints in mobile sub-systems such as mechanisms, because large clearance at joints is the major source for excessive impact force, resulting in wear and tear of the joints, and consequently the malfunction/degradation of a mechanism's performance. Thus, how to reduce the joint clearance is a major research issue for layer-based rapid fabrication of non-assembly mechanisms. In this paper, different <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> designs are analysed. It was found that drum shaped <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> design gives the minimum joint clearance in layer-based fabrication, and at the same time, without weakening the joint strength compared to the traditional cylindrical <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> design. A number of sample joints and mechanisms have been made by a layer-based fabrication machine Objet Eden 350 V to test the effectiveness of the proposed drum shaped joint design. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|A truss {{arch bridge}} {{combines}} {{the elements of}} the truss bridge and the arch bridge. The actual resolution of forces will depend upon the design. If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss, essentially a bent beam - see moon bridge for an example. If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a <b>pin</b> <b>joint,</b> this is termed a three-hinged arch - see The Iron Bridge for an example. If no hinge exists at the apex, it will normally be a two-hinged arch.In the Iron Bridge shown below, the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood. Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together, so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another, as they are in a pin-jointed truss structure that allows rotation at the <b>pin</b> <b>joint.</b> Such rigid structures (which impose bending stresses upon the elements) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss.|$|R

50|$|The {{track laying}} began on 2 September 2009 along a wide, grassy forest track.

Thus, it fitted together {{very much like a}} toy railway, using preassembled track sections which are either straight or of fixed curvature. The track laying operation looked a bit like a child’s train set on a large scale. The rails, with sleepers ready attached, came in sections - straight or curved to suit their position.

5000|$|Chain-stretch {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the cause of the gear's inefficiencies, but another cause may have been geometrical due to the sequential proportions of levers, especially the multiplying rockers that transmitted the limited movement of the [...] "miniaturised" [...] valve gear to the union link driving the long travel piston valve. These rockers alone would have made accurate valve timing difficult to achieve, giving rise to stress in the drive mechanism, a symptom of which would be an increase in the likelihood of chain-stretch. The maximum throw of the expansion links was 2.25 in. To provide the maximum valve travel of 6 in the rocker arms multiplied the motion of the auxiliary crankshaft in the ratio 8:3. The effects of wear in the <b>pin</b> <b>joints,</b> also multiplied by the same ratio, caused valve openings to vary between cylinders even if the driver maintained the same cut-off.|$|E

The New York Central Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also had large classes which used Baker gear. There was always debate about the advantages of Baker gear, the main criticism being the number of <b>pin</b> <b>joints</b> and possible lost motion. Western United States and British railroads tended to continue with the Walschaerts pattern, as did the Pennsylvania Railroad. In Britain Baker gear was popular amongst model engineers but in full-size practice the length of the yoke and the width of the assembly may have been difficult to accommodate within the restricted loading gauge.|$|E
