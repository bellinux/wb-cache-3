40|$|Presented at {{the annual}} Association of Institutional Research (AIR) forum, Toronto, Canada, May 25, 2011. This study {{compared}} the outcomes for less <b>prepared</b> and well <b>prepared</b> first year college students enrolled in learning communities at the University of Minnesota. Less <b>prepared</b> students were retained at the same rate, though their first year grades were significantly lower. In a second study the less <b>prepared</b> students were compared to an earlier cohort of matched pairs. The matched pairs had similar rates of retention and similar grades. A third study compared the responses of less <b>prepared</b> and well <b>prepared</b> students to items on the SERU survey. Less <b>prepared</b> students reported more gains in items related to the learning outcome communicating effectively. Less <b>prepared</b> and more <b>prepared</b> students reported similar gains on the outcome appreciating diversity. Less <b>prepared</b> students were as satisfied as well <b>prepared</b> students with their {{sense of belonging to}} the institution and were as likely to say they would choose to attend the same institution again, but they were less satisfied with their grades, social experience and academic experience...|$|R
