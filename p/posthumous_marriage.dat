The surviving spouse is also subject to impediments of marriage that result.|$|E

50|$|Oval-Teen was an indie pop {{band from}} the town of Yorkville, Illinois. Started in 1994 as a songwriting outlet for Bradley Davis, Chad Lynd and Joseph Chellino. Influenced by the sounds of punk and Teenage Fanclub their early three-chord pop {{expanded}} as their playing and songwriting improved and expanded to include new wave and Bubblegum. The band began releasing cassettes and EPs on their own Debris label, and attracted the attention of other self-run small labels around the country and Japan who also released some of their recordings. In 1999, the band recorded their only full-length album, A Million Shades of Oval-teen, for MOC Records but financial problems at the label delayed its release until 2001. The group broke up in 1999 when Bradley Davis relocated to Toronto following his <b>marriage.</b> <b>Posthumous</b> recordings surfaced slowly on Toronto's My Mean Magpie label and a double CD collection of stray tracks was released on Bi-Fi Records in 2004. Brad continues to release records as Lake Holiday (band), Joseph denies any responsibility for records under the names Jonas Crenshaw and Power Craig, Jeremiah keeps busy as a member of Paper Airplane Pilots and generally being tall. Chad lives with his dogs and releases albums with The Bloody Knife Killers, The Tiger Springs and The Sky Lovelies.|$|R

50|$|During World War I, a {{few women}} were married by use of proxy to {{soldiers}} that had died weeks earlier. This practice {{came to be called}} <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b> <b>Posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> for civilians originated in the 1950s, when a dam broke and killed 400 people in Fréjus, France, including a man named André Capra, who was engaged to Iréne Jodart. Jodart pleaded with French President Charles de Gaulle to let her go along with her marriage plans even though her fiancé had died. She had support from the media and within months was allowed to marry her fiancé. It is likely that <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> was made as an extension to France's proxy marriage.|$|E
50|$|Anyone in France {{who wants}} to file for <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> sends a request to the President of France, who {{forwards}} it to the Justice Minister, who forwards it to the prosecutor for the surviving member’s district. If the couple had originally planned on getting married and {{the family of the}} deceased approves, the prosecutor sends the application back to the President. One out of every four applicants for <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> is rejected.|$|E
50|$|The {{marriage}} applies retroactively to the {{day before}} the deceased spouse died. Even if they were engaged and had published banns, a <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> will not necessarily happen, partly because living engaged couples can change their minds at the last minute. A <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> can also be thwarted by the testimony of a trustworthy individual. The judge’s role {{is to make sure that}} the paperwork has been properly filled out. The judge cannot question the authority of the documents.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary reason}} for the <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> in France is to legitimize {{children}} that a woman might have. It is also done for emotional reasons.|$|E
50|$|Article 171 of the Civil Code {{requires}} that application refers to serious reasons for <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b> The President of the Republic carefully considers {{the seriousness of}} the circumstances of the death.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{months after}} the Fréjus dam tragedy, France’s {{parliament}} drafted a law permitting <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b> Since then, hundreds of women have formally filed for {{what is known as}} postmortem matrimony. <b>Posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> became legal in France by Article 172 of the civil code which states: [...] "The President of the Republic may, for serious reasons, authorize the solemnization of marriage if one of the spouses died after completion of official formalities marking it unequivocal consent. In this case, the effects of marriage dated back to the day preceding the death of the husband. However, this marriage does not entail any right of intestate succession {{for the benefit of the}} surviving spouse and no matrimonial property is deemed to have existed between the spouses." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Posthumous</b> <b>{{marriage}}</b> (or necrogamy) is {{a marriage}} {{in which one}} of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.|$|E

50|$|In Okinawa, {{which has}} been under the {{influences}} of China for centuries, {{there has been a}} custom of <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b> The reason is to correct the rules of the placing of spirit tablets. There are strict rules of placing spirit tablets, and if the rules are broken, the spirit tablet under question is moved to a proper place with ceremonies at the order of a spiritualist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> {{also shows}} the {{strength}} of an individual to overcome a fiancé’s death. Article 171 specifically states that the usual financial aspects of a marriage, such as liquidation of matrimonial regime or the granting of intestate inheritance (meaning the laws governing inheritances of people whose spouses die without a will) do not apply. The widow can, however, receive a pension and can be entitled to insurance benefits.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 a posthumous wedding {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} Batavia, Illinois, for Annie Hopkins, who had died of spinal muscular atrophy. Annie Hopkins had said that she wanted a wedding celebration instead of a funeral. The wedding celebration was {{open to the public}} and was a fundraiser for the Annie Hopkins Foundation Scholarship Fund, named after her. [...] Since there was no apparent groom in this marriage, it is better classified as a wedding-themed funeral than a <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In December 1983, Heung Jin Moon, {{the second}} son of Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han (who were {{leaders of the}} Unification Church), was in an {{automobile}} accident in New York and died on January 2. Moon’s death came before his planned arranged marriage to ballerina Julia Pak, daughter of Moon’s interpreter, Bo Hi Pak. According to Unificationism, only married couples are allowed to enter the highest level of heaven. Moon’s parents conducted a <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> ceremony on February 20, 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that, {{with the}} {{appropriate}} authority, marriages can be performed for [...] "time and all eternity," [...] rather than just [...] "until death do us part." [...] They believe that Jesus gave this authority to the Apostle Peter; in Mathew 16:19, Jesus tells Peter, [...] "And I will give thee the keys {{of the kingdom of}} heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." [...] Consequently, the practice of marriage for eternity is referred to as a sealing or an eternal marriage. Sealings can be performed posthumously, {{as well as for the}} living. Posthumous sealings can be performed to eternally wed a living person and a deceased spouse (with a live church member standing as a proxy for the deceased), or, more commonly, between two deceased persons (with a living man and woman standing in as proxies). In either case, the couple must have been married while alive. Thus, this practice is perhaps better described as a posthumous sealing rather than a <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 709, Xiao {{was made}} Shizhong (侍中), {{the head of}} the {{examination}} bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor and was also responsible for editing the imperial history. Later in the year, he was made Zhongshu Ling (中書令), {{the head of the}} legislative bureau (中書省), still a chancellor. At that time, Zong and Ji were organizing a faction in supporting Empress Wei, and other chancellors Wei Juyuan, Yang Zaisi, and Li Jiao went along with what this powerful faction wanted to do. Xiao alone did not do so and was much praised in popular opinion for this, and Emperor Zhongzong once commented, [...] "Among the chancellors, Zhizhong cares about me the most." [...] Nevertheless, Xiao gave his deceased daughter in a <b>posthumous</b> <b>marriage</b> to Empress Wei's deceased brother Wei Xun (韋洵), and also married a daughter to a son of Empress Wei's uncle Cui Congli (崔從禮). On the day of the wedding, Emperor Zhongzong presided on the Xiao side, and Empress Wei presided on the Cui side, leading to a popular comment, [...] "The Son of Heaven is giving away a daughter, and the Empress is taking in a daughter-in-law." [...] Sometime during Emperor Zhongzong's reign, Xiao was also created the Duke of Zan.|$|E
