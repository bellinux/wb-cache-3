2500|$|Applying {{this test}} to the plaintiff's complaint, the Court held that Iqbal’s {{pleadings}} did {{not comply with}} Rule 8 under Twombly. The Court found that several of his allegations - that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh conditions {{as a matter of}} policy, solely on account of discriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest, that Ashcroft was that policy's [...] "principal architect", and that Mueller was [...] "instrumental" [...] in its adoption and execution - were conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. The Court decided that given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it was not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy's purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. Even if the complaint's well-pleaded facts gave rise to a <b>plausible</b> <b>inference</b> that Iqbal’s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone did not entitle him to relief since his claims rested solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees categorized as “of high interest,” but the complaint does not contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory factors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} experiments investigating the use of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of evidence in combining the evidences provided by <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> in Information Retrieval. PLIR is an experimental information retrieval system based on the theory of plausible reasoning[1] which tries to simulate a reference librarians reasoning while trying to retrieve documents in response to queries. Often a document can be retrieved by several <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences.</b> Each inference constitutes of an uncertain evidence of relevance. In these experiments, DS theory is used in several ways to combine these evidences in PLIR system. The application of DS theory and weighting inferences based on their overall usefulness in retrieval has improved the quality of ranking of PLIR system. We use this conclusion in our future research {{in the application of}} <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> and DS theory in adaptive information filtering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—XML is a markup {{language}} which {{is becoming the}} standard format for information representation and data exchange. A major purpose of XML is the explicit representation of the logical structure of a document. Much research has been performed to exploit logical structure of documents in information retrieval in order to precisely extract user information need from large collections of XML documents. In this paper, we describe an XML information retrieval weighting scheme that tries {{to find the most}} relevant elements in XML documents in response to a user query. We present this weighting model for information retrieval systems that utilize <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> to infer the relevance of elements in XML documents. We also add to this model the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to express the uncertainty in <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> and Dempster-Shafer rule of combination to combine evidences derived from different <b>inferences.</b> Keywords—Dempster-Shafer theory, <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences,</b> XM...|$|R
40|$|The p-model is a metatheoretical {{approach}} to linguistic theorising {{that has been}} designed to capture the nature of linguistic data and evidence in an unorthodox and novel, but well-motivated and effective way. Its starting point is the insight that the latest literature on linguistic data and evidence acknowledged the uncertainty of the latter as their key feature. Since the main characteristic of <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> is that they facilitate drawing conclusions from uncertain premises, and since chains of <b>plausible</b> <b>inferences</b> constitute {{the main body of the}} process of plausible argumentation, the basic idea of the p-model is that the structure of linguistic theories is based on various techniques of plausible argumentation. This chapter summarises the main hypotheses of the p-model, which the case studies in the volume are expected to apply to various linguistic theories...|$|R
60|$|It {{was known}} that the {{continent}} of Asia was bounded on the east by a vast ocean, and that a similar body of water bounded Europe on the west, leaving the <b>plausible</b> <b>inference,</b> on the supposition that the earth was a sphere, that nothing but islands existed between these two great boundaries of land. Less {{than half of the}} real circumference of the globe is to be found between the western and eastern verges of the old continent, as they were then known; but it was too bold an effort of the mind, to conceive that startling fact, in the condition of human knowledge {{at the close of the}} fifteenth century. The theories were consequently content with drawing the limits of the east and the west into a much narrower circle, finding no data for any freer speculation; and believing it a sufficient act of boldness to maintain the spherical formation of the earth at all. It is true, that the latter theory was as old as Ptolemy, and quite probably much older; but even the antiquity of a system begins to be an argument against it, in the minds of the vulgar, when centuries elapse, and it receives no confirmation from actual experiment. Columbus supposed his island of Cipango, or Japan, to lie about one hundred and forty degrees of longitude east of its actual position; and, as a degree of longitude in the latitude of Japan, or 35° north, supposing the surface of the earth to be perfectly spherical, is about fifty-six statute miles, it follows that Columbus had advanced this island, on his chart, more than seven thousand English miles toward the eastward, or a distance materially exceeding two thousand marine leagues.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to reveal the {{inferential}} structure, the functions and the felicity conditions of indirect reports from a novel perspective by {{the application of a}} model of plausible argumentation (Kertész and Rákosi 2012).
