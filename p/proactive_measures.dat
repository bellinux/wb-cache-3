25|$|Korea {{dealt with}} a pair of Japanese invasions from 1592 to 1598 (Imjin War or the Seven Years' War). Prior to the war, Korea sent two ambassadors to scout for signs of Japan's {{intentions}} of invading Korea. However, they came back with two different reports, and while the politicians split into sides, few <b>proactive</b> <b>measures</b> were taken.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite these}} <b>proactive</b> <b>measures,</b> {{adhesion}} formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, adhesion barrier {{can be put}} during surgery {{to minimize the risk}} of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice though as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} payback from {{efforts of the}} International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to {{coordinate}} <b>proactive</b> counterterrorism <b>measures</b> by its member countries to arrest terrorists and weaken their ability to conduct operations. We use Interpol arrest data and data on utilization of Interpol resources by member countries to compute counterfactual benefit measurements, which, when matched with costs, yield benefit-cost ratios. The average of these ratios is approximately 200 over 12 alternative counterfactual scenarios, so each dollar of Interpol counterterrorism spending returns approximately $ 200. This paper also puts forward a perspective on benefits derived from Interpol’s Stolen and Lost Travel Document database. Interpol provides an inexpensive <b>proactive</b> <b>measure</b> against transnational terrorism that, unlike military operations, does not result in backlash attacks. ...|$|R

25|$|Dorothy Robinson {{reviewed}} {{data from}} jurisdictions where helmet use increased following legislation, {{and concluded that}} helmet laws did not demonstrably reduce cyclists' head injuries. Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, {{does not support the}} use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value {{in the event of a}} collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other expert opinion in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether it is worthwhile to buy lottery tickets by sampling only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding <b>proactive</b> <b>measures</b> including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.|$|E

40|$|High speed {{wireless}} communication {{technologies such as}} Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have revolutionized the way of our day-to-day communication and opened opportunities for many innovative applications. The 802. 6 m version of WiMAX offers data rates up to 1 Gbps for fixed communications and supports mobility up to 350 km/h. While WiMAX technology 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to deliver high data rates in a fixed environment is beyond any doubt, the standard is not fully optimized yet for mobile communication at high vehicular speeds. At high vehicular speeds, rapid changes in surrounding environments, cause severe fading at the receiver, resulting a drastic fall in throughput and unless any <b>proactive</b> <b>measure</b> is taken to combat this problem, throughput becomes insufficient to support many applications, particularly those with multimedia contents. Bit Error Rate (BER) estimation {{is an integral part}} of any <b>proactive</b> <b>measure</b> and recent studies suggest that Nakagami-m model performs better for modeling channel fading in {{wireless communication}}s at high vehicular speeds. No work has been reported in literature that estimates BER at high vehicular speeds in WiMAX communication using Nakagami-m model. In this paper, we develop and present an analytical model to estimate BER in WiMAX at vehicular speeds using Nakagami-m fading model. The proposed model is adaptive and can be used with resource management schemes designed for fixed, nomadic, and mobile WiMAX communications...|$|R

Later, the parks department and Ann (Rashida Jones) visit neighboring Indiana town Eagleton to help build a playground in a single day, as part of an event by the charity KaBOOM! There, Leslie and Ann find Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), who claims to be volunteering, but in reality, is coming for the free food. He tells Leslie and Ann that he now has a home with the drummer of his band. Leslie is inspired by the energy of the group and its leader Keef (Paul Scheer), which prompts her to take <b>proactive</b> <b>measures</b> in filling in the pit in Pawnee and turning it into a park. While discussing the matter with her parks department, Mark (Paul Schneider) takes her aside and suggests she simply fill it in without permission.

30|$|Another sociolinguistic {{reality that}} the 1974 - 2002 policy could not address {{adequately}} is the complex sociolinguistic phenomenon (typically among urban populations) of Ghanaian children growing up in Ghana with English rather than an indigenous Ghanaian language as L 1. Usually, such children are products of cross-ethnic marriages where couples do not speak each other’s L 1, especially among educated Ghanaians (Ansah and Mensa, [2005]). It is important to emphasize, however, that this phenomenon is not widespread: possibly even non-existent in rural Ghana. To such people, the 2002 language- in- education policy was a <b>proactive</b> <b>measure</b> {{by the government to}} solve the problems inherent in the previous policy.|$|R

In current perioperative practice, patient core temperature is monitored and active warming interventions are implemented during the intraoperative and postoperative phases in response to UPH. The literature suggests preoperative warming of patients as a <b>proactive</b> <b>measure</b> {{may be more effective}} in the prevention of UPH. In the form of an integrative review, this thesis seeks to address the research question: For adult patients undergoing general anesthesia, how does preoperative warming compared to no preoperative warming affect UPH incidence?

The conclusion is drawn there is sufficient evidence to support preoperative warming as an effective measure to decrease UPH incidence and should be considered for implementation in clinical practice as the benefits outweigh the risks...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of failure log {{analysis}} shows that spatial and temporal patterns exist among events contained within the system logs of nodes that comprise large-scale systems. Existing works in this field use clustering mechanisms on log events to represent these patterns and recommend proactive methods to prevent failures in the immediate future. Recent works use discrete-time Semi Markov Models to closely model such events and calculate node reliability. In this research, we use a Hidden Semi Markov Model to predict subsystem failure events leading to a degraded or failure state of a node. As a <b>proactive</b> <b>measure,</b> this method can allow a job scheduler to intelligently assign time and resource consuming jobs to appropriate nodes based on this assessment of reliability of nodes. It will also enable system administrators to be informed of specific subsystem events that are likely to occur in the future. ...|$|R
