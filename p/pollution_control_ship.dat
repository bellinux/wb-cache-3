40|$|Pollution from {{shipping}} is a {{major issue}} in the Straits of Malacca (SOM). Unless appropriate measures are taken, pollution may increase as traffic through the SOM grows. This paper examines alternative mechanisms to finance straits-wide, transboundary measures to prevent or <b>control</b> <b>pollution</b> from <b>shipping</b> in the SOM. Cooperative programs and various user charges for cost of services are examined, and issues and options for financing these services presented. The implications of financing alternatives are assessed in general terms using the criteria of economic efficiency, fairness, transaction costs, impact on behaviour, and political feasibility.

Other advanced automotive applications, while not {{the primary focus of}} current development efforts, are also possible. These include load leveling high-energy batteries, power conditioning electronics, electrically hated catalysts, electric power steering, and engine starter power. Higher power and longer cycle life are expected for electrochemical capacitors than for batteries. Evaluation of environmental, health, and safety (EH and S) issues of electrochemical capacitors {{is an essential part of}} the development and commercialization of electrochemical capacitors for advanced vehicles. This report provides an initial EH and S assessment. This report presents electrochemical capacitor electrochemistry, materials selection, intrinsic material hazards, mitigation of those hazards, environmental requirements, <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> options, and <b>shipping</b> requirements. Most of the information available for this assessment pertains to commercial devices intended for application outside the advanced vehicle market and to experiment or prototype devices. Electrochemical capacitors for power assists in HEVs are not produced commercially now. Therefore, materials for advanced vehicle electrochemical capacitors may change, and so would the corresponding EH and S issues. Although changes are possible, this report describes issues for likely electrochemical capacitor designs...|$|R

40|$|Most {{economic}} studies of pollution externalities {{focus on the}} relative efficiency or cost-effectiveness of alternative <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> instruments. Much less {{attention has been paid}} to policy goals and objectives. However, a comprehensive <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> strategy depends on all of these choices. This paper examines several efficiency properties of cost-effective <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> strategies in a stochastic setting when economic damages from pollution are unknown. A number of policy goals are considered.

(B) There is heterogeneity in the marginal pollutant concentration reduction cost among various districts {{as a result of the}} cities' varying contribution of unit emission reduction to the pollutant concentration reduction, and their diverse unit cost of emission reduction brought about by their different industry composition.

25|$|<b>Pollution</b> <b>control</b> is a {{term used}} in {{environmental}} management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without <b>pollution</b> <b>control,</b> the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of <b>controls,</b> <b>pollution</b> prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than <b>pollution</b> <b>control.</b> In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique {{for the prevention of}} urban runoff.|$|R

40|$|Incineration is a {{powerful}} waste management tool which is employed in many countries. However, air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues are a by-product produced {{as a result of}} flue gas treatment, a key requirement for incineration. Air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues are classified as hazardous waste and are becoming increasingly difficult to dispose of in the UK due to tightening legislation. Therefore recycling of air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues as secondary building materials is an attractive option. Geopolymerisation offers advantages with regards to stabilizing heavy metals and has been investigated here as a means to reducing leaching rates of key elements in air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues collected from three UK based incinerators. The role of soluble chloride phases was also investigated by pre-treating the air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues with a washing procedure. Geopolymerisation was found to immobilize metals such as Ba, Pb and Ni, however it did not positively affect the mobility of As, Sb and Se. Chloride leaching rates were also reduced although not to an acceptable level and the mobility of soluble chloride phases are one of the key challenges when attempting to reuse air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> residues...|$|R
