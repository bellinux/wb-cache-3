40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the way investor <b>protections</b> <b>in</b> international trade agreements {{may affect the}} division of power over environmental and land use regulation among federal, state, and local governments in the United States.

Professor Been predicts that domestic property owners will use investor <b>protections</b> <b>in</b> international trade agreements to argue for more expansive takings protections under the Fifth Amendment. Professor Been concludes with a call for policy-makers to consider more carefully the effects investor <b>protections</b> <b>in</b> free trade agreements may have on the division of responsibility for environmental and land use regulation among federal, state, and local governments...|$|R
