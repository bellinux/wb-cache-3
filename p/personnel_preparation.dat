40|$|The {{centerpiece}} of my vision for <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> {{is a well}} paid, well-educated early childhood intervention workforce situated in "learning communities" whereby parents, practitioners, administrators, consultants, and university and community college faculty are mutually accountable for creating quality early environ-ments for children. <b>Personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> is an ongoing {{part of the fabric}} of daily work. The driving force behind the content and specific <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> activi-ties is the basic question, "What do we need to know and do to improve the outcomes for all young children? " I suggest that currently we do not have the resources or the policies in place to support such a vision. I further suggest that grassroots public sup-port for early childhood intervention could be achieved through the kind of "learning communities " envisioned in the opening vignette of this article. I suggest that there are three areas where changes are critical in order to create "learning communities": (1) in-creasing collaboration among multiple partners at multiple levels; (2) attending to di-versity issues; and (3) promoting family involvement in <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation.</b> Without a shared vision and commitment to early childhood intervention at the communit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To date, {{research}} has not sufficiently addressed {{the impact of}} <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> programs on secondary special educators in relationship to specialized competencies needed to impact students during transition from school to adult life. This study sought to evaluate transition competencies gained by secondary practitioners involved in a transition teacher education program. We were particularly interested in examining whether graduates of our programs reported increased levels of competence {{upon completion of the}} program. Responses were compared to a pre-assessment measure to determine significant levels of change. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, findings were overwhelmingly positive. Over time, our evaluation methods have expanded in terms of sophistication. Finally, this article addresses strategies for evaluating <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation.</b> The issues and challenges of providingcoordinated transition services are com-plex and pressing; therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} secondary special education teachers might feel unprepared to provide effective services. Such a lack of preparation could be due in part to the limited number of courses devoted to transition offered within teacher educatio...|$|E

40|$|One {{strategy}} {{that is increasingly}} being used for helping early interven-tion professionals become more family centered is to involve family members in <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> efforts. The {{purpose of this article}} is twofold: (a) to describe the types of and rationale for some of the roles family members have begun to play in <b>personnel</b> <b>preparation</b> efforts and (b) to offer guidelines and strategies for facilitating family participation in ways that model collaborative family-professional partnerships. The strategies provided have application across a variety of personnel prepa-ration contexts (e. g., inservice, preservice, policymaking). Dramatic changes in the nature of the parent-professional rela-tionship are being recommended as the field of early intervention moves from a child-centered to a family-centered model of service delivery. Central to the changes is the shift in power differentials. In the past, professionals tended to operate primarily in an expert role, defining the nature and type of services for children, with fam-ilies assuming a subordinate role (Shelton & Stepanek, 1994; Winton, 1986). Current recommendations related to effective mod-els of service delivery suggest that professionals must relinquish some of their power and move toward a family empowerment an...|$|E
