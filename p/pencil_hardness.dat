5000|$|The lead of {{the pencil}} {{is a mix of}} finely ground {{graphite}} and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended <b>pencil</b> <b>hardness</b> (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and {{the amount of time spent}} on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a [...] "slat," [...] and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{oxidative}} polymerization of cardol derived from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), {{which is a}} cheap, useful, and renewable substance, {{has been carried out}} using a fungal peroxidase from Coprinus cinereus (CiP). Cardol, one of the major components of CNSL, is a resorcinol derivative mainly having a C 15 unsaturated hydrocarbon chain with 1 - 3 double bonds at a meta position. To date cardol has not been completely exploited as a monomer for enzymatic polymerization. Enzymatic polymerization of cardol proceeded with higher yield in an equivolume mixture of tert-butanol and phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0). The yield and molecular weight of polycardol depended on the hydrogen peroxide concentration. Polycardol was rapidly cured at room temperature within 4 h to give harden dry and dark brown color coatings. <b>Pencil</b> scratch <b>hardness</b> data indicated that the curing rate of polycardol was superior to those of polycardanol.

Lipase catalysis {{was used for}} the epoxidation of the unsaturated alkyl chains of both cardanol and polycardanol.

One route was the synthesis of epoxide-containing cardanol from cardanol, hydrogen peroxide and an organic acid in the presence of lipase, followed by the polymerization of the phenolic functional groups of cardanol using peroxidase. In the other route, polymerized cardanol was prepared from cardanol and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase and, subsequently, the epoxide-containing polycardanol was synthesized from polycardanol, hydrogen peroxide and an organic acid in the presence of lipase.

The flexibility of the resin was tuned by using different modifiers, namely hexanediol-diglycidylether (HDGE) and a diglycidoxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane (GTMQ).

The UV-cured films showed silica rich surfaces, the morphology of which was related to the presence of GPTS and of the reactive comonomers and to the experimental conditions adopted for the sol-gel process. The TMOS absorption and hence the subsequent hydrolysis-condensation processes seem to occur at the surfaces of the films probably due to the selective migration of the silicone chains towards the air interface.

Various physicochemical properties of the resins such as acid value, iodine value, yield, density, specific gravity, molecular weight, non-volatile material content, drying time, colour, solubility, etc., were tested by using standard methods. The resins were cured by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), styrene and cobalt naphthenate at 120 °C.

To overcome this limitation, palm oil was modified through transesterification process to produce polyol. Acrylated isocyanate (urethane oligomer) was then grafted onto polyol to produce polyurethane with vinylic ends. The polyurethane was formulated with different cross-linkers (reactive diluents) and cured under UV radiation. The effect of three different diluents; monoacrylate, diacrylate and triacrylate on the properties of cured polymer were studied in this research. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Hydroxyl Value Titration, Gel Content, and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) were used for characterization. Physical testing performed were <b>Pencil</b> <b>Hardness</b> and Pull-Off Adhesion test. Novel palm oil-based polyurethane coatings have been found to have good properties with mono acrylate functionality...|$|E
