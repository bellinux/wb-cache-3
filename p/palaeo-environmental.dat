It aimed to explain the cultural relations of this territory with its regional entourage as well as the interaction between Man and environment in the southern part of the plain from the Neolithic to the Middle Bronze II. The research was structured around three major research axis. The first dealt with the analysis of the ceramic material surveyed in the southern part of the plain in 1997 and 1999 in order to learn the technological, cultural and chronological aspects of this material. Through the parallels, it also aimed to sketch a model of the cultural contacts throughout the region. The second focused on the <b>palaeo-environmental</b> data in order to understand the paleoclimate of the region in general, and the plain in particular with its geomorphology during the mentioned periods. The third axis, based on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), focused on the archaeology of the landscape taking into account the spatial dimension of the plain to better understand the interactions between the sites and their territory.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{potential}} of <b>palaeo-environmental</b> information to strengthen natural resource policy, science and practical outcomes naturally occurring archives of <b>palaeo-environmental</b> and ecosystem service information have not been fully recognised or utilised to inform the development of environmental policy. In this paper, we describe how Australian <b>palaeo-environmental</b> science is improving environmental understanding through local studies and regional syntheses that inform us about past conditions, extreme conditions and altered ecosystem states. Australian innovations in ecosystem services research and <b>palaeo-environmental</b> science contribute in five important contexts: discussions about environmental understanding and management objectives, improving access to information, improved knowledge about the dynamics of ecosystem services, increasing understanding of environmental processes and resource availability, and engaging interdisciplinary approaches to manage ecosystem services. Knowledge {{of the past is}} an important starting point for setting present and future resource management objectives, anticipating consequences of trade-offs, sharing risk and evaluating and monitoring the ongoing availability of ecosystem services. <b>Palaeo-environmental</b> information helps reframe discussions about desirable futures and collaborative efforts between scientists, planners, managers and communities. However, further steps are needed to translate the ecosystem services concept into ecosystem services policy and tangible management objectives and actions that are useful, feasible and encompass the range of benefits to people from ecosystems.

40|$|Small {{alluvial}} fan systems have formed off the hillslopes of the remnant Karoo koppies at Heelbo in the Eastern Free State, South Africa. The landform geometry {{is a result}} of complex relationships between climate, lithology, structure and vegetation. This research area, which includes a large mammal mass death site, potentially contains a wealth of <b>palaeo-environmental</b> and specifically palaeoclimatic information. <b>Palaeo-environmental</b> information and proxy records on past climates in southern Africa has traditionally been obtained from a variety of techniques including stable isotope analysis of speleothems, pollen, faunal analyses at archeological sites, animal remains and crater-lake sediments (see references below).

40|$|Investigators {{have studied}} past {{environmental}} {{change in the}} Eastern Mediterranean region {{from a number of}} perspectives. While climate reconstructions and palynological research have focused on forces that drive the geomorphologic system, many researchers have attempted to use sediment archive studies to identify periods of change in sediment dynamics. Due to the large variability in environmental parameters and the variety of landscapes present in the Eastern Mediterranean region, research has focused on sediment archives ranging from small colluvial sites to deltas of large rivers on the Mediterranean coast. As the cultural record for the region is extremely rich, the main goal of <b>palaeo-environmental</b> research in the Eastern Mediterranean has been to identify the relative importance of human impact on the landscape. Nevertheless, sediment archives have significant limitations: chronological control for many <b>palaeo-environmental</b> records is highly uncertain, and rates of landscape change are oftentimes difficult to assess. Most <b>palaeo-environmental</b> research has been conducted on or near archeological sites, where direct human impact may obscure the indirect impact on sediment dynamics through land-use changes. Quantification and modeling of sediment dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean environment offer one solution. When erosion and sediment transport rate analyses are incorporated, periods of relatively important change can be identified. Using multiple approaches the relative importance of the main driving forces, climate and land use, become distinguishable. Since field-based data from the actual sediment archives remain vital, an overview of numerous studies in the Eastern Mediterranean is provided in order to draw a general picture for different time periods and the relative scale of regional landscape development during the Holocene. A comparison of sediment dynamics with the record of driving forces indicates that while climate was the main driver of the geomorphic system during the early Holocene, at some point human impact became widespread and began to dictate sediment dynamics to a large extent. From the Byzantine Period onward soil properties seem to play an increasingly important role, as the hillslope soil reservoir in the Eastern Mediterranean was progressively depleted during the late Holocene. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} archaeological sites {{was carried out}} across 60 km 2 of the Black Mountain in {{south-east}} Dyfed, an upland common. These are described {{and placed in a}} putative chronological sequence against a <b>palaeo-environmental</b> backcloth. Sepulchral cairns are the earliest sites recorded, probably belonging to the early second millennium bc. House circles and homesteads may date to later prehistory and the early proto-historic period, while numerous rectangular foundations are probably the remains of Medieval, possibly later Medieval, settlement. Boundaries partition part of the landscape and there are stone clearance heaps and strips. Land-use is discussed up until the early Post-Medieval period, taking account of both the monuments and the <b>palaeo-environmental</b> data and informed by definition of some parameters within which exploitation of upland environments can take place. Seasonality of resources, the importance of the wider region and the requirements for mobility are amongst the factors considered. The historical model of transhumance which is frequently applied to the Welsh uplands is examined. Periodic hunting, gathering and husbandry is suggested in the area prior to c. 2000 bc after which perceptions of the landscape seemingly begin to change with evidence for episodes of more formal management relating to animal husbandry and limited cultivation. Although settlement may frequently have been transient, overwintering or longer periods of continuous occupation are not precluded in response to a combination of economic, social and environmental factors.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decades, archaeologists and historians have faced the {{necessity}} to reconstruct ancient settlement history not only through {{the study of the}} material excavated, but also with the use of <b>palaeo-environmental</b> parameters. Geoarchaeology is a recent field of research that uses the computer cartography, the Geographic Information System (GIS) and the Digital Elevation Models (D. E. M.) in combination with disciplines from Human and Social Sciences and Earth Sciences. Satellite images, high resolution topographic surveys (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data) and <b>palaeo-environmental</b> results are used to establish accurate topographic maps, palaeogeographic reconstructions and three dimensional views of the landscape, contemporaneous to the ancient site of interest. GIS is used to manage the important amount of data widely dispatched both in space and in time. This paper describes several powerful methods to infer the evolution of landscapes in the context of such multi-disciplinary/geoarchaeological programmes. The potential of Geoarchaeology is illustrated by three case-studies in Albania and Greece, where the neighbourhood of ancient settlements from the Holocene (the last 10000 years) have been reconstructed into virtual landscape. These geoarchaeological studies offer now an unprecedented level of integration between disciplines to visualize a shoreline and its displacement. Over the last 20 000 years, humans had to constantly adapt their lifestyles according to the displacement of the shoreline. Given the current threats and uncertainties related to climate change, it is predictable and desirable that many disciplines will adopt similar integrated approach to model their favourite object of research...|$|E
40|$|The terrigenous {{fraction}} of sediments from a deep-sea sediment core {{recovered from the}} northwestern Western Australian continental slope offshore North West Cape, SE Indian Ocean, reveals a history of Western Australian climate throughout the last 550 ka. End-member modelling of a data set of grain-size distributions (n = 438) of the terrigenous sediment fraction allows to interpret the record in terms of aeolian and fluvial sediment deposition, both related to <b>palaeo-environmental</b> conditions in the North West Cape area. The data set can be best described by two aeolian end members and one fluvial one. Changes in {{the ratio of the}} two aeolian end members over the fluvial one are interpreted as aridity variations in northwestern Western Australia. These grain-size data are compared with bulk geochemical data obtained by XRF scans of the core. Log-ratios of the elements Zr/Fe and Ti/Ca, which indicate a terrigenous origin, corroborate the grain-size data. We postulate that the mid- to late Quaternary near North West Cape climate was relatively arid during the glacial and relatively humid during the interglacial stages, owing to meridional shifts in the atmospheric circulation system. Opposite to published <b>palaeo-environmental</b> records from the same latitude (20 °S) offshore Chile and offshore Namibia, the Australian aridity record does not show the typical southern hemisphere climate variability of humid glacials and dry interglacials, which we interpret {{to be the result of}} the relatively large land mass of the Australian continent, which emphasises a strong monsoonal climatic system...|$|E

Based on their findings, the authors challenge the association of angular debris with frost shattering and {{use this as a}} platform for directing critique against palaeo-geomorphic studies. While the lightning strike data are not questioned directly here, the <b>palaeo-environmental</b> contextwithin which the paper is set, the portrayal of former findings and the assumptions regarding weathering mechanisms in Lesotho are commented on. Frost shattering is the centre of Knight and Grab's weathering critique but, contrary to that stated in their text, none of the cited authors invoke this process in Lesotho. Other weathering processes that are speculated upon are not specific to cold climates either and thus cannot be used in support of their argument. In terms of debris and block distribution, lightning will not account for the preferential location of relict blocks and debris below the summits on south-facing slopes, or for the extensive valley floor accumulations that are documented in Lesotho. Knight and Grab also falsely portray former studies by implying that <b>palaeo-environmental</b> inferences in the area are drawn fromblock origin or morphology alonewhen the climatic signatures were derived from integrated assessments. In a palaeo-context, the relative contribution of lightning to debris production under dryer and colder conditions, when convective thunderstorm activity in the highlands was likely reduced, is also questioned. The weathering context, as well as the critique that Knight and Grab direct at other studies on relict landforms, is thus shown as inappropriate. [URL]...|$|E

Duricrusted strandlines along the northeastern margin of Sua Pan provide <b>palaeo-environmental</b> data pertaining to the Makgadikgadi subbasin (MSB) with inferences regarding the larger Makgadikgadi–Okavango–Zambezi (MOZ) rift depression. Field, XRD and geochemical data show that MSB strandlines comprise calcretes (LU 1 type), MgO-rich calcretes with silica (LU 2 type), sil-calcrete (LU 3 type) and silcrete (LU 4 type). Early freshwater episodes {{appear to have been}} followed by calcrete-dominated drying phases interspersed with repeated silcretisation. Calcretisation through pan littoral sediments may have been both biogenically and environmentally induced. Calcite precipitation was in part controlled by the Mg/Ca ratio of pore water in the pan littoral zone suggesting closed basin type evaporative conditions, which were followed by a major desiccation interval. Phases of silcrete precipitation appear to be related to periods when the geochemistry of the lake littoral more closely resembled present-day Na–CO 3 –SO 4 –Cl-type brines. Silica saturated acidic, moderately saline groundwater preceded Si precipitation which took place as the pH reduced. Si mobilisation occurred (inter alia) as a result of quartz grain dissolution enhanced by diatoms, bacteria and algal growth in the moist pan littoral. SiO 2 -rich pore waters migrated through cracked and desiccated calcrete into areas of lower salinity and lower pH resulting in preferential calcite removal and silcrete precipitation. Approximate TL dates imply that exposed littoral sand underwent calcretisation during the drying phases of extensive palaeo-lakes which occurred prior to 110 ka, 80 – 90 ka and 41 – 43 ka. These wet periods compare fairly well with Vostok core chronologies for southern Africa...|$|E
