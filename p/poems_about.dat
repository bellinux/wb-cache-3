5|$|The {{entomologist}} Otto Plath wrote Bumblebees and Their Ways in 1934. His daughter, {{the poet}} Sylvia Plath, wrote {{a group of}} <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> bees late in 1962, within four months of her suicide, transforming her father's interest into her poetry.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sea-{{inspired}} novels {{have been}} written by Joseph Conrad, Herman Wouk, and Herman Melville; <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the sea {{have been written}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rudyard Kipling and John Masefield. The sea has inspired much music over the centuries including sea shanties, Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, Claude Debussy's La mer (1903–05), Charles Villiers Stanford's Songs of the Sea (1904) and Songs of the Fleet (1910), Edward Elgar's Sea Pictures (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' A Sea Symphony (1903–1909). Burial at sea has been practised in various ways by countries around the world since the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.|$|E
50|$|One half-stanza from a <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> Thor {{dealing with}} the god's fight against Jörmungandr and one {{fragment}} from a <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> an unidentifiable king are all that survive of his work. They were preserved in Snorri Sturluson's Skáldskaparmál (4, 64).|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a longer}} <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> the same subject called The Maiden’s Stone of Tullibody. A third, much shorter, poem called Martha of Myreton comes {{sandwiched}} between a <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> the same graveyard and another entitled Tullibody which repeatedly describes Tullibody as sweet.|$|R

5|$|In late 1888 he {{finished}} {{work on a}} fourth book, Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.|$|E
5|$|Still {{the subject}} of {{speculation}} and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book {{went on to win}} the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested {{that the purpose of the}} trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E

5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Nile {{remains one}} of the Royal Navy's most famous victories, and has {{remained}} prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the battle is Casabianca, which was written by Felicia Dorothea Hemans in 1826 and describes a fictional account of the death of Captain Casabianca's son on Orient. Monuments were raised, including Cleopatra's Needle in London. Muhammad Ali of Egypt gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the Victoria Embankment until 1878. Another memorial, the Nile Clumps near Amesbury, consists of stands of beech trees purportedly planted by Lord Queensbury at the bequest of Lady Hamilton and Thomas Hardy after Nelson's death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship. A similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near Alnwick by Nelson's agent Alexander Davison. The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names HMS Aboukir and HMS Nile, and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate HMS Somerset, whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in the battle.|$|E

25|$|Vortigern's story {{remained}} well known after the Middle Ages, especially in Great Britain. He {{is a major}} character in two Jacobean plays, the anonymous The Birth of Merlin and Thomas Middleton's Hengist, King of Kent, first published in 1661. His meeting with Rowena became a popular subject in 17th-century engraving and painting, for example William Hamilton's 1793 work Vortigern and Rowena. He was also featured in literature, such as John Lesslie Hall's <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> the beginnings of England.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{poets and}} writers from Dubrovnik wrote about Skanderbeg, like Ivan Gundulić in his {{greatest}} work Osman {{at the beginning}} of the 17th century and Junije Palmotić in his work Glasovi where he mentions Skanderbeg among other heroes of Serbian epic poetry. Many authors from Croatia wrote about Skanderbeg, including Pavao Ritter Vitezović in 1682 and especially Andrija Kačić Miošić whose <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> Skanderbeg, published in 1756, were basis for tragedy Skenderbeg written by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{contained}} the magical elements and love interest that were generally {{lacking in the}} more austere and warlike <b>poems</b> <b>about</b> Carolingian heroes. Ariosto continued to mix these elements in his poem as well as adding material derived from Classical sources. However, Ariosto has an ironic tone rarely present in Boiardo, who treated the ideals of chivalry much more seriously. In Orlando Furioso, instead of chivalric ideals, no longer alive in the 16th century, a humanistic conception of man and life is vividly celebrated under {{the appearance of a}} fantastical world.|$|E
