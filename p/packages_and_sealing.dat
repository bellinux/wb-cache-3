50|$|When {{selecting}} packaging films (web substrates) for EMAP {{of fruits}} and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> reliability. Traditionally used packaging films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, {{there is a need to}} transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} which factors {{affect the}} price of wine. Among these are amount of alcohol, age, <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing.</b> The investigation {{is divided into two}} parts. The country in which the wine is produced is examined in one model and the second model examines the effect grapes contained in the wine has on the price. In order to produce the two models data from Systembolaget AB’s assortment is used. When the data has been treated, a linear regression analysis is conducted. The results of the two regressions are then discussed in order to examine the reliability of the models. This discussion is based on the assumptions made when conducting a linear regression, and economic theory. It appears that the model with countries is better than the model with grapes, and that factors such as alcohol content, age, <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> are correlated with price. Finally the causes of these correlations are discussed.   —Vi undersöker vilka faktorer som påverkar priset på vin. Bland dessa finns alkoholhalt, ålder, förpackning och förslutning. Undersökningen delas upp i två delar. I den ena modellen undersöks vilket land vinet kommer ifrån och i den andra modellen undersöks hur de druvor som vinet innehåller påverkar priset. För att ta fram de två modellerna används data från Systembolaget AB:s sortiment. När datan har behandlats genomförs linjär regressionsanalys. Resultatet av de två regressionerna diskuteras sedan för att undersöka tillförlitligheten hos modellerna. Denna diskussion bygger på de antaganden som krävs för den linjära regressionen samt ekonomisk teori. Det visas att modellen med länder är bättre än modellen med druvor, samt att faktorer som alkoholhalt, ålder, förpackning och kork är korrelerade med priset.

Hermeticity testing is {{a technology that}} deals with the transfer of media (gasses) in <b>and</b> out of <b>sealed</b> enclosures based on vacuum science, physics, and chemistry. The chapter aims to establish {{an understanding of the}} different seal test methodologies for MEMS packages. The hermeticity classes are explained. Method for measuring <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> Integrity using helium as the tracer gas defines and quantifies these classes differently but uses the same wording. Only three nondestructive leak tests possess high enough measurement sensitivity for modern inertial sensors. The relevant hermeticity tests for MEMs packages are membrane resonance, Kr 85 radioactive tracer gas tests, optical deformation, internal pressure measurement, helium leak test, IR transmission tests, and Q factor monitoring. The neon ultra-fine leak test is an elaborated hermeticity test environment with a dedicated vacuum prediction model (vacuum lif etime model) based on quality factor monitoring of micro resonating devices. The neon ultra-fine leak test procedure for a new device starts with measuring a calibration curve for Q factor over a relevant pressure range, using selected open devices. The calculation regarding the vacuum lifetime model can be done easily in an analytical way such as cavity with ideal getter and getter saturation. The calculation will be much easier if we can assume molecular flow in the hole leak channel...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Deboned, {{skinless}} {{white and}} dark meat from fowl was pretreated by overnight soaking at 3 C in either deionized water, 2 % sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, 3 % Kena solution (sodium polyphosphate), or 2 % NaCl plus 3 % Kena solution. Meat was subsequently water cooked 90 min at 92 C: then diced and batched with ground cooked skin, fat, and broth. Ingredients were <b>packaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealed</b> in flexible retortable pouches and retorted at 121 C (250 F). Finished prod-ucts were evaluated for proximate composition, mineral content, and sensory properties. Presoaking the meat in water or 2 % NaCl {{had little effect}} on product composition or sensory properties after retorting. Soaking in Kena, with or without NaCl, increased moisture, decreased percentage protein, and increased ash. Kena plus NaCl had significantly higher Na and CI contents than all other treatments. Finished products made from meat presoaked in Kena, with or without NaCl, were lighter in color, more tender, and less off-flavored than products presoaked in water or 2 % NaCl only. Product made from Kena plus NaCl differed significantly from product made from Kena alone in higher initial juiciness, increased perception of seasoning, and higher Na and CI contents; however, {{there were no significant differences}} in other parameters. The value of increased juiciness and seasoning perceived versus the value of increased Na content would need to be con-sidered in making a recommendation on the use of polyphosphates with or without NaCl to improve fowl meat products. If dietary sodium content is a concern, small differences in quality may be negated by increased sodium content resulting from treatment with polyphosphates plu...|$|R

40|$|The Development of Non-Milk Based Formulated Drinks For Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women. Background: The {{pregnant}} and breastfeeding women need a greater nutrition intake compared to normal women. At {{second and third}} trimester of pregnancy, and during breastfeeding, a woman should have additional nutrient for approximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein per day. Recently, various formula drinks for {{pregnant and}} breastfeeding women {{are available in the}} market, however most of these formulas are expensive. Objectives: To develop non-milk based formula drinks for pregnant and breastfeeding women which contained adequate amount of additional macro and micro nutrients had good sensory quality and had long self life. Methods: Initially, 13 kinds of drinks were formulated. The drinks contained aproximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein. They were analyzed for nutrient contain, microbiology and sensory quality in order to vote the best 5 formulas at the laboratory scale. The formulated drinks were <b>packaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealed</b> in 150 mL plastic cups. To know the self life of the drinks, storage was carry out in the room, incubator and refrigerator temperature during 12 months. Results: From sensory test, it was concluded that the best five drinks were kweni formula, chocholate formula, ginger formula, guava-orange formula and red bean formula. One cup of 150 ml formulated drink, had 140 - 150 Kcal energy and 8 grams protein. Therefore, to fulfill additional requirements for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the drinks should be consumed 2 cups a day. Conclusions: The formula drink developed could provide additional energy, protein, vitamin and mineral needed by pregnant and breast feeding women. There was no side effect reported by the panelist because of consuming the formula. Keywords: formulated drinks, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, acceptance. </p...|$|R

40|$|Shelf-life of many foods {{is largely}} {{dependent}} on the barrier to moisture and oxygen of the respective package. Barrier is often assessed by measuring the transmission rate of films. However, in thermosealed <b>packages</b> leaks <b>and</b> weak <b>seals</b> can give rise to increased total mass transfer entering the system and reaching the food. While leaks are random defects and are associated to early failure, lower integrity of regular seals tends to affect whole batch causing {{a decrease in the}} product shelf-life. In the present work the contribution of the seals to total permeability of packages was assessed by measuring transmission rate of the film <b>and</b> of thermosealed <b>packages</b> of different sizes, therefore with different seals length. Packages made of PA/PE and PVDC coated PET/PE and their respective films were tested for moisture and oxygen transmission rate at different temperature and relative humidity.

Six trimeric tailspikes attached around this tail hub are kinked, suggesting a functional hinge that may be used to trigger DNA release. Inside the capsid, the portal's central channel is plugged by densities interpreted as pilot/injection proteins. A short rod-like density near these proteins may be the terminal segment of the dsDNA genome. The coaxially packed DNA genome is encapsidated by the icosahedral shell.
