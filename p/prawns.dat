5|$|Invertebrates {{including}} cephalopods like squid and octopus; crustaceans such as <b>prawns,</b> crabs, and lobsters; and bivalve or gastropod molluscs such as clams, oysters, cockles, and whelks are all hunted or farmed for food.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crustaceans}} {{are consumed}} by humans, and nearly 10,700,000tons were produced in 2007; {{the vast majority}} of this output is of decapod crustaceans: crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and <b>prawns.</b> Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and <b>prawns,</b> and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.|$|E
5|$|The bigfin reef squid eats {{a variety}} of {{different}} marine organisms. Its main prey are usually <b>prawns</b> and other crustaceans, and fish. Captive specimens were observed to consume one fish every 2 to 25 hours.|$|E

5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid <b>prawns</b> and mantis shrimps); cephalopods are also infrequently consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of <b>prawns.</b> In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5000|$|Pandalus borealis is {{a species}} of caridean shrimp found in cold parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

5|$|Piccadilly was {{increasingly}} developed {{and by the}} middle of the 18th century it was continuously built on as far as Hyde Park Corner. The development of St James's and Mayfair in particular made Piccadilly into one of the busiest roads in London. Hugh Mason and William Fortnum started the Fortnum & Mason partnership on Piccadilly in 1705, selling recycled candles from Buckingham Palace. By 1788, the store sold poultry, potted meats, lobsters and <b>prawns,</b> savoury patties, Scotch eggs, and fresh and dried fruits.|$|E
5|$|The Eumalocostraca {{contains}} {{the vast majority}} of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a marsupium in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes lobsters, crabs, shrimps, <b>prawns</b> and krill.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including <b>prawns,</b> crabs, and mantis shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} performance of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus) and freshwater <b>prawn</b> (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in periphyton-based systems were studied in farmers' ponds at Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Fifteen ponds (200 - 300 m 2 area and 1. 0 - 1. 5 m in depth) {{were used to}} compare five stocking ratios in triplicate: 100 % GIFT, 75 % GIFT plus 25 % <b>prawn,</b> 50 % GIFT plus 50 % <b>prawn,</b> 25 % GIFT plus 75 % <b>prawn</b> and 100 % <b>prawn.</b> Ponds were stocked at a total density of 20 000 GIFT and/or <b>prawn</b> ha - 1. Bamboo poles (mean diameter 6. 2 cm and 5. 5 pole m- 2) were posted in pond bottoms vertically as periphyton substrate. Periphyton biomass in terms of dry matter (DM), ash-free DM and chlorophyll a were significantly higher in ponds stocked with <b>prawn</b> alone than in ponds with different combinations of GIFT and <b>prawn.</b> Survival of GIFT was significantly lower in ponds stocked with 100 % GIFT (monoculture) whereas, that of <b>prawn</b> was significantly higher in its monoculture ponds indicating detrimental effects of GIFT on prawn's survival. Individual weight gains for both species were significantly higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The highest total fish and <b>prawn</b> yield (1623 kg GIFT and 30 kg <b>prawn</b> ha- 1) over 125 - 140 days culture period was recorded in ponds with 75 % GIFT and 25 % <b>prawn</b> followed by 100 % GIFT alone (1549 kg ha- 1), 50 % GIFT plus 50 % <b>prawn</b> (1114 kg GIFT and 68 kg <b>prawn</b> ha- 1), 25 % GIFT plus 75 % <b>prawn</b> (574 kg GIFT and 129 kg <b>prawn</b> ha- 1) and 100 % <b>prawn</b> alone (157 kg ha- 1). This combination also gave the highest economic return. Therefore, a stocking ratio of 75 % GIFT plus 25 % <b>prawn</b> at a total density of 20 000 ha- 1 {{appeared to be the}} best stocking ratio in terms of fish production as well as economics for a periphyton-based polyculture syste...|$|R

5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most important food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid <b>prawns,</b> molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to <b>prawns</b> and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, <b>prawns,</b> salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly <b>prawns,</b> {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid <b>prawns.</b> Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, <b>prawns,</b> sea bass, and sole.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted for rearing of Meni, Nandus nandus in laboratory condition {{for seven months}} with the objective to select appropriate feed for the species {{and to develop a}} rearing technique of the species up to the stage of sexual maturation. Different trials were conducted using artificial feed (35. 5 % protein), dead fresh kachki (Carica soborna), dead fresh <b>prawn</b> (Macrobrachium lamarrei) and live <b>prawn</b> (Macrobrachium lamarrei). The provision of bottom sediment did not significantly influence the growth of fish. Between dead fresh kachki and dead fresh <b>prawn,</b> the fish preferred dead fresh <b>prawn.</b> The fish was found to be reluctant to take dead fresh kachki and <b>prawn</b> as food unless they became very hungry. The fish was found actively feeding on live <b>prawn.</b> The FCR of the <b>prawn</b> as food for N. nandus was found to be 2. 5.

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid <b>prawns.</b> Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} groups that are now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: mantis shrimp are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis shrimp. In the Decapoda, <b>prawns</b> and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species. It preys mainly on <b>prawns,</b> but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to ecotourism, being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E
