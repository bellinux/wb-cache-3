40|$|This paper {{describes}} a powder-metering, -mixing, and -dispensing mechanism {{that can be}} used as a method for producing large numbers of samples for metallurgical evaluation or electrical or mechanical testing from multicomponent metal and cermet powder systems. It is designed to make use of the same commercial powders that are used in powder metallurgy and, therefore, to produce samples that are faithful to the microstructure of finished products. The particle assemblies produced by the device could be consolidated by die pressing, isostatic pressing, laser sintering, or direct melting. The <b>powder</b> metering <b>valve</b> provides both on/off and flow rate control of dry powders in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. The valve is simple and involves no relative movement, avoiding seizure with fine powders. An orchestra of such valves can be arranged on a building platform to prepare multicomponent combinatorial libraries. As with many combinatorial devices, identification and evaluation of sources of mixing error as a function of sample size is mandatory. Such an analysis is presented. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{describes a}} method for both on/off and flow rate control of dry powders in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. In a glass capillary attached to an electromagnetic transducer, the wave characteristics of the forced vibration control both flow rate and switching of <b>powder</b> flow. The <b>valve</b> is free from relative movement of parts that may wear or seize {{in the presence of}} fine powders. The versatility of the flow controller has been demonstrated by playing popular music to a sample of H 13 tool steel powder. The on/off switching and the flow rate of the powder correspond to the waveform of the musi...|$|R
5000|$|Midway through {{model year}} 1998, the Dodge Ram {{switched}} from the 6BT to the ISB to meet updated emissions requirements. Like other ISB's, these engines started out using the Bosch VP44 rotary injection pump. The VP44 setup meant that timing and fuel could be precisely controlled, {{which led to}} cleaner emissions. However, VP44 failure rates were higher than the older P7100 injection pump. The compression ratio in these engines was 17.2:1. The 1998-2000 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with the 47RE automatic transmission. The 1998 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with the manual transmission. The 1999-2000 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with a manual transmission. For the 2001-2002 model years, a standard output and a high output ISB Cummins engine were offered. The standard output, which {{was the same as}} the previous engines was rated to [...] and [...] when equipped with either a manual transmission or automatic. The high output ISB was rated at [...] and , with only a NV5600 six-speed manual transmission available. The high output engine was different in a few ways from the standard output engine; it had higher compression (17.1:1), <b>powdered</b> metal <b>valve</b> seat inserts, a larger flywheel, the Bosch fuel system was reworked to allow higher fuel flows, and fuel-injection timing was altered.|$|R
40|$|In mould {{decoration}} (IMD) {{is attractive}} because a fully, or partially, decorated component is produced {{directly from the}} moulding process, with reduced emissions at lower process costs when compared to traditional techniques. A new IMD process has been developed to produce a painted component direct from the injection moulding tool. This incorporates the pressure spraying of thermoset <b>powders</b> through a <b>valve</b> into a closed mould. The residual heat of the tool initially softens the thermoset. The high temperature of thermoplastic polymer injected in a standard injection moulding subsequently cures the thermoset. The resultant product combines both thermoplastic and thermoset in a single injection moulding cycle. This paper presents frames from high speed video capture of powder mould filling {{and the results of}} INSPIRE (in mould spray painting, impact reduced on the environment) initial injection moulding using thermoset polyester and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The parameters that affect material distribution are examined and discussed. Similarities to the coinjection moulding process are noted. ...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{the safety of}} lead have provided sufficient motivation to develop substitute materials for the surface layer on a thrust bearing type component known as a valve plate in axial piston hydraulic pumps that consists of 10 % tin, 10 % lead, and the remainder copper (in wt. %). A recently developed replacement material, a Cu- 10 Sn- 3 Bi (wt. %) P/M bronze, {{was found to be}} unsuitable as valve plate surface layer, requiring {{the development of a new}} alloy. A comparison of the Cu- 10 Sn- 10 Pb and Cu- 10 Sn- 3 Bi <b>powder</b> metal <b>valve</b> plates showed that the differences in wear behavior between the two alloys arose due to the soft phase bismuth in the alloy that is known to cause both solid and liquid metal embrittlement of copper alloys. A lead-free alternative was developed by using infiltration of high-tin alloys into porous bronze compacts compacted at 350 MPa and sintered for 2 hours at 650 Â°C to replicate the dual phase structure of leaded bronze. The resulting engineered composite had a lower volume loss than samples of leaded and bismuth bronze under lubricated wear test conditions. It also possessed a similar coefficient of friction and abrasive/plowing mechanism of wear as the Cu- 10 Sn- 10 Pb alloys. The results of wear testing show that the alloy demonstrates wear resistant properties comparable to those of the very successful leaded-bronze alloys. Furthermore, the microstructure of the composite alloy can be engineered by increasing the compaction pressure and sintering temperature of the bronze to balance strength and percentage of the soft phase to match the end use. Also critical to the alloys performance is the control of copper-tin intermetallic formation and growth. The amount of intermetallics could be controlled by minimizing time at temperature during infiltration. In addition, it was shown that growth of the copper-tin Cu 3 Sn intermetallic can mitigated by the addition of manganese...|$|R
