This study uses a firm level analysis to examine firms' effectiveness in using Market Promotion Program (MPP, which is now the MAP) funds to increase revenues. Whereas point estimates suggested that smaller firms were more effective in translating MPP funds into increased revenue than larger firms, these point estimates for small firms were statistically indistinguishable from zero. In contrast, large firms showed an increase in revenue of greater than one dollar for every dollar of MPP funds. Further, the revenue increase was statistically significant. Thus, the firm level analysis supports neither the GAO hypotheses nor the recent program changes. export promotion programs, export sales, export revenues, Market Promotion Program, firm-level analysis, joint estimation, Financial Economics,...|$|R

In 2002 the Ministry of Foreign Trade merged with the Ministry of Economic Development and became the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism. The government created Proexport Colombia, an export-promotion agency, and Proexpo became the Foreign Trade Bank of Colombia (Bancoldex), an export-import bank that now provides financing alternatives for Colombian producers of all sorts in commerce, industry, and tourism.|$|E

Research conducted on computer-mediated composition to uncover opportunities for digital applications to improve soundscape-choreographic connectedness across transnational dance networks. Questions sought to extend awareness in Japan’s culture of disability through dance. Compositional technologies were utilised and developed using speech synthesis, HCI and multidimensional scaling. An acoustically synthesised program was designed to develop the potential of sound interaction and spatial coordination in dance. This involved an original cross-disciplinary methodology between different fields including spatial awareness, audio and science. Vocal sounds made by the disabled Japanese dancers were translated into numerical data language with the outcome of designing a new synthesised soundscape.
