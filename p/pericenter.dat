40|$|The {{equations}} {{of secular}} evolution for dust grains in mean motion resonances with a planet are solved for stationary points. This is done including both Poynting-Robertson effect and stellar wind. The solutions are stationary in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and resonant angle, but allow the pericentre to advance. The semimajor axis of stationary solutions can be slightly {{shifted from the}} exact resonant value. The periodicity of the stationary solutions in a reference frame orbiting with the planet is analytically proved. The existence of periodic solutions in mean motion resonances means that analytical theory enables for dust particles also infinitely long capture times. The stationary solutions are periodic motions to which the eccentricity asymptotically approaches and around which the libration occurs. Using numerical integration of equation of motion are successfully found initial conditions corresponding to the stationary solutions. Numerically and analytically determined shifts of the semimajor axis form the exact resonance for the stationary solutions are in excellent agreement. The stationary solutions can be plotted by locations of <b>pericenters</b> in the reference frame orbiting with the planet. The <b>pericenters</b> are distributed in the space according to properties of dust particles. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Images {{obtained}} by the Cassini spacecraft between 2012 and 2015 reveal a periodic brightness variation in a region of Saturn's D ring that previously appeared to be rather featureless. Furthermore, the intensity and radial wavenumber of this pattern have decreased steadily with time since it was first observed. Based on analogies with similar structures elsewhere in the D ring, we propose that this structure was created by some event that disturbed the orbital motions of the ring particles, giving them finite orbital eccentricities and initially aligned <b>pericenters.</b> Differential orbital precession then transformed this structure into a spiral pattern in the ring's optical depth that became increasingly tightly wound over time. The observed trends in the pattern's radial wavenumber are roughly consistent with this basic model, and also indicate that the ring-disturbing event occurred in early December 2011. Similar events in 1979 may have generated the periodic patterns seen in this same region by the Voyager spacecraft. The 2011 event could {{have been caused by}} debris striking the rings, or by a disturbance in the planet's electromagnetic environment. The rapid reduction in the intensity of the brightness variations over the course of just a few years indicates that some process is either damping orbital eccentricities in this region or causing the orbital <b>pericenters</b> of particles with the same semi-major axis to become misaligned.

40|$|The {{orbital element}} {{distribution}} of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with large <b>pericenters</b> {{has been suggested}} {{to be influenced by}} the presence of an undetected, large planet at > 200 AU from the Sun. To find additional observables caused by this scenario, we here present the first detailed emplacement simulation {{in the presence of a}} massive ninth planet on the distant Kuiper Belt. We perform 4 Gyr N-body simulations with the currently known Solar System planetary architecture, plus a 10 Earth mass planet with similar orbital parameters to those suggested by Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) or Batygin & Brown (2016), and 10 ^ 5 test particles in an initial planetesimal disk. We find that including a distant superearth-mass planet produces a substantially different orbital distribution for the scattering and detached TNOs, raising the <b>pericenters</b> and inclinations of moderate semimajor axis (50 <a< 500 AU) objects. We test whether this signature is detectable via a simulator with the observational characteristics of four precisely characterized TNO surveys. We find that the qualitatively very distinct Solar System models that include a ninth planet are essentially observationally indistinguishable from an outer Solar System produced solely by the four giant planets. We also find that the mass of the Kuiper Belt's current scattering and detached populations is required to be 3 - 10 times larger in the presence of an additional planet. We do not find any evidence for clustering of orbital angles in our simulated TNO population. Wide-field, deep surveys targeting inclined high-pericenter objects will be required to distinguish between these different scenarios. Comment: accepted to A...|$|R

40|$|We {{point out}} that the usual {{self-similarity}} in cold dark matter models is broken by encounters with individual normal galactic stars on a subparsec scale. Tidal heating and stripping must have redefined the density and velocity structures {{of the population of the}} Earth-mass dark matter halos, which are likely to have been the first bound structures to form in the universe.

40|$|The ring models {{described}} here {{were developed to}} account for the dynamical problems posed by the narrow rings of Uranus. Some of these rings are now known to be eccentric, inclined, nonuniform in width, optically thick, and narrow, with very sharp edges. The eccentric rings have common <b>pericenters</b> and large, positive eccentricity gradients. The theory of shepherding satellites successfully accounts for most of these features and can also account for some features of the narrow Saturnian rings, in particular, waves, kinks, and periodic variations in brightness. Outstanding problems include the putative relation between eccentricity and inclination displayed by eight of the nine Uranian rings, and the magnitudes of the tidal torques acting on the shepherding satellites. The horseshoe-orbit model, although viable, probably has more application to the narrow rings from which the Saturnian coorbital satellites formed.

40|$|Although {{analytical}} {{studies on}} the secular motion of the irregular satellites have been published recently, these theories {{have not yet been}} satisfactorily reconciled with the results of direct numerical integrations. These discrepancies occur because in secular theories the disturbing function is averaged over orbital motions, whereas instead one should take into account some large periodic terms, most notably the so-called ``evection''. We demonstrate that such terms can be incorporated into the Kozai formalism, and that our synthetic approach produces much better agreement with results from symplectic integrations. Using this method, we plot the locations of secular resonances in the orbital-element space, and we note that the distribution of irregular satellite clusters appears to be non-random. We find that the large majority of irregular-satellite groups cluster close to the secular resonances, with several objects having practically stationary <b>pericenters.</b> None of the largest satellites belong to this class, so we argue that this dichotomy implies that the smaller near-resonant satellites might have been captured differently than the largest irregulars.

40|$|Earth-mass {{dark matter}} halos {{are likely to}} have been the first bound {{structures}} to form in the Universe. Whether such objects have survived to the present day in galaxies depends on, among other factors, the rate of encounters with normal stars. In this letter, we estimate the amount of tidal heating and mass loss in microhalos as a result of stellar encounters. We find that while microhalos are only mildly heated in dwarf galaxies of low stellar density, and they should be been completely destroyed in bulge or M 32 -like regions of high stellar density. In disk galaxies, such as the Milky Way, the disruption rate depends strongly on the orbital parameters of the microhalo; systems on non-planar retrograde orbits with large <b>pericenters</b> survive the longest. Since many microhalos lose a significant fraction of their material to unbound tidal streams, the final dark matter distribution in the solar neighborhood is better described as a superposition of microstreams rather than as a set of discrete spherical clumps in an otherwise homogeneous medium.
