5000|$|Túmin [...] is an {{alternative}} currency used in the municipality of Espinal, Veracruz, Mexico. Its name means [...] "money" [...] in the Totonac language. (Note that this word in Totonac is borrowed from the old Spanish coin the [...] "tomín" [...] www.rae.es). Espinal is a municipality of some 2600 inhabitants, 19% of whom are indigenous Totonac people. Used as a complementary currency, the Tumin was first put in circulation in 2010 as a student project at the Intercultural University of Veracruz, where students {{were trying to find}} ways of strengthening the local economy. In Espinal the access to cash is scarce as most people work for the minimum wage. The project creators analyzed the economy of the area and concluded that there were sufficient goods and demand, but that a medium of exchange was lacking. The creators designed bills and started promoting its use as a kind of exchange coupon among locals in Espinal, in order to support a barter economy. The bills are decorated with the likenesses of Emiliano Zapata and paintings by Diego Rivera, and they describe the value of the bill in Spanish and Totonac. The Tumin is accepted in Espinal in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from health care to tacos and internet cafe visits.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} report {{commissioned}} by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation poverty and participation are analyzed as a social phenomenon characterizing UK society following the tradition initiated several decades ago by Peter Townsend. Participation in society is {{measured in terms of}} social relationships, membership of organisations, trust in other people, ownership of possessions and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The study finds out that all these dimensions of participation are lower among people with low incomes. While participation generally drops as income declines, participation stops falling among the 30 per cent or so of people with the lowest incomes, creating a participation 'floor'. The 30 per cent of people with the lowest incomes are forced to choose between the basic necessities of modern life; they must decide which needs to neglect.For people affected by the floor, additional income may well be spent on upgrading the quality of necessary goods and services rather than adding to them. Averages mask important variation. The participation floor for benefit recipients is lower than for other groups on the same income. Most minority ethnic groups experience greater material deprivation than the white majority but social participation is, on average, higher. Children's engagement in school life and friends is not directly affected by household income. However, parents on low incomes, on average, play less often with their children and spend less on activities. This is associated with poorer educational outcomes as judged by teachers. Low-income parents frequently spend more time than affluent ones assisting children with their school work because they have fallen behind their classmates.|$|E

Project-based and post-based purchases are two typical policy designs. Why do the local states develop two different designs to serve similar intentions? The answers to this question contribute to the broader discussion of policymaking and social development in China. Using the intention-capacity analytic framework, this study systemically compares Guangzhou 2 ̆ 7 s project-based model and Shenzhen 2 ̆ 7 s post-based model by drawing upon an extensive review of policy and archive documents, key informant interviews and field observations. The comparative study suggests that a pro-market ideology and incomplete analytical capacity in policy learning directed the design thinking towards market mechanism and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Without the organisational conditions of social organisation and social work in Guangzhou, rapid growth in the social work workforce became the top priority in Shenzhen. Meanwhile, the trustworthiness of newly developing social organisations is another concern. All of these concerns underpinned the post-based design.

40|$|Title: <b>Purchasing</b> Process <b>of</b> Services: A Study <b>of</b> the <b>Purchasing</b> Process <b>of</b> HumanResource (HR) <b>services</b> Background: The rise in {{competition}} among organizations continues to increase. The rise in globalization, outsourcing and continuous pressure from customers {{have been the}} source for the increase {{in competition}}. Additionally, the instability in various industries is leading to high competition among firms. The <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>services</b> is vital to organizations. Contemporary organizations spend a huge portion of their resources on the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>services.</b> The proper <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>services</b> can lead to cost saving and competitive advantage for companies or organizations. Research Questions:  How can the various purchasing models be used to develop a process for professional HR service purchasing? What are the factors involved in developing a process for the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional HR <b>services</b> Purpose: The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis {{is to develop a}} purchasing process for the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional HR <b>services.</b> It takes into consideration the various classifications models <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> and the factors involved in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in order to develop a purchasing process for professional HR services. Method: Through a qualitative case study, the thesis gathered empirical data and used the deductive scientific approach to building a foundation of theory. Additionally, pattern matching was used to analyze both the theory and empirical data.

The discussion is theoretical, viewing outsourcing in its preconditions and effects as outcomes of economic,social,cultural and political factors and forces in society at large.

40|$|Abstract Contracting {{is one of}} {{the tools}} {{increasingly}} being used to enhance the performance of health systems in both developed and developing countries; it takes different forms and cannot be limited to the mere <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Actors adopt contracting to formalize all kinds of relations established between them. A typology for this approach will demonstrate its diversity and provide {{a better understanding of the}} various issues raised by contracting. In recent years the way health systems are organized has changed significantly. To remedy the under-performance of their health systems, most countries have undertaken reforms that have resulted in major institutional overhaul, including decentralization of health and administrative services, autonomy for public service providers, separation of funding bodies and service providers, expansion of health financing options and the development of the profit or nonprofit private sector. These institutional reshuffles lead not only to multiplication and diversification of the actors involved, but also to greater separation of the service provision and administrative functions. Health systems are becoming more complex and can no longer operate in isolation. Actors are gradually realizing that they need to forge relations. The simplest way to do that is through dialogue, although some prefer a more formal commitment. Interaction between actors may take various forms and be on different scales. There are several types of contractual relations: some are based on the nature of the contract (public or private), others on the parties involved and yet others on the scope of the contract. Here they are classified into three categories according to the object of the contract: delegation of responsibility, act of <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> or cooperation...|$|E

The largest effects were for personal care and homemaker services. These effects were substantially stronger under the financial control model of channeling, which included expanded funding for such services. There were also increases in home-delivered meals, transportation, and day-care services under the financial model but not under the basic model.
