40|$|The {{verification}} <b>of</b> cryptographic <b>protocols</b> {{has greatly}} improved these last years. Automated {{tools such as}} AVISPA provide real help in finding and characterizing attacks.

The verification tools of AVISPA are not designed to detect such specification errors.

The Region has started the creation of the territorial partnership called the Mid-Adriatic Metropolitan Area (Area Metropolitana Medio-Adriatica – AMMA). This experience of a new method for the management of the territory was implemented by the Research project, by identifying functional connective systems that confirm its unitary structure and the current and future potential, for the widespread systematic development of the Metropolitan Area as a whole. iv) Principal results and major conclusions. This experience, is today in Italy, an extraordinary case study generated from of local participatory development (Community-Led Local Development – CLLD); a integrated, bottom-up process with the involvement of local communities. The results of the applied research, conducted in the Middle-Adriatic Territory, made it possible to identify critical and original aspects in the organisation of the “variable geometry” system of relationships between Municipalities, in terms of participation in complex projects and the introduction <b>of</b> specific Territorial <b>Protocols</b> <b>of</b> <b>Understanding,</b> to Identify de facto cities with respect to the de jure and developmental cities of the FUAs in Marche region.

METHODS: Thirteen patients were evaluated at baseline and on the week 6 for best corrected visual acuity, optical coherence tomography central macular thickness and decibel loss on Macular threshold <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> the Humphrey visual field after 1. 25 mg intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. The outcomes were analyzed separately and in correlation using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: The improvement of the optical coherence tomography and the Macular threshold <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> the Humphrey visual field from baseline to week 6 were significant with p= 0. 032 and p= 0. 003, respectively. The visual acuity did not show a significant improvement.

40|$|Background: Advances in {{anesthesia}} {{and surgical}} techniques, {{along with an}} increase in managed care, have led to an increase in ambulatory surgeries. The post-anesthesia discharge criteria used for inpatient care may not be appropriate for ambulatory care patients Aim: This quality improvement project was aimed at examining whether or not the patient length of stay (LOS) in Phase I of post anesthesia care was appropriate. The global aim was to right-size post anesthesia care Phase I length of stay for adult upper extremity surgical patients. The first step was to assess the effectiveness of the PACU discharge criteria. The specific aim was to determine the effectiveness of the Aldrete scoring tool at this facility. Methods: After study approval from the hospital’s clinical inquiry committee, data from existing records of 60 adult upper-extremity surgical patients were used to compare LOS in Phase I of post-anesthesia care in relation to achieving a score of 8 - 10 on the Aldrete tool. A survey was given to PACU nurses to assess their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> discharge criteria. Results: An education seminar was conducted for PACU nurses as the survey revealed lack of knowledge of the hospital discharge <b>protocol</b> and lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the steps and purpose of Aldrete scoring. A comparison of ASPAN approved discharge tools was completed to ascertain if a change in discharge protocol was warranted. Conclusion: It is anticipated that a new scoring tool will be instituted as the discharge protocol for Phase I PACU. Using a standardized tool provides consistency of care, reduces errors,promotes efficient use of resources, meets Joint Commission requirements, and meets ASPAN recommended standards. Use of the scoring tool should be taught as part of orientation to the unit. Implications for CNL practice: The CNL will take charge of this policy change process...|$|R
