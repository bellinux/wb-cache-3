5000|$|<b>Palilalia</b> (from the Greek πάλιν (pálin) meaning [...] "again" [...] and λαλιά (laliá) meaning [...] "speech" [...] or [...] "to talk"), {{a complex}} tic, is a {{language}} disorder {{characterized by the}} involuntary repetition of syllables, words, or phrases. It has features resembling other complex tics such as echolalia or coprolalia, but, unlike other aphasias, <b>palilalia</b> is based upon contextually correct speech.|$|E

50|$|<b>Palilalia</b> is {{considered}} an aphasia, a disorder of language, and {{is not to be}} confused with speech disorders, as there is no difficulty in the formation of internal speech. <b>Palilalia</b> is similar to speech disorders such as stuttering or cluttering, as it tends to only express itself in spontaneous speech, such as answering basic questions, and not in automatic speech such as reading or singing; however, it distinctively affects words and phrases rather than syllables and sounds.|$|E
50|$|A 2007 {{case study}} by Van Borsel et al. {{examined}} the acoustic features in <b>palilalia.</b> AB, a 60-year-old male {{was diagnosed with}} idiopathic Parkinson's disease and had noticed changes in gait, posture, writing, and speech. Observation of his perceptual speech characteristics and Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment results suggested AB suffered from hypokinetic dysarthria with a marked <b>palilalia.</b> It was determined to start speech therapy with passive (metronome) and active (pacing boards) pacing techniques {{to reduce the number}} of palilalic repetitions. Unfortunately AB was not able to enunciate despite extensive training.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} that are noted during attacks include mutism, <b>palilalia,</b> eye blinking, lacrimation, pupil dilation, drooling, respiratory dyskinesia, increased blood pressure and heart rate, facial flushing, headache, vertigo, anxiety, agitation, compulsive thinking, paranoia, depression, recurrent fixed ideas, depersonalization, violence, and obscene language.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palilalia</b> must be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} complex tic disorders (such as echolalia), stuttering, and logoclonia. In contrast to stuttering or logoclonia, palilalic repetitions tend {{to consist of}} complete sections of words or phrases, are often repeated many times, and the speaker has no difficulty initiating speech.|$|E
50|$|Complex phonic tics include {{echolalia}} (repeating words just {{spoken by}} someone else), <b>palilalia</b> (repeating one's own previously spoken words), lexilalia (repeating words after reading them), and coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases).

50|$|<b>Palilalia</b> {{is defined}} as the {{repetition}} of the speaker's words or phrases, often for a varying number of repeats. Repeated units are generally whole sections of words and are larger than a syllable, with words being repeated the most often, followed by phrases, and then syllables or sounds. Palilalic repetitions are often spoken with decreasing volume and speed up over time.|$|E
5000|$|Klazomania (from the Greek κλάζω ("klazo")—to scream) {{refers to}} {{compulsive}} shouting; it has features resembling the complex tics such as echolalia, <b>palilalia</b> and coprolalia seen in tic disorders, {{but has been}} seen in people with encephalitis lethargica, alcohol abuse and carbon monoxide poisoning. It was first reported by L. Benedek in 1925 in a patient with postencephalitic parkinsonism. [...] Little {{is known about the}} condition, and few cases have been reported.|$|E

5000|$|Echolalia (also {{known as}} echologia or echophrasia) {{is defined as}} the {{unsolicited}} repetition of vocalizations made by another person (by the same person is called <b>palilalia).</b> In its profound form it is automatic and effortless. It is one of the echophenomena, closely related to echopraxia, the automatic repetition of movements made by another person; both are [...] "subsets of imitative behavior" [...] whereby sounds or actions are imitated [...] "without explicit awareness". [...] Echolalia may be an immediate reaction to a stimulus or may be delayed.|$|E
5000|$|Perseveration - Persistent {{repetition}} of words or ideas even when another person attempts {{to change the}} topic. e.g. [...] "It's {{great to be here}} in Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada." [...] This may also involve repeatedly giving the same answer to different questions. e.g. [...] "Is your name Mary?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Are you in the hospital?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Are you a table?" [...] "Yes." [...] Perseveration can include <b>palilalia</b> and logoclonia, and can be an indication of organic brain disease such as Parkinson's.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palilalia</b> {{has been}} theorized {{to occur in}} writing and sign language. A case study by Tyrone and Moll {{examined}} a 79-year-old right-handed deaf man named PSP who showed anomalies in his signing. PSP had learned British sign language (BSL) {{at the age of}} seven and had developed left-sided weakness and dysphagia at age 77. PSP showed involuntary movements and repetitions in his signing. Tyrone and Moll reported his movements were palilalic in nature, as entire signs were repeated and the repetitional movements became smaller and smaller in amplitude.|$|E

The wolf, here presented with <b>palilalia,</b> addresses the audience: [...] "You know? Now there's a pretty hungry little billy goat-goat-goat-goat-goat-goat." [...] Oblivious to Billy's limitless hunger, the wolf gives him a bottle of milk, but Billy spills the milk and eats the bottle, the pacifier, the cutlery and crockery (like a sandwich), the teapot (along with all the tea inside it), and the napkin.|$|E
50|$|Two of Benedek’s colleagues, E. Von Thurzó and T. Katona, {{recorded}} two further {{instances of}} klazomania in 1927. They expanded upon Benedek’s earlier observations, describing the angry flushed face of one patient, {{as well as}} extreme restlessness and agitation. They noted that afterwards the patient apologized for the incident, suggesting awareness of the behavior. From this, Thurzó and Katona proposed {{that there is no}} loss of consciousness during klazomania and that individuals may remain fully aware of their surroundings. One of the first instances in which an infectious disease was associated with klazomania was the notable pandemic of the encephalitis lethargica from 1916 to 1927. This pandemic also gave rise to observations of other tics that came to be associated with encephalitis lethargica such as complex vocalizations of blocking, echolalia, <b>palilalia,</b> and oculogyric crises.|$|E
50|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and <b>palilalia</b> (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.Speech assessment also contributes to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, loud and pressured speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.|$|E
50|$|Klazomania {{is similar}} to other complex tics {{including}} echolalia, <b>palilalia</b> and coprolalia. It is defined as compulsive shouting, which {{can be in the}} form of swearing, grunting or barking. The subject may appear flushed, and klazomania can occur with increasing frequency if the person is agitated. The duration of the incident depends on the individual, but it can be characterized by a peak period, followed by intermittent remissions of less intensity. Although the individual may sound like they are in pain, there {{does not appear to be}} any actual physical discomfort. The shouting can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as oculogyric crises or other involuntary movements. The presentation of klazomania has been compared to temporal lobe epilepsy, although the two can be distinguished by the duration of the attack and the fact that the patient experiencing klazomania appears to retain consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Analysis of AB's {{speech therapy}} showed that his repetitions lasted from 1 minute 33 seconds to 2 minutes 28 seconds, ranging from 1 to 32 repetitions on some words, and {{differed}} from trial to trial. Pauses were present between each repetition, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 seconds. Van Borsel et al. concluded that AB's palilalic repetitions followed no pattern: {{the duration of}} each repetition train did not decrease over time, the number of repetitions per train did not increase, and the duration of each individual word did not decrease in duration. Such results indicated not all palilalic repetitions show an increasing rate with decreasing volume, and defied the two distinct subtypes of <b>palilalia</b> as suggested by Sterling. Sterling's Type A, sometimes called palilalie spasmodique, is characterized by fast repetitions and decreasing volume, while Sterling's Type B, sometimes called palilalie atonique, is characterized by repetitions at a constant rate with interspersed periods of silence. AB showed neither a systematic increase (Sterling's Type A) or a constant duration (Sterling's Type B) and instead fell between the two.|$|E
40|$|<b>Palilalia,</b> {{the delayed}} {{repetition}} of words or phrases, occurs frequently among individuals with autism and developmental disabilities. The current study used a combined multiple baseline and reversal design {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of presenting tacts as corrections for <b>palilalia.</b> During baseline, five preschoolers with autism emitted high rates of <b>palilalia</b> and low rates of mands and tacts during play and instructional activities. During treatment, when experimenters presented opportunities to echoically tact actions and objects following the emission of <b>palilalia,</b> its frequency decreased to low and stable levels and mands and tacts increased. Functional relationships between the tact corrections and emissions of <b>palilalia,</b> mands, and tacts were established during reversals to baseline and treatment conditions. Similar trends in responding were found for frequency of <b>palilalia,</b> mands, and tacts in non-treatment settings...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and neuroradiological findings of three patients with marked <b>palilalia</b> due to different neurological disorders are reported.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{involuntary}} speech phenomena as for example <b>palilalia</b> {{have been described}} as consequences of neurological disorders. <b>Palilalia</b> is the involuntary repetition of syllabels, words and phrases in ongoing speech. We describe a 73 year old woman who suffered from a hypertensive thalamic haemorrhage. MRI revealed that the lesion was predominantly located within the pulvinar, extending to the lateroposterior thalamic nuclei and to the pretectal area with possible involvement of the medial geniculate body. Few months after the event she developed involuntary vocalisations with whole words and meaningless syllables being rapidly reiterated. In contrast to typical <b>palilalia</b> these vocalisations were not meaningfully related to the ongoing speech of the patient. In addition, the patient developed a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder with right-sided painful hemidystonia and bilateral clonic jerks and a right-sided postural tremor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPalilalia {{is a kind}} {{of motor}} {{perseveration}} involving speech, consisting in the continuous repetition of words or phrases, or both. Rarely it occurs in seizure disorders as ictal or post-ictal manifestation. We report a case of epileptic <b>palilalia</b> in a 71 -year-old patient with a previous history of intracerebral haemorrhage in the left frontal region, characterized by the continuous repetition of the same speech sequence for few minutes. EEG recordings during NREM sleep and wakefulness showed recurrent and prolonged focal subclinical epileptiform paroxysms in the left mesial frontal region. Our case confirms the role of the left frontal lobe, reliably of the supplementary motor area (SMA), as neuroanatomic origin of ictal <b>palilalia...</b>|$|E
