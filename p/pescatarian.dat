2500|$|Raised as a Christian, Tatchell {{says that}} he [...] "ditched [...] faith a long time ago" [...] and is an atheist. It is widely {{reported}} that Tatchell is a vegan; however, Tatchell himself only states that he eats no meat, but does eat eggs, cheese, and, according to Richard Fairbrass, wild salmon, meaning Tatchell {{is in fact a}} <b>pescatarian.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An ovo-lacto {{vegetarian}} (or lacto-ovo vegetarian) is {{a vegetarian}} {{who does not}} eat meat, but does consume some animal products such as eggs and dairy. Unlike <b>pescatarians,</b> they do not consume fish or other seafood. A typical ovo-lacto vegetarian diet can include fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, milk, cheese, yogurt, kefir, and eggs.|$|R
5000|$|However, pescetarians eat {{fish and}} other seafood, but not mammals and birds. The Merriam-Webster {{dictionary}} dates {{the origin of the}} term pescetarian to 1993 and defines it to mean: [...] "one whose diet includes fish but no other meat." [...] <b>Pescatarians</b> may consume fish based solely upon the idea that the fish are not factory farmed as land animals are (i.e., their problem is with the capitalist-industrial production of meat, not with the consumption of animal foods themselves). Some eat fish with the justification that fish have less sophisticated nervous systems than land-dwelling animals. Others may choose to consume only wild fish based upon the lack of confinement, while choosing to not consume fish that have been farmed.|$|R
2500|$|Studies on {{the health}} effects of {{vegetarian}} diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. [...] An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, <b>pescatarians,</b> and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.|$|R

50|$|In most {{towns and}} cities, {{traditional}} Buddhist vegetarian fare, without any meat or seafood products {{of any kind}} and also excluding certain strong tasting vegetables and spices, is sold at specialized vegetarian restaurants which can be recognized by a yellow sign with in Thai script the word che (เจ) or ahan che (อาหารเจ) written on it in red. These restaurants serve what {{can be regarded as}} vegan food. Many Indian restaurants of the sizable Thai-Indian community will also have vegetarian dishes on offer, {{due to the fact that}} vegetarianism is held as an ideal by many followers of the Hindu faith. Indian vegetarian cuisine can incorporate dairy products and honey. Due to the increased demand for vegetarian food from foreign tourists, many hotels, guesthouses and restaurants that cater to them, will now also have vegetarian versions of Thai dishes on their menu. <b>Pescatarians</b> would have very few problems with Thai cuisine due to the abundance of Thai dishes which only contain fish and seafood as their source of animal protein.|$|R

After eating the pupils spend fives minutes thanking someone, followed by two claps {{from the rest of}} the school. By teaching gratitude, the school believes it is teaching kindness and happiness.|$|E
