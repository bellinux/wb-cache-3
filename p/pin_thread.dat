40|$|In {{friction}} stir welding (FSW), {{a rotating}} pin is translated along a weld seam so as to stir {{the sides of the}} seam together. Metal is prevented from flowing up the pin, which would result in plowing/cutting instead of welding, by a shoulder on the pin. In conventional FSW, the weld metal rests on an "anvil", which supports the heavy "plunge" load on the tool. In this study, both embedded tungsten wires along and copper plating on the faying surfaces were used to trace the flow of AA 2219 weld metal around the C-FSW tool. The effect of tool rotational speed, travel speed, plunge load, and <b>pin</b> <b>thread</b> pitch on the resulting weld metal flow was evaluated. Plan, longitudinal, and transverse section x-ray radiographs were examined to trace the metal flow paths. The results are interpreted in terms of a kinematic theory of metal flow in FSW...|$|E
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} are responsible assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and threaded connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods threaded connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in <b>pin</b> <b>thread</b> becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|E

50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together.

The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as <b>pins,</b> <b>thread</b> plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved.

40|$|Abstract- Friction S t i r welding (FSW) is an e n e r g y efficient, {{environment}} friendly, {{and versatile}} technique used to join high-strength aerospace aluminum alloys and other metallic alloys {{that are hard}} to weld by conventional fusion welding. More than a decade, FSW is considered to be the most noteworthy development in metal joining a r e a a n d was developed for micro structural modification of metallic materials. Material flow during friction stir welding is very complex and can be understood with very critical investigation only. Most of studies in literature used <b>threaded</b> <b>pins</b> since most industrial applications currently use <b>threaded</b> <b>pins.</b> However, initially <b>threaded</b> tools may become unthreaded because of the tool wear when used for high melting point alloys or reinforced aluminum alloys. Material flow with unthreaded pin was found to have the same features as material flow using classical <b>threaded</b> <b>pins.</b> The material flow is also influenced by the process parameters that directly influence the micro structural refinement. In the present article, the current state of understanding and development of the FSW with emphasis on material flow behaviour with various modeling techniques and the influence of process parameters like tool rotation and traverse speeds, tool tilt and plunge depth etc on t h e resultant microstructure are critically reviewed...|$|R

We made extensive performance evaluation on three different multi-core machines reflecting three usual utilisation: workstation machine, server machine and high performance machine. In overall, we show that fixing thread affinities (whatever the tested strategy) is a better choice for improving program performance on HPC ccNUMA machines compared to OS-based thread placement. This means that the current Linux OS scheduling strategy is not necessarily the best choice in terms of performance on ccNUMA machines, even if it is a good choice in terms of cores usage ratio and work balancing. On smaller Core 2 and Nehalem machines, we show that the benefit of <b>thread</b> <b>pinning</b> is not satisfactory in terms of speedups versus OS-based scheduling, but the performance stability is much better...|$|R

40|$|Osteotomy is {{used for}} {{correction}} of the altered load on the gonarthrotic knee joint. It can be performed above or below the knee. Clinical results depend on the correction after bone healing. By tibial closed wedge osteotomy (HTO), the deformity is corrected peroperatively in contrast to tibial hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO) where the correction is performed after surgery. Comparing the two methods, the precision was better after HCO but the clinical results were similar at follow-up. After one year, the radiographic alignment of the leg was better after HCO, as was {{the stability of the}} osteotomy measured by RSA. In 308 operations, the most common complication after HCO was minor pin-tract infection. It was registered in 157 cases.

Hydroxyapatite-coating (HA) of the <b>pin</b> <b>threads</b> increased the fixation.

The peaks and valleys of <b>threaded</b> <b>pin</b> profile offer more friction over the plasticized material which promotes sticking condition. Thus, the extent of heat generation and plasticization is sufficient to attain the balance state of heat and material flow.
