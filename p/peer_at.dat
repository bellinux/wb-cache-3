5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren stood next to President Obama as the {{president}} made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects editor Marc Varisco, who had {{previously}} collaborated with director Scott on the 2005 film Domino, worked again with Scott to develop Déjà Vu into a fully-fledged work. In total, approximately 400 visual effects scenes were shot during the production of Déjà Vu. They had acquired a LIDAR device, which incorporated lasers to scatter light {{with the intent of}} mapping out a small region, during the production of Domino; Scott and Varisco decided to use the apparatus again during the production of Déjà Vu. Additionally, the two utilized the Panavision Genesis high definition camera to film the shots that would encompass the past that the Snow White team would <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> throughout the film, as well as the various night scenes. The LIDAR apparatus, which was operated by a hired Texan company devoted to the device, performed scans of Claire Kuchever's apartment, the ferry, the ATF office, and actress Paula Patton, among others. Effects editor Zachary Tucker combined the elements created by the Texan LIDAR company with computer-generated graphics to make possible the scenes of time-travel experienced in the film.|$|E
500|$|Berman recounts a {{story that}} during the Civil War, Benjamin was called to the Torah at Beth Ahabah synagogue in Richmond. [...] However, {{there is no proof}} of this, nor does Benjamin's name appear in any {{surviving}} record of the Jews of that city. [...] "But whether or not Benjamin practiced Judaism overtly or contributed to Jewish causes, to the Jews of the South, he was a symbol of a coreligionist who was a man among men". According to Evans, [...] "Benjamin survives, as he willed it: a shadowy figure in Civil War history". Kahn noted that Benjamin [...] "is epitomized as a foremost orator, lawyer, and statesman, without a <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> the bars of two of the world's greatest nations". Meade questioned whether Benjamin's character can ever be fully understood: ...|$|E

This was an arrangement with one of the <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> the time (information needed) who <b>peered</b> <b>at</b> more than one Australian peering fabric. Similar arrangements were formalised in the eastern states with the formation of AusBone.|$|R

'So it was positive. I felt relieved.'” The exhibition traveled to 13 museums in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Korea from 2000 through 2003.

2500|$|Hume {{was accused}} of 'hushing up' a {{suspected}} sexual abuse scandal at Ampleforth College by not calling in the police when he received a complaint from parents in 1975 about Father Piers Grant-Ferris, {{the son of a}} Tory <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> Gilling Castle, formerly a prep school for Ampleforth. In 2005, Grant-Ferris admitted 20 incidents of child abuse. This was not an isolated incident and involved other monks and lay members. The Yorkshire Post reported in 2005; [...] "Pupils at a leading Roman Catholic school suffered decades of abuse from at least six paedophiles following a decision by former Abbot Basil Hume not to call in police {{at the beginning of the}} scandal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vishniac's {{photographs}} from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished. His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: [...] "There is barely {{a hint of a}} smile on any of the faces. The eyes <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners." [...] Gene Thornton, writer for The New York Times, called them [...] "somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter".|$|E

"It is us, the {{professional}} artists of flamenco, {{who have to}} make cante flamenco, and nobody else, Flamenco, like any other art, is an art of professionals, {{although there are many}} people who <b>peer</b> <b>at</b> us, with a look as if to say: What interesting little creatures! or maybe: Oh! What music the people are playing! and so on. And people often think that maybe you have to have fingers swollen from picking potatoes to be able to play the guitar with feeling. Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E
