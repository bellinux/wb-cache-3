500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous <b>property</b> <b>man</b> said to me: 'It'll be just like the real thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{technical}} director, Siedle was {{in charge}} of fifty stage carpenters, twenty <b>property</b> <b>men,</b> thirty electricians, five engineers, sixty wardrobe women.

50|$|Veblen {{understood}} man as {{a creature}} with a strong instinct to emulate others to survive. As social status is in many cases at least partially based on or represented by one's <b>property,</b> <b>men</b> tend to try and match their acquisitions {{with those who are}} higher in a social hierarchy. In terms of taste and modern consumption this means that taste forms in a process of emulation: people emulate each other, which creates certain habits and preferences, which in turn contributes to consumption of certain preferred goods.|$|R

60|$|So, {{instead of}} bemoaning the {{position}} of the playwright, it were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards restoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not allowing him to be built over by the <b>property</b> <b>man,</b> or hammered to death by the carpenter. I have never seen any reason myself why such artists as Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled to become Academicians. They have certainly as good a claim as have many of those R.A.'s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a shilling.|$|E

If this advantage could be added to his character it would be one of a more agreeable nature than it is, and his forlorn position would be greatly improved. His duty is to call every half year at the bankers', when he signs his name in a large greasy inconvenient book, to certain documents of which he knows nothing, and then he delivers it to the <b>property</b> <b>man</b> and exits anywhere.|$|E

60|$|Within this scheme, {{which makes}} the State {{the source of all}} energy, and the final legatee, what will be the nature of the <b>property</b> a <b>man</b> may own? Under modern conditions--indeed, under any conditions--a man without some {{negotiable}} <b>property</b> is a <b>man</b> without freedom, and the extent of his property is very largely the measure of his freedom. Without any property, without even shelter or food, a man {{has no choice but to}} set about getting these things; he is in servitude to his needs until he has secured property to satisfy them. But with a certain small <b>property</b> a <b>man</b> is free to do many things, to take a fortnight's holiday when he chooses, for example, and to try this new departure from his work or that; with so much more, he may take a year of freedom and go to the ends of the earth; with so much more, he may obtain elaborate apparatus and try curious novelties, build himself houses and make gardens, establish businesses and make experiments at large. Very speedily, under terrestrial conditions, the <b>property</b> of a <b>man</b> may reach such proportions that his freedom oppresses the freedom of others. Here, again, is a quantitative question, an adjustment of conflicting freedoms, a quantitative question that too many people insist on making a qualitative one.|$|R

5000|$|Wellman {{hated being}} an actor, {{thinking}} it an [...] "unmanly" [...] profession, and was miserable watching himself on screen while learning the craft. He soon switched to {{working behind the}} camera, aiming to be a director, and progressed up the line as [...] "a messenger boy, as an assistant cutter, an assistant <b>property</b> <b>man,</b> a <b>property</b> <b>man,</b> an assistant director, second unit director and eventually... director." [...] His first assignment as an assistant director for Bernie Durning provided him with a work ethic that he adopted for future film work. One strict rule that Durning enforced was no fraternization with screen femme fatales, which almost immediately Wellman broke, leading to a confrontation and a thrashing from the director. Despite his transgression, both men became lifelong friends, and Wellman steadily progressed to more difficult first unit assignments.|$|E
