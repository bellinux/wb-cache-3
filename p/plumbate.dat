5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming <b>plumbate</b> anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Temple 3 (also {{known as}} Structure 3) is a pyramid-temple {{located on the}} east side of Plaza A, {{opposite}} Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building. The stairway climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform. In front of the stairway, at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform. A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple. One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in a standing position. They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax. The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche. Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays. Fragments of an Early Postclassic <b>plumbate</b> ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself. There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from Zaculeu, a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance. A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3. Two low platforms stand in front of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.|$|E

25|$|Lead is a {{soft metal}} (MH 1.5, but hardens close to melting) which, in many cases, {{is unable to}} support its own weight. It has a {{close-packed}} structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that {{has been attributed to}} partial ionisation of the lead atoms.

40|$|In this {{critical}} review {{we consider the}} large literature that has accumulated in the past 5 - 10 years concerning solution-mediated crystallisation of complex oxide materials using hydrothermal, or more generally solvothermal, reaction conditions. The aim is {{to show how the}} synthesis of dense, mixed-metal oxide materials, usually prepared using the high temperatures associated with solid-chemistry, is perfectly feasible from solution in one step reactions, typically at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C, and that important families of oxide materials have now been reported to crystallise using such synthetic approaches. We will focus on two common structures seen in oxide chemistry, ABO(3) perovskites and A(2) B(2) O(6) O' pyrochlores, and include a systematic survey of the variety of chemical elements now included in these two prototypical structure types, from transition metals, in families of materials that include titanates, niobates, manganites and ferrites, to main-group elements in stannates, <b>plumbates</b> and bismuthates. The significant advantages of solution-mediated crystallisation are well illustrated by the recent literature: examples are provided of elegant control of crystal form from the nanometre to the micron length scale to give thin films, anisotropic crystal morphologies, or hierarchical structures of materials with properties desirable for many important contemporary applications. In addition, new metastable materials have been reported, not stable once high temperatures and pressures are applied and hence not amenable using conventional synthesis. We critically discuss the possible control offered by solvothermal synthesis from crystal chemistry to crystal form and how the discovery of new materials may be achieved. Computer simulation, combinatorial synthesis approaches and in situ methods to follow crystallisation will be vital in providing the predictability in synthesis that is needed for rational design of new materials (232 references). ...|$|R

Metallic oxides with a perovskite structure form a large family that displays {{a wide variety of}} properties such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity and catalysis. Barium <b>plumbates</b> have been studied extensively in recent years because of such interesting properties. BaPbO₃ is known to exhibit room temperature metallic conductivity, due to an overlap (2 eV) of the O 2 p nonbonding band with the Pb-O spσ antibonding band at the Fermi level. Another phase in the Ba-Pb-O system, Ba₂PbO₄, is known to adopt the K₂NiF₄ structure and behaves as a large-gap semiconductor (valence bands are separated by a 1. 7 eV semiconductor gap). The compounds BaPbO₃ and Ba₂PbO₄ have been prepared with a view to evaluating them as fuel cell materials, in terms of compatibility with common electrolytes such as YSZ and CGO, stability under fuel cell operating conditions, and overall performance. The effect of substituting Y and Sc in the structures has also been studied using a combination of XRD and A. C. impedance spectroscopy. 	It was found that BaPbO₃ offers good performance compared with La₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂MnO₃-x (LSM) and La₀. ₆Ca₀. ₄MnO₃-x (LCM) in the lower temperature region for SOFC operation (700 – 800 K), giving an activation energy of 0. 93 eV. The introduction of Y to the BaPbO₃ structure reduced performance. 	Electrode/electrolyte compatibility studies revealed BaPbO₃ and YSZ or CGO to be unstable to 800 °C – the formation of cerate or zirconate phases was observed. No reaction was observed at 700 °C. Therefore CGO was considered as an electrolyte for use with BaPbO₃ since CGO offers good performance at temperatures where the electrode is stable. 	In order to avoid high sintering temperatures for electrode adhesion, BaPbO₃ precursors were impregnated into porous CGO, before firing at 700 °C, thus creating a composite cathode...|$|R

Two types of compounds are formed in these reactions: MEl 2 (OtBU) 6 [El = Ge, M = Mg (1 A), Cr (1 B), Mn (1 C), Zn (1 F); El = Pb, M Mn (3 C), M = Zn (3 F) ] and M 2 El 2 (OtBu) 8 [El = Ge, M = Co (1 d), Ni (1 e); El = Sn, M = Mg (2 a), Cr (2 b), Mn (2 c), Co (2 d), Ni (2 e); El = Pb, M = Co (3 d) ]. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies have been performed on 1 C, 1 d, 2 a, 2 b, 2 c, 2 d, and 2 e, and the structures have been solved. In 1 C the Mn atom occupies {{the center of an}} elongated O 6 octahedron, the germanium(II) atoms displaying pyramidal coordination by three oxygen atoms. The central molecular cage can be described as two MnO 3 Ge trigonal bipyramids sharing the common central Mn atom and being wrapped by tert-butyl groups linked to the oxygen atoms. The other compounds of the MEl 2 (OtBU) 6 formula seem to be isostructural with the exception of 3 F, which displays a H- 1 -NMR spectrum which is not compatible with this structure. All X-ray structures of the compounds M 2 El 2 (OtBu) 8 show the same feature: to a central M 2 (OtBU) 2 four-membered ring are spirocyclically connected two M(OtBu) 2 El rings through the common metal atoms M.

From susceptibility measurements it is apparent, that in the compounds MEl 2 (OtBu) 6 and M 2 El 2 (OtBu) 8 the transition metal atoms are in high-spin configurations, which is also supported by the UV spectra.

50|$|At that time, Tula was {{a fertile}} region near {{obsidian}} mines {{and on an}} important trade route. Its economic base was agriculture and the mining and crafting of obsidian.

Tula probably did not rule an empire but may have ruled a regional state. Long range contacts are indicated by the appearance of ceramics from eastern Mesoamerica, grey-green <b>plumbate</b> from southern Guatemala and polychrome ceramics from Costa Rica. Tula probably traded obsidian in return. The socioeconomics of Tula society is thought to have consisted of a ruling elite class, a craftsmen class, a merchant class and a large number of farm workers. Most of the farm workers were outside Tula proper with most of the other classes in the city. Excavations in the area have found evidence of the cultivation of chili peppers, amaranth, squash and maguey along with corn and beans. A number of wild plants were harvested including mesquite beans and cactus fruit. There is evidence of domesticated turkey and dog. Irrigated corn was the most important crop with anywhere from 3000 to 10000 hectares cultivated. It may not have been enough to feed the large population.
