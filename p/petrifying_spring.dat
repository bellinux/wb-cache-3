40|$|This report {{contains}} baseline {{information for}} Article 17 reporting in Wales for the Annex 1 habitat H 7220 Petrifying springs with tufa formation (Cratoneurion). Natural Resources Wales selected {{a total of}} 14 sites, across Wales for inclusion within the study. Only one site, Nant Peris, {{is part of a}} designated SAC (Eryri SAC) where petrifying springs are a notifiable feature and as such they had benefited from prior study (see Creer, 2012). The remaining sites included within this survey were associated with a mixture of designated and undesignated sites for which there was little to no baseline information on the <b>petrifying</b> <b>spring</b> habitats. A methodology was devised and applied where possible at each site, involving an ecologist (Jonathan Graham) and a hydrogeologist (Gareth Farr) working together. It was important that both the hydrological and ecological surveys were undertaken simultaneously in order to make important linkages between hydrological supporting condition, the occurrence of species and condition of the site. Each survey started with a ‘site walkover’ to allow familiarisation with the site and to help form initial conceptual ideas. Following this a vegetation survey and collection of species for detailed identification for both bryophytes, lichens and flowering plants was undertaken, using the DAFOR scale. A total of 130 species were recorded including 77 flowering plants, 46 bryophytes, one club moss, two ferns, 3 horsetails, 2 blue green algae and one charophyte. Detailed maps were drawn for key sites within this study. Elevation data shows that Palustriella falcata occurs over a smaller range within an upland setting and Palustriella commutata occurs over a wider range in a primarily (but not exclusively) lowland setting. In situ water quality readings and lab analysed samples were collected proving the sites were dominantly Calcium Bicarbonate type waters, however some sites such as Nant Peris were much less calcareous, with the majority of sites having very low levels of nutrients. Vegetation transects accompanied by field readings of water quality were undertaken whenever possible showing that there can be dramatic changes in pH over very small distances (< 1 m). An assessment was made of the immediate catchment, with the aim of identifying any hydrological threats or pressures to the habitats. Two broad group are proposed for this habitat in Wales Group 1 : mainly upland or open hills and dominated by Palustriella falcata, it is species rich and has a greater number of associated flowering plant species. Group 2 : mainly lowland and dominated by Palustriella commutata, it is species poor and associated more with partially shaded (i. e not open) sites. Each group is further divided into two subgroups ‘ Group A and Group B’. Palustriella dominated springs occurred across a range of geologies (not all Carboniferous Limestone) and also associated with a mixture of bedrock, superficial and made ground. Importantly active or historic tufa deposition was not observed at all sites. Visual estimates of flow varied but were frequently low and diffuse. Condition assessments suggest that all of the sites included within this study should be considered as being in both favourable ecological and hydrogeological condition...|$|E

50|$|Calcareous sinter is {{also called}} tufa, {{calcareous}} tufa, or calc-tufa. It is a deposit of calcium carbonate, as with travertine.

The precipitation is assisted with mosses and other vegetable structures, thus leaving cavities in the calcareous sinter after they have decayed.|$|R
40|$|Most bryologists are {{familiar}} with <b>petrifying</b> or ‘tufa’ <b>springs</b> as they are a habitat where bryophytes often predominate. In Britain, these springs and seepages are often associated with the pleurocarpous moss Palustriella commutata. The importance of <b>petrifying</b> <b>springs</b> in Europe is further highlighted by their inclusion within the EC Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /EEC) as the Annex 1 habitat: H 7220 <b>Petrifying</b> <b>springs</b> with tufa formation (Cratoneurion). The authors were commissioned by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to survey a range of Welsh sites; {{the aim was to}} provide a baseline dataset for the habitat, whilst also fulfilling the EC Habitat Directive’s requirement to record the condition of this Annex 1 habitat (see Farr et al., 2014). Twenty seven sites at fifteen locations were surveyed during November 2013 and January 2014, a wet but not exceptionally cold Welsh winter. The sites ranged from natural locations such as the vertical cliff seepage faces on the Anglesey coastline (Fig. 1) to those highly influenced by historic anthropogenic activities. An example of the later was a site associated with highly calcareous, hyperalkaline (>pH 12) waters leaching from the base of spoil heaps at Herbert’s Quarry, Mynydd Du (The Black Mountain) (Fig. 2). From the outset, the project aimed to combine both botanical and hydrogeological investigations of the sites including: species-richness, water chemistry, water supply mechanisms, geological setting and identification of land use pressures...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} ecological factors affecting species distribution and travertine deposition in an Italian {{site of the}} ‘‘Natura 2000 ’’ network. Vegetation plots were located along four streams in a prealpine valley (Valganna, Lombardy, Northern Italy). Five meso-scale variables (e. g. altitude, aspect and slope) and ten microscale variables (e. g. shading, plot position and soil accumulation) were recorded for each plot; in addition, travertine deposition was evaluated. The main floristic gradients extracted by DCA were related to topography, vegetation type and water availability. The occurrence of species groups in relation to environmental variables was analysed using Poisson regression. Amongst 15 environmental variables and six species, the variables showing the greatest relationship to travertine deposition were {{the length of the}} waterless period and substrate slope. Photosynthetic organisms had a minor role in travertine formation, mostly restricted to substrates with a shallow slope.

50|$|Triangolo lariano is {{also the}} name of a Special Protection Area (593 hectares) {{protected}} by European laws, located in the Corni di Canzo (Horns of Canzo). Its protection concerns 84 precious bird species (including the honey buzzard, the peregrine falcon, the rock partridge, the eagle owl, the nightjar, the tawny pipit, the red-backed shrike, and the ortolan bunting) and the habitats, e.g. the natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates (Festuco-Brometalia) - with significant blossoming of orchids -, the limestone pavements and the <b>petrifying</b> <b>springs</b> with tufa formation (Cratoneurion), and the calcareous beech forests of Central Europe Cephalanthero-Fagion. Inside is another nature reserve, the Site of Community Importance “Sasso Malascarpa” (328 hectares), with 52 protected species, among which are the greater horseshoe bat, various kinds of backed shrike, and the rare white-clawed crayfish. A peculiar habitat of the reserve consists in the stone springs with travertine formation. The alternation of woods, meadows-pastures, and rock formations in the mountains of Canzo, makes the landscape particularly popular for tourism.|$|R

We believe that applied-ecology studies during the whole period covered by these meetings clearly show that monitoring and assessment makes sense only if these are embedded within a broader process of management. In this paper, we will first provide a brief overview of phytobenthos methods in Europe. Then, we will turn toward the 'dark side' of phytobenthos and describe four particular problems for phytobenthos assessment in the European Union: (1) reliance on a single group of algae (mostly diatoms) to the exclusion of other groups; (2) relatively low adoption of benthic algae for ecological assessments in lakes; (3) absence of measures of abundances; (4) the approaches used to define boundaries between ecological classes. Lastly, we describe three general challenges of phytobenthos assessment: use of phytobenthos as a diagnostic and communication tool and linking phytobenthos assessment to the provision of ecosystem services.

It has been my fate to see great educational funds fossilise into mere bricks and mortar, in the <b>petrifying</b> <b>springs</b> of architecture, with nothing left to work the institution they were intended to support. A great warrior is said to have made a desert and called it peace. Administrators of educational funds have sometimes made a palace and called it a university. If I may venture to give advice in a matter which lies out of my proper competency, I would say that whenever you do build, get an honest bricklayer, and make him build you just such rooms as you really want, leaving ample space for expansion. And a century hence, when the Baltimore and Ohio shares are at one thousand premium, and you have endowed all the professors you need, and built all the laboratories that are wanted, and have the best museum and the finest library that can be imagined; then, if you have a few hundred thousand dollars you don't know what to do with, send for an architect and tell him to put up a façade. If American is similar to English experience, any other course will probably lead you into having some stately structure, good for your architect's fame, but not in the least what you want.|$|R

Following this, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of current phytobenthos assessment methods against 12 criteria for method evaluation addressing four areas: ecological rationale, performance, feasibility of implementation, and use in communication and management. Using these criteria, we identify and discuss three general challenges for those developing new methods for phytobenthos-based assessment: a weak ecological rationale and insufficient consideration of the role of phytobenthos as a diagnostic tool and for communicating ecosystem health beyond a narrow group of specialists.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{modelling}} species’ distribution and habitat suitability has greatly improved {{as a result of}} new powerful statistics and GIS tools which can use a wide number of ecological variables. Species distribution models represent an important technique for the conservation of biodiversity and for town-and-country planning (Guisan & Zimmermann, 2000). Rare and threatened plant species, particularly the ones with known scattered distribution, can be of highest interest in modelling to assess conservation priorities and evaluate habitat suitability. Pinguicula crystallina Sibth. & Sm. subsp. hirtiflora (Ten.) Strid (Lentibulariaceae) is a carnivorous plant which has sticky leaves used as flypaper-type traps and grows on dripping carbonate or serpentine rocks primarily in mountain ecosystems such as wet cliffs inside ravines which can be mainly ascribed to Natura 2000 priority habitat 7220, which is <b>petrifying</b> <b>springs</b> with tufa formation (Cratoneurion W. Koch). Current distribution of this taxon is in South-Eastern Europe (mainly Albania and Greece), with only few populations living in Southern Italy (Campania and Calabria) (Innangi et al. 2011). Many studies about karyology (Casper & Stimper, 2009) and molecular data (Degtjareva et al., 2006), suggest that P. crystallina subsp. hirtiflora along with P. crystallina could be the sister group of all the other species in the genus Pinguicula, which comprises 74 species distributed in the Northern hemisphere, South America and South-Eastern Asia. In Campania, where the vast majority of Italian populations are found, according to IUCN the plant has been assessed as Vulnerable (VU). Within this region, the plant is known to grow only in ravines and river gorges of two mountain systems, namely Monti Lattari and Monti Picentini (Innangi et al., 2011). For this region, an expert-based habitat suitability model has been developed in order to look for unknown locations and/or plan possible repopulation strategies. Expert-based models, although introducing a subjective component in their development, can take into account a wide range of ecological needs for a taxon and their results are extremely synthetic (Boitani et al., 2002). According to the ecological features of known presence points of in Campania (Innangi et al., 2011), a set of five variables has been chosen, namely altitude, slope, rock type, CORINE land cover, and distance from rivers. For each variable, four scores have been assigned, that is zero for no suitability to three for best suitability. The results highlight the strict connection of this plant to water streams and courses, thus, in order to correlate chemical and biological features of the water to the habitat suitability for P. crystallina subsp. hirtiflora, water has been sampled in both presence and not-presence locations for chemical analysis, namely chromatography and toxicity tests, using bioassay organisms such as Daphnia magna Straus, Sorghum saccharatum Pers., and Lepidium sativum L. (APAT, 2002). Acknowledgements. The authors are grateful to Prof. M. Guida and M. Trifuoggi for the toxicity tests and chemical analyses...|$|R
