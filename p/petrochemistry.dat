50|$|His {{research}} group, {{based at}} the Institut Lavoisier of the University of Versailles where Ferey is a professor, is formed by a few young researchers and is assisted by researchers and engineers from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

This field of research is becoming increasingly relevant due {{to the importance of}} these materials in hydrogen and CO2 storage {{as well as in the}} production of electrode materials because of their combination of inorganic (metal ions) and organic components (mostly stiff organic molecules that make up 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional porous structures).|$|E
50|$|In 1923, {{he entered}} the higher {{pedagogical}} institute of Baku. In 1926, after successful graduation from the institute he taught at secondary school for 3 years. In 1929, he became a second-year student of chemistry faculty of MSU, from which he graduated in 1932. He was the student of N.D.Zelinsky and A.A.Balandin {{and one of the}} first seniors of the laboratory of organic chemistry of chemistry faculty’s organic chemistry cathedra with “organocatalysis” speciality. On the termination of MSU he worked in Moscow at the chemical plant №1, and then was transferred to Azerbaijan, where he managed the Cathedra of organic chemistry of the agricultural college of Azerbaijan at first. Then he worked (1933-1945) at the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Oil, where he became the manager of laboratory. Perfect talent of the young scientist was discovered there. His work was dedicated to scientific problems of <b>petrochemistry</b> and organocatalysis and was closely connected with the development of domestic oil-refining and petrochemical industry. Some developments assumed as the basis of new industrial processes.|$|E
50|$|Refining is the {{processing}} of one complex mixture of hydrocarbons {{into a number of}} other complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. Refining is where the job of oil industry stops and that of petrochemical industry starts. The raw materials used in the <b>petrochemistry</b> industry are known as feedstocks. These are obtained from the refinery:naphtha, components of natural gas such as butane, and some of the by-products of oil refining processes, such as ethane and propane. These feedstocks then undergo processing through an operation called cracking.Cracking is defined as the process of breaking down heavy oil molecules into lighter, more valuable fractions. There are two kinds: steam cracking and catalytic cracking. In steam cracking, high temperatures are used. Catalytic cracking is when a catalyst is being used. The plant where these operations are conducted is called a 'cracker'.Once these operations complete, new products are obtained that serve as building blocks of the petrochemical industry: olefins, i.e., mainly ethylene, propylene, and the so-called C4 derivatives, including butadiene—and aromatics, so called because of their distinctive perfumed smell, i.e., mainly benzene, toluene and the xylenes.|$|E
