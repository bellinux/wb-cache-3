50|$|Many {{printers}} supported ASA {{carriage control}} characters which provided a limited {{degree of control}} over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a <b>paper</b> <b>carriage</b> control tape loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the [...] "Type Writer" [...] had two flaws that made the product susceptible to jams.Firstly, characters were mounted on metal arms or typebars, which would clash and jam if neighboring arms were pressed {{at the same time}} or in rapid succession. Secondly, its printing point was located beneath the <b>paper</b> <b>carriage,</b> invisible to the operator, a so-called [...] "up-stroke" [...] design. Consequently, jams were especially serious, because the typist could only discover the mishap by raising the carriage to inspect what had been typed. The solution was to place commonly used letter-pairs (like [...] "th" [...] or [...] "st") so that their typebars were not neighboring, avoiding jams.|$|E

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, Hamilton had {{developed}} as a significant manufacturing city. Its early products were often machines and equipment used to process the region’s farm produce, such as steam engines, hay cutters, reapers and threshers. Other production included machine tools, house hardware, saws for mills, paper, <b>paper</b> making machinery, <b>carriages,</b> guns, whiskey, beer, woolen goods, and myriad and diverse output made from metal, grain, and cloth.|$|R

50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper punch tape to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a carriage control tape and was mounted on the printer. The length of the carriage control tape had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of <b>paper.</b> The looped <b>carriage</b> tape was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{quest for}} low cost {{precision}} machinery benefits developing nations and can open new markets. The principles of elastic averaging can fulfill {{the need for}} low cost precision machinery while maintaining a large degree of accuracy and repeatability. In this <b>paper,</b> a linear <b>carriage</b> was constructed, built, and tested using readily available industrial construction supplies. Elastic averaging was achieved by two hex nuts preloaded via flexures on a threaded rod. The prototype maintained accuracy and repeatability to better than 25 microns in the carriage’s six degrees of freedom. These {{results are consistent with}} the postulations of a kinematic error model performed on the carriage design and suggest a wide variety of applications for the concept...|$|R
50|$|The LA30 was {{followed}} in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming {{for a time}} the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar fanfold <b>paper.</b> The <b>carriage</b> was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an optical encoder / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were buffered for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60 character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30 character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36 quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.|$|R
50|$|An integraph {{consists}} of a rectangular carriage which moves left to right on rollers, two sides of which run parallel to the x axis on the Cartesian plane. The other two sides are parallel to the y axis. Along the trailing vertical (y axis) rail, slides a smaller carriage holding a tracing point. Along the leading vertical rail slides a second smaller carriage to which is affixed a small, sharp disc, which rests and rolls (but does not slide) on the graphing paper. It will not rotate about its point of contact with the <b>paper.</b> The trailing <b>carriage</b> is connected both with {{a point in the}} center of the carriage and the disc on the leading rail by a system of sliding crossheads and wires, such that the tracing point must follow the disc's tangential path.|$|R
6000|$|He made {{a cruise}} round the islands. His visit shook {{him a good}} deal with respect {{to two of the}} points--Corfu and Ithaca--on which it has been {{customary}} to dwell as proving Homer's precise local knowledge. The rain poured in torrents for most of the time, but it cleared up for a space to reveal the loveliness of Ithaca. In the island of Ulysses and Penelope he danced at a ball given in his honour. In Cephalonia he was received by a tumultuous mob of a thousand persons, whom neither the drenching rains nor the unexpected manner of his approach across the hills could baffle. They greeted him with incessant cries for union with Greece, thrust disaffected <b>papers</b> into his <b>carriage,</b> and here and there indulged in cries of [Greek: katô ê prostasia], down with the protectorate, down with the tyranny of fifty years. This exceptional disrespect he ascribed to what he leniently called the history of Cephalonia, meaning the savage dose of martial law nine years before. He justly took it for a marked symbol of the state of excitement at which under various influences the popular mind had arrived. Age and infirmity prevented the archbishop from coming to offer his respects, so after his levee Mr. Gladstone with his suite repaired to the archbishop. 'We found him,' says Mr. Gordon, 'seated on a sofa dressed in his most gorgeous robes of gold and purple, over which flowed down a long white beard.... Behind him stood a little court of black-robed, black-bearded, black-capped, dark-faced priests. He is eighty-six years old, and his manners and appearance were dignified in the extreme. Speaking slowly and distinctly he began to tell Gladstone that the sole wish of Cephalonia was to be united to Greece, and there was something very exciting and affecting in the tremulous tones of the old man saying over and over again, [...] "questa infelice isola, questa isola infelice," [...] as the tears streamed down his cheeks and long silvery beard. It was like a scene in a play.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{certainly}} sweet to be merry {{at the right}} moment; but the right moment hardly {{seems to me the}} ten days of the Roman Carnival. It was my rather cynical suspicion perhaps that they wouldn't keep to my imagination the brilliant promise of legend; but I have been justified by the event and have been decidedly less conscious of the festal influences of the season than of the inalienable gravity of the place. There {{was a time when the}} Carnival was a serious matter--that is a heartily joyous one; but, thanks to the seven-league boots the kingdom of Italy has lately donned for the march of progress in quite other directions, the fashion of public revelry has fallen woefully out of step. The state of mind and manners under which the Carnival was kept in generous good faith I doubt if an American can exactly conceive: he can only say to himself that for a month in the year there must have been things--things considerably of humiliation--it was comfortable to forget. But now that Italy is made the Carnival is unmade; and we are not especially tempted to envy the attitude of a population who have lost their relish for play and not yet acquired to any striking extent an enthusiasm for work. The spectacle on the Corso has seemed to me, on the whole, an illustration of that great breach with the past of which Catholic Christendom felt the somewhat muffled shock in September, 1870. A traveller acquainted with the fully papal Rome, coming back any time during the past winter, must have immediately noticed that something momentous had happened-- something hostile to the elements of picture and colour and [...] "style." [...] My first warning was that ten minutes after my arrival I found myself face to face with a newspaper stand. The impossibility in the other days of having anything in the journalistic line but the Osservatore Romano and the Voce della Verità used to seem to me much connected with the extraordinary leisure of thought and stillness of mind to which the place admitted you. But now the slender piping of the Voice of Truth is stifled by the raucous note of eventide vendors of the Capitale, the Libertà and the Fanfulla; and Rome reading unexpurgated news is another Rome indeed. For every subscriber to the Libertà there may well be an antique masker and reveller less. As striking a sign of the new régime is the extraordinary increase of population. The Corso was always a well-filled street, but now it's a perpetual crush. I never cease to wonder where the new-comers are lodged, and how such spotless flowers of fashion as the gentlemen who stare at the carriages can bloom in the atmosphere of those camere mobiliate of which I have had glimpses. This, however, is their own question, and bravely enough they meet it. They proclaimed somehow, to the first freshness of my wonder, as I say, that by force of numbers Rome had been secularised. An Italian dandy is a figure visually to reckon with, but these goodly throngs of them scarce offered compensation for the absent monsignori, treading the streets in their purple stockings and followed by the solemn servants who returned on their behalf the bows of the meaner sort; for the mourning gear of the cardinals' coaches that formerly glittered with scarlet and swung with the weight of the footmen clinging behind; for the certainty that you'll not, by the best of traveller's luck, meet the Pope sitting deep in the shadow of his great chariot with uplifted fingers like some inaccessible idol in his shrine. You may meet the King indeed, who is as ugly, as imposingly ugly, as some idols, though not so inaccessible. The other day as I passed the Quirinal he drove up in a low carriage with a single attendant; and a group of men and women who had been waiting near the gate rushed at him with a number of folded <b>papers.</b> The <b>carriage</b> slackened pace and he pocketed their offerings with a business- like air--hat of a good-natured man accepting handbills at a street-corner. Here was a monarch at his palace gate receiving petitions from his subjects--being adjured to right their wrongs. The scene ought to have thrilled me, but somehow it had no more intensity than a woodcut in an illustrated newspaper. Homely I should call it at most; admirably so, certainly, for there were lately few sovereigns standing, I believe, with whom their people enjoyed these filial hand-to-hand relations. The King this year, however, has had as little to do with the Carnival as the Pope, and the innkeepers and Americans have marked it for their own.|$|R
