He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of <b>plate</b> <b>f,</b> with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, {{he points to the}} similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.|$|E
