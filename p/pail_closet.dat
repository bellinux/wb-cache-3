500|$|Although {{the more}} {{advanced}} water closet (flush toilet) was popular in wealthy homes, {{the lack of an}} adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th-century England, in working-class neighbourhoods, towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods of waste disposal. [...] The <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> was an evolution of the midden closet (privy midden or midden closet), an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health. [...] The pail system was popular in France and England, particularly in the historic Lancashire town of Rochdale, from which the system commonly took its name. [...] The <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> was not without its own problems; if the pail was not emptied on a regular basis, it overflowed and became unhygienic. [...] Some manufacturers lined the pail with absorbent materials, and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise the smell.|$|E
5|$|In Coventry, {{the number}} of <b>pail</b> <b>closets</b> in use {{declined}} from about 712 in 1907, to 92 in 1912, and only 16 by 1926.|$|R
500|$|Manchester's {{population}} {{increased by}} more than 150% between 1831 and 1851.

500|$|Once delivered, refuse was {{normally}} {{placed in}} heaps {{and allowed to}} dry before being put into the ground. [...] The naturally acidic water was a perfect receptacle for the contents of <b>pail</b> <b>closets,</b> rich in urea and nitrogen.

500|$|Improved water {{supplies}} and sewerage systems in England {{led directly to}} {{the replacement of the}} <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> during the early 20th century.

500|$|Pail closets {{were used}} to dispose of human excreta, dirty water, and general {{household}} waste such as kitchen refuse and sweepings. [...] The <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> system {{was one of several}} methods of waste disposal in common use in the 19th century, others of which were the privy midden system, the pail system, and the dry-earth system.|$|E
500|$|A <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> or pail privy was a room {{used for}} the {{disposal}} of human excreta, under the [...] "pail system" [...] (or Rochdale system) of waste removal. [...] The closet was a small outhouse (privy) which contained a seat, underneath which a portable receptacle was placed. This bucket (pail), into which the user would defecate, was removed and emptied by the local authority on a regular basis. [...] The contents would either be incinerated or composted into fertiliser.|$|E
50|$|Fewer {{and fewer}} cesspits {{needed to be}} dug out as more modern sewage {{disposal}} systems, such as <b>pail</b> <b>closets</b> and water closets, became increasingly widespread in 19th-century England.

500|$|The {{purchase}} {{was part}} of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> system (now superseded by the water closet), and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30–60tons of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. [...] It paid about £38,000 (£ as of [...] ), for the site, but the bog's depth, between [...] deep pushed the total development cost to almost £94,000 (£ as of [...] ). [...] The [...] estate included [...] of wild mossland, [...] of partly cultivated mossland, [...] of mossland under cultivation and [...] of incomplete roads. [...] A number of brick buildings were included, along with Asphodel Farm and Ash Farm, both with wooden farmhouses. [...] The corporation rented [...] of land in small holdings to local farmers and kept [...] for itself.|$|E
500|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. [...] It used a wooden tub, or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. [...] The pails were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of the pail carried a cast iron rim about 3inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. [...] The pails were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during the day. [...] Each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. [...] While the pail was removed from the closet, a replacement was installed in its place. [...] In 1874, Rochdale Corporation employed five such wagons in full-time service, collecting from 3,354privies spread across the town. [...] By contrast, with a much larger population, Manchester Corporation employed 73wagons. [...] By 1875, 4,741pails were in use, and in 1876 the number was5,566. [...] A separate cart accompanied the wagon to collect other household refuse which was collected from a separate chamber in the <b>pail</b> <b>closet.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the night soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the water closet having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E
5000|$|The privy midden (also midden closet) was {{a toilet}} system that {{consisted}} of a privy associated with a midden (or middenstead). They were widely used in rapidly expanding industrial cities such as Manchester in England, but were difficult to empty and clean. A typical comment {{was that they were}} of [...] "most objectionable construction" [...] and [...] "usually wet and very foul". They were very often replaced eventually by <b>pail</b> <b>closets</b> and flush toilets.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pail</b> <b>closets,</b> outhouses, and cesspits {{were used}} to collect human waste. The use of human waste as {{fertilizer}} was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities {{did not have a}} functioning sewer system before the Industrial era, relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional rain showers to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, waste water simply ran down the streets, which had stepping stones to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.|$|R
500|$|Between 1831 and 1851, the {{population}} of nearby Manchester {{increased by more than}} 150per cent, putting considerable pressure on refuse disposal. The problem was exacerbated by a gradual switch from the 1870s onwards from the older cesspit methods of sewage disposal to <b>pail</b> <b>closets,</b> which required regular emptying. By the 1880s, Manchester was producing more than [...] of refuse annually, about 75per cent of that being night soil. In 1895, Manchester Corporation purchased [...] of Chat Moss known as Chat Moss Estate from Sir Humphrey de Trafford, with a view to using the moss as a refuse disposal site. The final price paid by the corporation was £137,531 7s 1d (£ as of [...] ).|$|R
2500|$|In {{suburban}} areas {{not connected to}} the sewerage, outhouses were not always built over pits. Instead, these areas utilized a <b>pail</b> <b>closet,</b> where waste was collected into large cans positioned under the toilet seat, to be collected by contractors (or night soil collectors) hired by property owners or the local council. The used cans were replaced with empty, cleaned cans. Brisbane relied on [...] "dunny carts" [...] until the 1950s (one source says until the 1970s); because the population was so dispersed, {{it was difficult to}} install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that [...] "the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns" [...] had, throughout {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, [...] "a dunny against the back fence, so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door" [...] The person who appeared weekly to empty the buckets beneath the seats was known as the [...] "dunnyman", see gong farmer.|$|E

2500|$|Discussion {{about the}} superiority of the Ripley Ville houses {{compared}} to the average working class houses of the time focused on the provision of WCs. In November 1866 Mr Gott, the corporation's chief engineer gave evidence to the Pollution of Rivers Commission. He said there were 26,000 houses in the town and 19,500 privies – of which 1,500 were WCs, 6,000 ash pits and 12,000 <b>pail</b> <b>closets.</b> [...] Half of all houses, 13,000 in total, did not have sole use of a privy and WCs were installed in 5.7% of the total housing stock. WC's were a middle class preserve and virtually unknown in working class dwellings – other than the houses being constructed in Ripley Ville.|$|R
5000|$|Manual {{scavenging}} {{also took}} place in Europe but not specifically linked to a caste-based occupation and not called [...] "manual scavenging": In European history the terms [...] "nightsoil collectors" [...] or [...] "nightmen" [...] and gong farmers were used. The contemporary term for safe nightsoil collection is fecal sludge management. Towns with sanitation systems based on <b>pail</b> <b>closets</b> (bucket toilets in outhouses) relied on frequent emptying, performed by workers driving [...] "honeywagons", a precursor to the vacuum truck now used to pump out septage from septic tanks. The municipal emptying of pail toilets continued in Australia into {{the second half of}} the twentieth century; these were known as dunnies and the workers were dunnymen.|$|R
5000|$|By 1869 Manchester had a {{population}} of about 354,000 people served by about 38,000 middensteads and 10,000 water closets.

5000|$|Prior to the 20th {{century the}} amount of waste {{generated}} by a household was relatively small. Household wastes were often simply thrown out the window, buried in the garden or deposited in outhouses (see more at urban archaeology). When human concentrations became more dense, waste collectors, called nightmen or gong farmers were hired to collect the night soil from <b>pail</b> <b>closets,</b> performing their duties only at night (hence the name). Meanwhile, disposing of refuse became a problem wherever cities grew. Often refuse was placed in unusable areas just outside the city, such as wetlands and tidal zones. One example is London, which from Roman times disposed of its refuse outside the London Wall beside the River Thames. Another example is 1830s Manhattan, where thousands of hogs were permitted to roam the streets and eat garbage. A small industry developed as [...] "swill children" [...] collected kitchen refuse to sell for pig feed and the rag and bone man traded goods for bones (used for glue) and rags (essential for paper manufacture prior to the invention of wood pulping). Later, in the late nineteenth century, trash was fed to swine in industrial.|$|R

5000|$|Although bucket toilet {{systems are}} now rare in {{developed}} countries, particularly where sewers are common, basic forms of sanitation were widely used until the mid 20th century. The <b>pail</b> <b>closet</b> was {{the term in}} Victorian England for a bucket (pail) in an outhouse. The municipality employed workers, often known as [...] "nightmen" [...] (from night soil), to empty and replace the buckets. This system was associated in particular with the English town of Rochdale, {{to the extent that}} it was described as the [...] "Rochdale System" [...] of sanitation.|$|E
5000|$|Earth closets {{were usually}} {{housed in a}} {{separate}} building from the main structure and were well ventilated. As with the <b>pail</b> system, earth <b>closet</b> containers were designed to be emptied frequently. [...] The earth closet was popular and was used in private houses, military camps, hospitals and extensively in India. It remained in use well into the 1930s.|$|R
500|$|Some pails were {{supplied}} with deodorants such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with <b>pail</b> <b>closets</b> by lining the pail with an absorbent material. [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|R
