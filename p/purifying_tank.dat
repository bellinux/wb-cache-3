The result shows that {{when all the}} three zones were added bio-filter the mean values of effluent COD and NH 3 -N were 37. 8 mg/L and 9. 64 mg/L respectively, which shows that the bio-filter bed is a key technology and plays important roles for solid-liquid separation, bio-sorption and bio-degradation, to raise the effluent quality in the sewage treatment process...|$|E

40|$|Investigations of {{electrical}} changes experimentally induced in nerve {{have led to}} the conclusion that potassium shifts are intimately involved (12 - 15). The suggestion of potassium release during anoxic depolarization is of special interest in view of evidence to the contrary (3, 6). It appeared imperative, therefore, to reexamine the problem by a direct analytical method. The results to be described demonstrate that such potassium loss does occur and that this process has certain additional features indicated by the electrical studies. Method All data are based on analyses with the Beckman flame speetrophotometer t of small volumes of sea water brought successively in contact with paired sets of leg nerves from Libinia emarginata.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 32 - 35) An {{experiment was}} conducted to determine if nitric acid vapor, (HN 03) is present under typical conditions used in ozone generations for human health effects studies. HN 03 may be formed during the production of ozone by electrical discharge. Two sources of feed gas, (<b>tanked</b> <b>purified</b> air and compressed room air), and four ozone concentrations, (0, 0. 25, 0. 50, and 0. 75 ppm), were studied. Nitric acid vapor was collected on nylon filters in a sampling train behind Pallflex quartz fiber pre-filters which removed any particulate nitrates or other particles. Small, statistically significant amounts of HN 03 {{were found in the}} test atmospheres, (0. 1 to 2. 4 ppb), during ozone generations. Analysis of the data supports the hypothesis that increased contamination occurs when compressed room air is used instead of purified air for the generations. Increases in HN 03 were found with increases in ozone concentrations. The interaction of the type of air and the ozone concentration was also significant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Purified {{water for}} {{pharmaceutical}} purposes must {{be free of}} microbial contamination and pyrogens. Even with the additional sanitary and disinfecting treatments applied to the system (sequential operational stages), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas picketti, Flavobacterium aureum, Acinetobacter lowffi and Pseudomonas diminuta were isolated and identified from a thirteen-stage purification system. To evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} chemical agents used in the disinfecting process along with those used to adjust chemical characteristics of the system, over the identified bacteria, the kinetic parameter of killing time (D-value) necessary to inactivate 90 % of the initial bioburden (decimal reduction time) was experimentally determined. Methods Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas picketti, Flavobacterium aureum, Acinetobacter lowffi and Pseudomonas diminuta were called in house (wild) bacteria. Pseudomonas diminuta ATCC 11568, Pseudomonas alcaligenes INCQS, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 3178, Pseudomonas picketti ATCC 5031, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 937 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as 'standard' bacteria to evaluate resistance at 25 °C against either 0. 5 % citric acid, 0. 5 % hydrochloric acid, 70 % ethanol, 0. 5 % sodium bisulfite, 0. 4 % sodium hydroxide, 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite, or a mixture of 2. 2 % hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and 0. 45 % peracetic acid. Results The efficacy of the sanitizers varied with concentration and contact time to reduce decimal logarithmic (log 10) population (n cycles). To kill 90 % of the initial population (or one log 10 cycle), the necessary time (D-value) was for P. aeruginosa into: (i) 0. 5 % citric acid, D = 3. 8 min; (ii) 0. 5 % hydrochloric acid, D = 6. 9 min; (iii) 70 % ethanol, D = 9. 7 min; (iv) 0. 5 % sodium bisulfite, D = 5. 3 min; (v) 0. 4 % sodium hydroxide, D = 14. 2 min; (vi) 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite, D = 7. 9 min; (vii) mixture of hydrogen peroxide (2. 2 %) plus peracetic acid (0. 45 %), D = 5. 5 min. Conclusion The contact time of 180 min of the system with the mixture of H 2 O 2 + peracetic acid, a total theoretical reduction of 6 log 10 cycles was attained in the water <b>purified</b> storage <b>tank</b> and distribution loop. The contact time between the water purification system (WPS) and the sanitary agents should be reviewed to reach sufficient bioburden reduction (over 6 log 10) ...|$|R
