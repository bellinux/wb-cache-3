40|$|While {{a variety}} of flow {{measurement}} devices are available to measure {{the flow of water}} through closed pipe systems, these devices generally only function correctly when the pipes are completely full of water. Accurate measurement of water flows in partially-filled pipes is extremely difficult. In siphonic drainage systems, this problem is further compounded by the unsteady flow conditions that occur in the pipework during the priming process. This has been a major obstacle to understanding the performance of these systems in practice. In order to accurately model the priming process in multioutlet siphonic roof drainage systems, a method of estimating the instantaneous flows through the partially-filled individual pipes needs to be developed. This paper describes an experimental method of determining flows in partially-filled pipes using a <b>propeller-type</b> <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> to measure flow velocity and a pressure transducer to measure water depth and {{a modified version of the}} continuity equation. A computational model is presented which estimates the unsteady flows passing through partially-filled pipework. Overall, the experimental results are promising and correspond well with the model. The results of this study will ultimately be used to develop an unsteady flow model of the priming process in multi-outlet siphonic roof drainage systems...|$|E

Periodic calibrations of <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> {{are important to}} ensure the quality of measurements, but the required testing facilities are complex and only available in a few institutions.

Thus, this study aimed to develop an automated system for testing <b>current</b> <b>meters,</b> which consisted of a trapezoidal channel, a step motor, a tow car and a management system, composed of a supervisory application and microprocessed modules to control the motor and the data acquisition. Evaluations of the displacement velocity showed that it matched the reference value up to 1. 85 m s- 1 for a vertical-axis <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> and 2. 3 m s- 1 for a horizontal-axis one. The developed system showed reliability during tests, for both <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> movement and data acquisition.

These tests included measurements of the discharge through the turbine using <b>current</b> <b>meters.</b> Simultaneous measurements were also taken in one bay of the intake with an Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM). The ASFM is a new instrument which offers unique advantages for measuring intake flows in low-head, short intake plants for which <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> have been the traditional and only effective method.

5000|$|Tilt <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> {{operate under}} the drag-tilt {{principle}} and are designed to either float or sink depending on the type. A floating tilt <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> typically consists of a sub-surface buoyant housing that is anchored to the sea floor with a flexible line or tether. A sinking tilt current is similar, but the housing is designed such that the meter hangs from the attachment point. In either case, the housing tilts {{as a function of}} its shape, buoyancy (negative or positive) and the water velocity. Once the characteristics of a housing is known, the velocity can be determined by measuring the angle of the housing and direction of tilt. The housing contains a data logger that records the orientation (angle from vertical and compass bearing) of the Tilt <b>Current</b> <b>Meter.</b> Floating tilt <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> are typically deployed on the bottom with a lead or concrete anchor but may be deployed on lobster traps or other convenient anchors of opportunity. Sinking tilt <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> may be attached to an oceanographic mooring, floating dock or fish pen. Tilt <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> have the advantage over other methods of measuring current in that they are generally relatively low-cost instruments and the design and operation is relatively simple.
