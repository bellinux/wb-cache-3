60|$|Still {{the ticking}} in the hall. Still the breathing, deeper and fuller now, from the medium. Still the {{occasional}} flash, more welcome than ever, of the <b>passing</b> <b>lights</b> of the hansoms. What a gap we were bridging, the half-raised veil {{of the eternal}} {{on the one side}} and the cabs of London on the other. The table was throbbing with a mighty pulse. It swayed steadily, rhythmically, with an easy swooping, scooping motion under our fingers. Sharp little raps and cracks came from its substance, file-firing, volley-firing, the sounds of a fagot burning briskly on a frosty night.|$|E
60|$|But though Francis {{retired to}} his room, {{it was more}} than an hour before he got into bed. His window looked down upon one of the canals running into the Grand Canal. Gondolas lighted by lanterns, or by torches held by servitors, passed {{constantly}} backwards and forwards beneath his window, and by leaning out he could see the <b>passing</b> <b>lights</b> of those on the Grand Canal. Snatches of song and laughter came up to him, and sometimes the note of a musical instrument. The air was soft and balmy, and he felt no inclination for sleep.|$|E
5000|$|As a solo artist Carrigan {{produced}} {{his first}} two records <b>Passing</b> <b>Lights</b> and Focus in 2011. John Diliberto of Echoes wrote that, [...] "It wasn't until he hit 42 in 2011 that Bryan Carrigan released his first solo album, <b>Passing</b> <b>Lights.</b> But before the shrink wrap came off that one he put out a second CD, Focus. Each disc had {{a different kind of}} effervescent electronic music." [...] His third studio album Windows was released in 2012. After the release of Windows Bill Binkelman wrote that, [...] "Over the course of just three albums, Bryan Carrigan has established himself as an electronic music maestro and someone of substantial importance to follow for any fan of the genre who wants to stay ahead of the curve." [...] Zone Music Reporter also named Windows a nominee for its 2012 Best Ambient Album of the Year award. His 2013 album Below Zero won the ZMR Music Award for Best Chill/Groove album in May 2014.|$|E

5000|$|The {{surprise}} {{winners were}} Americans A. J. Foyt and Dan Gurney, who led {{all but the}} first 90 minutes of the race and defeated the factory Ferrari 330P4 of Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti and Briton Michael Parkes by nearly four laps. The team had to fabricate a roof [...] "bubble" [...] to accommodate the helmet of Dan Gurney, who stood more than 190 cm (6 feet, 3 inches) tall. In one famous incident {{which took place in}} the middle of the night, Gurney had been running quite easily to preserve his car, and Parkes came up behind in the second-place Ferrari (which was trailing by four laps, or 34 miles). For several miles Parkes hounded the Ford driver by flashing his <b>passing</b> <b>lights</b> in Gurney's mirrors until an exasperated Gurney simply pulled off the course at Arnage corner and stopped on a grassy verge. Parkes stopped behind him, and the two race-leading cars sat there in the dark, motionless, until Parkes finally realized this attempt at provocation was not going to work. After a few moments, he pulled around Gurney and resumed the race, with Gurney following shortly. With the cat-and-mouse game abandoned, each car then simply maintained their positions to the finish. The win remains, to this day, the sole all-American victory at Le Mans: an American-built car, prepared by an American team and driven by American drivers.|$|E
40|$|In {{an optical}} network, the {{fiber optic cable}} is used for {{communication}} between the nodes in a network by <b>passing</b> <b>lights.</b> The main problem in optical network is finding the link disjoints as well as optimal solution for the disjoints. To tolerate a single link failure in the network, the enhanced active path first algorithm is used which computes the re-routed back-up path. The multiple link failure in a network called fibre span disjoint path problem is solved using integer linear programming algorithm. The loop back recovery is used to provide pre-planned recovery of link or node failures in a network which allows dynamic choice of routes over pre-planned directions. Considering reliability in a mesh networks, the reliability algorithm helps to achieve the maximum reliability in two-path protection. It addresses the multiple disjoint failures that arise in a network and discusses the best solution between paths shared nodes or links. The unified algorithm is used to generate the optimal results with minimum cost for multiple link failures. The heuristic algorithm namely maximum arbitrary double-link protection algorithm helps to pre-compute the back-up path for double-link failures. In all the above approaches the shortest optimized path must be improved. To find the best shortest path, link-disjoint lightpath algorithm is designed to compute the disjoint occurred in a network and it also satisfies the wavelength continuity constraint in wavelength division multiplexing. A polynomial time algorithm Wavelength Division Multiplexing – Passive Optical Networking is used to compute the disjoint happen in the network. The overall time efficiency is analyzed and performance is evaluated through simulations...|$|E

50|$|An LCD {{presents}} an image by absorbing some <b>light</b> <b>passing</b> through it. When an electric field is applied across the crystal, {{it changes the}} <b>passing</b> <b>light</b> so it will not pass through a polarization filter.
