Pari passu is a term generally used to signify equal priority or treatment, and a collective action clause would have obligated any holdouts to accept the generally offered terms if enough other bondholders agreed to accept them. As a result, the holdouts realized that while Argentina could not force the holdouts to accept the terms in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings, NML could use the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> to force Argentina to choose between paying all its bondholders (including NML) or none of them.|$|E
5000|$|On August 23, 2013, the Second Circuit (in another opinion {{also signed}} by Judge Parker) affirmed the lower court's latest ruling {{clarifying}} {{the scope of}} the permanent injunctions. [...] The court implied at the start of its opinion that since Argentina had taken a calculated risk to enjoy the benefit of New York law (i.e., a lower interest rate), it now had to bear the burden of New York law as well: [...] "In order to enhance the marketability of the bonds, Argentina made a series of promises to the purchasers." [...] Among those promises in the 1994 Fiscal Agency Agreement were the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause,</b> the aforementioned forum selection and choice-of-law clauses expressly referencing New York, as well as a promise of the free transferability of the bonds to any transferee, regardless of whether that transferee was a [...] "university endowment, a so-called 'vulture fund,' or a widow or an orphan." [...] In other words, as the drafter of the Fiscal Agency Agreement, Argentina could have easily avoided the situation it found itself in by writing a different <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause,</b> omitting the transferability clause, including anti-assignment clauses (e.g., a clause providing that assignees could only recover the amount actually paid rather than face value of the debt), or writing the contract under the law of a different jurisdiction altogether, with the understanding that rational investors would have demanded higher interest rates in exchange for any of these things.|$|E
5000|$|The Second Circuit {{interpreted}} this clause under New York law {{and concluded}} [...] "that in pairing the two sentences of its <b>Pari</b> <b>Passu</b> <b>Clause,</b> the FAA manifested an intention to protect bondholders {{from more than}} just formal subordination .... the two sentences ... protect against different forms of discrimination: the issuance of other superior debt (first sentence) and the giving of priority to other payment obligations (second sentence)." [...] Argentina had argued the entire clause was intended to protect only against the first type of discrimination; the Second Circuit held that Argentina's approach was invalid because it ignored the critical differences in wording between the two sentences, treated the second sentence as redundant, and in turn violated New York's rule that [...] "a contract should not be interpreted {{in such a way}} as would leave one of its provisions substantially without force or effect." [...] Thus, the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision that Argentina could either pay all its bondholders or none, but could not pay only those who cooperated with the 2005 and 2010 restructurings and ignore the rest.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{contract}} theory model {{to argue that}} covenants ruling debt renegotiations are important to assure the sovereign willingness to pay. The model includes the following features: first, collective action clauses, exit consents, aggregation provisions and <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clauses</b> {{play an important role}} in the post default “game” of negotiations and coalitions. These covenants are represented in reduced form by the endogenous probability of refinancing a defaulted sovereign debt. Second, the model has “endogenous bad luck” because the unfavorable state of nature where default occurs depends on the level of indebtedness, which is itself an endogenous variable. Third, “vultures”, contrary to conventional wisdom, tend to improve the access of emerging economies to capital markets because they might help to rule out strategic defaults. And fourth, under special assumptions the model is able to analyze the possibility of post default discrimination between domestic and foreign bondholders. debt, default, negotiation, vultures, Shapley-values...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the outcome of}} a related broader project, {{exploring}} the explanatory power of the Legal Theory of Finance, which proposes a new institution-based analytical framework for the analysis of phenomena of financial markets.

Further implications can then be shown referring to <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clauses</b> and collective action clauses, which are both exhibit a differential application of these legal rules according to the hierarchical status of the respective market participant, and can therefore endanger sovereign debt restructurings.

40|$|Unresolved {{sovereign}} debt problems and disruptive litigation are hurting debtor nations and their citizens, {{as well as}} their creditors. A default can also pose a serious systemic threat to the international financial system. Yet the existing “contractual” approach to {{sovereign debt}} restructuring, including the use of so-called collective action clauses, is insufficient to solve the holdout problem; recent empirical research indeed shows a drastic rise in sovereign debt litigation by holdout creditors. And the political economy of treaty-making makes a multilateral “statutory” approach highly unlikely to succeed in the near future. This article, prepared at the invitation of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for presentation at its 50 th Anniversary Congress, shows why a model-law approach to sovereign debt restructuring should be realistic and effective. Nations and even subnational jurisdictions could individually enact a model law as their internal law, and contracts governed by that law would thereby become governed by the model law. Choice of law thus gives a model-law approach a powerful multiplier effect. A model-law approach could also solve the problem of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clauses</b> and address the critical need for a financially troubled nation to obtain liquidity during its restructuring process. The article proposes a form of Sovereign Debt Restructuring Model Law, which has been vetted in discussions with leading experts worldwide and also embraces the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. At the very least, pursuing the Model Law in parallel to other approaches would help to develop norms for a sovereign debt restructuring legal framework that goes beyond mere contracting...|$|R
40|$|It can be {{said that}} the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> mistakenly {{migrated}} from secured private lending to unsecured sovereign lending. Once rooted in unsecured sovereign lending instruments it faced certain provisions like the ones in Spain or the Philippines that can allow a creditor to create a preference positioning itself in a better position vis-a-vis other creditors, and become a 'must have' provision in this type of debt instruments. Then, pari passu clauses stayed in unsecured debt instruments due to the fear of the earmarking revenues or the risk of the sovereign preferring a group of creditors over another. These two fears were tackled by an expanded negative pledge clause and the Libra and Allied Bank cases. Therefore, if a proper due diligence was conducted {{there was no need to}} have a <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> unless in exceptional circumstances alike the ones of Spain or the Philippines. Unfortunately, a misguided interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> in the Elliot case opened the door to litigation on incorrect grounds (payment interpretation or broad interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause).</b> It was an 'aberration', but one that caused furore. The problem was that in Elliot there was no breach of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause,</b> just a wrong understanding of its meaning. In the case of Argentina the whole story could be different since it can be correctly interpreted as a breach of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> in its ranking or narrow form.

40|$|In October 2000 a {{hedge fund}} holding an unpaid debt claim won an {{enormous}} victory against the debtor, the Republic of Peru, through an opportunistic interpretation of the common <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> by a Brussels court.

Over the ensuing years, multiple reform solutions were proposed including the revision of certain contractual terms, the filing of amicus briefs in a key case, and the imposition of an international bankruptcy regime for sovereigns.

40|$|In this comment, {{we take a}} {{helicopter}} tour {{of the history of}} notions of "equality" and "justice" in sovereign debt restructuring in particular, and in the division of property more generally, and show that these concerns have existed for centuries, if not millennia.

40|$|The rise of {{vulture fund}} {{investing}} in sovereign bonds has created additional hurdles to successful restructuring in an already fragile ad hoc process. Recent litigation in NML Capital, Ltd. v. Argentina has proven courts’ willingness to utilize powers of equity {{to enforce a}} ratable payment interpretation of the pari passu clause—the equal treatment provision commonly found in sovereign bond contracts—creating much uncertainty on how the ruling will affect future restructuring efforts. By looking to the tension in interpretations of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause,</b> discrepancies in remedial relief awarded, and international institutions’ proposed solutions, this Note analyzes {{the role of the}} <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> as a tool for holdout creditors to disrupt restructurings. This Note argues for a contractual solution targeted at preventing vulture fund investors from access to pari passu injunctive relief coupled with creative restructuring strategies for outstanding bonds awaiting maturity. This resolution seeks to retain some protection for traditional holdout creditors while disincentivizing investments made with intent to derail restructurings from the start. Unlike debtors in the domestic bankruptcy system, sovereigns have no overarching mechanism to facilitate a successful restructuring when their debt burden becomes unsustainable. Using the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> as a means to enjoin payment to restructured bondholders leaves sovereign debtors with little recourse but to cede to the demands of holdout creditors and can have a devastating long-term impact on the sovereign’s capacity to rebuild debt sustainability. On the other hand, removing pari passu injunctive relief strips holdout creditors of a valuable enforcement mechanism and can leave sovereigns unrestrained. This Note balances these concerns by advocating for a solution that diminishes vulture creditor leverage that can obstruct a restructuring, while otherwise preserving creditor rights against unfair or coercive exchange terms...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> {{is found}} in nearly every {{sovereign}} debt contract issued throughout the globe. In the private context, this clause is well understood to ensure fair distributions to all creditors {{in the event of}} bankruptcy and liquidation. As insolvency distributions are not an option when dealing with distressed sovereign debt, the rights and duties associated with this clause have been subject to extensive litigation for over 20 years. Starting from the case of Elliot v. Peru, in the early 1990 s, and more recently in Argentina v. NML, courts have interpreting these bonds, governed subject to New York law, in favor of holdout creditors. By means of a novel interpretation of the clause, vulture funds have gained a legal “weapon” with which they can force a sovereign nation into default if they are not paid in full. As a result, sovereign debtors have rapidly begun to adapt the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> in their new debt contracts to negate the adverse position of the courts.

40|$|U. S. {{federal court}} rulings against Argentina since 2012 {{have turned the}} <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> in {{sovereign}} bond contracts into the most promising debt collection tool against immune governments {{since the days of}} gunboat diplomacy. The large literature on pari passu (“equal step” in Latin) assumes that the clause had not been used for enforcement before the late 1990 s, and that it was first construed by a Belgian court in a case against Peru in the year 2000. The Belgian decision was criticized for wrongly concluding that pari passu promised ratable payment to all holders of Peru’s external debt. A decade later, the U. S. courts adopted the same interpretation against Argentina, despite interventions by the United States, Brazil, France, Mexico and a slew of experts. The case is now caught up in litigation around the world involving bondholders, trustees, payment and clearing systems. Debates about the meaning of pari passu have so far been drawn on bond language, contract practices and diplomatic statements, not judicial interpretation. This essay reports on a once-famous lawsuit in Swiss courts, brought by Swedish holders of German government bonds against the Bank for International Settlements as bond trustee in 1935. The Swedish creditors claimed that the BIS violated the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> when it paid them nominal value, while it indexed payments to other bondholders to the value of gold. Three Swiss courts concluded that such payment discrimination was a breach of the pari passu clause; one even suggested that it could give rise to inter-creditor remedies. However, all three courts held against the bondholders {{on the grounds that the}} trustee’s duties in this case were limited to following Germany’s instructions. Subsequent commentators criticized the Swiss courts’ views of the trustee’s role, but did not disagree with its reading of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause.</b> The case has featured prominently in 20 th century sovereign debt literature, but the pari passu angle appears to have been forgotten...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> rule in English law. That rule, {{commonly}} understood, provides for equal (or pro rata) treatment of creditors belonging to the same class. The rule has been developed through both legislative and judicial activities over a long passage of legal history. This thesis will analyse the construct given to this rule by both legislators and judges, particularly, {{with reference to the}} extent it has been adapted {{to meet the needs of}} modern insolvency law. Such a perspective is especially acute in the light of recent reforms to the position of unsecured creditors introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002. The effects of the current financial downturn have furthermore focused attention on insolvency law from the perspective of corporate rescue or the treatment of creditors, and the increasingly global nature of commerce has meant that different jurisdictions face similar challenges in the enforcement of their insolvency laws. This work engages in a doctrinal study which contrasts the conception of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> rule which is widely known and applied (though subject to criticism) with the actual operation of the rule in a private law and public policy context. Accordingly, the development of the rule is traced from its origins to its present application. An effort is made to determine the extent to which the judicial model of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> is substantiated in practice and commercial realities. It is argued that this model can be distinguished from the manner in which the rule actually applies in the context of managing the relationship between unsecured creditors within their class, and in the promotion of wider social interests. Regard is made of developments in insolvency law which may have diminished the view of the rules of insolvency distribution as an indicator of the social values of a legal system. The manifestation of the rule in ‘international insolvencies’ is one such development. An examination of the advent of a more flexible approach to <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> in international insolvencies would thus be necessary. It will be shown that a revised construct of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> which more strongly accords with modern imperatives is needed.

40|$|Coined the “trial of the century” in {{sovereign}} debt litigation, NML v. Argentina (NML) involves {{a radical departure}} from the traditional unenforceability of {{sovereign debt}} contracts in favor of the opposite extreme: enforcement through potent injunctive remedies applicable to third parties. Problems with the NML precedent could extend far beyond Argentina’s immediate situation. NML is the latest landmark in a trend that creates serious uncertainties for sovereign debt markets—a major concern for sovereigns, their creditors, and financial institutions around the world. This Article argues that NML creates “bad law” by overcompensating for unenforceability problems with an ambitious reading of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> and supercharged injunctive remedies. As a practical matter, the milk is spilled; “rogue” precedent now exists.

40|$|Sovereign {{immunity}} {{has served}} as a partial substitute for bankruptcy protection, but it has encouraged a minority of creditors to pursue unorthodox legal remedies with spillover effects far beyond the debtor-creditor relationship. The attempt to enforce Argentina’s <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause</b> in New York is an example of such a remedy, which relies primarily on collateral damage to other creditors and market infrastructure to obtain settlement from a debtor that would not pay. The District Court decision, now on appeal before the Second Circuit, may not make holding out more attractive in future restructurings – but it would make participation less attractive for creditors, and create uncertainty for trustees, clearing and payments systems. Contractual innovations that support debt restructuring, such as collective action clauses (CACs), will not diminish the impact of the remedy for the foreseeable future, among other reasons because they are not designed to work across the debt stock. The Greek debt restructuring, where over half of the foreign-law issues with CACs failed to clear the voting threshold, is a case in point. The latest pari passu episode illustrates the challenge of a purely contractual framework for debt restructuring: interpretation uncertainty, institutional barriers to contract change, and a well-resourced constituency with every incentive {{to take advantage of the}} combination, make for an irreducible risk. Options going forward range from contract reform to reviving treaty-based sovereign bankruptcy. The former will be slow and incomplete; the latter has dim political prospects.

40|$|Rote {{use of a}} {{standard}} form contract term can erode its meaning, a phenomenon made worse when the process of encrustation introduces various formulations of the term. The foregoing process, when it occurs, weakens the communicative properties of boilerplate terms, leading some terms to lose much, if not all, meaning. In theory, if a clause is completely emptied of meaning through this process it can create a contractual “black hole. ” The more frequent and thus potentially more pervasive problem arises when, as the term loses meaning, random variations in language appear and persist, resulting in what we term a “grey hole. ” The question that follows is what interpretive strategy courts should use when parties exploit these variations, persuading a court to adopt {{an interpretation of the}} grey hole term that (a) surprises the market that previously had disregarded the term and (b) results in an interpretation that the market disavows. Traditional doctrine holds that even if the court errs, parties have an incentive to revise the standard language to exclude the aberrant interpretation. But what if the assumptions about the costs and motivations to revise this type of boilerplate are wrong? We seek to gain purchase on this question with a study of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> <b>clause,</b> {{a standard}} provision in sovereign debt contracts that almost no one seems to understand. This clause gained fame in 2011 because of a series of court decisions in New York arguably misinterpreting a particular variation of the clause. Even though the courts’ interpretation put at risk a multi-trillion dollar debt market, meaningful revisions to the language of the boilerplate term did not begin to appear until late 2014. Market forces, in other words, worked very slowly to remedy a major systemic problem, leading to considerable costs. We ask, therefore, whether courts might not do more to avoid the problem at the front end rather than depend on market forces to correct court error at the back end...|$|E
