40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to obtain information for use in the design of truss and <b>plywood</b> <b>forms,</b> particularly with reference to wing ribs. Tests were made on many designs of wing ribs, comparing different types in various sizes. Many tests were also made on parallel-chord specimens of truss and <b>plywood</b> <b>forms</b> in place of the actual ribs and on parts of wing ribs, such as truss diagonals and sections of cap strips. It was found that for ribs of any size or proportions, when they were designed to obtain a well-balanced construction and were carefully manufactured, distinct types are of various efficiencies; the efficiency is based on the strength per unit of weight. In all types of ribs the heavier are the stronger per unit of weight. Reductions in the weight of wing ribs are accompanied even in efficient designs by a much greater proportional reduction in strength...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} glue was Casein-based, later {{replaced by}} [...] "Aerolite", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde, {{which was more}} durable. Many other types of screws and flanges (made of various woods) also held the structure together. The fuselage construction joints were made from balsa wood and plywood strips with the spruce multi-ply being connected by a balsa V joint, along with the interior frame. The spruce was reinforced by plywood strips {{at the point where}} the two halves joined to form the V-joint. Located on top of the joint the <b>plywood</b> <b>formed</b> the outer skin.|$|R

25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in <b>plywood,</b> <b>formed</b> the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root to tip, with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to half-span the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum lift coefficient and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a gull wing. The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root to tip.|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, McCracken {{generated}} {{his signature}} sculptural form: the plank, a narrow, monochromatic, rectangular board format that leans {{at an angle}} against the wall (the site of painting) while simultaneously entering into the three-dimensional realm and physical space of the viewer. He conceived the plank idea in a period when artists across the stylistic spectrum were combining aspects of painting and sculpture in their work and many were experimenting with sleek, impersonal surfaces. As the artist noted, [...] "I see the plank as existing between two worlds, the floor representing the physical world of standing objects, trees, cars, buildings, and human bodies, ... and the wall representing {{the world of the}} imagination, illusionist painting space, and human mental space." [...] The sculptures consist of <b>plywood</b> <b>forms</b> coated with fiberglass and layers of polyester resin. While the polished resin surface recalls the aesthetic of 1960s southern California surfboard and Kustom Kar cultures, the title was drawn from advertising slogans in fashion magazines. In addition to the planks, the artist also creates wall pieces and free-standing sculptures in varying geometrical shapes and sizes, ranging from smaller forms on pedestals to large-scale, outdoor structures in the shape of pyramids, ziggurats, tetrahedrons and occasionally crystals. He worked in highly polished stainless steel and bronze and occasionally made work that in effect sliced the planks into thin, repeating elements that leaned against the wall in rows.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{exceptionally}} {{low quality}} of Chinese timber producers at the time, Ban had trouble finding a suitable {{material for the}} building. He eventually settled on a newly developed plywood called Laminated Bamboo <b>Plywood,</b> a <b>form</b> of LVL. All beams, floors, interior and exterior finishes were done in Bamboo to ensure consistency of material throughout the home. Bamboo Furniture House {{was also one of}} the first buildings that successfully utilized bamboo as a structural material, something that only Simon Velez had done before. Ban was incredibly interested in learning the construction methods and styles of Chinese Architecture, of which he was unfamiliar.|$|R

The buck included removable metal frames which showed the outline of the windows. Once completed, the body buck and forms were sent to California Metal Shaping for an aluminium body and Aircraft Windshield Co for the windows. Once returned to Thomas', it was finished by Don Borth and Edmunds. A second car was also constructed with an aluminum body, but the remainder of the cars were fiberglass.|$|R
25|$|Floors in wooden {{buildings}} are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called joists, {{covered with a}} diagonal wood planking or <b>plywood</b> to <b>form</b> a subfloor upon which the finish floor surface is laid. In many structures these are all aligned in the same direction. To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall.|$|R
50|$|The Tobia was {{specifically}} designed by Rotondi {{as the basis}} of an extended aircraft building project for the students of the aeronautical division of the G. Feltrinelli Technical Institute of Milan. This {{turned out to be a}} four-year exercise, beginning in 1958. It was a shoulder wing, single seat, wood and fabric glider with a single spar, straight tapered, square tipped wing. From the spar forwards the wing was <b>plywood</b> covered, <b>forming</b> a torsion resisting D-box; aft, it was fabric covered. Its ailerons were long and narrow, covering half the span. The inner parts of the wing carried mid-chord air brakes similar to those used on the influential DFS Olympia Meise.|$|R

50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a glue for waterproof plywood. It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a resole phenolic resin. When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated <b>plywood</b> was <b>formed.</b> Most <b>plywood</b> at this time used other adhesives, such as casein. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses. This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|R
50|$|The wing was {{a wooden}} two spar structure, largely fabric covered.

The rear spar was just behind mid-chord. The central panel, occupying a little under half the span, was straight edged and had constant chord. Outboard the wing was straight tapered to rounded tips, ailerons occupying all the trailing edge. The centre section was supported by a low fuselage pedestal and braced on each side with a parallel pair of steel struts. These were fixed to the two spars close to the outer ends of the centre panels and to the lower fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The Alcione was {{a refined}} {{sailplane}} in its day, designed {{in collaboration with}} the Polytechnic University of Milan. It was a cantilever mid-wing monoplane, its wing built around a single spar at about one third chord. Forward of the spar the wing was <b>plywood</b> covered, <b>forming</b> a torque resisting D-box; elsewhere it was fabric covered. In plan the wings were straight tapered to rounded tips. [...] The whole trailing edge of each wing was moveable, the inner third acting as camber changing air brakes and the rest as differential ailerons. [...] Spoilers of the early, single action Centro Volo a Vela (CVV) type were mounted on the upper wing surface immediately behind the spar and at about one quarter span.|$|R
500|$|The Hamilcar was {{constructed}} primarily from wood, mainly birch and spruce, with fabric-covered <b>plywood</b> <b>forming</b> the skin, and {{high grade steel}} reinforcement beams in critical areas.

It was so large and heavy that it required the largest and most powerful aircraft to pull it off the airfield and subsequently tow it; four-engined bombers were used, most frequently the Handley Page Halifax. Both wing and cockpit were set above the fuselage to provide the greatest amount of room for the cargo compartment, and to ensure that they did not interfere with the loading of vehicles; the compartment measured approximately , [...] inches wide and between [...] and [...] inches in height. The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|R
50|$|The one sheet boat, or OSB, is an {{outgrowth}} of the stitch and glue technique. The OSB is a boat that can be built using a single sheet of 4 foot by 8 foot plywood (1.22 m × 2.44 m). Some additional wood is often used, for supports, chines, or as a transom, though some can be built entirely with the sheet of plywood. OSBs tend to be very small, since the displacement is limited to a theoretical maximum of about 1500 lb (680 kg), based on the largest hemispherical shape that could be formed with the same surface area as the sheet of <b>plywood.</b> Though <b>forming</b> a hemisphere is possible (see geodesic dome), it is only practical for one person, since most designs have a maximum displacements of under 1000 lb (450 kg).|$|R

50|$|Precast shape {{manufacturing}} {{requires a}} mold or pattern {{to form the}} shape. Several methods for mold-making are routinely used, {{and the type of}} mold construction and materials depends on the size, complexity, and dimensional tolerances the shape requires, and sometimes the quantity of shapes. Simple shapes with loose dimensional tolerances (+/- 1/16") can use <b>plywood</b> or metal <b>forms.</b> Other shapes may involve extremely tight tolerances that require more sophisticated molds made from wood, plastic, or metal. These molds may be made by a foundry pattern maker or machine shop.|$|R

50|$|Epoxy resin -a {{chemical}} fluid {{widely used}} in advanced wooden boat building since the 1980s {{in a variety of}} forms, principally glue, as a filler (with a variety of powders or sawdust) and as a moisture-resistant barrier on both the interior and exterior of a wooden hull. The method was popularized by the WEST system. Sometimes used in conjunction with various cloths such as fibreglass, kevlar or carbon fibre. A thinned mixture of resin is used to penetrate the fibres of light weight woods such as Balsa and Western red cedar forming a waterproof barrier, far superior to single pot paint or varnish. In small boat and kayak construction Epoxy resin is often used in conjunction with lightweight 3 or 4 mm thick Okoume (Gaboon) <b>plywood</b> to <b>form</b> very light strong hulls. Typically few nails or screws are needed as the resin is so strong. Slow drying and far stronger but more difficult to sand than polyester resin. Typically applied with a roller, throw away brushes and radiused flat tongue depressor for coving using thickened epoxy. Softens and weakens slightly at high ambient temperatures so vessels in tropical waters should be lighter coloured.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a study on {{a particular type of}} long-spanning composite timber beams with box section, which can potentially used for floor joists. In this study, four-point bend tests of four composite timber beams of 2400 × 200 × 105 mm 3 were performed on a fixture with inner span of 700 and outer, 2100 mm. The beams consist of two wood flanges connected via two <b>plywood</b> webs, <b>forming</b> a rectangular hollow section. The wood flanges are made of MGP 12 with thickness of 90 mm and depth of 45 mm (AS 1720. 1), and plywood webs, ID Code 7 - 24 - 3 with total thickness of three plies, 7. 2 mm (AS 2269. 0 - 2008). The experiments demonstrated that with very strong rigid bonds joining the flanges and webs, the beams invariably failed from the buckling and then shearing of web. For the beam with weaker flange-web bonds, the beam will prematurely fail because of debonding. These observations are analysed in terms of stress distributions in the beams and the strength behaviours of individual components in the beams...|$|R
5000|$|In this method, the {{exterior}} {{surface of the}} fuselage is also the primary structure. A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded plywood, where the layers of <b>plywood</b> are <b>formed</b> over a [...] "plug" [...] or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin, instead of plywood, as the skin. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.The use of molded fiberglass using negative ("female") molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes. The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (using pressure-molding on female molds).|$|R
