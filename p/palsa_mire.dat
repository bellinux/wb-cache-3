50|$|Stordalen mire (elevation 351 m) {{lies in the}} subarctic {{region in}} northernmost Sweden. It is located 10 km east {{of the town of}} Abisko close to Lake Torneträsk. It is a 25 ha <b>palsa</b> <b>mire,</b> which is common in the {{discontinuous}} permafrost zone. The mire has two major topographical features: elevated palsas and depressions. The palsas are dry, ombrotrophic plateaus (or hummocks) with permafrost cores that raise the peat surface above its surroundings that is the wet minerotrophic depressions, largely permafrostfree and water saturated. The small-scale topography is often very patchy in its structure, creating an environment where localities nearby each other have distinct differences in moisture, permafrost and nutrient status, which creates differences in vegetation types. Of these subhabitats the vegetation in the dry parts consists mainly of mosses, lichens and dwarf shrubs, whereas the wet parts are dominated by sphagnum or tall graminoids. A peat layer up to 3 m deep covers most of the area and is an indication of a net carbon accumulation over the past 5000 years. In the areas underlying by permafrost the active layer reaches a thickness of about 60 cm in the late summer. The mire experiences thermokarst erosion, with the ongoing permafrost thawing that leads to degradation and collapse of the palsa structure, converting it into the wetter surface types. To the east the mire is bordered by the shallow Lake Villasjön (max depth 1.3 m) whereas it is in general largely surrounded by mountain birch forest.|$|E

In total 75 new  14 C dates from {{different}} palsa sections were obtained. In <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> near Bugry Settlement 3. 2  m high palsa dated from 8. 6 to 2. 1  ka BP. The permafrost and palsa began 2. 1  ka BP. In <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> near Usa Settlement low moor peat in 2  m high palsa dated 3690  BP, palsa began to heave at least 3700  BP.

A number of 8   14 C dates from 5. 6 to 2. 7  ka BP obtained from peat of 3  m high palsa. Near Abez’ Settlement palsa development began about 2. 8  ka BP. There are both large and smaller palsas. Low-moor peat of 3. 5  m high palsa is dated between 9180  BP to 6730  BP near Nikita Settlement. In Vorkuta area near Khanovey Settlement the northern most palsa is found. The  14 C age of peat at slope of the palsa is much younger, than in an axial part, there is inversion of the dates: the date 3. 5  ka BP is between dates 2. 9 and 2. 8  ka BP. It is probably caused by creep of peat downwards from a summit. This evidenced this frozen mound is real palsa, but not a residual form as a result of erosion. </span...|$|E
40|$|Palsa mires, {{nutrient}} poor permafrost peatlands {{common in}} subarctic regions, store {{a significant amount}} of carbon (C) and it has been hypothesized their net ecosystem C balance (NECB) is sensitive to climate change. Over two years we measured the NECB for Stordalen <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> and found it to accumulate 46 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1). While Stordalen NECB is comparable to nutrient poor peatlands without permafrost, the component fluxes differ considerably in magnitude. Specifically, Stordalen had both lower growing season CO 2 uptake and wintertime CO 2 losses, but importantly also low dissolved organic carbon exports and hydrocarbon (mainly methane) emissions. Restricted C losses from palsa mires are likely to have facilitated C accumulation of unproductive subarctic permafrost peatlands. Continued climate change and permafrost thaw is likely to amplify several component fluxes, with an uncertain overall effect on NECB - highlighting the necessity for projections of high-latitude C storage to consider all C fluxes.

40|$|Palsas are mounds with a {{permafrost}} core {{covered by}} peat. They occur in subarctic <b>palsa</b> <b>mires,</b> which are ecologically valuable mire complexes {{located at the}} outer margin of the permafrost zone. Palsas are expected to undergo rapid changes under global warming. This study presents {{an assessment of the}} potential impacts of climate change on the spatial distribution of <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> in northern Fennoscandia during the 21 st century. A large ensemble of statistical climate envelope models was developed, each model defining the relationship between palsa occurrences and a set of temperature- and precipitation-based indicators. The models were used to project areas suitable for palsas in the future. The sensitivity of these models to changes in air temperature and precipitation was analysed to construct impact response surfaces. These were used to assess the behaviour of models when extrapolated into changed climate conditions, so that new criteria, in addition to conventional model evaluation statistics, could be deﬁned for determining model reliability. A special focus has been on comparing alternative methods of representing future climate, applying these with impact models and quantifying different sources of uncertainty in the assessment. Climate change projections were constructed from output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models as well as finer resolution regional climate models and uncertainties in applying these with impact models were explored. New methods were developed to translate probabilistic climate change projections to probabilistic estimates of impacts on palsas. In addition to future climate, structural differences in impact models appeared to be a major source of uncertainty. However, using the model judged most reliable according to the new criteria, results indicated that the area with suitable climatic conditions for palsas can be expected to shrink considerably during the 21 st century, disappearing entirely for an increase in mean annual air temperature of 4 °C relative to the period 1961 - 1990. The risk of this occurring {{by the end of the}} 21 st century was quantified to be between 43 % (for the B 1 low emissions scenario) and 100 % (for the A 2 high emissions scenario). The projected changes in areas suitable for palsas are expected to have a significant influence on the biodiversity of subarctic mires and are likely to affect the regional carbon budget...|$|R

Important signs of climate change include, pollen and growing seasons begin earlier, fish stocks shift northwards, some bird populations decrease in numbers and other adapt by a change in migration rhythm, sensitive nature types such as <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> are declining in distribution, and polar bears are threatened by earlier ice-break-up...|$|R
40|$|Two main {{types of}} {{permafrost}} {{are found in}} northern Finland. The most widely known occurence is in mires, in peat mounds with permanently frozen cores known as palsas. Some fully new, small occurrences {{have been found in}} pounus, small peat humps over large areas in Lapland. The second main type of permafrost occurrence is located above the tree line on barren fell summits there permafrost means continuous temperature below 0 °C in the bedrock. Some massive cave ice has been found in Lapland, too. The climatic conditions at permafrost sites are still poorly know because the local topography affects the temperature conditions. Only sporadic recordings are available from the summits of fells and from <b>palsa</b> <b>mires.</b> In general, the mean annual air temperature for permafrost formation should be below - 1 °C. Snow depth seems to be the most critical factor for permafrost formation in Lapland: thin snow cover promotes frost penetration.

40|$|Global warming can {{substantially}} {{affect the}} export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat-permafrost to aquatic systems. The direct degradability of such peat-derived DOC, however, is poorly constrained because previous permafrost thaw studies have mainly addressed mineral soil catchments or DOC pools {{that have already been}} processed in surface waters. We incubated peat cores from a <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> to compare an active layer and an experimentally thawed permafrost layer with regard to DOC composition and degradation potentials of pore water DOC. Our results show that DOC from the thawed permafrost layer had high initial degradation potentials compared with DOC from the active layer. In fact, the DOC that showed the highest bio- and photo-degradability, respectively, originated in the thawed permafrost layer. Our study sheds new light on the DOC composition of peat-permafrost directly upon thaw and suggests that past estimates of carbon-dioxide emissions from thawed peat permafrost may be biased as they have overlooked the initial mineralization potential of the exported DOC...|$|E

The CO 2 /CH 4 flux measurements performed during the years 2001 - 2008 showed that the areas represented in the measurements were a relatively stable sink of carbon with an average annual rate of uptake amounting to on average - 46 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) including an equally stable loss through CH 4 emissions (18 - 22 g CH 4 -C m(- 2) y(- 1)).

40|$|Palsa mires are sub-Arctic {{peatland}} complexes, vulnerable ecosystems with {{patches of}} permafrost. Permafrost thawing in palsa mires occurs throughout Fennoscandia, {{probably due to}} local climatic warming. In palsa mires, permafrost thaw alters hydrological conditions, vegetation structure and microhabitat composition with unknown consequences for invertebrate fauna. This study's objectives were to examine the role of microhabitat heterogeneity {{and the effects of}} permafrost dynamics and thaw on oribatid mite communities in palsa mires. Oribatid mites were sampled in two palsa mires in Finland and Norway. Three different types of microhabitats were examined: graminoid-dominated wet sites, herb-dominated small hummocks and evergreen shrub-dominated permafrost-underlain palsa hummocks. The results indicate that permafrost dynamics are an important factor structuring oribatid mite communities in palsa mires. The community composition of oribatid mites differed remarkably among microhabitats. Six species were significantly more abundant in permafrost-underlain microhabitats in relation to non-permafrost microhabitats. None of the species identified occurred exclusively in permafrost-underlain microhabitats. Findings suggest that permafrost thaw may not have an impact on species diversity but may alter community composition of oribatid mites in <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of different sources of impact model uncertainty and combine this with probabilistic projections of climate change. Climatic envelope models describing the spatial distribution of <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> (mire complexes with permafrost peat hummocks) in northern Fennoscandia were calibrated for three baseline periods, eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques and 25 versions sampling the parameter uncertainty of each technique – a total of 600 models. The sensitivity of these models to changes in temperature and precipitation was analysed to construct impact response surfaces. These {{were used to assess}} the behaviour of models when extrapolated into changed climate conditions, so that new criteria, in addition to conventional model evaluation statistics, could be defined for determining model reliability. Impact response surfaces were also combined with climate change projections to estimate the risk of areas suitable for palsas disappearing during the 21 st century. Structural differences in impact models appeared to be a major source of uncertainty, with 60 % of the models giving implausible projections. Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was judged to be the most reliable technique for model extrapolation. Using GAM, it was estimated as very likely (> 90 % probability) that the area suitable for palsas is reduced to less than half the baseline area by the period 2030 – 2049 and as likely (> 66 % probability) that the entire area becomes unsuitable by 2080 – 2099 (A 1 B emission scenario).

40|$|Biogenic {{production}} and release of methane (CH 4) from thawing permafrost {{has the potential}} to be a strong source of radiative forcing. We investigated changes in the active layer microbial community of three sites representative of distinct permafrost thaw stages at a <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> in northern Sweden. The palsa site (intact permafrost and low radiative forcing signature) had a phylogenetically clustered community dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria. The bog (thawing permafrost and low radiative forcing signature) had lower alpha diversity and midrange phylogenetic clustering, characteristic of ecosystem disturbance affecting habitat filtering. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens and Acidobacteria dominated the bog shifting from palsa-like to fen-like at the waterline. The fen (no underlying permafrost, high radiative forcing signature) had the highest alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity, was dominated by Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota and was significantly enriched in methanogens. The Mire microbial network was modular with module cores consisting of clusters of Acidobacteria, Euryarchaeota or Xanthomonodales. Loss of underlying permafrost with associated hydrological shifts correlated to changes in microbial composition, alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity associated with a higher radiative forcing signature. These results support the complex role of microbial interactions in mediating carbon budget changes and climate feedback in response to climate forcing...|$|E
40|$|In {{this review}} I examine the {{geographical}} {{patterns of the}} Finnish mires {{and the role of}} regional and local factors that lead to their spatial differentiation. Finland can be divided into three roughly latitudinal mire zones (from south to north) : the raised bog zone, the aapa mire zone, and the <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> zone. The development of the raised bogs is linked to the dominance of Sphagnum, leading to the growth of a thick peat layer that rises above the level of the mineral soil. The gross morphology of an aapa mire is typically inclined and concave. Here, Sphagnum species are less dominant, probably due to spring floods which keep the mire surface minerotrophic. Both raised bogs and aapa mires have typically regularly-patterned microtopography. Seasonal movements of microtopographical features of the aapa mires reflect the morphological dynamism of the mires. Mires are also important sources of information re-garding past environmental changes. Their growth pattern is affected by envi-ronmental conditions and they respond sensitively to the changes in effective humidity and other climatic variables. Most of the present microtopographi-cal patterns have formed during the last 3, 000 years as a response to gradual cooling of climate. Research on Finnish peat deposits has shown, however, that not all peat-stratigraphical changes are caused by past climate variations. They can also be due to the natural growth dynamics of the mires, such as the long-term development towards drier conditions {{on the surface of the}} raised bogs, the rhythmic growth pattern of the low hummocks, and the local chang-es in water table resulting from growth of hummocks and hollows...|$|E
40|$|Two {{separate}} {{studies have}} been undertaken to improve estimates of methane emissions on a landscape scale. The first study took place over a <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> in northern Finland in August 1995. A tethered balloon and a tunable diode laser were used to measure profiles of methane in the nocturnal boundary layer. Using a simple box method or the flux gradient technique fluxes ranging from 18. 5 to 658 μmol m− 2 h− 1 were calculated. The large fluxes {{may be caused by}} advection of methane pockets across the measurement site, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of methane source strengths in the surrounding area. Under suitable conditions, comparison with nearby ground-based eddy-correlation results suggested that the balloon techniques could successfully measure fluxes on field scales. The second study was carried out by the NERC Scientific Services Atmospheric Research Airborne Support Facility using the Hercules C 130 operated by the United Kingdom Meteorological Research Flight. A flight path around the northern coastline of Britain under steady West-East wind conditions enabled the measurement of methane concentrations up- and down-wind of northern Britain. Using a simple one-dimensional, constant-source diffusion model, the difference between the upwind and downwind concentrations was accounted for by methane emission from the surface. The contribution to methane emissions from livestock was also modelled. Modelled non-agricultural methane emissions decreased with increasing latitude with fluxes in northern England being a factor of 4 greater than those in northern Scotland. Since the only major methane source in northern Scotland was peat bogs, these results indicated that emissions over northern England were dominated by anthropogenic sources.

40|$|Peatlands are wetland {{ecosystems}} that accumulate dead {{organic matter}} (i. e. peat) when plant litter production outpaces peat decay, usually under conditions of frequent or continuous waterlogging. Collectively, global peatlands store vast amounts of carbon (C), equalling if not exceeding the amount of C in the Earth’s vegetation, and they encompass a remarkable diversity of forms, from the frozen <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> of the northern sub-arctic to the lush swamp forests of the tropics, each with their own characteristic range of fauna and flora. In this review we explain what peatlands are, how they form and the contribution that peatland science can make {{to our understanding of}} global change. We explore the variety in formation, shape, vegetation type and chemistry of peatlands across the globe while stressing the fundamental features that are common to all peat-forming ecosystems. We consider the impacts that past, present, and future environmental changes, including anthropogenic disturbances, have had and will have on peatland systems, particularly in terms of their important roles in carbon storage and the provision of ecosystem services. The most widespread uses of peatlands today are for forestry and agriculture, both of which require drainage that results in globally significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), a greenhouse gas. Climatic drying and drainage also increase the risk of peat fires that are a further source of greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 and methane, CH 4) to the atmosphere, as well as causing negative human health and socio-economic impacts. We conclude our review by explaining the roles that palaeoecological, experimental and modelling studies can play in allowing us to build a more secure understanding of how peatlands function, how they will respond to future climate- and land management-related disturbances, and how best we can improve their resilience in a changing world...|$|R
40|$|Palsa peats {{are unique}} {{northern}} ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and {{characterized by a}} high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires. We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during {{the formation of the}} mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (&delta; 13 C) with depth, due to preferential release of 12 C during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in 13 C. The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was 14 C dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving...|$|R
40|$|Palsas and peat {{plateaus}} are permafrost mounds {{situated in}} mires with {{a core of}} ground ice. In northern Norway, palsas {{are located in the}} sporadic permafrost zone, and demarcate the southernmost limit of permafrost. Thus these landforms are vulnerable to climate change. Polar Regions contain immense amounts of organic carbon frozen in the soil. Permafrost degradation in these areas leads to emission of greenhouse gasses and may further accelerate the climate feedback on hydrology, vegetation, infrastructure and climate. Permafrost models have proven to be sufficient tools in predicting the future scenario on ground temperatures and climate change. However, such models implement parameterizations on soil, vegetation and climate data which encompass broad uncertainties, as land cover and soil stratigraphy are estimated on a coarse scale and interpolated for large regions. Moreover, permafrost is controlled by local factors, which may vary over small scales. Therefore, sufficient datasets and parameter initializations are crucial in order to reproduce the state of the art- and future ground temperature regimes in permafrost regions. The grid based transient thermal model CryoGrid 2 has been forced with stratigraphy- and snow scenarios based on in situ measurements on both a local- and regional scale for <b>palsa</b> <b>mires</b> in Finnmark. The resulting ground temperatures and thaw depths are in surprisingly well agreement with in situ GSTs and active layer depth for the region, and validated against a recent map over the palsa distribution in Finnmark. The presented soil and snow scenarios may benefit permafrost models in improvement on parameters which are controlling the temperature regimes for permafrost in organic rich soil. Moreover, palsa distribution in Finnmark is strongly dependent on the insulating organic peat layer, and low snow depth throughout the winter in order to survive the current climate. The average thaw depth for the widely distributed study sites are comparable with one another and measured to be roughly 0. 5 m.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{deals with}} the Holocene {{development}} of palsa mires in continental Europe, especially permafrost dynamics and its consequences on vegetation succession and peat accumulation. Peat deposits of four permafrost mires in boreal and subarctic northeastern European Russia and in northern oroboreal Finland have been studied using plant macrofossil analysis, (AMS) radiocarbon dating, dry bulk density and carbon content measurements. In addition, preliminary results are available from another <b>palsa</b> <b>mire</b> in northeastern European Russia. Modern vegetation has been investigated to support the interpretation of fossil plant assemblages. Earlier literature on vegetation, stratigraphy and dating of permafrost mires in Europe has been reviewed. The vegetation of palsa mires in general is well known. As a rule, palsas are dry ombrotrophic habitats, surrounded by wet flarks of variable trophic levels. There {{is a lack of}} information about vegetation in different small-scale habitats within palsa mires, which would have been useful when studying the permafrost-vegetation relationship. Although no functional indicator species of permafrost have been found, permafrost dynamics in peat stratigraphy can often be detected with high degree of probability based on changes in vegetation. Some plant assemblages and vegetation successions are typical on permafrost, while many species rarely grow on or near to permafrost. Relatively sudden changes between dry and wet mire environments and continuously dynamic conditions are good signs of permafrost impact. Also gradual changes towards drier conditions may be caused by permafrost; in these cases the timing of first permafrost aggradation is more difficult to ascertain and can usually be pronounced only in terms of maximum and minimum ages. Changes in peat accumulation rates and even hiatuses in stratigraphy are additional tools to support the interpretation on permafrost history at the studied sites. Dry organic matter and carbon accumulation rates for different developmental stages are calculated for the five studied mires. From earlier studies this information is not available. Accumulation rates in the permafrost environment are very variable: from zero or negative rates in old palsas to as high as 100 gC/m 2 yr in incipient palsas. On moist plateau palsas, permafrost flarks and in unstable permafrost conditions, accumulation continues at low to moderate rates. Thermokarst processes result in decomposition of former peat deposits with important consequences for the ecosystem carbon balance, especially in plateau palsa mires. Radiocarbon datings are available from 27 permafrost mires in continental Europe; only 5 of these are situated in Russia. Many of the published dates cannot be considered reliable as dating permafrost aggradation. Based on limited material, permafrost started to develop at latest about 3000 BP in mires of northern Russia and 2500 BP in Fennoscandia. Older permafrost formation is suggested for a few sites, but the evidence is insufficient to confirm this interpretation. The oldest preserved palsas are ca. 2500 – 2000 14 C years old. Most of the modern palsas are less than 600 14 C years old. Permafrost aggradation follows the major climate development in the Holocene, with formation being most active during the coldest stages. Global warming is expected to greatly affect the Arctic in the near future, which would imply significant changes in ecosystem functioning and carbon balance of permafrost mires.

Signs of degradation on aerial images from the 1950 s suggest that the tendency of decay started at latest in the 1950 s, and probably already from the warming period in the 1920 s- 1930 s. The most important factors for the increase in rate of degradation are most likely the increase in both temperature and precipitation observed in the last few decades. By utilizing Generalized Linear Model, the probability of presence of palsas increase with 1) decreasing freezing degree days, 2) a humped (nonlinear) curve of thawing degree days, 3) decreasing mean annual precipitation, 4) increasing mean summer precipitation, 5) increasing area of mire and 6) a humped (nonlinear) curve of area of water. Hierarchical Partitioning indicates that the climate variables are the most important group of variables to independently explain the distribution of palsas. The total area of palsas in Finnmark in 2010 based on GDM and aerial images is estimated to be roughly 0. 3 % of the total area of Finnmark. By utilizing the degradation rate and the total area of palsas in Finnmark, the total amount of potential carbon gas release in form of CH 4 from decay of palsas from 1960 to 2010 was estimated to be less than three times as much as the human emissions of CH 4 in Finnmark for one year (2010), and thus of rather minor importance in the global carbon cycle...|$|R
