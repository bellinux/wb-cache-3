5000|$|When the {{cofferdam}} was unwatered, {{the bottom}} of the enclosure was under a 22-ft. head of water from the river, and owing to the porous nature of the boulder and gravel formation considerable water was forced through the floor of the pit. The enclosure was 33 x 69 ft. and it was found impracticable to partition it off and place and hold concrete in the dry against the flow of water. As the low temperature of the water (35 deg. F. in November) and the large area (2,277 sq.ft.) made it impracticable to place concrete under water by bucket or pipe methods, the following plan was devised to meet the conditions of cold running water and low air Fig. 4. temperature. A large sheet of canvas was prepared in one piece, sufficient to entirely cover the bottom area and extend about 6 ft. up the sides of the enclosure. This canvas was [...] "formed-in" [...] by wooden forms along the sides and ends, to provide a runway for water around the edges. <b>Steam</b> <b>coils</b> were placed around the sides of the pit inclosure and the entire spaced was housed in and made warm. Sand and gravel delivered on cars were heated by being dumped on a platform holding <b>perforated</b> <b>steam</b> pipe <b>coils,</b> and hot water was used in mixing.|$|R

This inspection revealed at least three rather substantial holes as opposed to crack- or pit-like leak sites near the nominal solution level position on one particular <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> This section {{was removed from the}} evaporator vessel, and subsequent hot cell examination revealed extensive general corrosion on the process side of the coil with little or no attack on the steam side. Hot cell metallography confirmed intense general corrosion on the process side and, in addition, revealed shallow intergranular attack at the leading edge of corrosion. No pits or cracks were detected in this section of the <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> Laboratory corrosion tests with coupons of 304 L (and other high-alloy materials) isothermally exposed in a range of solutions similar to those expected in the evaporator reveal only very low corrosion rates below 40 % sodium hydroxide and the solution boiling point. However, {open_quotes}dried film{close_quotes} experiments revealed that much more dilute solutions became aggressive to stainless steel due to concentrating effects (evaporation and periodic wetting) at the air/solution interface. The high general corrosion rates observed on the failed coil section occurred at or near the air/solution interface and were attributed to such {open_quotes}splash zone{close_quotes} activity...|$|R

50|$|Unless the {{autoclave}} uses steam injection, {{the circulation}} fan carries {{the burden of}} assuring temperature uniformity throughout the working chamber. Since the heat flows from the source, whether electric resistance, <b>steam</b> <b>coil,</b> or firing tube, into the circulating air stream {{and then into the}} workload, the greater the airflow turbulence, the better the heat transfer, particularly with workloads that are heavy and dense.|$|R
50|$|Fixed roof {{tanks are}} meant for liquids with very high flash points, (e.g. fuel oil, water, bitumen etc.) Cone roofs, dome roofs and {{umbrella}} roofs are usual.

50|$|The easiest {{alternative}} {{to this is}} steam heating. This presupposes {{the presence of a}} boiler capable of generating steam at high enough pressures to reach the required temperatures. An existing high pressure steam plant is a fine thing to have on hand, and facilitates the use of <b>steam</b> <b>coils,</b> which are simple, compact, and easily controlled. The purchase price of <b>steam</b> <b>coil</b> heating is roughly comparable to that of electric heating, but the operating cost is dramatically lower. If high pressure steam is not available, consider a small dedicated boiler for the autoclave. The cost can be surprisingly low, making this alternative nearly as economical as direct gas-firing of an internal heat exchanger. It also enables you to run your autoclave on natural gas, propane, butane, or fuel oil, sometimes interchangeably if the boiler is set up for dual-fuel operation. Where gas supplies are susceptible to interruption, using a small high-pressure steam boiler to run the autoclave and ovens can be a life-saver when dual-fuel firing is incorporated.|$|R
5000|$|At this time, it was {{described}} by many as a [...] "city within a city". The distillery also housed a Smithy, Cooperage, saw mills, engineers, carpenters, painters and coppersmiths’ shops. Water for the distillery came from two deep wells dug underneath the site. Cellars were also dug underneath nearby streets to store maturing whiskey, while four stills and two wash stills, each holding 24,000 gallons, were heated by both fire and <b>steam</b> <b>coils</b> above.|$|R
50|$|Commercial smokehouses, mostly {{made from}} {{stainless}} steel, have independent systems for smoke generation and cooking. Smoke generators use friction, an electric coil {{or a small}} flame to ignite sawdust on demand. Heat from <b>steam</b> <b>coils</b> or gas flames is balanced with live steam or water sprays to control the temperature and humidity. Elaborate air handling systems reduce hot or cold spots, to reduce variation in the finished product. Racks on wheels or rails are used to hold the product and facilitate movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A {{convection heater}} may have an electrical heater element, a hot water <b>coil,</b> or a <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|R
50|$|Separators {{should be}} {{operated}} above hydrate-formation temperature. Otherwise hydrates may {{form in the}} vessel and partially or completely plug it thereby reducing {{the capacity of the}} separator. In some instances when the liquid or gas outlet is plugged or restricted, this causes the safety valve to open or the safety head to rupture. <b>Steam</b> <b>coils</b> can be installed in the liquid section of oil and gas separators to melt hydrates that may form there.

5000|$|A {{desiccant}} {{wheel is}} very similar to a thermal wheel, but with a coating applied {{for the sole purpose of}} dehumidifying, or [...] "drying", the air stream. The desiccant is normally silica gel. As the wheel turns, the desiccant passes alternately through the incoming air, where the moisture is adsorbed, and through a “regenerating” zone, where the desiccant is dried and the moisture expelled. The wheel continues to rotate, and the adsorbent process is repeated. Regeneration is normally carried out by the use of a heating coil, such as a water or <b>steam</b> <b>coil,</b> or a direct-fired gas burner.|$|R
5000|$|Most large marine diesels run {{on heavy}} fuel oil (sometimes called [...] "bunker oil"), which is a thick, viscous and almost {{flameproof}} fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk {{as it is a}} waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability. This is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and <b>steam</b> <b>coils</b> in fuel oil tanks. The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.|$|R
50|$|In the {{basement}}, {{one could}} find the mailing room for University Extension, storage for the Department of Paleontology’s collections, and restrooms. The basement is also where the heating and ventilation chambers could be found.

40|$|Steam {{has been}} widely used {{as the source of}} heating in {{commercial}} buildings and industries throughout the twentieth century. Even though contemporary designers have moved to hot water as the primary choice for heating, a large number of facilities still use steam for heating. Medical campuses with on-site steam generation and extensive distribution systems often serve a number of buildings designed prior to the mid- 1980 s. The steam is typically used for preheat as its high thermal content helps in heating the air faster and prevents coils from freezing in locations with extreme weather conditions during winter. The present work provides a comprehensive description of the various types of steam heating systems, <b>steam</b> <b>coils,</b> and valves to facilitate the engineer's understanding of these steam systems. A large percentage of the <b>steam</b> <b>coils</b> used in buildings are provided with medium pressure steam. Veterans Integrated Service Network and Army Medical Command Medical Facilities are examples which use medium pressure steam for heating. The current design manual for these medical facilities recommends steam at 30 psig be provided to these coils. In certain cases although the <b>steam</b> heating <b>coil</b> is designed for a 5 psig steam pressure, it is observed that higher pressure steam is supplied at the <b>coil.</b> A higher <b>steam</b> pressure may lead to excessive heating, system inefficiency due to increased heat loss, simultaneous heating and cooling, and increased maintenance cost. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of lowering steam pressure on the system performance. A 16 % reduction in temperature rise across the coil was found when the steam pressure in the coil was reduced from 15 psig to 5 psig. The rise in temperature with lower pressure steam was sufficient to prevent coil freeze-up even in the most severe weather conditions. Additional benefits of reduced steam pressure are reduced flash steam losses (flash steam is vapor or secondary steam formed when hot condensate from the coil is discharged into a lower pressure area, i. e., the condensate return line) and radiation losses, increased flow of air through the coil thereby reducing air stratification and reduced energy losses in the event of actuator failure. The work also involved evaluating the existing control strategies for the steam heating system. New control strategies were developed and tested to address the short comings of existing sequences. Improved temperature control and occupant comfort; elimination of valve hunting and reduced energy consumption were benefits realized by implementing these measures...|$|R

40|$|Westinghouse Hanford Company {{plans to}} install mixer pumps in double-shell waste tanks to {{mobilize}} and suspend settled sludge to allow eventual retrieval for treatment and permanent storage. The mixer pumps produce high momentum, horizontally directed jets that impact and mobilize the sludge and mix it into slurry for removal. There is {{concern that the}} force of the jet may damage tank internal components in its path. This test plan describes scaled experiments designed to characterize the velocity profiles of a near floor jet and to quantify the impact farces and drag coefficients of three tank components: radiation dry well, airlift circulator, and <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> The experiments will be conducted in water, at approximately 1 / 6 -scale, using one stationary nozzle to simulate the jet. To measure and confirm the velocity profile of the free, submerged jet, the horizontal and vertical velocity profiles will be measured at several distances from the nozzle. The profile will also be measured after the jet impinges upon the tank floor to determine the·extent of the change in the profile caused by impingement. The jet forces upon the test articles will be measured at a maximum of four velocities and a variety of test article orientations. Each orientation will represent a unique position of the test article relative to the jet and the tank floor. In addition, the <b>steam</b> <b>coil</b> will be tested in three rotational orientations because it is not symmetric. The highest jet velocity will be selected so that the Reynolds number of the test article in the model will match that of the prototype when operating at design conditions. The forces measured upon the model components will be used to calculate the force on the prototype components using geometric scaling factors. In addition, the model force measurements will be used to calculate the component&#x 27;s drag coefficient {{as a function of the}} component Reynolds number...|$|R

50|$|In batch distillation, {{the feed}} is charged to the still pot to which heat is {{supplied}} continuously through a steam jacket or a <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> As the mixture boils, it generates a vapour richer {{in the more}} volatile. But as boiling continue, concentration of more volatile in the liquid decrease. It is generally assumed that equilibrium vaporization occurs in the still. The vapour is led to a condenser and the condensate or the top product is collected in the receiver. At the beginning, the condensate will be pretty rich in the more volatiles, but the concentrations of the more volatiles in it decrease as the condensate keep on accumulating in the receiver. The condensate is usually withdrawn intermittently having products or cuts of different concentrations. Batch distillation is used when the feed rate is not large enough to justify installation of a continuous distillation unit. It may also be used when the constituents greatly differ in volatility. Figure 1 show the batch distillation setup.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this study}} is to analyze the causes of {{premature}} failure of <b>steam</b> generator <b>coil</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. Special attention is paid to corrosion damage processes within the welded joints. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations were conducted several segments of the coil made of seamless cold-formed pipes Ø 23 x 2. 3 mm, of austenitic stainless steel grade X 6 CrNiTi 18 - 10 according to EN 10088 - 1 : 2007. The working time of the device was 6 months. The reason for the withdrawal of the generator from the operation was leaks in the coil tube caused by corrosion damage. The metallographic investigations were performed with the use of light microscope and scanning electron microscope equipped with the EDX analysis attachment. Findings: Examinations of coil tubes indicated severe corrosion damages as pitting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and intergranular corrosion within base material and welded joints. Causes of corrosion was defined as wrong choice of austenitic steel grade, improper welding technology, lack of quality control of water supply and lack of surface treatment of stainless steel pipes. Research limitations/implications: It was not known the quality of water supply of steam generator and this was the reason for some problems in the identification of corrosion processes. Practical implications: Based on the obtained research results and literature studies some recommendations were formulated in order to avoid failures in the application of austenitic steels in the steam generators. These recommendations relate to the selection of materials, processing technology and working environment.
