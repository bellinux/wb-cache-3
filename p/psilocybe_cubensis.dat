Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis,</b> A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E

One of the most popular of this latter group was published in 1976 under the pseudonyms O.T.Oss and O.N.Oeric by Jeremy Bigwood, Dennis J. McKenna, K.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Harvard University became a testing ground for psilocybin, {{through the efforts}} of Timothy Leary and his {{associates}} Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (who later changed his name to Ram Dass). Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz pharmaceutical. Some studies, such as the Concord Prison Experiment, suggested promising results using psilocybin in clinical psychiatry. According to a 2008 review of safety guidelines in human hallucinogenic research, however, Leary and Alpert's well-publicized termination from Harvard and later advocacy of hallucinogen use [...] "further undermined an objective scientific approach to studying these compounds". In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public, psilocybin and other hallucinogenic drugs suffered negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws. In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year. Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit drugs in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these drugs in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being [...] "professionally marginalized".Despite the legal restrictions on psilocybin use, the 1970s witnessed the emergence of psilocybin as the [...] "entheogen of choice".

25|$|A {{number of}} ethnomycologists, {{including}} Terence McKenna, {{have suggested that}} most characteristics of manna are {{similar to that of}} <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis</b> mushrooms, notorious breeding grounds for insects, which decompose rapidly.

25|$|McKenna {{stated that}} due to the {{desertification}} of the African continent at that time, human forerunners were forced from the increasingly shrinking tropical canopy in search of new food sources. He believed {{they would have been}} following large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis,</b> a dung-loving mushroom often found growing out of cowpats.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Food of the Gods, McKenna {{proposed}} that the transformation from humans' early ancestors Homo erectus to the species Homo sapiens mainly {{had to do with}} the addition of the mushroom <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis</b> in its diet, an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the species diverged from the Homo genus). McKenna based his theory on the main effects, or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Psilocybe tampanensis {{contains}} the psychedelic compounds psilocin and psilocybin, and is consumed for recreational and entheogenic purposes. The species {{was found to}} be one of the most popular psychoactive mushrooms confiscated by German authorities in a 2000 report, behind <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis,</b> Psilocybe semilanceata, and Panaeolus cyanescens. The alkaloid content in the confiscated samples ranged from not detectable to 0.19% psilocybin, and 0.01 to 0.03% psilocin. According to mycologist Michael Beug, dried fruit bodies can contain up to 1% psilocybin and psilocin; in terms of psychoactive potency, Stamets considers the mushroom [...] "moderately to highly active".|$|E
500|$|The {{toxicity}} of psilocybin is low. In rats, the {{median lethal dose}} (LD50) when administered orally is 280milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), approximately {{one and a half}} times that of caffeine. When administered intravenously in rabbits, psilocybin's LD50 is approximately 12.5mg/kg. [...] Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis</b> mushrooms, and so nearly [...] of dried mushrooms, or [...] of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a [...] person to reach the 280mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6grams, 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6milligrams. The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances assigns psilocybin a relatively high therapeutic index of 641 (higher values correspond to a better safety profile); for comparison, the therapeutic indices of aspirin and nicotine are 199 and 21, respectively. The lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels, and has rarely been documented—, only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms (without concurrent use of other drugs) {{have been reported in the}} scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin.|$|E

Amanita muscaria mushrooms have properties that are arguably more deliriant than psychedelic.

2500|$|Psilocybin, a {{naturally}} occurring chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis,</b> is being studied {{for its ability}} to help people suffering from psychological disorders, such as obsessive–compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported to stop cluster and migraine headaches. A double-blind study, done by the Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. [...] In the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events. [...] On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However, the anxiety went away after a short period of time. Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol and cigarettes.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the partial}} {{completion}} of his studies, and his mother's death from cancer in 1971, McKenna, his brother Dennis, and three friends {{traveled to the}} Colombian Amazon in search of oo-koo-hé, a plant preparation containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT). [...] Instead of oo-koo-hé they found fields full of gigantic <b>Psilocybe</b> <b>cubensis</b> mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, {{at the urging of}} his brother, McKenna {{was the subject of a}} psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to bond harmine (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms) with their own neural DNA, through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists’ Philosopher’s Stone which they viewed as a [...] "hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter". McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with [...] "Logos": an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his [...] "Novelty Theory".|$|E

Like his previous studies, he did not only study the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, but he focused part of his research in social impacts, learning about these fungi directly from the local shaman, María Sabina. His ecological research in hallucinogenic mushrooms determined the environmental conditions for these organisms to grow: oak and coniferous forests between 1,300 to 2,600 msl.
