50|$|Arsenic(V) {{compounds}} typically {{feature the}} functional groups RAsO(OH)2 or R2AsO(OH) (R = alkyl or aryl). Biomethylation of arsenic compounds {{starts with the}} formation of methanearsonates. Thus, trivalent inorganic arsenic compounds are methylated to give methanearsonate. S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor. The methanearsonates are the precursors to dimethylarsonates, again by the cycle of reduction (to methylarsonous acid) followed by a second methylation. This dimethyl compound is Cacodylic acid ((CH3)2AsO2H), figures prominently throughout the chemistry of organoarsenic compounds. In contrast, the dimethylphosphonic acid is less significant in the corresponding chemistry of phosphorus. Cacodylic acid arises from the methylation of arsenic(III) oxide. <b>Phenylarsonic</b> <b>acids</b> can be accessed by the reaction of arsenic acid with anilines, the so-called Bechamp reaction.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of the diet on the chick growth response to different antibiotics and an antimicrobial compound. The design was a factorial comprising five diets differing in their grain component, four drugs, and four levels of each drug in the diets. Each treatment had four replicate groups of 10 day-old male birds each. The replicates from each treatment were separated into two pair and placed in two contiguous animal rooms. Replicate groups within each room were placed at random. Data on body weight and feed consumption were collected up to the time the birds were three weeks of age. The results indicate that chick growth was significantly affected by diet type. Diets containing corn or wheat gave greater growth than those with barley or rye as the grain component.

We report here on formulation studies aiming to produce a parenteral product with the primary objective of restricting GSAA transformation from GSAO to protect maximal potency of the molecule. Successful anti-oxidant strategy primarily came from pH control. The presence of glycine was proposed to form a stabilising five-membered oxazarsolidinone ring with arsenoxide and this was investigated using potentiometric assays. We report on these tritration studies identifying a pK(a) of 8. 2 associated with an As-OH, but not confirming ring presence. An original clinical trial pharmaceutical was successfully realised by lyophilisation of 50 mg/mL GSAO in 100 mM glycine solution, pH 7 to obtain a 48 -month shelf life for the freeze-dried vials. The Phase I clinical study is ongoing in patients with solid tumours refractory to standard therapy...|$|E
40|$|Clark 1 (diphenylarsine chloride) and Clark 2 (diphenylarsine cyanide) {{were used}} as {{chemical}} weapon agents (CWA), and the soil contamination by these CWA and their degraded products, diphenyl and phenyl arsenicals, {{has been one of}} the most serious environmental issues. In a series of comparisons in toxicity between trivalent and pentavalent arsenicals we investigated differences in the accumulation and toxicity of phenylarsine oxide (PAO(3 +)) and <b>phenylarsonic</b> <b>acid</b> (PAA(5 +)) in rat heart microvascular endothelial cells. Both the cellular association and toxicity of PAO(3 +) were much higher than those of PAA(5 +), and LC 50 values of PAO(3 +) and PAA(5 +) were calculated to be 0. 295 muM and 1. 93 mM, respectively. Buthionine sulfoximine, a glutathione depleter, enhanced the cytotoxicity of both PAO(3 +) and PAA(5 +). N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reduced the cytotoxicity and induction of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) mRNA in PAO(3 +) -exposed cells, while NAC affected neither the cytotoxicity nor the HO- 1 mRNA level in PAA(5 +) -exposed cells. The effect of NAC may be due to a strong affinity of PAO(3 +) to thiol groups because both NAC and GSH inhibited the cellular accumulation of PAO(3 +), but PAA(3 +) increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cellular proteins. These results indicate that the inhibition of protein phosphatases as well as the high affinity to cellular components may confer PAO(3 +) the high toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{carbonic}} anhydrase (CA, EC 4. 2. 1. 1) superfamily of metalloenzymes catalyzes the hydration {{of carbon}} dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. The catalytically active form of these enzymes incorporates a metal hydroxide derivative, the formation {{of which is the}} rate-determining step of catalytic reaction, being affected by the transfer of a proton from a metal-coordinated water molecule to the environment. Here, we report the cloning, expression, and purification of a particular CA, i. e., nacrein-like protein encoded in the genome of the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas (previously known as Crassostrea gigas). Furthermore, the amino acid sequence, kinetic constants, and anion inhibition profile of the recombinant enzyme were investigated for the first time. The new protein, CgiNAP 2 X 1, is highly effective as catalyst for the CO₂ hydration reaction, based on the measured kinetic parameters, i. e., kcat = 1. 0 × 10 ⁶ s(- 1) and kcat/KM = 1. 2 × 10 ⁸ M(- 1) ·s(- 1). CgiNAP 2 X 1 has a putative signal peptide, which probably allows an extracellular localization of the protein. The inhibition data demonstrated that the best anion inhibitors of CgiNAP 2 X 1 were diethyldithiocarbamate, sulfamide, sulfamate, phenylboronic acid and <b>phenylarsonic</b> <b>acid,</b> which showed a micromolar affinity for this enzyme, with KIs in the range of 76 - 87 μM. These studies may add new information on the physiological role of the molluskan CAs in the biocalcification processes...|$|E
40|$|Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4. 2. 1. 1) are metalloenzymes which {{catalyze}} the hydration {{of carbon}} dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the α-, β-, and/or γ-CA families. In the last decade, enzymes from some of these pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila, have been cloned and characterized in detail. These enzymes were shown to be efficient catalysts for CO 2 hydration, with kcat values {{in the range of}} (3. 4 – 8. 3) × 105 s− 1 and kcat/KM values of (4. 7 – 8. 5) × 107 M− 1 ·s− 1. In vitro inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates, were also reported for the two β-CAs from this pathogen, LpCA 1 and LpCA 2. Inorganic anions were millimolar inhibitors, whereas diethyldithiocarbamate, sulfamate, sulfamide, phenylboronic acid, and <b>phenylarsonic</b> <b>acid</b> were micromolar ones. The best LpCA 1 inhibitors were aminobenzolamide and structurally similar sulfonylated aromatic sulfonamides, as well as acetazolamide and ethoxzolamide (KIs in the range of 40. 3 – 90. 5 nM). The best LpCA 2 inhibitors belonged to the same class of sulfonylated sulfonamides, together with acetazolamide, methazolamide, and dichlorophenamide (KIs in the range of 25. 2 – 88. 5 nM). Considering such preliminary results, the two bacterial CAs from this pathogen represent promising yet underexplored targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems common to most of the clinically used antibiotics, but further studies are needed to validate them in vivo as drug targets...|$|E
40|$|The Gram-positive {{bacterium}} Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is a human}} {{respiratory tract}} pathogen that contributes significantly to global mortality and morbidity. It was recently shown that this bacterial pathogen depends on a conserved beta-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4. 2. 1. 1) for in vitro growth in environmental ambient air and during intracellular survival in host cells. Hence, {{it is to be}} expected that this pneumococcal carbonic anhydrase (PCA) contributes to transmission and pathogenesis of the bacterium, making it a potential therapeutic target. In this study, purified recombinant PCA has been further characterized kinetically and for inhibition with a series of inorganic anions and small molecules useful as leads. PCA has appreciable activity as catalyst for the hydration of CO(2) to bicarbonate, with a k(cat) of 7. 4 x 10 (5) s(- 1) and k(cat) /K(m) of 6. 5 x 10 (7) M(- 1) s(- 1) at an optimum pH of 8. 4. Inorganic anions such as chloride, bromide, iodide, cyanate, selenocyanate, trithiocarbonate, and cyanide were effective inhibitors of PCA (K(I) s of 21 - 98 muM). Sulfamide, sulfamic acid, phenylboronic, <b>phenylarsonic</b> <b>acid,</b> and diethyldithiocarbamate showed inhibition constants in the low micromolar/submicromolar range (K(I) s of 0. 61 - 6. 68 muM), whereas that of the sulfonamide acetazolamide was in the nanomolar range (K(I) s 89 nM). In conclusion, our results show that PCA can effectively be inhibited by a range of molecules that could be interesting leads for obtaining more potent PCA inhibitors. PCA might be a novel target for designing antimicrobial drugs with a new mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|Stacking {{techniques}} used independently {{and also with}} a high-sensitivity cell (HSC) were employed to optimise sensitivity and detection limits in the direct photometric detection of the following eight arsenic species by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) : arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenylarsonic acid (Roxarsone), p-aminophenylarsonic acid (p-ASA), 4 -nitrophenylarsonic acid (4 -NPAA), and <b>phenylarsonic</b> <b>acid</b> (PAA) (target analytes). The stacking mechanisms, optimised stacking and separation conditions, and concentration sensitivity enhancement factors were discussed and compared for (i) normal stacking mode (NSM, sometimes {{also referred to as}} field-amplified stacking) in an uncoated fused-silica capillary in the counter-electroosmotic flow (EOF) mode, (ii) large-volume sample stacking (LVSS) with polarity switching, and (iii) the less often applied stacking method of co-EOF NSM stacking with EOF reversal using a poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) -coated capillary. The optimal injection volumes were 7. 4, 60 and 17. 2 % of the total capillary volume, for the above three methods, respectively. LVSS with polarity switching gave the lowest limit of detection (LOD). The use of the HSC further reduced the LOD of each target analytes by a factor of 5 - 8 times. By combining LVSS and HSC, LODs of the target analytes could be reduced by a factor of 218 - 311, to 5. 61, 9. 15, 11. 1, and 17. 1 g/L for As(III), DMA, MMA, and As(V), respectively. The method was demonstrated to be applicable to the determination of the target analytes in tap water and lake water, with recoveries in the range of 89. 4 - 103. 3 %...|$|E
