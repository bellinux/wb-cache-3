40|$|OPENLAND 3 {{belongs to}} a suite of {{computer}} programs included in the POLLSCAPE simulation model. These programs {{make it possible to}} calculate estimates of pollen loadings in lake basins or bogs using vegetation data. OPENLAND 3, written in Visual Basic 6, is designed to produce appropriate vegetation data files from vegetation maps stored in a Geographical Information System. It calculates percentage cover of plant taxa in concentric circles at increasing distances from a central point, using either real digitised maps or hypothetical maps (simulated landscape designs). Such data are necessary for simulation of pollen dispersal and deposition, and for calculation of pollen productivity estimates and relevant source area of pollen using specific mathematical models developed by palynologists, such as the Prentice-Sugita model. OPENLAND 3 also produces output files needed to run RS-OPEN, another program included in POLLSCAPE, in order to obtain estimates of pollen loadings in lakes or bogs. The rationale of OPENLAND 3, the algorithm used, and a modification of RS-OPEN (RS-OPEN 2) are described. A test of the programme capability using a detailed vegetation map from southern Sweden shows that simulations using OPENLAND 3 produce coherent results. <b>Pollen</b> <b>loading</b> for species characterized by high pollen productivity is higher than for species with low pollen productivity. Altering the wind speed has also a significant effect on <b>pollen</b> <b>loading.</b> As wind speed increases, the proportions of the light pollen decrease, while the heavy pollen types increase, which is what empirical data suggest, and what the model predicts in earlier studies.

40|$|Honey {{bees are}} a model {{system for the}} study of {{division}} of labor. Worker bees demonstrate a foraging division of labor (DOL) by biasing collection towards carbohydrates (nectar) or protein (pollen). The Reproductive ground-plan hypothesis of Amdam et al. proposes that foraging DOL is regulated by the networks that controlled foraging behavior during the reproductive life cycle of honey bee ancestors. Here we test a proposed mechanism through which the ovary of the facultatively sterile worker impacts foraging bias. The proposed mechanism suggests that the ovary has a regulatory effect on sucrose sensitivity, and sucrose sensitivity impacts nectar loading. We tested this mechanism by measuring worker ovary size (ovariole number), sucrose sensitivity, and sucrose solution load size collected from a rate-controlled artificial feeder. We found a significant interaction between ovariole number and sucrose sensitivity on sucrose solution load size when using low concentration nectar. This supports our proposed mechanism. As nectar and <b>pollen</b> <b>loading</b> are not independent, a mechanism impacting nectar load size would also impact pollen load size...|$|E

The fact is conditioned upon assumption of unchangeable linear relationship between abundance of pollen and the vegetation {{that is responsible for}} its production. Calibration of this relationship is experimentally performed on modern pollen samples and current vegetation. Relative pollen produktivity etimates (PPEs) represents basic parameters for the conversion of proportional pollen data into the vegetational ones. Their knowledge is indispensible for the quantitative vegetation restoration and for the simulating of the processes of pollen dispersion and deposition. PPEs estimation is performed by ERV model which corrects nonlinear relationship of proportional pollen and vegetation data back to the linear relationship.

40|$|International audienceInformation on past {{land cover}} {{in terms of}} {{absolute}} areas of different landscape units (forest, open land, pasture land, cultivated land, etc.) at local to regional scales is needed to test hypotheses and answer questions related to climate change (e. g. feedbacks effects of land-cover change), archaeological research, and nature conservancy (e. g. management strategy). The palaeoecological technique best suited to achieve quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation is pollen analysis. A simulation approach developed by Sugita (the computer model POLLSCAPE) which uses models based on the theory of pollen analysis is presented together with examples of application. POLLSCAPE has been adopted as the central tool for POLLANDCAL (POLlen/LANdscape CALibration), an international research network focusing on this topic. The theory behind models of the pollen-vegetation relationship and POLLSCAPE is reviewed. The two model outputs which receive greatest attention in this paper are the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) and <b>pollen</b> <b>loading</b> in mires and lakes. Six examples of application of POLLSCAPE are presented, each of which explores a possible use of the POLLANDCAL tools and a means of validating or evaluating the models with empirical data.

40|$|In April and May 2010, {{a natural}} {{population}} of Cerinthe major (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) was investigated with regard to: floral morphology, phenology, sexual receptivity during anthesis, {{the production of}} nectar and its sugar and amino acid content. The pollinator array of this species was also investigated. Cerinthe major has showy, pentamerous, hermaphroditic flowers with a deep yellow corolla tube arranged on numerous scorpioid inflorescences. Nectar and pollen are the main floral rewards for pollinators. The arrangement of stamens limits access to nectar and promotes <b>pollen</b> <b>loading</b> onto pollinator bodies as they force their way towards the source of nectar. By limiting the direct exposure of nectar to the environment, the corolla tube and the arrangement of anther filaments seemingly protect nectar from evaporation resulting from high temperatures and low relative humidity during flower anthesis. The green, annular nectary located {{at the base of}} the ovary lobes is composed of a very thin epidermis enclosing a dense mass of parenchyma. The epidermis lacks stomata, and the thin cuticle has an irregular surface. The parenchyma cells do not store starch during the pre-secretory stage, suggesting that immediate photosynthesis is the most likely source of nectar carbohydrates. Generally, anthesis lasts 4 – 5 days; the gynoecium becomes fully receptive on the second day and this is synchronous with anther dehiscence. Since nectar production begins during the bud stage, a substantial volume is available for flower visitors at anthesis. Nectar production decreases drastically in senescent flowers and, if not consumed, the nectar can be re-absorbed.

40|$|Floral visitation {{resulting}} in interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) from non-native or invasive plant species {{can affect the}} reproductive fitness of native plant species through pollen allelopathy, stigma clogging, stylar clogging, and ovule (seed) discounting. The prevalence of IPT {{and the importance of}} pollinators in mediating its impacts, however, remain poorly understood. Although most traditional methods for examining visitor movement are insufficient for determining rates of potential IPT, one promising alternative is the use of DNA barcoding. Because floral visitors eat, collect or unknowingly obtain pollen, nectar and other floral tissues, plant DNA should be recoverable from their bodies, permitting molecular identification of <b>pollen</b> <b>loads.</b> To assess the utility of plant DNA barcodes for tracking floral visitation, I collected 89 honeybees (Apis mellifera) and 49 bumblebees (Bombus spp.) from a disturbed forest edge in Columbus, Georgia and analyzed their <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> using the plastid DNA barcode region rbcL. The identities of monospecific <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> were determined by comparing sequences to a local plant reference library containing 22 native and 27 non- native plant species. The overall recovery of rbcL sequences from <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> was relatively high (41. 6 %). Based on local BLASTn analysis, 95 % of monospecific <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> were identifiable to the species level. Rates of heterospecific visitation were quite high (77 %), as indicated by pure heterospecific (15 %) and mixed <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> (62 %).

In 1994 stigma <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> {{were inversely related to}} population size and were significantly lower than in 1993. The lower stigma <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> in 1994 were associated with adverse weather conditions (high rainfall), which are known to affect pollinator activity and may have led to competition among plants for pollinators in large populations. However, population size was not correlated with percentage of fruit set or percentage of seed set in either year. The lack of fruit and seed set differences between large and small populations, particularly in 1994, likely resulted from the small amount of pollen needed to trigger fruit and seed production.

40|$|Fillers {{are often}} {{incorporated}} in polymer matrices {{in order to}} improve cost, mechanical, thermal, and transport properties. This work explores the hypothesis that pollen, a natural particle, {{has the potential to be}} an effective biorenewable reinforcing filler due to its unique surface architectures, high strength, chemical stability, and low density. Pollens from sources such as ragweed plants are ubiquitous natural materials that are based on sustainable, non-food resources. Pollen is a remarkable example of evolutionary-optimized microscale particle with structures and/or chemistries tailored for effective adhesion to a variety of surfaces and protection of genetic material under different dynamic and environmental conditions. The pollen shell is perhaps the most chemically resistant naturally occurring material. As many pollens achieve pollination simply by being carried by wind, they are very light-weight. These properties make pollen an attractive option as a natural filler for polymers. This research aims to characterize pollen interfacial properties and utilize pollen as an effective reinforcing filler in polymer materials. In this work, interfacial properties are characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the BET method, and inverse liquid chromatography (ILC). These techniques were useful in determining the effect of surface treatments and further chemical modifications on pollen interfacial properties. Characterizing these properties allowed for improved understanding and utilization of pollen as a filler by revealing the enhanced surface interactions and surface properties of acid-base treated pollens when compared to as received untreated pollens. Epoxy and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) matrices were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of pollen as a filler, as a function of <b>pollen</b> <b>loading</b> and surface treatments/chemical modifications. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine interfacial morphology, a high throughput mechanical characterization device (HTMECH) was used to determine mechanical properties, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine glass transition behavior. In epoxy, pollen was an effective load bearing filler only after modifying its surface with acid-base hydrolysis. In PVAc, pollen was an effective load bearing filler only after an additional functionalization with a silane coupling agent. Finally, the species of pollen incorporated in PVAc matrices was varied in order determine the effect of the size of surface nano- and micro- structures on wetting, adhesion, and composite properties. Composites containing pollen displayed enhanced wetting and interfacial adhesion when compared to composites with smooth silica particles. Additionally, it was observed that pollen with smaller surface structures were wetted more effectively by the polymer matrix than pollen with larger structures. However, mechanical properties did not suggest significant changes in interfacial adherence with varied pollen microstructure size. The results of this work highlight the feasibility and potential of utilizing pollen as a natural filler for creating high strength, light-weight polymer composites with sustainable filler. Ph.

40|$|Plant mating {{systems are}} {{influenced}} by the amount and genetic composition of pollen grains deposited on stigmas and by the ability of recipients to discriminate among pollen from different sources. We describe an experimental procedure that uses limiting and excess pollinations with mixtures of genetically marked pollen to partition the siring success of donors into three components: prefertilization gamete attrition (failure of male gametophytes before fertilization), pollen competitive ability (differences in pollen tube growth rate), and postfertilization gamete attrition (embryo abortion). Regression models for the relationships of <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> size with each pollen 2 ̆ 7 s siring success and total recipient fecundity indicate that, for mixtures of self and outcross pollen, differences in gamete attrition, pollen competitive ability, and postfertilization success will have distinct and predictable effects on mating patterns and fecundity. Mating systems that rely on differences in pollen competitive ability result in outcrossing frequencies that increase with <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> size, with seed production remaining high over a broad range of load sizes. In contrast, for mating systems governed by differences in gamete attrition, the frequency of outcrossed progeny will not vary greatly with <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> size, but reduced fecundity will be expected over a wider range of <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> sizes. These predictions were confirmed by analyzing the response of siring success and fecundity in response to <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> size in the tristylous Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae).

40|$|Selection among male gametophytes {{can affect}} the perfonnance of a {{population}} of plants. There is reason to expect such competition {{to be important in}} buckwheat because it has a few, fast-growing pollen, many of which carry detrimental alleles, that compete for a single egg cell. Flowers of cultivated buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) often receive natural <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> of fewer than 10 pollen grains. These observations raise the question of when seed production in buckwheat is limited by pollen delivery, and whether small increases in <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> could result in gametophytic selection through pollen grain competition. The <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> necessary to obtain beneficial competition has not been previously detennined for buckwheat. In this experiment using greenhouse-grown buckwheat plants, embryo sac penetration by pollen tubes was universal with 10 or more pollen grains. However, seed production increased with <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> up to 30 grains per flower. Larger <b>pollen</b> <b>loads,</b> which intensify selection among gametophytes, resulted in more vigorous progeny. Seedlings produced from high <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> (15 - 20 pollen grains) were larger (40 % by weight) than those from low <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> (5 <b>pollen</b> grains). These results are evidence that pollen grain competition can occur in buckwheat with benefits for progeny perfonnance. It is also possible for selection among donors to occur through pollen competition if they differ in pollen tube growth rate. Pollen tubes from different donors did differ in growth rate. Pollen from different donors applied to different flowers on the same plant set the same proportion of seed, indicating that there was no selective abortion. However, when donor pollen was applied to individual flowers, one donor in each competing pair was consistently more successful because of better pollen perfonnance. This indicates that pollen competition can influence the paternal success of buckwheat plants. Pollen competition occurs in buckwheat and can therefore have a significant influence on the genetic structure and vigor of populations...|$|R

We investigated the impacts of plant mate and visiting insect availabilities on pollen transport and receipt in a mass-flowering and facultative autogamous shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum). First, we recorded insect visits to R.  ferrugineum in plant patches of diverse densities and sizes. Second, we analyzed the <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> transported by R.  ferrugineum pollinators and deposited on stigmas of emasculated and intact flowers, in the same patches. Overall, pollinators (bumblebees) transported much larger <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> than the ones found on stigmas, and the pollen deposited on stigmas included a high proportion of conspecific pollen. However, comparing <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> of emasculated and intact flowers indicated that pollinators contributed only half the conspecific pollen present on the stigma.

Finally, self-pollen completely buffered the detrimental effects on pollination of patch fragmentation and pollinator failure.

This thesis examines processes associated to varying pollination, with focus on plant responses. The first aim was to examine the possibility and constraints for short-term evolution of flower size in Raphanus raphanistrum. The results showed that there exists a possibility for pollinator-mediated short-term evolution of flower size in the study species. Flower size was strongly correlated to plant size. Since flower size cannot evolve separately from plant size, this correlation may constitute a constraint to the evolution of flower size. The second aim was to determine how varying <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> affects later flowering, reproduction and growth of maternal plants. High <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> treatment resulted in larger or more flowers on late flowers, which may enhance pollen dispersal and reproductive success, while the total seed mass was the same between treatments. The results indicate that the study species R. raphanistrum, Sinapis arvensis and Brassica napus have plastic responses in floral traits according to the present pollination level. The third aim was to determine how varying <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> affects seed quality and offspring vigor. The results suggest that high <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> had no positive effects on seed quality or offspring vigor due to pollen competition. Instead, seed mass determined seed quality and offspring vigor in the three study species and low <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> treatment resulted in highquality offspring due to heavier seeds.

Meanwhile, in the wet season, feeder usage was more evenly distributed across species, {{with the exception of the}} Volcano Hummingbird, Selasphorus flammula, which occupies the last place in the dominance hierarchy. <b>Pollen</b> <b>loads</b> of hummingbirds captured near feeders were low in abundance (more than 50 % of captured individuals had zero or low <b>pollen</b> <b>loads),</b> and low in species richness (96 % of the hummingbirds with pollen from only one plant genus, Centropogon). Overall <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> increased during the dry season coinciding with peaks in flower availability, although the majority of captured hummingbirds carried no pollen. Mist nets located 3 km from La Georgina returned few captures (one-to-three specimens) per sampling date, contrasting with observations made before feeders were present. These results suggest that sugar-water feeders gather hummingbirds in over considerable distances drawing them away from flowers. The competitive and antagonistic pattern shown between feeders and flowers indicate that natural pollination system could be significantly altered. Supplementing hummingbirds with food seems likely to interfere with pollination networks already stressed by many anthropogenic effect...|$|R

Natural reservations of Chrášťanský vrch and Vysoká Běta are in the distance of flying range from the colony. According to the pollen grains were detected taxons of Blanský les Protected Landscape Area?s flora in native preparates and estimated its importance {{from the point of view}} of honeybee nourishment in the stated region. The attention was given to the structure of vegetation in honeybee colony surroundings and the occurrence of important biotopes of pollen plants...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{population}} density and population size on stigma <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> and fruit set in Anemone canadensis, a xenogamous self-incompatible species. In 1993, 1994, and 1995, we examined 13 - 17 populations, with densities ranging from one to 39 flowering ramets per square meter and sizes ranging from 25 to 27, 000 flowering ramets. In 1993, stigmas received fewer pollen grains than in 1994 or 1995. In 1993 and 1995, population size and fruit set were significantly and positively related, and in 1993, both population density and stigma <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> were significantly and positively related to fruit set. Stigma <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> was not significantly related to population density or size. Our results indicate that {{the effects of}} population density and population size on plant reproduction in A. canadensis represent a range of outcomes influenced by differences between years in the quality (self vs. outcross) of pollen moved. We hypothesize that small populations typically have poor fruit set because they consist of relatively few genets and infrequently receive large amounts of outcross pollen, particularly when they are relatively close to large populations in protected areas...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the pollination ecology of shrub species in an upper montane forest in Costa Rica, where {{the diversity of}} insect visitors is much below that of the well-studied tropical forests of lower elevations. Data are presented on visitation rates by the tropical bumblebee Bombus ephippiatus to flowers of three species, <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> on bumblebee bodies, and <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> on stigmas of two of` the species. High visitation rates to flowers of Palicourea brenesii were found, a species which produces copious amounts of nectar. Visitation rates to nectarless Leandra subseriata and Deppea grandiflora were much lower. Conspecific pollen comprised on average 90 % of the <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> on stigmas of Leandra, while Palicourea stigmas carried only 26 to 55 % conspecific pollen, With only two ovules per flower, fruit and seed set in Palicourea were not limited by a shortage of conspecific pollen. In Leandra, 20 - 25 % of the flowers received too few conspecific pollen grains for maximum seed set among 440 ovules per flower. Individual bumblebees showed no constancy in plant choice, judging from {{the high number of}} different pollen types (6 - 12) on their bodies. Workers returned frequently to the same Palicourea patch without visiting nearby Palicourea plants, which suggests the use of foraging paths...|$|R
40|$|Gathering {{information}} on the bee foraging plants in a given area is of primary importance {{in the development of}} any apiculture industry. Analysis of the honey produced in hives as well as the stored <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> help to evaluate the sources of nectar and pollen used by honey bees and their behavioural pattern in the selection of preferences for certain plants as food. Our previous melissopalynology study focused on the analysis of the Omani honey from hives in 14 locations of Muscat and the Al Batinah regions. Our current study examines the pollen pellets collected from those same areas. A total of 249 pollen pellets from 22 honeycombs that were collected by Apis florea and Apis mellifera honeybees were processed and the pollen types were identified using light and scanning electron microscopy. Each <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> was designated as a unifloral, bifloral or multifloral type. Each plant taxon identified was categorized as being utilized by honeybees for pollen only, nectar only or for both pollen and nectar. A pollen reference collection of 105 local flowering plants was prepared that enabled us to identify most of the pollen types. The quantification of 94 pollen types revealed that 67 of them belonged to 39 plant families, all of which are represented in both the <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> and the honey samples. Seven pollen genera were found in the <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> only and suggest that those plants were visited by bees just for pollen. Twenty pollen types appear only in the honey samples and suggest that bees visited them only for nectar. Major bee foraging plant species include: Ziziphus spina-christi, Acacia tortilis, Prosopis cineraria, Prosopis juliflora, Maerua crassifolia, Citrus spp., Zygophyllum spp. and Fagonia spp. These data provide a guide to the optimal utilization of floral resources by honeybees in these regions...|$|R
500|$|As {{with other}} Banksia species, B.brownii {{is a heavy}} {{producer}} of nectar, {{and serves as a}} food source for a range of nectariferous birds, mammals and insects. Honeyeaters such as Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (western spinebill) and Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird) are frequent visitors that often carry heavy <b>pollen</b> <b>loads,</b> making them important pollinators. Nocturnal mammals such as Rattus fuscipes (bush rat) and Tarsipes rostratus (honey possum) also carry heavy <b>pollen</b> <b>loads,</b> but the foraging behaviour of bush rats suggests that these may transfer pollen only over very short distances. [...] Invertebrate visitors include the introduced Apis mellifera (western honeybee), native bees, flies and ants; bees appear to be effective pollinators, but ants and flies forage only at the base of flowers and do not come in contact with plant pollen.|$|R
30|$|Although {{there was}} a general {{congruency}} between wind data, <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> and cross-pollination, it is evident that wind data and <b>pollen</b> <b>load</b> do not solely explain the directional extent of cross-pollination and that swirling winds may have contributed to this incongruence. Based on the logarithmic equations of cross-pollination over distance, 45 m is sufficient to minimize cross-pollination to between < 1.0 % and 0.1 %, 145 m for < 0.1 % to 0.01 % and 473 m for < 0.01 % to 0.001 %. However, compared to this, a theoretical isolation distance of 135 m is required to ensure a minimum level of cross-pollination between < 1.0 % and 0.1 %, 503 m for < 0.1 % to 0.01 % and 1.8 km for < 0.01 % to 0.001 % based on high values of cross-pollination.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} under laboratory condition to study the consumption of some proteinic diets and their effect on hypopharyngeal glands (HPG) development during nursing period. The {{results showed that the}} bee bread and the <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> mixture with sugar (1 : 1) were more consumed by honeybee workers followed by Nectapol® and Yeast-Gluten mixture. The lowest consumption amount was recorded with traditional substitute. Clear differences were found in HPG development under feeding with different diets. The maximum development degree was observed when fed with bee bread followed by <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> and mixture from Yeast, Gluten and sugar (1 : 1 : 2). The acinal surface of HPG showed clear difference under feeding with difference diets.

40|$|High {{quality of}} bee pollen for {{commercial}} purpose is required. In {{order to attend}} the consumer with the best identification of the botanical and floral origin of the product, 25 bee pollen batches were investigated using two techniques of pollen grain preparation. The first started to identify <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> of different colors in two grams of each well mixed batch, and the second to identify pollen grains in a pool made of all the <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> comprised in two grams. The best result was obtained by this last technique, when a pollen grain suspension was dropped on a microscope slide and circa 500 pollen grains were counted per sample. This analysis resulted in the recognition of monofloral and bifloral pollen batches, while {{the use of the}} first technique resulted in all samples receiving a heterofloral diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Humans are {{interested}} in the knowledge of <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> composition due to their nutritional value and therapeutical benefits. Its palynological composition depends on the local flora surrounding the beehive. So, the presence of a specific composition of pollen types in a sample indicates its geographical origin. Currently, pollen origin is manually determined by an expert palynologist counting the proportion of pollen types analyzing the pollen of the hive with an optical microscopy. This procedure is tedious and expensive for its systematic application. We present an automatic methodology to discriminate <b>pollen</b> <b>loads</b> of genus Rubus and Cytisus based on texture image classification. The method consists of three steps: after selection non-blurring regions of interest (ROIs) in the original image, a texture feature vector for each ROIs is calculated, which is used to discriminate between pollen types. An statistical evaluation of the algorithm is provided and discussed...|$|R
