5|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} (cancer of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland)</b> is {{the rarest}} cause of OFC, accounting for about 0.5% {{of all cases}} of hyperparathyroidism. OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma is difficult to diagnose.|$|E
5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The artery ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The artery is also found to be the only supply of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> in rare cases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> are {{two pairs}} of glands usually {{positioned}} behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> The two <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> while the lower two are called the inferior <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> Healthy <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|R

25|$|VDR {{activation}} in the intestine, bone, kidney, and <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> cells {{leads to}} the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and {{to the maintenance of}} bone content.|$|E
500|$|Hyper{{parathyroid}}ism is {{the state}} {{in which there is}} excess parathyroid hormone circulating. This may cause bone pain and tenderness, due to increased bone resorption. Due to increased circulating calcium, there may be other symptoms associated with hypercalcemia, most commonly dehydration. [...] Hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a benign proliferation of chief cells in single gland, and rarely MEN syndrome. This is known as primary hyperparathyroidism, which is generally managed by surgical removal of the abnormal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland.</b>|$|E
500|$|The thyroid ima artery (thyroidea ima artery, arteria thyroidea ima, thyroid artery of Neubauer or {{the lowest}} thyroid artery) is an artery {{of the head}} and neck. It is an {{anatomical}} variant that, when present, supplies blood to the thyroid gland primarily, or the trachea, the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and the thymus gland (as thymica accessoria) in rare cases. It has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when {{one or both of the}} inferior thyroid arteries are absent and in a few cases the only source of blood to the thyroid gland. It varies in origin, size, blood supply, and termination, and occurs in only 3–10% of the population. Because of the variations and rarity, it [...] may lead to surgical complications.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> are {{variable}} in number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> Rarely, the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|R
50|$|When {{secondary}} hyperparathyroidism is corrected and the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> remain hyperfunctioning, {{it becomes}} tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The {{treatment of choice}} is surgical removal of three and one half <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> produce <b>parathyroid</b> hormone (PTH), {{a hormone}} needed to {{maintain}} adequate amounts of calcium in the blood. Removal results in hypoparathyroidism and a need for supplemental calcium and vitamin D each day. In {{the event that the}} blood supply to any one of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> is endangered through surgery, the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland(s)</b> involved may be re-implanted in surrounding muscle tissue.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 25% of {{medullary}} thyroid {{cancer is}} genetic in nature, {{caused by a}} mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. [...] This form is classified as familial MTC. When MTC occurs by itself it is termed sporadic MTC. [...] When it coexists with tumors of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and medullary component of the adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma) it is called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).It was first characterized in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|Osteoclasts are {{regulated}} by several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> calcitonin from the thyroid gland, [...] and growth factor interleukin 6 (IL-6). This last hormone, IL-6, {{is one of}} the factors in the disease osteoporosis, which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand. Note that these molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast.|$|E
50|$|Parathyroid chief cells {{make up the}} {{majority}} of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>gland</b> along with adipocytes and oxyphil cells. Parathyroid chief cells have large amounts of organelles associated with protein synthesis.

50|$|In {{the neck}} are the thyroid and <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> that secrete hormones that control {{metabolism}} and blood calcium levels. The four <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> are situated upon the dorsal (back) {{surface of the}} thyroid gland.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRenal {{hyperparathyroidism}} usually {{occurs in}} {{chronic renal failure}} patients on regular dialysis. However, renal hyperparathyroidism resulting from intrathyroidal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> is an uncommon condition. We herein present {{the case of a}} 35 -year-old woman who has been on hemodialysis for 20 years. She had renal hyperparathyroidism with generalized weakness and bone pain for 2 years. The patient initially underwent parathyroidectomy at a local institution, during which two large <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were resected from the right side (no <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were found on the left side); however, the surgical procedure was unsuccessful, and the patient had persistent renal hyperparathyroidism after the operation. She was then transferred to our hospital and ectopic intrathyroidal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were localized by neck ultrasonography and technetium- 99 m sestamibi scans with single-photon emission computed tomography imaging preoperatively. A left thyroid lobectomy was performed and two intrathyroidal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were found. The patient recovered uneventfully and her symptoms resolved. Therefore, clinicians {{should be aware of the}} possibility of renal hyperparathyroidism resulting from intrathyroidal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> in cases where the renal hyperparathyroidism persists after parathyroidectomy...|$|R
5000|$|In 1891 Gley was {{the first}} to {{discover}} the importance of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> which are four (or more) small endocrine glands lying close or embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. These glands had been recently discovered as an anatomical entity in 1880, however their importance was not understood at the time. Gley realized that the cause of tetany after thyroid operations was the inadvertent destruction of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> He demonstrated this by removing the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> from laboratory animals and witnessing their deaths from tetany. Because of his discovery, <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> have sometimes been referred to as [...] "Gley's glands".|$|R

5|$|The major {{function}} of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> do this by secreting parathyroid hormone.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the fetus}} reaches {{four weeks of}} gestation, the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> begins to develop. The human embryo forms five sets of endoderm-lined {{pharyngeal}} pouches. The third and fourth pouch are responsible for developing into the inferior and superior <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> respectively. The third pharyngeal pouch encounters the developing thyroid gland and they migrate down to the lower poles of the thyroid lobes. The fourth pharyngeal pouch later encounters the developing thyroid gland and migrates to the upper poles of the thyroid lobes. At 14 weeks of gestation, the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> begin to enlarge from 0.1 mm in diameter to approximately 1 - 2 mm at birth. The developing <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> are physiologically functional beginning in the second trimester.|$|R

Malformations in the GCM2 gene have resulted in hypoparathyroidism. Studies on SOX3 gene mutations have demonstrated that it plays a role in parathyroid development. These mutations also lead to varying degrees of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|The {{superior}} <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} inferior thyroid arteries.

40|$|Two-hundred seventy-four {{patients}} with primary hyperparathyroidism had selective removal of enlarged <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> Biopsies {{were taken from}} all <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> Normal-size glands were not resected irrespective of their histological appearance. After a mean follow-up of 13. 5 years the rates of persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism were, respectively, 3. 6 % and 0. 7 %. Transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred in 24 % and 2. 5 % of the patients. The microscopic appearance of enlarged glands and of biopsies taken from normal-size glands were reviewed by two pathologists. Normal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were distinguished from abnormal glands fairly accurately (sensitivity 93 %, specificity 80 %). Microscopic classification of abnormal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> as adenomas or hyperplastic glands correlated poorly with the gross classification as single or multigland disease. Flow cytometric DNA analysis of paraffin embedded parathyroid tissue showed significant differences for DNA index, % S-phase and % G 2 M (p< 0. 001). Differentiating single from multigland disease by means of DNA analysis was not possible. In conclusion, removal of only enlarged <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> results in acceptable rates of persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Biopsies should only be taken sparingly to prevent transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism. Microscopic examination and flow cytometric DNA analysis can differentiate normal from abnormal <b>parathyroid</b> <b>glands</b> but are unable to differentiate abnormal glands into single or multigland disease...|$|R

Sestamibi imaging is correlated with the number and activity of the mitochondria within the parathyroid cells, such that oxyphil cell parathyroid adenomas {{have a very high}} avidity for sestamibi, while chief cell parathyroid adenomas have almost no imaging quality at all with sestambi. Some researchers have also attempted to quantify or characterize the imaging capabilities of parathyroid glands by the MDR gene expression. Approximately 60 percent of parathyroid adenomas may be imaged by sestamibi scanning. The natural distribution of etiologic causation for primary hyperparathyroidism is roughly 85% solitary adenomas, 10-15% diffuse hyperplasia, and 1% cancer.|$|E
