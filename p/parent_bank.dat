25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the <b>parent</b> <b>bank</b> alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the income statement. In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

Using panel data for 149 closed or divested foreign bank subsidiaries across 54 countries from 1997 to 2009, we show that the problems encountered by subsidiaries were not the main cause of divestment by <b>parent</b> <b>banks.</b> Based on data for the <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> of the closed subsidiaries, our results show that those <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> reported significant financial weaknesses prior to closing their international operations. Therefore, we assume that a multinational bank's decision to close or sell a subsidiary in another country is based mainly on problems in the home country, with a lesser factor being the weak performance of the foreign subsidiary...|$|R

The degree of foreign ownership in Baltic banking is quite high, thus majority credit growth was largely financed by heavy borrowing of the biggest players in the lending market from the <b>parent</b> <b>banks.</b> Consequently, there is a sizeable inflow of debt (denominated in foreign currency) into the <b>banking</b> sector from <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> to support the credit growth in the Baltic states.

Drawing on {{the experiences of the}} Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States and bank restructuring in the Central European transition economies, we argue that the original AMC design will not be successful in resolving the existing non-performing loans (NPLs) nor will it prevent the creation of new bad loans. We recommend a modification of the current proposal that redefines the relationships between the <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> and the AMCs by transferring the deposits of problem enterprises along with their NPLs from <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> to AMCs. bad loans, stae-owned banks, asset management companies, China...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how solvency and wholesale funding shocks to 84 OECD <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> affect the lending of 375 foreign subsidiaries. We find that parent solvency shocks {{are more important}} than wholesale funding shocks for subsidiary lending. Furthermore, we find that parent undercapitalization does not affect the transmission of shocks, while wholesale shocks transmit to foreign subsidiaries of parents that rely primarily on wholesale funding. We also find that transmission is affected by the strategic role of the subsidiary for the parent and follows a locational, rather than an organizational pecking order. Surprisingly, liquidity regulation exacerbates the transmission of adverse wholesale shocks. We further document that <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> tend to use their own capital and liquidity buffers first, before transmitting. Finally, we show that solvency shocks have higher impact on large subsidiary banks with low growth opportunities in mature markets...|$|R

5000|$|Following the {{liberalization}} of financial services in the Baltic states, banks from the Nordic region were competing for market shares in the Baltic states. Thus, this fuelled in capital inflows and credit expansion into the Baltic states. In Latvia, the foreign-owned banks captured more than 60% of financial sectors, while in Lithuania and Estonia exceeded more than 90%. Due to ample global liquidity, the <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> from the Nordic region were able to offer very low interest rates to the Baltic populations. A significant consequence from the [...] "cheap" [...] credit from the <b>parent</b> <b>banks</b> led to historical low interest rate loan (especially mortgage loans) in the Baltic States. Coupled with overly-optimistic attitudes on the integration with the European Union, investors’ risk appetite on property speculation were higher.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of adjustments {{in the provision of}} cross-border loans by internationally active banks. For the period from 2002 to 2010, we look at quarterly transaction data (excluding valuation effects) on long-term loans issued by the largest 69 German banking groups to the private sector of 66 countries. We show that the <b>parent</b> <b>bank's</b> lending adjustment is based almost exclusively on supply-side determinants, in particular on bank-specific factors. However, foreign countries' demand and risk characteristics become more relevant when loans are distributed by banks' affiliates located abroad. Focusing on risk measures such as the <b>parent</b> <b>bank's</b> ratio of Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, we find that rising risk aversion among banks curbed cross-border lending during the financial crisis, especially at a later stage following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. However, we find a threshold at around 11 % of the Tier I capital ratio above which an increase in the ratio does not curb lending anymore. [...] cross-border lending,banks,financial crisis...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data for}} 265 banks in Central and Eastern European Countries {{for the period}} of 1995 - 2003, this paper {{analyses}} the differences in profitability between domestic and for-eign banks. We show that foreign banks, especially greenfield institutions, earn higher profits than domestic banks. However, this effect is acquired rather than inherited, since there is evidence that foreign banks tend to take over less profitable institutions. Profits of foreign banks in CEECs also exceed profits of their <b>parent</b> <b>banks,</b> explaining the reasons for their entry. Further, we study benefits and costs of foreign ownership by analyzing de-terminants of profitability for domestic, takeover, and greenfield banks. Profits of foreign banks are less affected by macroeconomic conditions in their host countries. However, greenfield banks are sensitive to the situation of their <b>parent</b> <b>banks.</b> Only domestic banks enjoy higher profits in more concentrated banking markets, whereas takeover banks suffer from diseconomies of scale {{due to the fact that}} they acquired large institutions. foreign banks; bank profits; multinational banking; transition economies...|$|R
