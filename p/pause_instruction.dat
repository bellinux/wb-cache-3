The calculator's settings include a numbered flag which specifies whether equations in programs are to be evaluated or displayed at run time. Since an equation can contain any sequence of characters, it may be composed as a message to be displayed. After displaying a message, the program either stops until [...] is pressed, or if a [...] (<b>pause)</b> <b>instruction</b> follows the message then it pauses for one second before continuing.|$|E

Stack trace of each thread may be used to see the chain of function calls that led to the <b>paused</b> <b>instruction.</b> A list of watches allows one to view the values of selected variables and expressions.

40|$|Hyperthreaded (HT) and {{simultaneous}} multithreaded (SMT) processors are {{now available}} in commodity workstations and servers. This technology is designed to increase throughput by executing multiple concurrent threads on a single physical processor. These multiple threads share the processor’s functional units and on-chip memory hierarchy {{in an attempt to}} make better use of idle resources. Most OpenMP applications and runtime libraries have been written assuming an Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP), not an SMT, model. Threads executing on the same physical SMT processor have interactions on data locality and resource sharing that do not occur on traditional SMPs. This work focuses on tuning the behavior of an OpenMP runtime library to improve the performance of applications executing on SMPs with SMT processors. First we implement and evaluate three techniques that have been asserted as important on HT processors: the use of <b>pause</b> <b>instructions</b> in spin loops, incorporation of per-thread stack offsets in slave threads, and lock padding. After implementing these techniques in the Omni OpenMP runtime library, we discover that both pause instructiosn and lock padding show noticible improvements, while stack offsets show negligible gains. We then propose three adaptive loop schedulers: a region-based scheduler, a loop-based scheduler and hardware counter based scheduler. These novel schedulers determine effective hierarchical schedules for individual parallel regions or loops to exploit the unique nature of SMPs with HT processors. We compare the performance of our three proposed schedulers against several standard schedulers using the SPEC and NAS OpenMP benchmark suites. We show that schedule selection must be done at the granularity of loops not regions, and that our loop-based adaptive schedulers outperform all other approaches on average, increasing speedup on average by over 25 % when all thread contexts are used.

40|$|Background: Speech rate {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in overall speech intelligibility in fluent speakers and is an important variable affecting fluency in people who stutter (PWS). There are no normative speech rate data for South African English (SAE). In PWS, attempts to manipulate speech rate for improved fluency have mostly focused on articulation rate. Revisiting the role of pauses in speech rate and the manipulation of both frequency and duration of pauses was deemed necessary to investigate a potentially valuable alternative strategy to assist PWS in rate reduction and possible improved fluency. Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the speech rate and pause use for first language (L 1) and second language (L 2) SAE fluent speakers and PWS in both monologue and reading tasks. In addition, this study investigated if the manipulation of pause use could increase fluency in L 1 and L 2 PWS given six sessions of <b>pause</b> <b>instruction</b> in SAE. Methods: 80 fluent speakers (40 L 1 SAE and 40 L 1 isiZulu) and 14 PWS (7 L 1 SAE and 7 L 1 isiZulu) were asked to engage in a 2 -minute monologue and a reading task in order to calculate the mean speech rate, frequency of pauses and average pause duration for each group. Following baseline measures, the 14 PWS were randomly assigned to either immediate or delayed intervention consisting of 6 sessions addressing manipulation of pauses. A crossover treatment design allowed for repeated measures of speech rate and pause use across three data collection periods. Results: Results revealed L 1 and L 2 SAE fluent speakers differed significantly in speech rate and frequency of pauses in reading and in pause length in the monologue. L 1 and L 2 PWS differed in frequency of pauses in reading. L 1 fluent speakers and PWS differed in speech rate and both measures of pause use in reading. L 2 fluent speakers and PWS differed in frequency of pauses in the monologue. Results from the crossover intervention for the PWS revealed a significant decrease in percentage syllables stuttered (...|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren reached Mount Carmel Church and <b>paused</b> for <b>instructions.</b> Hancock's corps came up from behind and the two units got hopelessly mixed up on the road. The corps commanders decided that Hancock would {{continue}} along the Telegraph Road to Chesterfield Bridge while Warren would cross the North Anna upstream at Jericho Mills. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming that any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W. Henagan had created a dirt redoubt, and there was a small party guarding the railroad bridge downstream, but all of the other river crossings were left undefended. Grant had been presented with a golden opportunity if he moved quickly enough to take advantage of it.|$|R
