It is shown that when consumers preferences over recycling di®er, the monopolist can price discriminate between consumers leading to socially suboptimal recycling. In {{the absence of any}} externalities, the analysis can be viewed as amodelofcoupons or mail-in rebates which work as price discrimination devices. The role of government subsidies and additional deposits to eliminate suboptimal recycling is also analyzed. Finally, the model is extended to incorporate hustling, i. e., allowing consumers to recycle packages discarded Recycling and reuse of product <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> are common phenomena in most advanced economies today.

40|$|During {{preparation}} and heating {{of food in}} microwave ovens temperatures up to 150 degree C - also {{in the absence of}} susceptors - can occur dependent on the time of treatment, structure and fat content of food. Usually, the temperatures hardly exceed 100 degree C. To evaluate the quality of <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> for microwave use with regard to the overall migration, the total amount of substances transferred to the food simulant Tenax was determined by extraction with diethyl-ether and subsequent gaschromatographic analysis of the extract and, in some cases, gravimetrically after evaporation of the solvent. The amount of transferred compounds obtained in this way was dependent on the type of plastic. Whereas, for plastics on the base of polyester and polysulphon, mass transfer was found to be mostly in the range of the detection limit of 0. 1 mg/qdm, the corresponding values for polypropylene were found to be remarkably higher. The method described here allows a rapid and economic exam ination of <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> at higher temperature. Possible sources of faults are taken into consideration and discussed. In principle the method allows the identification of the migrated substances using suitable detectors. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated to some extent, but not a general correlation with the desorbed amounts. Furthermore, in contrast to the physical examinations, the sensory evaluation did not provide such a clear distinction between the different types of plastic...|$|E

This technique is based on the mystery of the dimensional ratio of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt and its effect on the growth of microorganisms when applied on pyramidal food <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers.</b> The shape power is the only responsible factor for the preservation effect without any other physical or chemical treatment.

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) is {{currently}} storing several {{metric tons of}} plutonium in various forms {{in a variety of}} facilities throughout the DOE complex. Since the cessation of weapons production in 1990, many of these facilities with plutonium in storage have not operated. Since the shutdown was regarded as temporary, little attempt was made at that time to empty the process lines of plutonium, or to place the plutonium in containers or packages that would provide safe storage for extended periods of time. As a result, the <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> providing interim storage are vulnerable to failure through leakage, rupture and other modes, and pose potential hazards to facility workers, the public and the environment.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Management (EM) Office of Nuclear Material & Spent Fuel, EM- 21, tasked the CSSG {{to perform}} a scoping study to {{determine}} the feasibility of increasing the fissile mass loading limits for specified TRUPACT-II and HalfPACT <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers.</b> The results of the scoping study may provide insights and technical guidance for establishing fissile mass loading limits at waste generator sites and at the waste repository. The goal is to reduce costs of transporting fissile material to the WIPP from EM's various closure sites. This report documents {{the results of the}} scoping study and demonstrates that it is feasible to significantly increase the fissile mass loading limits in the TRUPACT-II and HalfPACT <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers.</b> Depending upon the particular payload containers used, the number of shipments to WIPP could be reduced by at least a factor of 2 and as much as a factor of 16 and the number of total payload containers required ''down-hole'' at WIPP could be reduced by at least a factor of 2 and as much as about 6. These cost savings result simply from applying a more realistic criticality analysis model rather than the very conservative, hypothetical, bounding analysis used to support the existing fissile mass loading limits. However, the applications of existing and developmental computational tools, nuclear data, and experiments from the DOE Nuclear Criticality Safety Program have the potential to further reduce transportation and disposal container costs on the order of 7 % to 17 %. It is suggested that EM proceed with an effort to do the required formal analyses and pursue SARP supplements to take advantage of these savings. The success of these analyses are dependent upon the availability {{of the majority of the}} infrastructure supported by the DOE Nuclear Criticality Safety Program as defined in the Five-Year Plan for the program. Finally, it should be noted that these potential cost savings are based only on a criticality safety feasibility study and do not take into account other technical factors from other disciplines that may or may not impact the final approved loadings. The CSSG concurs that the results of this scoping study addresses the tasking statement provided by EM- 21...|$|E
40|$|Various nuclear-based {{techniques}} are being explored {{for use in}} non-intrusive inspection. Their development is motivated {{by the need to}} prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to thwart trafficking in illicit narcotics, to stop the transport of explosives by terrorist organizations, to characterize nuclear waste, and to deal with various other societal concerns. Non-intrusive methods are sought in order to optimize inspection speed, to minimize damage to <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers,</b> to satisfy environmental, health and safety requirements, to adhere to legal requirements, and to avoid inconveniencing the innocent. These inspection techniques can be grouped into two major categories: active and passive. They almost always require the use of highly penetrating radiation and therefore are generally limited to neutrons and gamma rays. Although x-rays are widely employed for these purposes, their use does not constitute nuclear technology and therefore is not discussed here. This paper examines briefly the basic concepts associated with nuclear inspection and investigates the related nuclear data needs. These needs are illustrated by considering four of the methods currently being developed and tested...|$|E

40|$|Objective: It {{is often}} {{believed}} that people overeat the foods they like. We investigate whether environmental cues such as packaging and container size are {{so powerful that}} they can increase our intake of foods that are less palatable. If so, there are be important implications for improving the consumption of healthy (but less preferred) foods. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, 158 Philadelphia moviegoers (57. 6 % male; 28. 7 years) were randomly given a medium (120 grams) or a large (240 grams) container of free popcorn that was either fresh or stale (14 days old). Following the movie, consumption measures were taken along with measures of perceived taste. Outcome Measures and Results: Moviegoers who were given fresh popcorn ate 45. 3 % more popcorn when {{it was given to}} them in large containers. This container-size influence is so powerful that when the popcorn was disliked (in the case of the stale, 14 day old popcorn), people still ate 33. 6 % more popcorn when eating from a large container than a medium-size container. Conclusions and Implications: Even when foods are not palatable, these results caution that large <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> can lead to overeating. A silver lining of these findings may be that portion size {{can also be used to}} increase the consumption of less-than-favorable healthy foods, such as raw vegetables...|$|E
