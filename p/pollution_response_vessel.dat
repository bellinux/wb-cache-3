The Ministry of Public Safety and Security maintains a unified command system as the primary entity in charge of handling maritime pollution and strengthens the private-public military partnership to ensure perfect response within the golden time. We form the emergency response team for rapid containment of maritime pollution and to maintain a 24-hour response system. In order to improve national pollution control capabilities, we reinforced assets such as oil spill <b>response</b> <b>vessels.</b> We protect the clean sea by focusing on high risk areas to prevent pollution incidents from happening.|$|R

5000|$|Both , a British destroyer, and , an Irish Naval Service vessel {{responded to}} the scene. The Russian vessels left the area around 18 February, having {{completed}} refuelling. Samples of the oil were taken for analysis at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's (MCA) labs in Edinburgh, and Ireland has requested samples of oils carried on board the Russian vessels from the Russian Embassy in Dublin. [...] The Irish Coast Guard contracted a tug, the Celtic Isle, equipped with oil dispersal equipment from a Cork based company. The tug assessed and attempted to deploy skimmers on 18 February, but the Irish Coast Guard director has said that international experience showed that success could be very limited. “Unless this fuel oil can be sprayed within {{the first day of}} a spill, {{it is very difficult to}} deal with, and collection at sea has a success rate of about 1%”. [...] The Celtic Isle was stood down by 26 February after recovery of the oil met with little success. [...] The EMSA’s <b>pollution</b> <b>response</b> <b>vessel</b> for this Atlantic region, the Galway Fisher, also made its way to Cork to take on board anti-pollution equipment and remain on stand-by. [...] The MCA laboratory confirmed that the oil involved was a light crude oil on 21 or 22 February. [...] Further test results announced on 26 February revealed the oil to have come from Russia.|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies of}} air {{pollution}} effects on respiratory health report significant modification by sex, although results are not uniform. Importantly, it remains unclear whether modifications are attributable to socially derived gendered exposures, to sex-linked physiological differences, or to some interplay thereof. Gender analysis, which aims to disaggregate social from biological differences between males and females, may help to elucidate these possible sources of effect modification. Studies of children suggest stronger effects among boys in early life and among girls in later childhood. The qualitative review describes possible sources of difference in air <b>pollution</b> <b>response</b> between women and men, which may vary by life stage, coexposures, hormonal status, or other factors.
