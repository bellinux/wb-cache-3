When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more <b>practical</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to reach the cemetery was by railway. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery, and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery. The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The rails, and in particular the sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of calculus {{states that}} differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply {{the definition of a}} definite integral, the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> of computing definite integrals.

25|$|The only <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> {{to capture}} {{most of the}} fusion energy is to trap the {{neutrons}} inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough to fission both 235U and 238U) or plutonium, the result is fission {{and the release of}} 180 MeV of fission energy, multiplying the energy output tenfold.|$|E

They include calorimetry, which is the commonest <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> of finding internal energy differences. The needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{was known}} to exist here, {{but there was no}} <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to extract it. Its main use to that time had been as a {{medicine}} for both animals and humans. In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now Oil Creek State Park. Drake hired a salt well driller, William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. After many difficulties, they finally drilled a commercially successful well on August 27. It was an event that changed the world, beginning with the surrounding vicinity.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10cm difference in path length. The most <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With negative dispersion, light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive dispersion, it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the stretcher is usually designed with positive dispersion and the compressor with negative dispersion.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp of the infraorder Caridea {{are more}} closely related to {{lobsters}} and crabs than they are {{to the members of the}} sub-order Dendrobranchiata (prawns). Biologists distinguish these two groups based on differences in their gill structures. The gill structure is lamellar in carideans but branching in dendrobranchiates. The easiest <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to separate true shrimp from dendrobranchiates is to examine the second abdominal segment. The second segment of a carideans overlaps both the first and the third segment, while the second segment of a dendrobranchiate overlaps only the third segment. They also differ in that carideans typically have two pairs of chelae (claws), while dendrobranchiates have three. A third group, the Stenopodidea, contains around 70 species and differs from the other groups in that the third pairs of legs is greatly enlarged.|$|E

25|$|Alleyways {{leading down}} to the Thames became the only <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to cross over the river via boat as Old London Bridge was {{frequently}} blocked. Wharves and latter rudimentary docks began {{to be used to}} offload goods but most ships simply moored in lines {{in the middle of the}} river and their cargo was rowed to shore and carried up shoreline stairs. Some of the Thames original shoreline did remain free from the construction of houses or walls. The access to the river was via, shore, gaps between houses used to launch boats. Samuel Pepys in his diaries of 1665 mentions making landfall at Dukes Shore for example before wading up the beach to Narrow Street. As late as the 1850s nearly all new bridges were built with stairs at both ends, and generally on both sides.|$|E
25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This is a <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> to store it but the gas must be stored at â260Â°F (â162Â°C).|$|E
25|$|Since Burgundy is land-locked, {{very little}} of its wine left the region in Medieval times, when wine was transported in barrels, meaning that {{waterways}} provided the only practical means of long-range transportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a <b>practical</b> <b>way</b> was the area around Auxerre {{by means of the}} Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive vineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as vin de Bourgogne in early texts. The wines from CÃ´te d'Or would then be called (vin de) Beaune. These wines first became famous in the 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by SaÃ´ne and RhÃ´ne after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, Beaune was generally seen as the finest wine, and better than anything available in Rome at that time.|$|E
