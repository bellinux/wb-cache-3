5|$|Before the {{understudy}} rehearsal, Jim's fiancée Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) {{helps him}} learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's <b>payslip</b> to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the report}} Pop Goes the <b>Payslip</b> the advice {{organisation}} Citizens Advice highlighted examples {{of people in}} work who are worse off under Universal Credit than under the 'legacy' benefits Universal Credit is replacing. Similarly, a report from 2012 by Save the Children highlights how [...] "a single parent with two children, working full-time on or around the minimum wage, could {{be as much as}} £2,500 a year worse off under the new Credit system".|$|E
5000|$|However, {{vocabulary}} {{referring to}} the figurative [...] "pay cheque" [...] persists in some languages, but this commonly refers to a <b>payslip</b> or stub rather than an actual cheque. Some company payrolls have eliminated both the paper cheque and stub, in which case an electronic image of the stub is available on a website. Most of the provinces and territories in Canada allow employers to issue electronic payslips if the employees have confidential access to it {{and are able to}} print it.|$|E
50|$|When a seaman {{paid off}} {{at the end of}} their {{engagement}} they would receive in addition to their pay, a detailed <b>payslip</b> showing hours worked at basic and overtime rates and monies paid in subs during the voyage or while in port, and a Discharge Slip which specified the name of the ship on which they had served, the rating in which they sailed (i.e., Able Seaman or Fireman) and the dates of their service aboard. It also gave indication of their ability at work and their conduct during that period.|$|E

50|$|Mrs Hall was {{dismissed}} from being head {{chef at the}} Epping Forest Golf Club because she became pregnant. She claimed unfair dismissal based on the Equal Treatment Directive 76/207/EC and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (now the Equality Act 2010). However, in September 1994, she had received a raise to £250 and her <b>payslip</b> still showed £250 gross and £186.65 net, which apparently demonstrated tax avoidance. She asked and was told “It’s {{the way we do}} business.” For five months she continued to work. The employer argued that because Mrs Hall was party to an illegal contract, she was not entitled to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, anti-fascist and left-wing groups {{have claimed that}} many of Golden Dawn's members have close {{relationships}} or collaborated with Greece's Central Intelligence Service, the predecessor to the National Intelligence Service, and accused Michaloliakos of working for the KYP from the 1980s. One piece of evidence for this, published in a Greek newspaper, was a <b>payslip</b> showing the names of both Michaloliakos and Konstantinos Plevris as operating for the agency, which Golden Dawn claimed was a forgery. The [...] "payslip", which was supposedly [...] "signed" [...] by a [...] "Hellenic army's officer", was a fake, as was proven in court after Golden Dawn's complaint.|$|E

50|$|A <b>payslip,</b> pay stub, paystub, pay advice, or {{sometimes}} paycheck stub, is a document an employee receives {{either as a}} notice that the direct deposit transaction has gone through, or {{is attached to the}} paycheck. Each country has laws as to what must be included on a pay slip, but which would typically include details of the gross wages for the pay period and the taxes and any other deductions the employer is required to make by law; as well as other personal deductions such as retirement plan or pension contributions, insurances, garnishments, or charitable contributions taken out of the gross amount to arrive at the final net amount of the pay, also including the year to date totals in some circumstances.|$|E
50|$|The {{amendment}} {{was put in}} force {{to make it easier}} for employees to detect ill labour practices. It made it illegal for employers not to provide a monthly <b>payslip</b> detailing the data on which employees' salary was based. The amendment required employers to keep a detailed track of employees' work and make it transparent to the latter. Payslips should state data such as employees' base salary, social benefits, overtime hours, vacation days, sick days, and the eventual hourly wage. The amendment also required employers to keep track of employees attendance for the first time, targeting the protection of employees working long hours in Law, Audit and Hi-tech firms. Following the legislation, many employers from those sectors feared their employees would notice that they aren't making the national minimum hourly wage, when taking into account their fixed salaries versus the excessively long work hours common in those industries.|$|E
5000|$|Raphael Geys's {{contract}} with Société Générale allowed for payment upon termination, {{three months of}} written notice, and incorporated the staff handbook that said in s.8.3 he could be dismissed immediately, and the contract would terminate, if pay in lieu of notice was made. On 29 November 2007, he had a meeting and was dismissed in breach of contract. He was escorted from the building. On 18 December 2007, he received the pay in lieu in his bank account, and was sent a <b>payslip</b> that included details of [...] "in lieu pay". He was not given a separate notice, or {{that the right to}} terminate the contract had in fact been exercised. Mr Geys's solicitors wrote on 2 January that Geys was affirming the contract. On 4 January 2008, Société Générale gave notice that the payment was in lieu of notice. Mr Geys brought proceedings.|$|E
30|$|All income {{variables}} in the EU-SILC were subject to careful cleaning by the CSO, using administrative and other sources. In addition, respondents were encouraged to check their <b>payslips</b> and whether they did or not was recorded. For these reasons, reporting error {{is likely to be}} less important in the EU-SILC than in the ECHP used by Dickens et al. (2007) and Knoppik and Beissinger (2009).|$|R
50|$|Family Income Supplement was {{introduced}} in 1970 by the new Conservative government of Edward Heath, following a child poverty campaign, effective from August 1971, and provided for a payment to families on low wages. Claimants were required to provide <b>payslips,</b> to prove they were in employment, {{for a minimum of}} 24 hours per week. Takeup of the benefit was initially poor, with only half of those eligible claiming.|$|R

40|$|We use {{longitudinal}} data from an Irish household survey {{to measure the}} union wage premium.   A sub-sample where the worker 2 ̆ 7 s <b>payslip</b> was seen by the interviewer is unlikely to have measurement error for the union variable.   The results support the finding that measurement error leads to a large downward bias in fixed effects estimates of the union effect but indicate that ability bias has a small effect on the average union wage premium...|$|E
30|$|In the {{reported}} results, we use all wage {{responses in the}} analysis. In order to assess the importance of measurement error, we follow Smith (2000) and also consider subsamples of workers who consulted their payslips before answering the wage question, {{which is likely to}} reduce measurement error in wages. Analysis of this <b>payslip</b> variable, which is only available from 2006, indicates that those who consulted their payslips were disproportionately public sector workers. Nevertheless, the results for these subsamples are similar to those reported in the text for the full sample.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{practices}} continue today, from examples such as envelopes {{to carefully}} designed packaging for <b>payslips.</b> In modern contract law, {{it is common}} to see each page of a contract individually initialled and numbered, so that any addition or removal of pages can be detected. Meanwhile, most checks have a variety of features to defeat both tampering and duplication (these are often listed {{on the back of the}} check).|$|R

50|$|A {{by-election}} {{was held}} for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Penrith on 19 June 2010. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of sitting Labor member and former Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Training Karyn Paluzzano, who had lied to an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry over her actions, such as signing false staff <b>payslips</b> and rorting her electoral mail allowance. Paluzzano resigned from Cabinet after she admitted lying to ICAC. Paluzzano resigned from Parliament on 7 May 2010, hours after being suspended from the Labor Party.|$|R
40|$|An {{accuracy}} indicator is an observed variable {{which is}} related to the size of measurement error. Basic and extended models are introduced to represent the properties of a binary accuracy indicator. Under specified assumptions, it is shown that an accuracy indicator can identify a measurement error model. An approach to estimating a distribution function is presented together with methodology for variance estimation. The approach is applied to data on earnings from the British Household Panel Survey, where the accuracy indicator is whether or not a <b>payslip</b> is observed. A validation study provides justification for the modelling assumption...|$|E
30|$|For the UK, Smith (2000) {{uses the}} 1991 – 1996 British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to examine wage rigidity. Her initial results {{indicate}} that 9 % of job stayers experience a zero nominal wage change {{from year to year}} and that 23 % experience nominal wage reductions. To examine the consequences of measurement error, she uses the fact that the BHPS records whether respondents consulted their payslips when answering the wage question. In contrast to the results of Altonji and Devereux (2000) and Barattieri et al. (2010), she finds that measurement error in household surveys leads to an understatement of the extent of wage flexibility. The proportion of workers reporting no wage change falls from 9 to 6 % when the sample is restricted to those who consult their <b>payslip,</b> a pattern she attributes to rounding error.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to move to a}} market economy sets in train two major forces. 1. The fall in output has led to a reduction in personal incomes and created a fiscal crisis. 2. A widening earnings and income distribution is a result of wage and price liberalisation, and is an inherent part of the reform. The change leads to rising unemployment and increased poverty. It also has major administrative implications. Thus, by its very nature, the reform process creates forces which require a major reshaping of the social safety net to address three major issues: poverty relief, cost containment, and strengthening administrative capacity. Of the recommendations, five are paramount. 1. The minimum level of the major benefits should be at or above subsistence and, {{at least in the short}} run, should be fully protected against inflation. 2. Cost containment implies that, in the short run, benefits above the minimum should be protected only to the extent that resources permit; and, to the maximum extent compatible with political realities, the right to combine full old age or invalidity pension with more or less full-time work should be withdrawn for individuals below normal retirement age. 3. Administrative capacity should be strengthened. In particular, the administration of cash benefits requires modernisation. Such a process is crucial both to ensure effective benefit delivery, and to containing costs. 4. Social insurance and pension contributions should be shared between worker and employer, with the worker's contribution appearing on his/her <b>payslip.</b> 5. Short-run problems should be addressed in a manner consistent with long-run policy design. In particular, as soon as economically and administratively feasible, the relationship between social insurance benefits and individual contributions should be strengthened. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{allegations}} against Pickering, by then 32 but which dated back to 2002 (when he was 23), involved {{the use of}} proof of income (P60s and <b>payslips)</b> for mortgage applications. The documents incorrectly showed he had paid {{tens of thousands of}} pounds in UK income tax and National Insurance contributions. As he hadn’t subsequently paid the taxes in full, all mortgages that he had applied for during his time as a property developer were declared retrospectively fraudulent. In June 2014 he pleaded guilty to five counts of mortgage fraud at Swansea Crown Court.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, payroll bureaus {{will deal}} with all HM Revenue & Customs {{inquiries}} and deal with employee's queries.

As of 6 April 2016, umbrella companies are {{no longer able to}} offset travel and subsistence expenses and if they do, they will be deemed liable to reimburse to HMRC any tax relief obtained. Furthermore, recruitment companies and clients may be potentially liable for the unpaid tax.|$|R
