These small glaciers would have {{developed in}} the Lesotho Highlands {{and parts of the}} Drakensberg. The development of glaciers was likely aided by localized cooling indebted to shading by adjacent cliffs. Various moraines and former glacier niches have been identified in the eastern Lesotho Highlands, above 3,000 m.a.s.l. and on south-facing slopes, a few kilometres west of the Great Escarpment. Studies suggest the mountains of Southern Africa were mostly subject to mild <b>periglaciation</b> during the last glacial cycle and the annual average temperatures were about 6° C colder than at present. The estimated 6° C temperature drop for Southern Africa is in line with temperature drops estimated for Tasmania and Southern Patagonia during the same time.

The scouring effect of glaciations and <b>periglaciations</b> has largely been believed to have removed any semblances of pre-Quaternary landforms in the Northern Hemisphere. However, as in the Southern Hemisphere, weathering profiles dating back to the Mesozoic have been preserved in places. The recognised juxtaposition or palimpsest nature of landforms, where old and new remnants lie close to each other has resulted from several studies. The methods employed in studying these ancient landscapes should be robust enough to cover the whole timeframe of geological landform history. This study employed the oxygen-isotope technique in studying weathering profiles, supported by palaeomagnetism where appropriate. Both these techniques date weathering profiles that extend well beyond the Quaternary. The regolith of southeastern and western Australia, in the states of South Australia and Western Australia (Yilgarn Craton) were investigated. This was done based on the pioneering work of Bird and Chivas (1988, 1989 and 1993), where an oxygen-isotope geochronology for the Australian regolith was established. Weathering ages from the regolith covered several geological times, the oldest being pre-late Mesozoic, and the youngest, post-mid Tertiary, which was the most abundantly preserved. Samples from southern Africa (South Africa) were subjected to a comparative analysis using the Australian geochronology. Isotopic compositions for the various African Erosion Surfaces differ, implying diversity in weathering ages. Some preliminary comparisons with the oxygen-isotope geochronology of Australia showed agreement. The findings are quite encouraging, and warrant further research. A comparison between palaeomagnetism and oxygen-isotope in dating weathering profiles was assessed. Palaeomagnetism uses the iron-rich material, whereas the oxygenisotope technique largely uses kaolinite. Areas of agreement in ages have been observed, although there were cases of discrepancies, due mainly to resetting of the palaeomagnetic signal. Palaeomagnetism was used to calibrate the oxygen-isotope signal in iron oxides, mainly hematite within the weathering mantle. The aim was to have a geochronology similar to that established using kaolinites. The findings have not been conclusive, and more detailed sampling is required. A study of deep weathering profiles sought to explore the nature of weathering as a function of depth - from top to bottom, and in some cases, a lateral aspect (same mine pit depth, but on opposite sides). The lateral aspect has been shown to have little effect on isotopic compositions - that is, samples from either side of a pit yielded similar isotopic compositions. In the Yilgarn Craton, oxygen-isotope variation with depth has been observed in some cases, but not others. Where the weathering profile incorporates distinct weathering phases, the oldest phase occurs deeper in the profile. The major findings from this study have been: the dating of breakaways in the Yilgarn Craton, some as old as the late Palaeozoic to pre-late Mesozoic (Old Plateau?) and a widespread post-mid Tertiary weathering phase, particularly in its southern portion where rocky outcrops dominate. The weathering ages ofthe breakaways do not fall into a single weathering age, with some equated to the widespread post-mid Tertiary age (New Plateau?). The antiquity of landforms for Australia and southern Africa was highlighted by similarity in geological and oxygen-isotope weathering ages. This requires further investigation. Palaeomagnetism and oxygen-isotope techniques are effective in elucidating landscape evolution, as demonstrated for several Australian sites. However, it is revealed that both the oxygen-isotope and palaeomagnetic data may be perturbed and re-set by later weathering events. Such complexity, while currently potentially confounding, should prove valuable if the physical and chemical stability of both iron oxides and kaolinite were better understood...|$|R

50|$|Stratified slope {{deposits}} or grèzes litées (original French name) are accumulations {{of debris}} that are traditionally associated with <b>periglaciation</b> {{but that can}} also form in other settings. The deposits have a weak sorting and a coarse bedding. Stratified slope deposits are usually found at the lower slopes of valleys where thicknesses vary but may exceed 10 meters.

Examples can be found in Abisko National Park in Sweden, Snowdonia National Park in Wales, the Great End-Scafell Pike ridge in England and Hickory Run Boulder Field and River of Rocks in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. All examples except the first one are outside present day subpolar climate areas, and have thus traditionally been seen as relict landforms from past times when these areas were under <b>periglaciation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For example, the Dartmoor granite was emplaced around 280 {{million years}} ago, with the cover rocks eroded away soon afterwards, exposing it to {{chemical}} and physical weathering processes. Where joints are closely spaced, the large crystals in the granite readily disintegrate {{to form a}} sandy regolith known locally as growan. This is readily stripped off by solifluction or surface wash when not protected by vegetation, notably during prolonged cold phases during the Quaternary ice ages - <b>periglaciation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Periglaciation</b> (adjective: [...] "periglacial," [...] also {{referring}} to {{places at the}} edges of glacial areas) describes geomorphic processes that result from seasonal thawing of snow in areas of permafrost, the runoff from which refreezes in ice wedges and other structures. [...] "Periglacial" [...] suggests an environment located on the margin of past glaciers. However, freeze and thaw cycles influence landscapes outside areas of past glaciation. Therefore, periglacial environments are anywhere that freezing and thawing modify the landscape in a significant manner.|$|E
50|$|Many {{areas of}} <b>periglaciation</b> have {{relatively}} low precipitation—otherwise, {{they would be}} glaciated—and low evapotranspiration. which makes their average river discharge rates low. However, rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean adjacent to northern Canada and Siberia are prone to erosion resulting from earlier thawing of snow pack in the upper, more southerly reaches of their drainage basins, which leads to flooding downstream, owing to obstructing river ice in the still-frozen, downstream parts of the rivers. When these ice dams melt or break open, the release of impounded water causes erosion.|$|E
50|$|A blockfield (also spelt block field) felsenmeer, boulder {{field or}} stone field is a surface covered by boulder- or block-sized angular rocks usually {{associated}} with alpine and subpolar climates and <b>periglaciation.</b> Blockfields differ from screes and talus slope in that blockfields do not apparently originate from mass wastings. They {{are believed to be}} formed by frost weathering below the surface. An alternative theory suggests that modern blockfields may have originated from chemical weathering that occurred in the Neogene when the climate was relatively warmer. Following this thought the blockfields would then have been reworked by periglacial action.|$|E
50|$|Albeit the {{definition}} of what a periglacial zone is not clear-cut a conservativa estimated is that a quarter of Earth's land surface has periglacial conditions. Beyond this quarter an additional quarter or fifth or Earth's land surface had periglacial conditions at some time during the Pleistocene. In the northern hemisphere larger swathes of northern Asia and northern North America are periglaciated. In Europe parts of Fennoscandia, Iceland, northern European Russia and Svalbard. In addition Alpine areas in the non-arctic northern hemisphere might also be subject to <b>periglaciation.</b> A major outlier in the northern hemisphere is the Tibetan Plateau that stands out by its size and low-latitude location. In the southern hemisphere parts of the Andes, the ice-free areas of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands are periglaciated.|$|E
50|$|The {{coast of}} Chile north of 42° S {{and most of}} the Chilean Coast Range {{remained}} glacier-free and parts of it also free from <b>periglaciation</b> though the glaciation. Yet, small glaciers existed in the highest part of the Chilean Coast Range. Above altitudes of 100 m (Cordillera Piuchén) or 600 m (Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) soils in the Chilean Coast Range were disturbed by solifluction (a periglacial process). Between 41 and 37° S, the coastal region, the lower slopes of the Chilean Coast Range, and the westernmost Chilean Central Valley remained free of disturbance by the glacial, glacifluvial and periglacial meaning that soils evolved free of such disturbances and that these regions (in particular around Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) served as refugia for Valdivian temperate rainforest.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Periglaciation</b> {{became a}} {{distinct}} subject within {{the study of}} geology after Walery Łoziński, a Polish geologist, introduced the term in 1909.

In the field trip to Svalbard that followed the congress participants were able to observe the phenomena reported by Łoziński, directly. Łoziński published his contribution to the congress in 1912. [...] From 1950 to 1970, periglacial geomorphology developed chiefly as a subdiscipline of climatic geomorphology that was current in Europe at the time. The journal Biuletyn Peryglacjalny, established in 1954 by Jan Dylik, was important for the consolidation of the discipline.|$|E

Büdel studied both cold-climate processes in Svalbard and [...] "tropical" [...] weathering processes in India to understand the origin of the relief of Central Europe, which he argued was a palimpsest of landforms formed at different times and under different climates. For Central Europe Büdel concluded that in Late Cretaceous to Early Pliocene times etchplains formed. Then in Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene times a transition period occurred in landscape forming processes. Finally in the Late Pleistocene <b>periglaciation</b> and deep permafrost made Central Europe a place of [...] "excessive valley cutting". Holocene developments would not have affected much of the landscape other than adding a deep soil cover.|$|E

40|$|The Jurassic Coast World Heritage Sites (JCWHS) is {{not only}} a 95 km long {{coastline}} and remarkable Mesozoic geological section, but also a slice through a Quaternary landscape. For the majority of the last two million years this landscape lay in the periglacial zone, just south of a waxing and waning ice margin and just north of an Atlantic inlet which eventually became the English Channel. This paper reviews how the previous landscape inherited from the Cenozoic, was modified through uplift, climatically driven fluvial activity and <b>periglaciation.</b> Much evidence of this Quaternary history can be been today in sections along the JCWHS coast which is cuts through a number of headwater valleys the largest of which are the Exe and Axe.

The Quaternary history of the JCWHS is also preserved in raised beaches on the Isle of Portland, coastal landforms, and in Holocene alluvial sediments associated with human activity and which may constitute part of the putative Anthropocene.

40|$|The {{change of}} {{topography}} {{with time and}} the consequent structure of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface {{is dependent on the}} production and transport of weathered bedrock. I use measurements of in-situ cosmogenic 10 Be to investigate erosion rates and exposure ages of boulders, streams, and hillslope sediments in central Pennsylvania, a landscape shaped by glacial/interglacial climate cycles and changes in base level. I measure rates of landscape change at three separate sites, Hickory Run boulder field, Young Womans Creek watershed, and Garner Run, a small upland catchment bounded by two ridgelines. Hickory Run Boulder field is the largest {{of its kind in the}} eastern United States. This enigmatic, 1 -km-long field of boulders has been attributed to frost-induced processes during the last glacial maximum, when the Laurentide ice sheet margin was nearby. My isotopic data demonstrate that Hickory Run, and likely many other similar boulder fields in eastern North America are ancient, multigenerational features that have persisted over many glacial-interglacial cycles. These findings add nuance to the conventional view of <b>periglaciation</b> as a force that 2 ̆ 2 wiped the slate clean 2 ̆ 2 in the Appalachian Mountains [...] in upland areas with resistant lithologies, I show that the landscape was reworked, but not reset by repeated <b>periglaciation.</b> Young Womans Creek is a 230 km 2 drainage basin in the headwaters of the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province, where I investigate the role of non-equilibrium topography on the rates of erosion at a basin scale. Here, I use in-situ 10 Be to understand the influence of fluvial incision into the landscape, contrasting erosion rates in undissected uplands with those in incised valleys. Erosion rates are positively correlated with slope, but correlate negatively with normalized channel steepness, ksn, and downstream distance. My results demonstrate the effects of lithology and base level on erosion rate are difficult to disentangle, and that when studied on a small scale, lithology exerts the strongest control over the spatial variability of erosion in a transient landscape. Resistant sandstone ridgelines such as those at Garner Run are common features in the Ridge and Valley province of central Pennsylvania. At this site, I strive to understand the influence of periglacial activity on the generation and movement of sediment downslope. My measurements demonstrate that sediment in small upland catchments such as Garner Run can have cosmogenic nuclide concentrations equal to and exceeding 100, 000 years of surface exposure history. Despite perturbations by multiple glacial/interglacial cycles throughout the Pleistocene these sandstone-underlain environments are not young, and the exposure of surficial materials predates the last major advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at ˜ 26, 000 years ago...|$|E
40|$|Aridity in Australia has {{generally}} been associated with glacial intervals {{of the last few}} glacial cycles. The causes and nature of aridity varied from north to south over the continent. In northern and central Australia, reduced monsoon rain in global cold stages caused lakes and rivers to dry, vegetation to become more sparse, sand dunes to become active, and dust advection to increase. While the monsoon is correlated with warmer global temperatures and high sea levels overall, the exact timing of the greatest development of the monsoon in Stage 5 remains uncertain. In southeastern Australia, the proxy records give a less clear picture. While vegetation seems to have been more sparse in cold stages and sand dune activity and dust flux consequently greater, records of runoff in rivers and lakes have mixed or opposite behaviour to northern or central Australia. The nature of aridity in southeastern Australia is not analogous to conditions anywhere on the continent today. Greatly reduced temperatures over the central and southern interior, greater influence of snow and <b>periglaciation</b> on runoff, high groundwater tables, lower rainfall and reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may all have contributed to and interacted to produce the reconstructed picture of a cold, sparsely vegetated arid landscape with large rivers and perennial lakes. The largest changes in circulation patterns over the glacial cycle probably occurred in the location and/or intensity of summer tropical convergence in northern Australia. Over southern Australia, changes to the temperature and humidity of the westerly circulation have been more significant than the small fluctuations in latitude of the sub-tropical high pressure ridge. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Long-term climate records such as SPECMAP and EPICA {{imply that}} the early Middle Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stages 19 – 13, 780 – 450 ka) was characterised by low {{magnitude}} climate cycles relative to the extreme glacial/interglacial cycles of the last 450 ka. As the early Middle Pleistocene is the period during which the first known occupation of Britain occurred, understanding the nature of climate cycles in northwest Europe during this period is important. In order to develop {{a clearer understanding of}} the pattern of climate change during the early Middle Pleistocene, deposits of this period are divided into four groups that are based on the climatic proxy data they contain. Group 1 deposits are characterised by evidence for interglacial climates that were warmer than the present day. Group 2 deposits are characterised by evidence for interglacial climates that were consistent with the present day with respect to their degree of warmth. Group 3 deposits contain evidence for temperate climates that were cooler than the present day; such deposits possibly reflect the end of an interglacial or interstadial. Group 4 deposits record evidence for extreme climate cooling and widespread permafrost development. This categorisation indicates that during multiple glacial/interglacial cycles the climate of eastern England oscillated between periods that were warmer than the present day, sometimes ‘Mediterranean’ in character, through to periods that were characterised by extreme climate cooling and widespread <b>periglaciation.</b> Despite the climate patterns suggested in the SPECMAP and EPICA records, there is no recognisable difference between the pattern of climate forcing observed in Britain during the early Middle Pleistocene relative to that which occurred during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene. Early human colonisers in Britain during the early Middle Pleistocene were, therefore, subjected to the same extremes of climate as humans during the last 450 ka. Consequently, it is probable that the pattern of depopulation during glacials and recolonisation during interglacials, proposed for the last four glacial cycles, is also likely to be true for the period 780 – 450 ka. It is also important to recognise that lithic artefacts are found in association with all four climatic groups, indicating that the presence of humans during the early Middle Pleistocene was not restricted to the climatic peaks of interglacials. ...|$|E
