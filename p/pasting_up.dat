2500|$|Also {{during the}} Easter Rising, {{members of the}} British 11th East Surrey Regiment at Portobello Bridge arrested the pacifist Francis Sheehy-Skeffington on 25 April because his name was 'on a list', as he {{returned}} to his home in Rathmines from touring the city <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> leaflets calling people to a meeting to form groups to stop looting of property by slum-dwellers. He was taken to Portobello Barracks, where he was held as an enemy sympathiser. Later that evening, he was taken out as a hostage with a raiding party led by Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst of the Royal Irish Rifles, to the home and shop of Alderman James Kelly, at the corner of Camden Street and Harcourt Road (from which the name [...] "Kelly's Corner" [...] derives). [...] Mistaking the Alderman (a conservative) for a different Alderman Kelly, the soldiers arrested two men who were there, gutter journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick McIntyre, then destroyed the shop with hand grenades. On the way back to Rathmines, Bowen-Colthurst and his party murdered two unarmed civilians, one of them a 17-year-old boy from Mountpleasant Avenue returning from Rathmines church.|$|E
60|$|Bea {{stood on}} the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue. The roar of the city began to frighten her. There were five {{automobiles}} on the street all at the same time--and one of 'em was a great big car that must of cost two thousand dollars--and the 'bus was starting for a train with five elegant-dressed fellows, and a man was <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> red bills with lovely pictures of washing-machines on them, and the jeweler was laying out bracelets and wrist-watches and EVERYTHING on real velvet.|$|E
60|$|Now, at the rear, a short hallway led {{off to a}} small kitchen, and here, at a table, alone, sat Patsy Horan, {{proprietor}} of the Vendome, consuming a hasty supper ere the evening rush of business. Also, Patsy Horan was angry with the world. He had {{got out of the}} wrong side of bed that morning, and nothing had gone right all day. Had his barkeepers been asked, they would have described his mental condition as a grouch. But Carter Watson did not know this. As he passed the little hallway, Patsy Horan's sullen eyes lighted on the magazine he carried under his arm. Patsy did not know Carter Watson, nor did he know that what he carried under his arm was a magazine. Patsy, out of the depths of his grouch, decided that this stranger was one of those pests who marred and scarred the walls of his back rooms by tacking up or <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> advertisements. The color on the front cover of the magazine convinced him that it was such an advertisement. Thus the trouble began. Knife and fork in hand, Patsy leaped for Carter Watson.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paste</b> <b>up</b> was {{preceded by}} hot type and cold type technologies. Starting in the 1990s, many {{newspapers}} started doing away with <b>paste</b> <b>up,</b> switching to desktop publishing software that allows pages to be designed completely on a computer. Such software includes QuarkXPress, PageMaker and InDesign.|$|R

6000|$|Fortunately for Dakon, {{he had had}} a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} hay and grain stored in his stable. We managed to raise four saddles, and we found the animals in good condition and spirited, withal unused to being ridden. I remembered the San Francisco of the great earthquake as we rode through the streets, but this San Francisco was vastly more pitiable. No cataclysm of nature had caused this, but, rather, the tyranny of the labour unions. We rode down past Union Square and through the theatre, hotel, and shopping districts. The streets were deserted. Here and there stood automobiles, abandoned where they had broken down or when the gasolene had given out. There was no sign of life, save for the occasional policemen and the soldiers guarding the banks and public buildings. Once we came upon an I.L.W. man <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> the latest proclamation. We stopped to read. [...] "We have maintained an orderly strike," [...] it ran; [...] "and we shall maintain order to the end. The end will come when our demands are satisfied, and our demands will be satisfied when we have starved our employers into submission, as we ourselves in the past have often been starved into submission." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, Wolfman {{moved to}} Marvel Comics as a protégé of then-editor Roy Thomas. When Thomas stepped down, Wolfman {{eventually}} {{took over as}} editor, initially {{in charge of the}} publisher's black-and-white magazines, then finally the color line of comics. Wolfman said in 1981 that, [...] "Marvel never gave [...] full commitment to" [...] the black-and-white line. [...] "No one wanted to commit themselves to the staff." [...] He added, [...] "We used to farm the books out to Harry Chester Studios [...] and whatever they <b>pasted</b> <b>up,</b> they <b>pasted</b> <b>up.</b> I formed the first production staff, hired the first layout people, paste-up people." [...] Wolfman stepped down as editor-in-chief in order to spend more time writing.|$|R

50|$|Late Spring, COMBO {{came back}} to Paris and settled down in the rue des Petits-Carreaux for his second exhibit, {{getting a lot of}} {{attention}} both from the neighborhood and the Internets by <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> a +30 ft. high portrait of a dandy version of Yoda. As opposed to most of his projects since Chernobyl, Old-Up didn't have any political dimension, allowing him to get back to his roots: cartoon.|$|E
5000|$|I'd {{heard on}} the grapevine that Gil's {{assistant}} had dropped dead {{of a heart attack}} at 23. I gave Gil a call, and he said, 'Yeah, I can use you.' So I went to work for him. ... He was doing early graphic novel Blackmark, and I did a really bad job <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> the dialog and putting in Zip-a-Tone.... It was a great apprenticeship. I learned a lot from watching Gil work.|$|E
5000|$|Jeffrey Thomas founded Necropolitan Press in 1993 in {{reaction}} to his discovery of the then-flourishing small press, causing him to become so enthused {{with the idea that}} he [...] "developed the desire to produce some publication or other" [...] of his own. Thomas chose the name for his publishing imprint due to the sound of it — fond of the similarity to the word Metropolitan but with a horrific bent. At the time, Thomas worked as a <b>paste</b> <b>up</b> artist in a print shop, allowing him to create the Necropolitan Press releases during his breaks by using a [...] "light table to <b>paste</b> <b>up</b> the pages the old fashioned way, with an exacto knife and wax." ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "clipart" [...] {{originated}} {{through the}} practice of physically cutting images from pre-existing printed works for use in other publishing projects. Before the advent of computers in desktop publishing, clip art was used through a process called <b>paste</b> <b>up.</b> Many clip art images in this era qualified as line art. In this process, the clip art images are cut out by hand, then attached via adhesives to a board representing a scale size of the finished, printed work. After the addition of text and art created through phototypesetting, the finished, camera-ready pages are called mechanicals. Since the 1990s, nearly all publishers have replaced the <b>paste</b> <b>up</b> process with desktop publishing.|$|R

50|$|After <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> {{his poems}} in Tiananmen Square, Huang Xiang {{and his friends}} held a short {{ceremony}} there to proclaim the founding of The Enlightenment Society, whose aim was nothing less than far reaching reforms of Chinese society. This was the first non-government and non-party, civil association to be created in China since 1949. They distributed copies of {{the first edition of}} the societys equally unofficial magazine, also called Enlightenment, which was devoted to their writing and their ideas on reform. These were further audacious challenges to the regime. The response from the public was electric. In the days that followed, The Democracy movement was born.|$|E
50|$|The folios {{grew out}} of Todd’s desire to inform the colonists of South Australia of the immense size of weather systems and that in {{southern}} Australia, they generally progressed from west to east and not {{from east to west}} as commonly assumed by the early colonists. To accomplish this, Todd displayed daily the last 6 synoptic charts for public viewing then bound and stored them in the folios.The Todd weather folios consist not only of synoptic charts, but also include clippings from newspapers detailing weather statistics and events for all the eastern colonies of Australia. Newspapers from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne were collected as they came off the inter-colonial trains and were processed for <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> next to the corresponding synoptic chart.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Banana {{accepted}} {{a job at}} the San Francisco Bay Guardian <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> advertising pages. She filled the one-inch-by-one-column ad holes with invitations to her events; the first entry was for the 1974 Columbus Day Parade, offering [...] "degrees of Bananology" [...] to those who participated or sent banana news. In 1975, the Guardian ran a full-page ad for her Banana Olympics. It attracted over 100 contestants, who dressed up to compete in the overhand banana throw, the water-balance race and the four-legged race. Winners were those who crossed the finish line with the most “appeal”, based on costume and style. It took place in the Embarcadero Plaza (with help from volunteers and the New Games Foundation), and was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner.|$|E

50|$|Their primary {{activity}} was {{the distribution of}} leaflets to incite civil disobedience and cause the Nazis to worry about subversion. They also printed and <b>pasted</b> <b>up</b> anti-Nazi stickers in large numbers, and they helped people in danger from the Nazis to escape the country via an Underground Railroad-like network.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was in this}} {{environment}} that Zhema Paul Magrão, Carli Cooper formed Vulcano in 1981. Due to their early date of formation, Vulcano {{was one of the}} first black metal / death metal bands in all of Latin America. Their first record [...] "Om Pushne Namah", was released in 1983, and is different from most early extreme metal in that the lyrics were sung in Portuguese, not English. The release of this album also marks the departure of Jose Piloni (drums) from the band. In this early period, it was very difficult to secure live performances, and the band had to produce their own shows, and promotion was limited to <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> posters, but Vulcano persevered, and moved forward in 1984 to release the demo Devil on My Roof.|$|E
50|$|Canada {{had plenty}} of land and jobs and new opportunities, which created a pull factor. The {{government}} made certain potential immigrants knew of the advantages, sending agents to recruit Irish and Scottish emigrants to settle in western Canada between 1867 and the 1920s. The Canadian government hoped to develop {{the economy in the}} sparsely populated western part of the country. It set up offices in towns in Ireland and Scotland, and agents went up and down the land <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> attractive posters, giving lectures, handing out pamphlets and trying one-on-one to persuade farmers and laborers of the virtues of life in Canada. Although many people agreed to emigrate, the agents faced competition from the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, and opponents of emigration warned of hardship in Canada. The agents did not create 'emigration fever,' but they did tap into a sense of restlessness that, if nurtured, could result in a decision to emigrate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{boom in the}} {{underground}} press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which {{made it possible to}} print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates. [...] Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, <b>pasting</b> <b>up</b> camera-ready copy on layout sheets on the editor's kitchen table, with labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand. As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole, students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money.|$|E
60|$|One evening, while Valentine--still deeply {{immersed}} in the difficulties of depicting the cover-hack--was returning to the Rectory, after a day's work at the Squire's house, his attention was suddenly attracted in the high street of Rubbleford, by a flaming placard <b>pasted</b> <b>up</b> on a dead wall opposite the market-house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{layout process}} then became {{the task of}} {{creating}} the <b>paste</b> <b>up,</b> so named because rubber cement or other adhesive {{would be used to}} physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper. Completed pages become known as camera-ready, [...] "mechanical" [...] or [...] "mechanical art".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Paste</b> <b>up</b> {{relied on}} phototypesetting, {{a process that}} would {{generate}} [...] "cold type" [...] on photographic paper that usually {{took the form of}} long columns of text. These printouts were often a single column in a scroll of narrow (3-inch or 4-inch) paper that was as deep as the length of the story.|$|R
