40|$|This {{project is}} an {{evaluation}} of a new, more proactive approach to legionellosis investigations conducted by the Southern Nevada Health District. The new protocol was conceived, written and adopted in April of 2012 {{with the goal of}} preventing outbreaks of Legionnaires 2 ̆ 7 disease that can {{have a significant impact on}} public health and the resort industry of Las Vegas. The objectives of this project were to determine if the remediation methods were successful at eliminating the target organism from water systems and maintaining a negative status throughout the monitoring period, to conduct a cost/benefit analysis, and to compare this protocol with other proactive health department protocols. Ninety percent of facilities found to be sources were able to obtain and maintain a negative target organism status throughout the monitoring period, indicating that the remediation methods are effective. There was no significant difference between the remediation methods (hot water flush, chlorine flush or both) in obtaining and maintaining negative results for Legionella. This evaluation also found that average yearly costs for SNHD increased from about 5, 611 a year on legionellosis investigations to about 82, 675. An estimate of the cost to all facilities investigated since implementation is 1, 466, 000 with an approximate total cost to SNHD and facilities of 1, 590, 013. This is a minor investment when compared with the significant healthcare costs of legionellosis illness and outbreaks in the U. S., which total 101 - 321 million per year. In addition, litigation awards can cost facilities hundreds of millions of dollars. No other health departments were identified that conduct this type of <b>proactive</b> <b>investigation,</b> and often only initiate an environmental investigation after a second case is found with an association to the same facility as a previous case. Often, by then it is too late to prevent outbreaks and additional illnesses associated with that facility.

40|$|Abstract: Digital {{forensics}} is {{the science}} of laws and technologies fighting computer crimes. It {{can be divided into}} two sub-areas, computer forensics and network forensics. Network forensics is still a frontier area of digital forensics and is the focus of this paper. We propose to classify network forensic investigations into three categories based on when law enforcement officers conduct investigations in response to cyber crime incidents. We define <b>proactive</b> <b>investigations</b> as those occurring before cyber crime incidents; real time investigations as those occurring during cyber crime incidents, and retroactive investigation as those occurring after cyber crime incidents. This classification in terms of incident timing helps us understand related laws since laws differ with investigation timing. We present a holistic study of the relationship between laws and network forensic investigations and believe that this framework provides a solid guide for digital forensic research. For example, the framework tells us that certain strategies (including technologies transformed from attacks against security systems) would violate the Constitution or relevant laws of the United States, which is the focus of this paper. With the guidance of this network forensic framework, we propose HaLo, a hand-held devic...|$|R

This study explores the feasibility of identifying {{a greater number of}} organized crime offenders, currently captured but invisible, within existing national general crime databases. All 2. 1 million recorded offenders, captured over a four year period on the UK Police National Computer (PNC), were filtered across three criteria associated with organized crime (co-offending, commission of specific offences, three years imprisonment or more). The 4109 ‘organized crime’ offenders, identified by the process, were compared with ‘general’ and ‘serious’ offender control groups across a variety of personal and demographic variables. Organized crime prosecutions are not random but concentrate in specific geographic areas and constitute 0. 2 % of the offender population. Offenders can be differentiated from general crime offenders on such measures as: diversity of nationality and ethnicity, onset age, offence type and criminal recidivism. Using an offence based methodology, rather than relying on offenders identified through police <b>proactive</b> <b>investigations,</b> can provide empirical information from existing data sets, across a diverse range of legislative areas and cultures.

S. law enforcement agencies. In 2006, there were an estimated 3, 672 arrests for CP possession, compared with 1, 713 arrests in 2000. Many characteristics of the offenders and the offense remained stable. In both 2006 and 2000, most offenders were White, non-Hispanic males and socioeconomically diverse. Few were known to have committed previous sex crimes. Most had CP that depicted preteen children and serious sexual abuse. In 2006, however, a higher proportion of offenders were aged 18 to 25 years, used peer-to-peer (p 2 p) networks, had images of children younger than 3 years, and had CP videos. P 2 p users had more extreme images (e. g., younger victims, sexual violence) and larger numbers of images {{than those who did not}} use p 2 p networks. Findings reflect heightened efforts in the criminal justice system to combat CP crimes.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss exhibit complex life-history {{patterns}} {{described by}} variable freshwater and marine residency periods, maturation patterns, and reproductive characteristics. Over 300 small populations of Steelhead {{are present in}} Southeast Alaska, and similar trends in abundance among these populations suggest the influence of population-regulating forces operating on a regional scale. The Situk River, near Yakutat, Alaska, supports the largest known population of Steelhead in Alaska. Stock assessment studies on this river have collected the longest set of biological data and scale samples for Steelhead in the state. For this study, retrospective scale pattern analysis of samples from Situk River Steelhead was synthesized with regional abundance information to investigate patterns in early marine growth among different life-history and demographic groups, {{as well as to}} explore linkages between growth, abundance, and marine environmental variables. Positive correlations were identified between freshwater growth, first ocean-year growth, and adult length, while first ocean-year growth was negatively correlated with second ocean-year growth. Early maturing Steelhead were found to have increased first ocean-year growth and reduced adult length relative to later maturing Steelhead, confirming connections between growth and maturation. Correlations in abundance among Southeast Alaska Steelhead populations suggest that marine and climatic drivers may impact these populations in a regionally coherent manner. Correlations among patterns in abundance also varied along a distance gradient: populations located closer to the Situk River were more correlated with the Situk River than more distant populations. Positive relationships between Gulf of Alaska sea surface temperature, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and Situk River Steelhead abundance further supported the importance of climate-driven marine conditions to Steelhead productivity. While conservation concerns for Steelhead in Southeast Alaska are currently minimal, <b>proactive</b> <b>investigations</b> into life-history diversity and population linkages may become more relevant with increased marine ecosystem variability related to climate change...|$|R

40|$|The {{scourge of}} child sex {{trafficking}} is {{as complex as}} it is alarming. It is speculated that the “Triple A Engine” effect of the Internet (Affordability, Access, and Anonymity) {{plays a role in}} the sex trafficking of children. For example, much media coverage and political action has recently taken place regarding online ad sites such as backpage. com facilitating child sex trafficking. However, as with many aspects of child sex trafficking, obtaining actual measurements and hard data is challenging {{due to the nature of}} the crime, the lack of a uniform description, and inherent under-reporting. That is why Microsoft Corporation awarded a competitive grant for this article to study the effects of technology on child sex trafficking. One format, where such crimes are often described in detail is that of judicial opinions. The passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000, and its subsequent reauthorizations, has led to increased detection and prosecution of child sex trafficking on the federal level. The resulting body of judicial opinions is a potential wealth of information about current trends in the execution of the crime and detection by law enforcement. This paper is a manifestation of a year of research in which researchers engaged in a comprehensive examination of available federal child sex trafficking opinions and press releases generated over the past twelve years. The research analyzed several hundred judicial opinions since the implementation of the TVPA to determine what, if any, trends could be observed. The paper is the first of a series to publish the results of this research, offering insight into the role of technology in the recruiting, advertising, selling, searching for, and purchasing of children for sex. This paper examines: (1) how traffickers use technology to advertise and sell child sex trafficking victims; (2) how purchasers of sex use technology to locate and complete the commercial transaction in buying a child for commercial sexual exploitation; and (3) how law enforcement use technology to detect and investigate child sex trafficking crimes. It offers important insight into technology’s role and critical evidence-based guidance for prevention and investigation of these cases. The article argues for altered prevention messaging and endorses <b>proactive</b> <b>investigations</b> which follow the guidelines suggested...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of the {{performance}} of engineering project organizations is critical for understanding and eliminating inefficiencies in today’s dynamic global markets. The existing theoretical frameworks consider project organizations as monolithic systems and attribute {{the performance}} of project organizations to the characteristics of the constituents. However, project organizations consist of complex interdependent networks of agents, information, and resources whose interactions give rise to emergent properties that affect the overall performance of project organizations. Yet, our understanding of the emergent properties in project organizations and their impact on project performance is rather limited. This limitation {{is one of the major}} barriers towards creation of integrated theories of performance assessment in project organizations. The objective of this paper is to investigate the emergent properties that affect the ability of project organization to cope with uncertainty. Based on the theories of complex systems, we propose and test a novel framework in which the likelihood of performance variations in project organizations could be investigated based on the environment of uncertainty (i. e., static complexity, dynamic complexity, and external source of disruption) as well as the emergent properties (i. e., absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and restorative capacity) of project organizations.

Objectives: To determine the hospital-based frequency of candidaemia in a tertiary hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria. Method: This was a prospective descriptive study which included 230 immunosuppressed patients. All isolates were identified to the species level using both conventional and automated methods. Thereafter, all  Candida species isolated were tested for antifungal susceptibility using the broth microdilution method. Results: Candidaemia occurred in 12 (5. 21 %) of the 230 study patients, with  C. tropicalis accounting for 50 % of the infections. Four patients (33. 3 %) presented with  C. parapsilosis, one (8. 3 %) with  C. albicans and one (8. 3 %) with a mixed infection of  C. albicans and  C. tropicalis. All 12 isolates were sensitive to fluconazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 8 mg/mL). Univariate analysis revealed that old age, multiple surgeries and long-term hospitalisation were significant contributing factors for the occurrence of candidaemia. Eleven (91. 7 %) of the 12 patients with candidaemia had  Candida colonisation of other sterile sites including the bladder, peritoneum and trachea. Furthermore, bivariate analysis revealed that mucositis (p = 0. 019) and diarrhoea (p = 0. 017) were significantly associated with an increased risk of candidaemia. The crude mortality rate of candidaemia was 91. 7 %. Conclusion: This study highlights the significance of nosocomial candidaemia and the need for <b>proactive</b> laboratory <b>investigation</b> and clinical management of this life-threatening disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{standard}} {{reliability and}} risk approaches have sufficed {{to identify the}} dominant causes of failure in forensic analyses, and the dominant risk contributors for <b>proactive</b> risk <b>investigations.</b> These techniques are particularly applicable when individual or even simple common failure events of a similar type dominate the analysis. However, nowadays due to increased understanding of the 'simple' mechanisms and the increasing complexity of the systems we build, failures in highly dependable systems arise from unexpected interactions between subsystems and the external and internal environment. Engineering data analysis {{is the process of}} data collection and investigation from a variety of perspectives, alternatively dissecting it into its underlying (yet often unknown) patterns; this process is becoming ever more necessary as systems become more complex. Some of the techniques employed are slicing the data sets according to known underlying variables, or overlaying data gathered from different perspectives, or imbedding data into previously established logical or phenomenological structures. This paper addresses the issues involved in visualizing patterns in data sets by providing examples of interesting maps from the past, indicating some of the maps currently in use, and speculating on how these visual maps might be developed further and used in the future to discover problems in complex systems before they lead to failure. Guidance is proposed as to how to explore and map data from different technical perspectives in order to evoke potentially significant patterns from reliability data. The techniques presented have been developed by combining approaches to common cause failure (CCF) classification with multidimensional scaling (MDS) to produce a new method for exploratory engineering data mapping...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is {{the most}} {{essential}} place-holder for protecting children's rights internationally. In support of its leading principle: “the {{best interest of the}} child” (Art. 3) a growing number of digital technologies are employed in different contexts of life, including contexts of justice and youth care. Therefore, when children enter the juvenile justice system and become objects of <b>proactive,</b> digitalised <b>investigations,</b> CRC rights are even more pivotal. Yet, as academic discourse demonstrates, children's rights are increasingly under pressure within law enforcement (Bruning, 2010; Kilkelly, 2001). This paper sets out to explore a relatively undiscussed topic, namely the digitalised preventative policing practices on children under the United Nations CRC. The discussion by way of illustration centres around an initiative taken in recent years in The Netherlands, ProKid SI 12 - (ProKid). Grounded in a public rhetoric where ‘crimes against children’ and ‘crimes committed by children’ are viewed as equally important issues to prevent, the risk profiling system ProKid is employed by the Dutch police as a solution for both. Empirical details about ProKid demonstrate, however, that its preventative profiling routines challenge several CRC principles such as, for instance ‘the child's assumption of a constitutive role in society’, its ‘privacy’ and perhaps most importantly ‘the assumption of innocence of a child until proven guilty’. The use of ProKid frames children as potential perpetrators even when they are registered as victims of violence. In the light of the challenges raised, this paper aims to open up the debate about the risks ProKid and similar initiatives bring along for children, and their families and about the CRC's potential to address these...|$|R

Among the most successful investigations carried out in 2011 were: • Operation Agon: International investigation in conjunction with Revenue’s Customs Service and the US Drug Enforcement Administration; • Operation Fortuna: Maritime investigation into the activities of an international drug trafficking gang with Irish contacts; • Operation Nitrogen: Nationwide investigation with district and divisional drug units into cannabis cultivation sites. There {{is no doubt that}} GNDU made {{a significant impact on the}} drug trafficking community in Ireland during 2011 by arresting and prosecuting a number of individuals involved in drug trafficking and fracturing drug supply routes operated by those intent on destroying the fabric of Irish society through the illicit drugs trade. In 2012 the unit will continue to relentlessly pursue the purveyors of the drug trafficking trade including those based within this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions where individuals are impacting on the Irish State. The policies pursued will involve <b>proactive</b> intelligence led <b>investigations</b> into members of organised crime gangs at all levels. They will also involve targeting the assets of persons involved in this illicit trade and the Garda National Drugs Unit will work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in that regard.
