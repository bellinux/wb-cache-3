5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
25|$|Cartilaginous {{fish have}} a {{cartilaginous}} skeleton. However, their ancestors were bony animals, {{and were the}} first fish to develop paired fins. Cartilaginous fish don't have swim bladders. Their skin is covered in <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> (dermal denticles) that are as rough as sandpaper. Because cartilaginous fish do not have bone marrow, the spleen and special tissue around the gonads produces red blood cells. Their tails can be asymmetric, with the upper lobe longer than the lower lobe. Some cartilaginous fishes possess an organ called Leydig's Organ which also produces red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Other {{distinctive}} characteristics {{include a}} strongly keeled caudal peduncle, highly textured skin covered in <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> and a mucus layer, a pointed snout—distinctly hooked in younger specimens—and a lunate caudal fin. In large individuals, the dorsal fin may flop {{to one side}} when above the surface. Colouration is highly variable (and likely dependent on observation conditions and the individual's condition): commonly, the colouring is dark brown to black or blue dorsally, fading to a dull white ventrally. The sharks are often noticeably scarred, possibly through encounters with lampreys or cookiecutter sharks. The basking shark's liver, which may account for 25% of its body weight, runs {{the entire length of}} the abdominal cavity and is thought to play a role in buoyancy regulation and long-term energy storage.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} foils, {{both natural and}} man-made, seen both in air and water, have {{features}} that delay or control the onset of lift-induced drag, flow separation, and stall (see Bird flight, Fin, Airfoil, <b>Placoid</b> <b>scale,</b> Tubercle, Vortex generator, Canard (close-coupled), Blown flap, Leading edge slot, Leading edge slats), as well as Wingtip vortices (see Winglet).|$|R
60|$|Section 3. The {{skin of the}} dog-fish {{is closely}} set with pointed tooth-like scales, the <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> and these are {{continued}} over the lips into the mouth as teeth. Each scale consists of a base of true bone, with a little tubercle of a harder substance, dentine, capped by a still denser covering, the enamel. The enamel {{is derived from the}} outer layer of the embryonic dog-fish, the epiblast, which also gives rise to the epidermis; while the dentine and bony base arise in the underlying mesoblast, the dermis. A mammalian tooth has essentially the same structure: an outer coat of enamel, derived from epiblast, overlies a mass of dentine, resting on bone, but the dentine is excavated internally, to form a pulpcavity containing blood-vessels and nerves. Most land animals, however, have teeth only in their mouths, and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute the armour of the dog-fish. Besides the teeth there perhaps remain relics of the <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata, in the membrane bones. How <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> may have given rise to these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as the vomer of the frog. This bone lies {{on the roof of the}} frog's mouth, and bears a number of denticles, and altogether there is a very strong resemblance in it to a number of <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> the bony bases of which have become confluent. In the salamander, behind the teeth-bearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone. The same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog, but without teeth. In some tailed amphibians the vomers and splenials are known to arise by the fusion of small denticles. These facts seem to point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases, and their withdrawal from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as membrane bones, a process entirely completed in the mammalian type.|$|E
60|$|Section 46. Hence we may {{infer that}} the mammals {{were the last}} of the three groups, of which we have taken types, to appear upon the earth, and that the fishes preceded, the amphibia. Workers in an entirely {{independent}} province, that of palaeontology, completely endorse this supposition. The first Vertebrata to appear in the fossil history of the world are fishes; fish spines and <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> (compare dog-fish) appear in the Ordovician rocks. In the coal measures come the amphibia; and in the Permo-triassic strata, reptile-like mammals. In the Devonian rocks, which come between the Silurian and the coal measures, we find very plentiful remains of certain fish called the dipnoi, of which group three genera still survive; they display, in numberless features of their anatomy, transitional characters between true fish and amphibia. Similarly, in the Permian come mammal-like reptiles, that point also downward to the amphibia. We find, therefore, the story told by the ovum written also in the rocks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Placoid</b> <b>scales</b> {{are found}} in the {{cartilaginous}} fishes: sharks, rays, and chimaeras. They are also called dermal denticles. <b>Placoid</b> <b>scales</b> are structurally homologous with vertebrate teeth ("denticle" [...] translates to [...] "small tooth"), having a central pulp cavity supplied with blood vessels, surrounded by a conical layer of dentine, all of which sits on top of a rectangular basal plate that rests on the dermis. The outermost layer is composed of vitrodentine, a largely inorganic enamel-like substance. <b>Placoid</b> <b>scales</b> cannot grow in size, but rather more scales are added as the fish increases in size.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Placoid</b> <b>scales</b> as {{viewed through}} an {{electron}} microscope. Also called dermal denticles, these are structurally homologous with vertebrate teeth.|$|E
50|$|Bony {{fish have}} no <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> Mucus glands coat the body. Most have smooth and {{overlapping}} ganoid, cycloid or ctenoid scales.|$|E
50|$|Scoliodon has an elongated, spindle-shaped, body tapered at the ends, {{making it}} a very fast swimmer. The trunk and tail are {{laterally}} compressed, while the head region is dorsoventrally compressed. The entire body is covered by an exoskeleton of <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> The mouth {{is located on the}} ventral side and is bound on both sides by jaws. It has two rows of homodont or polyphyodont teeth, which are homologous to the <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> covering the body.It is a marine fish.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> {{also called}} dermal denticles, {{are similar to}} teeth {{in that they are}} made of dentin covered by enamel. They are typical of sharks and rays.|$|E
50|$|Chondrichthyans have toothlike scales called dermal denticles or <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> Denticles provide two functions, {{protection}} {{and in most}} cases, streamlining. Mucous glands exist in some species as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Placoid</b> <b>scales</b> {{are found}} on {{cartilaginous}} fish including sharks. These scales, also called denticles, {{are similar in}} structure to teeth, and have one median spine and two lateral spines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dorsal fin}} spines of dogfish sharks and chimaeras, the {{stinging}} tail spines of stingrays, and the [...] "saw" [...] teeth of sawfishes and sawsharks are fused and modified <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the class Chondrichthyes, {{chimaera}} skeletons are constructed of cartilage. Their skin is smooth and largely covered by <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> and their color can range from black to brownish gray. For defense, most chimaeras have a venomous spine in front of the dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|Cartilaginous fishes (sharks and rays) {{are covered}} with <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> Most bony fishes {{are covered with}} the cycloid scales of salmon and carp, or the ctenoid scales of perch, or the ganoid scales of {{sturgeons}} and gars. Some species are covered instead by scutes, and others have no outer covering on the skin.|$|E
50|$|Members of the elasmobranchii {{subclass}} have no swim bladders, five {{to seven}} pairs of gill clefts opening individually to the exterior, rigid dorsal fins, and small <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> The teeth are in several series; the upper jaw is not fused to the cranium, and the lower jaw is articulated with the upper.|$|E
50|$|The elegestolepis is a {{primitive}} shark that lived during the Silurian and Devonian periods. It was {{closely related to}} the mongolepis and the Polymerolepis. It is only known from <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> The oldest of these scales have been dated back to the Ludlow epoch (427.4 Ma to 423 Ma), making elegestolepis the oldest known shark.|$|E
50|$|Many {{groups of}} bony fishes, {{including}} pipefishes and seahorses, several families of catfishes, sticklebacks, and poachers, have developed external bony plates, structurally resembling <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> as protective armour. In the boxfishes, the plates are all fused {{together to form}} a rigid shell enclosing the entire body. Yet these bony plates are not modified scales, but skin that has been ossified.|$|E
50|$|A {{free-living}} metamorphosed male {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 17 mm. It differs from other leftvent anglerfish in having no premaxillae and having large sphenotic spines. The jaws bear no teeth, but there are up to six or seven strong, short <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> {{above and below the}} mouth which meet when the jaws are closed. The olfactory organs are large and unpigmented, {{but the rest of the}} head and body is lightly pigmented and pale brown.|$|E
50|$|Cosmoid {{scales are}} found in several ancient lobe-finned fishes, {{including}} some of the earliest lungfishes, and were probably derived from a fusion of <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> They are composed of a layer of dense, lamellar bone called isopedine, above which is a layer of spongy bone supplied with blood vessels. The bone layers are covered by a complex dentine layer called cosmine and a superficial outer coating of vitrodentine. Cosmoid scales increase in size through the growth of the lamellar bone layer.|$|E
50|$|Cartilaginous {{fish have}} a {{cartilaginous}} skeleton. However, their ancestors were bony animals, {{and were the}} first fish to develop paired fins.

50|$|Apart from {{electric}} rays, {{which have}} a thick and flabby body, with soft, loose skin, chondrichthyans have tough skin covered with dermal teeth (again, Holocephali is an exception, as the teeth are lost in adults, only kept on the clasping organ seen on the caudal ventral surface of the male), also called <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> (or dermal denticles), making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are oriented in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed {{in one direction and}} very rough if rubbed in the other.|$|E
50|$|The shortfin {{devil ray}} is a small eagle ray growing to a maximum width of 120 cm and a weight of 30 kg. It is {{flattened}} horizontally with a wide central disc and the head is short with small cephalic fins. The large pectoral fins have curved tips and the dorsal fin has a white tip. The tail is not tipped with a spine and is shorter than the body. The dorsal surface of this fish is brown and does not bear any <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> and the ventral surface is white.|$|E
50|$|The skin {{of sharks}} is entirely covered by <b>placoid</b> <b>scales.</b> The scales are {{supported}} by spines, which feel rough when stroked in a backward direction, but when flattened by the forward movement of water, create tiny vortices that reduce hydrodynamic drag, making swimming both more efficient as well as quieter {{compared to that of}} bony fishes. The rough, sandpaper-like texture of shark and ray skin, coupled with its toughness, has led it to be valued as a source of rawhide leather, called shagreen. One of the many historical applications of shark shagreen was in making hand-grips for swords.|$|E
5000|$|Fish {{scales are}} part of the fish's {{integumentary}} system, and are produced from the mesoderm layer of the dermis, which distinguishes them from reptile scales. [...] The same genes involved in tooth and hair development in mammals are also involved in scale development. The <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> of cartilaginous fishes are also called dermal denticles and are structurally homologous with vertebrate teeth. It has been suggested that the scales of bony fishes are similar in structure to teeth, but they probably originate from different tissue. Most fish are also covered in a protective layer of mucus (slime).|$|E

5000|$|Elasmobranchii (...) is a {{subclass}} of Chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish, {{including the}} sharks (superorder Selachii) and the rays, skates, and sawfish (superorder Batoidea). Members of this subclass are characterised by having {{five to seven}} pairs of gill clefts opening individually to the exterior, rigid dorsal fins and small <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> on the skin. The teeth are in several series; the upper jaw is not fused to the cranium, and the lower jaw is articulated with the upper. The details of this jaw anatomy vary between species, and help distinguish the different elasmobranch clades. The pelvic fins in males are modified to create claspers for the transfer of sperm. There is no swim bladder, instead these fish maintain buoyancy with large livers rich in oil.|$|E
5000|$|Squalicorax falcatus (Agassiz, 1843) - is a {{medium-sized}} shark {{with a broad}} snout and relatively small teeth. Its length reached almost 3 m. It lived during the Cenomanian to early Santonian (Campanian). Complete skeletons are known from sediments of the Western Inland Sea of the Cretaceous in Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming, all in the USA. The teeth are also found in France, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Morocco. Given the small teeth, this species is considered a hunter of small prey. However, teeth marks on the bones of marine reptiles are evidence that these shark also fed on carrion. The body shape {{and structure of the}} trunk <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> indicate the ability to swim quickly. A fully articulated 1.9-m long fossil skeleton of Squalicorax falcatus has been found in Kansas, evidence of its presence in the Western Interior Seaway.|$|E
5000|$|The boa {{catshark}} is {{a fairly}} small, slender but deep-bodied species that can grow to a length of about 54 cm. The front nasal flaps do not extend {{as far as the}} mouth, which has grooves on the lower lip only, and there are no nasoral grooves. The first dorsal fin has its origin just behind the rear end of the pelvic fin; there is a wide gap between it and the second dorsal fin, which is much smaller and has its origin above the posterior part of the pelvic fin. The skin is only slightly rough and the <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> are small. The background colour of the dorsal surface and flanks is pale yellowish-brown. [...] The markings consist of a number of rather indistinct rectangular grey patches and saddles which are outlined with small black spots. Other black spots sometimes form net-like rows but these are seldom superimposed on the grey patches. There is sometimes a scattering of white spots also.|$|E
50|$|Sharks are {{sometimes}} regarded as {{being among the}} ritually unclean foods according to these regulations, as {{they appear to have}} a smooth skin. However, sharks do have scales, they are just <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> which are denser and appear smooth if rubbed in one direction, in contrast to leptoid scales, ganoid scales, and cosmoid scales. The sturgeon, and related fish, are also sometimes included among the ritually impure foods, as their surfaces are covered in scutes, which are bony armoured nodules; however, fish scutes are actually just hardened and enlarged scales. Scales has thus been traditionally interpreted along the lines of Nahmanides's proposal that qasqeseth (scales) must refer specifically to scales that can be detached, by hand or with a knife, without ripping the skin. In practice this excludes all but cycloid and ctenoid scales. A minor controversy arises {{from the fact that the}} appearance of the scales of sturgeon, swordfish, and catfish is heavily affected by the ageing process - their young satisfy Nahmanides' rule, but when they reach adulthood they do not.|$|E
5000|$|In the 17th {{and early}} 18th centuries, the term [...] "shagreen" [...] {{began to be}} applied to leather made from {{sharkskin}} or the skin of a rayfish (probably the pearled ray, Hypolophus sephen). This form is also termed sharkskin or galuchat. Such skins are naturally covered with round, closely set, calcified papillae called <b>placoid</b> <b>scales,</b> whose size is chiefly dependent on the age and size of the animal. These scales are ground down to give a roughened surface of rounded pale protrusions, between which the dye (again, typically green vegetable dye) shows when the material is coloured from the other side. This latter form of shagreen was first popularised in Europe by Jean-Claude Galluchat (d. 1774), a master leatherworker in the court of Louis XV of France. It quickly became a fashion amongst the French aristocracy, and migrated throughout Europe by the mid-18th century. [...] "The appeal of shagreen in Europe was closely bound up with the way the translucent skin absorbs colour, but in Japan, its whiteness was the measure of value".|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} use of sandpaper was in 1st-century China when crushed shells, seeds, and sand were bonded to parchment using natural gum. Shark skin (<b>placoid</b> <b>scales)</b> {{has also been}} used as an abrasive and the rough scales of the living fossil, Coelacanth are used for the same purpose by the natives of Comoros. Boiled and dried, the rough horsetail plant is used in Japan as a traditional polishing material, finer than sandpaper. Glass paper was manufactured in London in 1833 by John Oakey, whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. Glass frit has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive. Cheap sandpaper was often passed off as glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing published in 1688. [...] In 1921, 3M invented a sandpaper with silicon carbide grit and a waterproof adhesive and backing, known as Wet and dry. This allowed use with water, which {{would serve as a}} lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was in automotive paint refinishing.|$|E
5000|$|Ptychodus {{was about}} 10 m long and was {{unearthed}} in Kansas, United States. It {{was covered in}} <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> like other members of Hybodontoidea, reinforced with a large cartilaginous skeleton, and was a bearer of large serrated spines along the dorsal fin. [...] Unlike the colossal nektonic planktivores Rhincodon (whale sharks) and Cetorhinus (basking sharks) which relied upon gill rakers to acquire their food, the Ptychodus had a massive arrangement crushing plate teeth. A Ptychodus jaw contains many teeth, up to 550 teeth, 220 of which are on the lower jaw and 260 in the upper jaw. These teeth were very large as well. Paleontologists believe that the largest tooth plate measured 55 centimeters in length and 45 centimeters in width. There are two distinct formations of tooth plate between the genus; one being juxtaposed, non-overlapping tooth rows and another being imbricated tooth rows. It is believed that the shape coincides with the diet of the species and their geographic locations, but the time it lived has a big part as well. Ptychodus marginalis teeth differ from Ptychodus polygyrus. P marginalis was in the Middle Cenomanian to Middle Turonian deposits in the English Chalk, while P. polygyrus were in the Late Santonian-Early Campanian deposits.|$|E
5000|$|Western Sand Darters {{are part}} of the Percidae family, which are slender fish that have {{translucent}} flesh. Their sizes can range from 1.7 to 2.6 inches. Clear flesh aids in making the fish look like the sandy bottom, a strategy used to evade predators. For some time, Western Sand Darters were grouped in the same category as Eastern Sand Darters. [...] They stemmed from the Eastern Sand Darters by scale counts, opercula structures and pigmentation. The Western Sand Darter only has 3-5 scale rows, thin opercula spine, and are less colorful compared to the Eastern Sand Darter. Their scales are similar to <b>placoid</b> <b>scales</b> of cartilaginous fishes. Fish, such as sharks and rays, have hook like scales. Sand Darters have two dorsal fins that have spikes on them and a black stripe running from the anus to caudal fin.Caudal fins are the [...] "tail" [...] of most fishes. The type of caudal fin depends on the environment the fish lives in because it is the main propeller of a fish's movement. Western darters have a truncate fin. It's squared off at the corners and used for shorts bursts of swimming. Because of their lifestyle, darters have a body shape called [...] (spindle-shaped). This body, where the widest part of the fish is in the middle, produces as little drag as possible. These fish are swimming in fast currents have need to conserve energy while they're on the hunt. True spines are one of the characteristics of Perciformes. These spines are made out of bone, hence the name 'boney fish'. One of the more distinguishing features is the small sub terminal mouth. This occurs when the snout protrudes beyond the mouth.|$|E
