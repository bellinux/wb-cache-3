The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and yachts {{disguise}} their tanks with decoration, but the G. P. O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint. The inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy themselves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the waybill over the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken.

40|$|Maintenance {{is crucial}} to {{ensuring}} and improving system dependability: By performing timely inspections, repairs, and renewals the lifespan and reliability of systems can be significantly improved. Good maintenance planning, however, has to balance these improvements against the downsides of maintenance, such as costs and planned downtime. In this paper, we study the effect of different maintenance strategies on a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>compressor</b> used in trains. This compressor {{is critical to the}} operation of the train, and a failure can lead to a lengthy and expensive disruption. Within the rolling stock maintenance company NedTrain, we have modelled this compressor as a fault maintenance tree (FMT), i. e. a fault tree augmented with maintenance aspects. We show how this FMT naturally models complex maintenance plans including condition-based maintenance with regular inspections. The FMT is analysed using statistical model checking, which allows us to obtain several key performance indicators such as the system reliability, number of failures, and required unscheduled maintenance. Our analysis demonstrates that FMTs can be used to model the compressor, a practical system used in industry, including its maintenance policy. We validate this model against experiences in the field, compute the importance of performing minor services at a reasonable frequency, and find that the currently scheduled overhaul may not be cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fractures of the {{extremities}} {{are often}} complicated by a variable degree of swelling secondary to hemorrhage and soft tissue injury. Patients typically require up to 7  days of inpatient bed rest and elevation to reduce swelling to {{an acceptable level}} for operative treatment with internal fixation. Alternatively, an intermittent pneumatic compression device, such as the Vascular Impulse Technology (VIT) system, can be used at the injured extremity to reduce the posttraumatic swelling. The VIT system consists of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>compressor</b> that intermittently rapidly inflates a bladder positioned under the arch of the hand or the foot, which results in compression of the venous hand or foot plexus. That intermittent compression induces an increased venous velocity and aims to reduce the soft tissue swelling of the affected extremity. Methods/design: The VIT study is a prospective, monocenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the VIT system with elevation {{in the treatment of}} posttraumatic swelling {{in the case of a}} fracture of the upper and lower extremity. This study will include 280 patients with fractures of the upper and the lower extremity with nine different injury types. For each of the nine injury types a separate randomization to the two intervention groups (VIT group or control group) will be performed. The primary outcome parameter is the time taken for the swelling to resolve sufficiently to permit surgery. A separate analysis for each of the nine injury types will be performed. Discussion: In the proposed study, the effectiveness of the VIT system in the treatment of posttraumatic swelling of upper and lower extremity fractures will be evaluated.

40|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are together known as venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), {{one of the}} most common complications after surgery and trauma injury. In the case of critically ill patients, it is also a significant medical and financial burden, associated with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, much evidence has come to light showing that DVT prophylaxis can effectively reduce DVT, and it has been incorporated into various evidenced-based guidelines (Geerts et al., 2008; Nicolaides et al., 2006). The objectives of this study are to examine, through a comprehensive literature review of published studies, the effectiveness of various means of DVT prophylaxis aimed at reducing DVT, and to develop an evidence-based guideline for the use of DVT prophylaxis in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Keywords related to DVT prophylaxis were used in conducting the search in electronic bibliographic databases like MEDLlNE, CINAHL, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. A total of 110 articles were identified, and seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. Data from the seven studies have been extracted to form tables of evidence; the qualities of the studies were then rated, and the levels of evidence assigned according to SIGN 50 : A guideline developer’s handbook (Network, Harbour & Forsyth, 2011). Three studies attained a higher level of evidence with strong methodological design and demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of DVT. The implementation potential of DVT prophylaxis was examined in terms of target setting, target audience, transferability of findings, feasibility and cost-benefit ratio. And it was found that the development of evidence-based guidelines for DVT prophylaxis was feasible, cost-beneficial and transferable in current settings. The findings of the seven reviewed studies have been translated into an evidence-based DVT prophylaxis guideline. The main focuses of the guideline are the choice of prophylaxis used with surgical ICU patients and the strategies for improving adherence and prophylaxis monitoring. Combined pharmacological and mechanical DVT prophylaxis is recommended for ICU patients who are at high risk of DVT. For patients with active bleeding or high risk of bleeding, mechanical prophylaxis like intermittent <b>pneumatic</b> <b>compressor</b> (IPC) or gradual compression stocking (GCS) should be used first, followed by a review for pharmacological prophylaxis when the risk of bleeding has decreased. In addition, routine assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk for high-risk ICU patients and regular checking of fitting and functioning of the DVT prophylaxis are recommended. An implementation plan consisting of communication, pilot and evaluation plan was developed. A 12 -month programme including communication with stakeholders, marketing of the innovation, training of frontline staff, a five-week pilot study and implementation of the guideline followed by evaluation will be carried out. In the evaluation, programme effectiveness was assessed in terms of patient outcome (e. g. incidence of DVT), process outcomes (e. g. level of knowledge related to DVT, compliance with the guideline and level of staff satisfaction) and system outcome (e. g. financial cost reduction). published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance is {{essential}} to ensuring the dependability of a technical system. Periodic inspections, repairs, and renewals can prevent failures and extend a system’s lifespan. At the same time, maintenance incurs cost and planned downtime. It is therefore important to find a maintenance policy that balances cost and dependability. This paper presents a framework, fault maintenance trees (FMTs), integrating maintenance into the industry-standard formalism of fault trees. By translating FMTs to priced timed automata and applying statistical model checking, we can obtain system dependability metrics such as system reliability and mean time to failure, as well as costs of maintenance and failures over time, for different maintenance policies. Our framework is flexible and can be extended to include effects specific to the system being analysed. We demonstrate that our framework {{can be used in}} practice using two case studies from the railway industry: electrically insulated joints, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>compressors...</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{resuscitation}} {{of patients}} in hemorrhagic shock (e. g., trauma, surgical bleeding), the anesthesiologist must infuse normothermic fluid and blood products {{in order to maintain}} thermal homeostasis and tissue oxygen delivery. Occasionally, {{it may be necessary to}} pressurize the intravenous (IV) fluid or blood product bag in order to increase flow to the patient. Several fluid warming systems use a <b>pneumatic</b> external <b>compressor</b> that auto-matically squeezes the IV fluid or blood bag. 1, 2 While these systems have been used for many years to provide faster and easier fluid delivery, problems do arise such as accidental IV delivery of air to the patient, 3 – 6 and extravasation of fluid, causing a compart-ment syndrome. 7, 8 The FMS 2000 fluid warming system (Belmont Instrument Corp., Billerica, MA) is a new IV fluid and blood warmer that uses an integrated peristaltic pump to eliminate the requirement for compression and pressurization of the fluid bag (Fig. 1). The system automatically heats fluid to normother-mia at all flows> 10 ml/min. For flow ≥ 60 ml/min, the fluid is heated to 37. 5 oC. For flows between 10 and 50 ml/min, fluid is heated to 39 oC. There is no heating at 2. 5 and 5 ml/min. Heating is not adjustable. The maximum flow rate of the pump is 500 ml/min. The system also contains two air detectors, an automatic air purge, and a line pressure sensor. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of the FMS 2000 to deliver warm fluid and blood during a variety of flows (rapid, moderate, and slow). The thermal stress of infusing fluids with the FMS 2000 was calculated.

40|$|Pneumatically {{actuated}} miniature peristaltic {{vacuum pumps}} {{have been proposed}} for incorporation into advanced miniature versions of scientific instruments that depend on vacuum for proper operation. These pumps {{are expected to be}} capable of reaching vacuum-side pressures in the torr to millitorr range (from. 133 down to. 0. 13 Pa). Vacuum pumps that operate in this range are often denoted roughing pumps. In comparison with previously available roughing pumps, these pumps are expected to be an order of magnitude less massive and less power-hungry. In addition, they would be extremely robust, and would operate with little or no maintenance and without need for oil or other lubricants. Portable mass spectrometers are typical examples of instruments that could incorporate the proposed pumps. In addition, the proposed pumps could be used as roughing pumps in general laboratory applications in which low pumping rates could be tolerated. The proposed pumps could be designed and fabricated in conventionally machined and micromachined versions. A typical micromachined version (see figure) would include a rigid glass, metal, or plastic substrate and two layers of silicone rubber. The bottom silicone layer would contain shallow pump channels covered by silicone arches that could be pushed down pneumatically to block the channels. The bottom silicone layer would be covered with a thin layer of material with very low gas permeability, and would be bonded to the substrate everywhere except in the channel areas. The top silicone layer would be attached to the bottom silicone layer and would contain pneumatic- actuation channels that would lie crosswise to the pump channels. This version is said to be micromachined because the two silicone layers containing the channels would be fabricated by casting silicone rubber on micromachined silicon molds. The pneumatic-actuation channels would be alternately connected to a compressed gas and (depending on pump design) either to atmospheric pressure or to a partial vacuum source. The design would be such that the higher pneumatic pressure would be sufficient to push the silicone arches down onto the substrates, blocking the channels. Thus, by connecting pneumatic- actuation channels to the two pneumatic sources in spatial and temporal alternation, waves of opening and closing, equivalent to peristalsis, could be made to move along the pump channels. A pump according to this concept could be manufactured inexpensively. <b>Pneumatic</b> sources (<b>compressors</b> and partial vacuum sources) similar those needed for actuation are commercially available; they typically have masses of. 100 g and power demands of the order of several W. In a design-optimization effort, {{it should be possible to}} reduce masses and power demands below even these low levels and to integrate pneumatic sources along with the proposed pumps into miniature units with overall dimensions of no more than a few centimeters per side...|$|R
