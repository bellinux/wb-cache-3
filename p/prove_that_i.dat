500|$|Principal {{photography}} for The Rocketeer {{lasted from}} September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. Filming at the Griffith Observatory {{took place in}} November 1990. The film ended up going 50 days over schedule due to weather and mechanical problems. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce {{in an effort to}} be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. [...] "I was on the set day and night", Stevens reflected, [...] "from pre-production till post-production! And initially, I had to fight to <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was there {{for the benefit of the}} film, and not for my own ego." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Cena {{was interviewed}} for the CNN Special Investigations Unit documentary, Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, {{which focused on}} steroid and drug use in {{professional}} wrestling. When {{asked if he had}} taken steroids he was heard to reply, [...] "I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have". The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question [...] filmed by WWE cameras from another angle [...] in which he is heard beginning the same statement with [...] "absolutely not". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase [...] "my answer to that question". They did, however, edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the [...] "absolutely not".|$|E

500|$|DJ Diplo {{introduced}} {{elements of}} Brazilian baile funk to [...] "Bucky Done Gun". Fellow composer-producer Richard X {{worked on the}} track [...] "Hombre", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on [...] "Galang", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song [...] "a more analogue sound" [...] than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as [...] "refreshing". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, [...] "I just quietly got on with it... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. I felt it was much better to <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could be an individual." ...|$|E

2500|$|The dispute {{ended in}} 2010, when the pair reunited {{for a full}} tour. Paul Wall stated [...] "It {{took a long time}} and us growing.

2500|$|It {{had come}} at a bad time, as his {{favourite}} retreat at Moor Spa was threatened by Lane being put on trial accused of adultery, and five days later Darwin's baby Charles Waring came down with scarlet fever. Darwin's first impression had been that though it meant losing priority, it would be dishonourable {{for him to be}} [...] "induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace is in the field", but Lyell quickly responded strongly urging him to reconsider. Darwin's reply of 25 June was a plea for advice, noting that the points in Wallace's sketch had been fully covered in his own Essay of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and that he had also set out his ideas in a letter to Asa Gray in 1857, [...] "so that I could most truly say and <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> take nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself that I can do so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit". He added a request that Hooker be informed to give a second opinion.|$|E
