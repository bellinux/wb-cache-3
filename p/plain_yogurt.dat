40|$|Introduction and objective: Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are {{an important source of}} many nutrients that are known to have many beneficial effects on human health. On the other hand, milk {{and dairy products}} can cause allergies and intolerances. Allergy is caused by milk proteins that lead to immune reactions, while intolerance is caused by the milk sugar, lactose, due to reduced activity of enzyme lactase which digests it. To avoid the unpleasant symptoms, lactose intolerant persons can consume fermented milk products that are known to have reduced lactose content. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the content of lactose in commercially available fermented dairy beverages by HPLC method and to assess their adequacy in diet of lactose intolerant persons. Methods: Altogether 21 commercially available type of fermented milk products was analysed of which 13 were <b>plain</b> <b>yogurts,</b> while remaining 8 belonged to the group of functional products. Lactose content was determined by HPLC method. Lactose detection was achieved by refraction index detector and its quantification by external standard method. Results: Lactose content of analysed products ranged from 2. 65 g/ 100 g up to 4. 05 g/ 100 g in <b>plain</b> <b>yogurts,</b> and from 2. 61 g/ 100 g up to 4. 63 g/ 100 g in functional products. Conclusions: Based on determined lactose content and a presumption that most of lactose intolerant persons can digest up to 6 g of lactose on a daily basis without obvious symptoms it is assessed that daily acceptable amount of the analysed products ranges from 130 to 230 g...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute [...] Human NutritionDelores H. ChambersThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the sensory characteristics of commercially-available <b>plain</b> <b>yogurts</b> and examine how three "more sustainable" prototypes compared. Three experimental non-fat set-style yogurts were provided – one control and two samples that differed in fermentation time. These shortened fermentation times could result in energy reductions and potentially substantiate a “sustainable” marketing claim, a concept gaining traction with consumers. Twenty-six commercially-available yogurts varying in percent milk fat, milk type (organic or conventional), and processing (set-style, stirred, or strained/Greek-style) were also included. Using descriptive sensory analysis, a six-person highly-trained panel scored the intensity of 25 flavor, six texture, four mouth feel, and two mouth coating attributes on a 15 -point numerical scale. Three replications were conducted, and all samples were tested at least 10 days prior {{to the end of}} their shelf-lives. The samples differed for 19 flavor and all texture, mouth feel, and mouth coating attributes. Cluster analysis indicated approximately seven flavor and five texture (texture, mouth feel, and mouth coating combined) clusters, resulting in 15 unique combinations of flavor and texture. Although no legal definitions exist for “sustainable,” the prototypes’ sensory characteristics were comparable to those of top-selling yogurts indicating potential market viability. This research also demonstrated potential growth opportunities. Despite the current diversity, several combinations of flavor and texture were not represented...|$|R

40|$|Background: Oxidation {{processes}} in milk and yogurt during the shelf life {{can result in}} an alteration of protein and lipid constituents. Therefore, the antioxidant properties of yogurt in standard conditions of preservation were evaluated. Results: Total phenols, free radical scavenger activity, degree of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were determined in <b>plain</b> and skim <b>yogurts</b> with or without fruit puree. After production, plain, skim, plain berries and skim berries yogurts were compared during the shelf life up to 9 weeks. All types of yogurts revealed a basal antioxidant activity that was higher when a fruit puree was present but gradually decreased during the shelf life. However, after five-eight weeks, antioxidant activity increased again. Both in <b>plain</b> and berries <b>yogurts</b> lipid peroxidation increased until the seventh week of shelf life and after decreased, while protein oxidation of all yogurts was similar either in the absence or presence of berries and increased during shelf life.

Goat milk is {{a rich source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals as well as many short and medium chain fatty acids. Goat milk has better digestibility, lower allergenicity and suitable for those who suffer from lactose intolerance.

Yogurt samples were stored at 4 o C and physicochemical evaluation was conducted for 21 days at the interval of seven days. Addition of beetroot juice into goat milk increased moisture content and lowered total solid content while fat, protein and ash contents were non-significant during the storage.

Increasing the use of natural colorants could potentially reduce risks {{associated with the use of}} synthetic dyes and pigments, and could also be beneficial by finding an application of a waste product of the wine industry. A HPLC-DAD with C- 18 column was used to separate polyphenolics, including anthocyanins from the pomace. A roto-vaporator at 50 ?C under vacuum was used to concentrate the dye. Anthocyanin dye was tested for reproducibility, color degradation, and shelf-life. The extraction and concentration overall was reproducible and there was no significant difference between most wineries sampled. From the color degradation testing, when the extracted dye was used as a colorant in <b>plain</b> Greek <b>yogurt,</b> it can be concluded that when all samples were compared (not winery specific) there was a significant difference in L* values (white to black) between week 1 - 6. There was no significant difference in a* values (green to red) for weeks 1 - 6, while for b* values (blue to yellow) there was a significant difference from week 1 - 6. Winery to winery color degradation comparisons deduced that Adam Puchta and Stone Hill's Norton pomace extract were significantly different in L*a*b*. Stone Hill was also significantly different in b* value from Mizzou. For all other wineries, the L*a*b* values were not significantly different, showing a fair amount of color stability in the anthocyanin dye. Based on HPLC results it can be speculated that in all wineries there was a trend that malvidin- 3 -O-glucoside was the predominant compound, though peonidin- 3 - O-glucoside, and in some cases cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside closely followed. These results coincided with previous studies. For the Adams assay, it can be concluded that there was no significant difference in tannin, phenolic or anthocyanin content among pomace from the four wineries in this study.
