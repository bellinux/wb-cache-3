The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide an overview of the literature relevant to pasture P fertilization and the potential impacts on water quality. There continue to be uncertainties regarding interrelationships between pasture management and water quality issues. Despite the extensive body of literature on nutrient transport from grazinglands, limited information is available on the relationships between land use, transport potential, water management, and climatic conditions affecting nutrient losses at a watershed scale. As agriculture continues to modernize and intensify, public concerns about the impacts of plant nutrients on environmental quality will likely increase.

40|$|Abstract. Dairy cows fed on perennial-ryegrass pasture produce higher-quality milk {{in terms}} of fatty-acid composition; however, they produce much less milk {{compared}} to dairy cows under other systems. The low dry-matter intake (DMI) {{has been identified as}} the main factor responsible for the lower milk production in pasture-based systems. To maximize milk production from those systems it is important to maximize DMI from pasture. Many interventions have been studied, such as: manipulating herbage allowance, feeding frequency, time of allocating the new <b>pasture,</b> <b>pasture</b> maturity, <b>fertilization</b> rate and the choice of perennial-ryegrass variety. The results have shown that pasture DMI increases in a curvilinear asymptotic manner as herbage allowance increases. However, increasing herbage allowance decreases milk production per hectare and increases production cost due to the increased need for pasture and land. More frequent allocation of pasture has shown no effect on pasture DMI. Allocating the new pasture after the evening milking has sometimes shown to increase pasture DMI without any negative effect {{in terms of}} productivity per hectare. Allocating a young and leafy grass has shown to increase DMI, {{but at the same time}} pasture holding capacity was reduced and milk production per hectare decreased. Using high-sugar grass was advocated as a way to improve DMI of dairy cows on pasture. Research findings with regard to the effect of high-sugar grass on DMI are very inconsistent. Som...|$|R

The vegetation of the experimental pasture was classified as Cynosurion. It was found that moderate treatment (three grazing cycles per year) without mineral fertilization showed the highest value of diversity index (DI = 6. 08), and maximum dominance of legumes (Dmax = 9. 1 %), particularly Trifolium repens. The highest dominance of grasses (Dmax = 77. 7 %), mainly Dactylis glomerata and Elytrigia repens, was achieved with the fertilized treatment utilized in two grazing cycles per year. Based on RDA results, tested management treatments explained 26 % of species composition variability, where effect of number of grazing cycles per year was five-times higher than effect of fertilization.

The greenhouse experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with 13 treatments and five replications, with the following treatments: (1) Polyurethane foam (density 20 kg m- 3) with phosphoric acid solution absorber (foam absorber), installed 1, 5, 10 and 20 cm above the soil surface; (2) Paper filter with sulfuric acid solution absorber (paper absorber, 1, 5, 10 and 20 cm above the soil surface); (3) Sulfuric acid solution absorber (1, 5 and 10 cm above the soil surface); (4) Semi-open static collector; (5) 15 N balance (control). The foam absorber placed 1 cm above the soil surface estimated the real daily rate of loss and accumulated loss of NH 3 N and proved efficient in capturing NH 3 volatized from urea-treated soil. The estimates based on acid absorbers 1, 5 and 10 cm above the soil surface and paper absorbers 1 and 5 cm above the soil surface were only realistic for accumulated N-NH 3 losses.

Urea was hand applied at rates of 0, 22. 5, 45, 66. 7, and 90 lbs/acre to small plots at each site in October 2000. Some plots received 22. 5 and 45 lbs/acre of N at the fall application date as the first half of a split application to total 45 and 90 lb/acre of N. The same N rates were applied to different plots and the remainder of the split application treatments was applied in March 2001. Dry matter yield was determined in mid-May 2001. Yields at the Neely-Kinyon and McNay farms were similar, and slightly higher than those at the Armstrong farm. Yield response to nitrogen application rates was positive and linear for each additional unit of nitrogen applied. The average total increase was about 38 % for the first 45 lbsN/acre and about 81 % for the 90 lbN/acre rates. There was no statistically significant or consistent relation between pasture yield increase and timing of nitrogen application across the three sites, but there were minor differences among sites. The trend, however, indicated that greater yields frequently were obtained from the early spring application treatments. Data was not collected to assess forage nutritive quality or stand density, however, both could be of value and importance to the long-term sustainability of a foragelivestock enterprise. These results indicate that for the period studied, there was no consistent advantage in applying nitrogen fertilizer to grass-based pastures in late fall or splitting the total application between fall and spring as compared to making traditional spring nitrogen applications...|$|E

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the deviation between measured and estimated soil phosphorus (P) content, over 3 years, in a permanent bio-diverse pasture system in Southern Portugal with grazing sheep, and subjected to annual, differential P fertilization. The results can be a contribution to the development of practical and effective site-specific management strategies to minimize pasture yield variation. The soil and pasture samples were taken from a 6 ha field and were geo-referenced with RTK GPS. This procedure was carried out, each year, from March to May, according to the vegetative growth of the pasture. In October of each year the field was fertilized in a differential manner, as a function of soil P concentration measured at the end of the pasture growth cycle (May-June). Maps were developed in ARCGIS 9. 3 considering: i) the soil P concentration and pH; ii) the average P plant uptake; iii) the differential P application; and iv) the extractable P. The significant temporal variability of soil P concentration and pasture dry matter yield confirm the complexity of soil P dynamics in pastures involving two biological systems: plant and animal, under Mediterranean conditions and the consequent difficulties in implementing precision agriculture techniques. The results of this work indicate that three years of P variable-rate application rate were not sufficient to obtain homogeneous and adequate levels of P in the whole field for crop production. Despite differential P fertilization with the objective of obtaining homogenous values of soil P content in experimental field, the undulating topography of the experimental field associated with the presence of grazing animals adds a notable short-range spatial variation in nutrients that generally arises from heterogeneous excreta depositions. The small and positive final deviation between measured and estimated P levels suggests the irregular and gradual release of P by the fertilizer over years, contributing to an increase in soil P concentration. P input in fertilizer and removal in the crop greatly exceed all other inputs and outputs. However, the pH effect on extractable P, the estimation of amounts of export/import by livestock, atmospheric deposition or erosion/leaching losses are complex and justify more experiments to evaluate the confidence of long-term estimated P dynamic balance before sustained decision making is possible for differential <b>pasture</b> <b>fertilization</b> and site-specific management strategy implementation...|$|E

For pastures and patches, landscape and human-managed features werecharacterized using remote sensing data and interviews, respectively. Attributes of avail-able and used pastures (or patches) were compared using resource selection functions, onannual and seasonal (or annual and monthly) time scales. Additionally, intensity of pastureuse was modeled using negative binomial regression. Cultivated hay land and mineral supplements were associated with elk presence on cat-tle pastures, whereas <b>pastures</b> with manure <b>fertilization</b> and higher traffic-weighted roaddensities {{were less likely to}} be used by elk. The effects of landscape (elevation, aspect, wateraccess) and vegetation (forest cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) characteris-tics on patch selection were consistent with typical elk habitat requirements. The presenceof cattle and the traffic-weighted road density were negatively associated with patch selec-tion. The apparent avoidance of cattle by elk reduced the risk of direct transmission ofpathogens, except during winter months. However, human-managed features attractingelk to cattle pastures (e. g. hay land and mineral supplements) may increase inter-speciespathogen transmission through indirect contacts...|$|R

Amarillo) com e sem adubação nitrogenada e submetida a pastejo com lotação continua. Utilizou-se um delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos ao acaso com parcelas subdivididas no tempo, com duas repetições, para avaliação das seguintes combinações: coastcross + amendoim forrageiro + 200 kg/ha de N; coastcross + amendoim forrageiro + 100 kg/ha de N; coastcross + 200 kg/ha de N e coastcross + amendoim forrageiro. Para estimar a disponibilidade de massa de forragem e a produção de forragem, foram usadas as técnicas da dupla amostragem e do triplo emparelhamento, respectivamente, a cada 28 dias. Foram avaliadas as proporções de gramínea, leguminosas, invasoras, solo descoberto e liteira. O material da dupla amostragem foi separado em lâmina foliar, bainha+colmo e material morto. A massa de forragem foi menor na pastagem sem adubação com nitrogênio e maior na pastagem adubada com nitrogênio (200 kg/ha) sem amendoim forrageiro. A pastagem sem adubação foi a que apresentou a maior massa de amendoim forrageiro. A produção de forragem foi maior nas pastagens adubadas com nitrogênio na dose de 200 kg/ha, seguidas da pastagem adubada com 100 kg de N/ha. A taxa de acúmulo de forragem seguiu a mesma tendência da produção de forragem. Não foram observadas diferenças para solo descoberto, liteira e área descoberta entre as combinações avaliadas, porém na pastagem adubada com nitrogênio na dose de 200 kg/ha sem leguminosa, houve menor incidência de plantas invasoras. A razão folha/colmo, massa de folhas e massa de material morto não diferiu entre as pastagens, porém aquela adubada com 200 kg de N/ha sem leguminosa apresentou maior massa de colmos. This {{experiment was}} carried out from July 2006 to June 2007. It was used an experimental design of random blocks with split plot in time, with two replications using the following treatments: Coastcross + peanut forage + 200 kg/ha of N; Coastcross + Peanut Forage + 100 kg/ha of N; Coastcross + 200 kg/ha of N and Coastcross + Peanut Forage in the following seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn. To estimate the forage mass production availability, the double sampling and triple pairing technique, respectively, every 28 days was used. The proportions of grass, legumes, weeds, uncovered soil and litter were evaluated. The material from the double sampling technique was separated into leaf blade, stem + sheath and dead material fractions. Regarding of forage availability, the pasture submitted to treatment without nitrogen had the lower mass, while that submitted to 200 kg/ha of nutrient without the presence of legume had the highest forage mass. For the peanut forage mass, the <b>pasture</b> without <b>fertilization</b> presented the best result. The forage production was higher in pastures submitted to treatment with 200 kg of N/ha followed by that fertilized with 100 kg of N/ha. The grass accumulation rate followed the same trend of forage production. No difference were observed for uncovered soil, litter and uncovered area between treatments; however, the pasture submitted to the dose of 200 kg of N/ha without legume presented lower incidence of invasive plants. No differences were observed for the leaf/stem ratio, leaves mass and dead material mass between treatments; however, the grass submitted to 200 kg of N/ha without legume presented the greatest stems mass...|$|R

Foi conduzido um experimento na região do Planalto Norte de Santa Catarina, entre maio de 2006 e abril de 2011, no qual foram avaliadas cinco formas de uso do solo no inverno, repetidas por cinco anos nas mesmas parcelas: 1) consórcio de aveia preta + azevém + ervilhaca comum manejado sem pastejo (consórcio cobertura); 2) o mesmo consórcio, com pastejo e com 100 kg ha- 1 de N ano- 1 em cobertura (pastagem com N); 3) o mesmo consórcio, com pastejo e sem adubação nitrogenada (pastagem sem N); 4) nabo forrageiro sem pastejo (nabo forrageiro); e 5) pousio sem pastejo (pousio). O consórcio cobertura aportou a maior quantidade de palha para cultivo do feijão em sucessão, mas não foram observadas diferenças expressivas em atributos de solo entre as formas de uso investigadas. Coberturas de solo, pastagem anual e pousio no inverno não afetaram a produtividade de grãos de feijão cultivado em sucessão. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate in the fifth year of experimentation, the effect of winter soil uses on residual straw on the soil, physical and chemical soil attributes and grain yield of common bean cultivated in succession. An experiment was carried out in the North Plateau of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from May 2006 to April 2011. Five winter soil uses were investigated: 1) multicropping with black oat + ryegrass + common vetch without grazing (multicropping cover); 2) the same multicropping, with grazing and 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen year- 1, applied during the growing period (pasture with N); 3) the same multicropping, with grazing and without nitrogen <b>fertilization</b> (<b>pasture</b> without N); 4) oil seed radish, without grazing (oil seed radish); and 5) natural vegetation, without grazing (fallow). In the fifth year of experimentation, multicropping cover treatment inputted greater straw on the soil, but it was not observed expressive differences in soil attributes among the five winter soil uses. Cover crops, annual pasture and winter fallow did not affect the grain yield of common bean cultivated in succession...|$|R
40|$|Crop-livestock systems (CLS) using no-tillage {{systems have}} been used to reform and recover {{degraded}} pastures, allowing farmers greater profitability and improving soil health. In an experiment with the purpose to evaluate four models of CLS in rearing of cows Nellore, comparing them with the rebuilds performed in permanent pasture, soil physical attributes of quality (density-Db, microporosity-Mi and diameter weighted aggregates-DWA) were evaluated in three soil layers (0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm) six years after implantation.  The experiment was located in the Research Unity of São José do Rio Preto/APTA, in an Ferrasol, texture sandy/medium. The 26 ha-area was divided into 24 plots, distributed according to a randomized block design, with four replications and six treatments: (T 1) permanent <b>pasture</b> with moderate <b>fertilization</b> (application of 45 kg of N/ha/year); (T 2) permanent pasture with fertilizer intensive (90 kg of N/ha/year divided into two applications), and four CLS models with fertilization equal to the second treatment: (T 3) one year of maize followed by two pasture; (T 4) one year of corn and one of pasture, (T 5) two consecutive years of corn followed by a pasture and (T 6) two consecutive years of corn followed by two years of pasture. The goal was to provide information to identify environmental gains of CLS models with their long-term use. Changes were observed in {{the size and shape of}} the aggregates and the presence of roots in the aggregates. Permanent pastures (T 1 and T 2) form larger aggregates, at right angles, with fewer roots, while aggregates in the soil managed with CLS (T 3 to T 6) aggregates are smaller, rounder, with more roots and more darkened color. These observations are supported by the DWA aggregates, since the permanent pasture treatments (T 1 and T 2) showed higher values when compared to soils with CLS. Regarding the soil layers, there was higher aggregate stability in the surface layer (0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm) due to the higher input of organic matter and increased soil structural arrangement given by the presence of roots. Treatments with CLS values present slightly higher Db in relation to permanent pasture maintained with moderate fertilization. Higher Db can result from machine traffic areas. Soil microporosity, however, was lower in the soil with CLS, indicating rearrangement of the structure. Thus, CLS, regardless of the sequence or number of grain crops and pastures not significantly alter the D b and the Mi soil in relation to the permanent pasture. The DWA was the attribute that has been shown more sensitive to changes in soil by implementation of CLS...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaWith {{the rising}} {{difficulties}} of every economical {{sector in the}} past few years, society saw and still sees itself forced to find better and less expensive ways of obtaining some essential goods and services. The increase of oil prices and of the demand of specific raw-materials by the emerging economies, mainly cereals, oleaginous plants and micronutrients, along with the energetic and environmental concerns, led the farmers and farming companies, to the inevitable need of arranging other alternatives within the production strategies. This tendency has the purpose of reducing the resort to the expensive concentrated fodder (principally due to the biodiesel and bioetanol industry), and synthesized fertilizers. In addition, the negative impact that some nutrients are known to have on human health, mainly N, began to arise environmental and agricultural goods quality, safeguard policies. With the contingences mentioned, a renewed interest in white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and other legumes, along with the performance of mixed swards receiving lower levels of N, is taking place. Legumes are known to establish symbiotic associations with Rhizobium, which in return allows the plant to benefit with atmospheric N fixed by the bacteria, meaning that the costs in fertilizers can be reduced. Thus, there are several reasons for finding and encouraging better ways of improving the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency. A fertilizer trial was conducted for 5 months, in Faial Island, Azores, on a permanent pasture, mainly consisting of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.), italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), white clover and red clover (Trifolium pratensis L.). The pasture is established on a light, well drained soil, classified as an Andissol, with an organic matter content of 5, 17 % and pH-H 2 O of 6, 2. At the time, available phosphate was low (20 mg P 2 O 5 kg- 1 dry soil), and the potassium content very high (> 200 mg K 2 O kg- 1 dry soil). The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of a range of 7 nitrogen levels and the traditional fertilization, on the dry matter accumulation (DM at 60 - 65 ºC and 100 - 105 ºC, the last one only evaluated for treatments 0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha- 1 and traditional fertilization), botanical composition and some quality parameters, namely organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP). Seven N levels were tested, N 0, N 1, N 2, N 3, N 4, N 5, N 6, corresponding to 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 kg N ha- 1. The traditional fertilization consisted on the application of 480 kg ha- 1 of synthesized compost, adding up 125 kg N ha- 1, plus Ca, Mg and S. The effect of the treatments on the sward was evaluated in 5 consecutive cuts during the trial. The botanical composition was evaluated, resorting to sub-samples collected from the cut material, where grasses, legumes, other species and debris were manually separated, and dried at 60 - 65 ºC for 48 h, to assess their percentage on total DM, after each cut. The compostition of legumes in the sward according to the treatments 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 kg N ha- 1 and traditional fertilization, corresponded to 2. 66, 5. 54, 4. 45, 0. 40, 5. 24, 0. 80, 2. 68 and 4. 31 % respectively. The OM was evaluated in percentage on DM, and the CP in mass and percentage on DM. The increase of N levels resulted in an increase of DM accumulation, mainly due to the enhancement of grasses, and the depressing of the legumes proportion. The DM (at 100 - 105 ºC) accumulation of the treatments 0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha- 1 and traditional fertilization, corresponded to 1. 85, 1. 88, 2. 02, 2. 37 and 2. 11 % respectively. Also the CP increased with N treatments, but had no significant effect on the levels of OM. The proportion of CP in the DM according to the treatments 0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha- 1 and traditional fertilization, corresponded to 12. 71, 13. 99, 14. 52, 14. 86 and 14. 23 % respectively. The cutting season had a significant effect on the grasses and legumes proportion, DM accumulation, and quality parameters of the <b>pasture.</b> The traditional <b>fertilization</b> revealed not to be the most adequate one, whilst treatment N 4, corresponding to the application of 80 kg N ha- 1, seems the one more suitable for the farm exploration, since it resulted in high proportions of legumes (5, 24 %) and CP (14, 52 %), without reducing significantly the DM, compared with other treatments...|$|R
