40|$|Soil {{in a cold}} {{region is}} subject to {{frequent}} freezing and thawing cycles. Soil frozen for a prolonged period may cause adverse freeze damage to the plants due to cell dehydration or root cell rupture. It {{is important to understand}} the detailed heat transfer behaviors of the freezing and thawing processes to prevent freeze damage, and to devise proper mitigation measures for effective <b>pot</b> <b>planting</b> in cold regions. A theoretical model was developed to analyze the transient moving phase-change interface heat transfer in the freezing and thawing of porous potting soil. The theoretical derivation {{is based on the assumption}} that the soil freezes completely at a single temperature. Microscopic poromechanic effects on heat transfer behavior were ignored. The spatial domain of the problem was simplified to a 1 D spherical coordinate system with variation in the radial direction. Green's function was applied to solve for the time-dependent body temperature. Experiments were conducted for validation of the theoretical model. Reasonable agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements was obtained. The theoretical model developed can be easily used to determine the sensitivity of various parameters in the freezing/thawing processes, e. g., thermal properties of soil, ambient temperature, and planting pot size. © 2009 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|While {{producing}} {{medicinal plants}} is more economic {{in their natural}} habitat than in farms, their establishment problems and slow growth rate are the main constraints under the natural conditions. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the possibility for seedling transplantation of thyme into the natural conditions, in order to investigate the effect of mycorrhiza inoculation on establishment of this species in Bahar Kish rangeland, Quchan. Seeds were planted in glasshouse in small trays for 45 days, after that, seedlings were inoculated with two mycorrhiza species, Glomus mosseae and Glomus intraradices. After one month growth, the inoculated seedlings were transplanted into the natural. A complete randomized Block design with 30 replication was used. The results showed that mycorrhiza colonization with G. mosseae was 92 % and with G. intraradices was 68 %. There was no significant effect of inoculation on seedling establishment at early season, {{but at the end of}} growth there was a negative effect by G. intraradices but a positive effect by G. mosseae. Symbiosis with G. mosseae increased dry matter of leaf, stem, total dry matter and height of the plants while with G. intraradices had reduced these traits or the effects were non-significant. In conclusion <b>pot</b> <b>planting</b> can be an efficient method for establishing T. vulgaris under natural habitats, G. mosseae can be a beneficial symbiant for establishment of T. vulgaris in Baharkish rangelands...|$|E
40|$|Crude oil {{pollution}} is an inevitable worldwide phenomenon in oil producing and consuming areas that stems from human error, accidental discharge and other sources. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the phytoremediation potential of vinca in petroleum-polluted soil. The experiment was laid out as a completely randomized design in 3 replications with different concentrations of crude oil (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 % V/W in <b>pot</b> <b>planting</b> stage). At the end of the 70 -day period, soil samples were analyzed for total hydrocarbons removal. Contents of pb, zn and Ni were measured by atomic absorption from the soils and the leaves. Statistical analysis of data were performed on the basis of duncanâs test and by using of SPSS 16 software. In concentrations higher than 3 % no growth was observed. The growth parameters such as stem length, stem fresh and dry matter decreased progressively from 0. 5 - 3 % crude oil in soil. The results showed heavy metal accumulation in plant leaves and reduction of them in the soil. Heavy metals containing zinc, lead and nickel in plant increased in different concentration of crude oil. Total hydrocarbons and heavy metals containing zinc, lead and nickel reduced were in planted contaminated soil. This study showed that Periwinkle was able to grow and survive in low concentrations of oil and reduced pollutants in the soil. Based upon these results, Catharanthus roseus can be used as phytoremediator of petroleum-contaminated soil in low concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Flowering or foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are {{ornamental}} items usually {{grown in}} greenhouses under optimal growing conditions. Cultivation in protected environments allows for rapid growth and high quality characteristics. When plants reach the desired commercial size {{they can be}} transferred to hardening greenhouses or directly sent to the distribution chain. The growing and post-production conditions such as storage and transportation can have very deleterious effects on the ornamental quality of plants. The major post-production disorders are bud and flower abscission in flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> or leaf abscission or yellowing in foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, the ornamental quality of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is extremely important and depends on the number and colour of flowers or leaves, flower, leaf and plant longevity. The presence of flowers on flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> depends on flower longevity and turnover. The colour and size of leaves of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is linked to pre- and post-production environmental conditions. The post-production quality losses of flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> can be mainly ascribed to natural flower senescence. This phenomenon is highly regulated by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid, but the post-production environment can dramatically influence plant hormone equilibrium. Quality losses of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are mainly due to leaf senescence usually associated with inadequate acclimatization from the production area to the post-production chain...|$|R

The <b>pot</b> <b>planting</b> experiments were performed {{in order to examine}} the application of coal ash to afforest in desertificated areas. Four soils (desertificated soil, sand, Akadama and Kanuma) and three coal ashes (Chinese coal ash, clinker ash and fly ash) were mixed with various combinations and rates in pots, which the four kinds of plants were planted. The following observations and analyses were carried out about plants and soils in pots; mineralogical, physical and chemical analyses of soils, the rate of growth, observation of plants (up ground and underground parts), cultivation of soil microbes, and chemical composition of leaves. The results indicated that the plants in coal ash (especially clinker ash 100 %) and soils added coal ash grew up very well with developed roots and root hairs. The K and P contents in leaves were high in case of mixture of soils and coal ash. The results of cultivation experiment in media showed that the soil microbes (bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi) multiplied in case of pots with clinker ash. The clinker ash provides the microbes with water and living site because of porous structure with numerous cavities. The microbes multiplied around the plant roots form the mycorrhizas. The nutrient absorption increases into plant thorough the mycorrhizas. This study shows the possibility that addition of coal ash (clinker ash) into soils might be effect on afforestation in desertificated soils as remediation...|$|E

The results were based on questionnaires filled by clients of three retail sale points with pot plants: flower shop, horticultural centre and building material market in Poznan and its surroundings. Collected information was analysed for a frequency of purchases, amount of money spent on <b>pot</b> <b>plants,</b> place of purchases, occasions for which plant was bought, preferences of buyers and pattern of purchases. Customers purchase plants in various points of sale from 7 to 9 <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> per year, mostly in horticultural centres and in spring. Plants are used for interior decoration and are cultivated for many years, however cut flowers are more often chosen for a gift than <b>pot</b> <b>plants.</b> Whereas a significant part of building material market customers cultivate flowers <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a short time, and they buy <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a gift as often as cut flowers. Among plants with flowers Phalaenopsis and Anthurium are selected most frequently, and Zamioculcas and Yucca among plants with decorative foliage.

40|$|Reducing indoor {{heat gain}} from the roof into the {{building}} means reducing the cooling energy consumption of air conditioning system hence increase indoor comfort. Apart from its high initial installation cost, green roof is proven {{to be the best}} way in dealing with the issue of indoor heat gain in a building thus contributes in reducing urban heat island effect. Green roof also called eco-roof or vegetated roof is described as a roof that is planted with specific vegetation above a waterproofing membrane. A study in Malaysia suggested that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an alternative to more economic green roof and its potential in dealing with indoor heat gain needs further exploration. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> are plants grown in containers or <b>pots</b> instead of <b>planting</b> them in the ground. This study investigated the potential of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an affordable alternative tool to green roof application in reducing indoor temperature in tropical climate regions. Four similar test cells equipped with data acquisition system were built. Each top of the cell is treated with four different design variables; <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> vegetated, non-vegetated 150 mm depth soil layer and a bare top surface. Indoor peak heat value and lowest value were recorded and analyzed. At heat peak hour, <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> managed to reduce a daily average of 8. 7 % indoor heat gain whereas vegetation cell only managed to reduce an average of 7. 9 % indoor heat gain. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> were also found to reduce a daily average of 35. 5 % of total heat transfer amount compared to 28. 5 % in vegetated cell. Based on these results <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> appear to offer an alternative strategy towards reducing indoor temperature. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> could provide an affordable way especially to urban population in their strategy to deal with the high energy consumption for coolin...|$|R
