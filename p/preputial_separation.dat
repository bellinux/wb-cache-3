40|$|ABSTRACT: Phthalate esters such as di(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP), {{which are}} {{commonly found in}} cosmetics and in flexible plastics distributed by the food, construction, and medical products industries, have been classified as anti-androgens. High-dose DEHP exposure in utero is associated with decreased androgen levels. However, when administered after birth, low doses of DEHP (eg, 10 mg/kg body weight) may stimulate androgen production. In the present study, the potential of phthalate exposure to advance or delay the timing of puberty was assessed. Male Long-Evans rat pups were chronically subjected to low or high doses of DEHP, with the androgen-driven process of <b>preputial</b> <b>separation</b> serving as an index of pubertal timing.

40|$|Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an {{anti-epileptic drug}} that acts on Leydig cells, {{affecting}} steroidogenesis and causes fetal malformation. {{the aim of}} this study was to investigate the effects of CBZ on male sexual maturation and other male parameters. Rat dams were treated with CBZ during pregnancy and breastfeeding. the anogenital distance (AGD) and the anogenital index (AGI) were obtained. Testicular descent and <b>preputial</b> <b>separation</b> were also evaluated. the offspring was euthanized at PND 41 and 63. the accessory glands were weighed and the testes were collected for histopathological, morphometric and sterological analyses. the numerical density of Leydig cells and hormone dosage were obtained. CBZ caused an increase of AGI and a delay of testicular descent and of <b>preputial</b> <b>separation.</b> CBZ also caused a decrease of testosterone level and of sperm count and an increase of abnormal sperm. These results indicate that CBZ delays puberty onset and affects steroidogenesis and sperm quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Altered sperm parameters were reported in adult rats after intrauterine exposure to betamethasone. In this study, male rat offspring were assessed for reproductive development after dam exposure to betamethasone (0. 1 mg/kg) or vehicle on Days 12, 13, 18 and 19 of pregnancy. The treatment resulted in reduction in the offspring body weight, delay in <b>preputial</b> <b>separation,</b> decreased seminal vesicle weight, testosterone levels and fertility, and increased testicular weight. In the testis, morphologically abnormal seminiferous tubules were observed, characterized by an irregular cell distribution with Sertoli cell that were displaced towards the tubular lumen.

40|$|Summary. Blood {{samples were}} {{obtained}} each month for 18 months in 1984 =n- 5 from wild-caught California ground squirrels. Circulating testosterone and total oestrogens were {{extracted from the}} plasma, measured by radioimmunoassay and compared with concurrent changes in plasma progesterone and prolactin in the same individuals. Male plasma testosterone concentrations peaked in January, shortly before mating, whereas female testosterone concentrations were low throughout the year. Female plasma oestrogen concentrations peaked in February, during the mating period. Juvenile males exhibited a transient increase in circulating testosterone in September, followed by testis growth, <b>preputial</b> <b>separation,</b> {{and the appearance of}} epididymal spermatozoa. Juvenile females exhibited a transient increase in circulating oestrogens in November. By the start of the first mating season after their births, neither juvenile males nor females differed significantly from same-sex adults with respect to plasma concentrations of oestrogen or testosterone. Plasma concentrations of progesterone and prolactin in killed individuals were similar to those obtained in previous studies of free-living S. beecheyi.

40|$|Several {{members of}} the {{phthalate}} ester family have antiandrogenic properties, yet {{little is known about}} how exposure to these ubiquitous environmental contaminants early in development may affect sexual development. We conducted experiments to determine effects of in utero and lactational exposure to the most prevalent phthalate ester, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on male reproductive system development and sexual behavior. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with corn oil or DEHP (0, 375, 750, or 1, 500 mg/kg/day, per os) from gestation day 3 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Dose-related effects on male offspring included reduced anogenital distance, areola and nipple retention, undescended testes, and permanently incomplete <b>preputial</b> <b>separation.</b> Testis, epididymis, glans penis, ventral prostate, dorsolateral prostate, anterior prostate, and seminal vesicle weights were reduced at PND 21, 63, and/or 105 – 112.

40|$|Background: A {{suboptimal}} intrauterine {{environment may}} have a detrimental effect on gonadal development and thereby increases the risk for reproductive disorders and infertility in adult life. Here, we used uncontrolled maternal diabetes as a model to provoke pre- and perinatal growth restriction and evaluate the sexual development of rat male offspring. Methods: Maternal diabetes was induced in the dams through administration of a single i. v. dose of 40 mg/kg streptozotocin, 7 days before mating. Female rats presenting glycemic levels above 200 mg/dL after the induction were selected for the experiment. The male offspring was analyzed at different phases of sexual development, i. e., peripuberty, postpuberty and adulthood. Results: Body weight and blood glucose levels of pups, on the third postnatal day, were lower in the offspring of diabetic dams compared to controls. Maternal diabetes also provoked delayed testicular descent and <b>preputial</b> <b>separation.</b> In the offspring of diabetic dams the weight of reproductive organs at 40, 60 and 90 days-old was lower, as well as sperm reserves and sperm transit time through the epididymis. However the plasma testosterone levels were not different among experimental groups. Conclusions: It is difficult to isolate the effects directly from diabetes and those from IUGR. Although the exposure to hyperglycemic environment during prenatal life and lactation delayed the onset of puberty in male rats, the IUGR, in the studied model, did not influenced the structural organization of the male gonads of the offspring at any point during sexual development. However the decrease in sperm reserves in epididymal cauda and the acceleration in sperm transit time in this portion of epididymis may lead to an impairment of sperm quality and fertility potential in these animals.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of male reproductive pathologies, such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism, testicular cancer, and low sperm production in adulthood, is increasing {{and may be}} related to exposure to environmental contaminants. the silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are a new class of chemical compounds commonly used in both medical and nonmedical settings, and they affect development of spermatogonial stem cells in vitro. the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the adverse productive toxic effects of AgNPs in male Wistar rats exposed during the prepubertal period and sacrificed at postnatal day (PND) 53 and PND 90. Growth was assessed by daily weighing. the progress of puberty in the rats was measured by <b>preputial</b> <b>separation,</b> while spermatogenesis was assayed by (1) measuring the sperm count in testes and epididymis and (2) examining the morphology and morphometry of seminiferous epithelium using stereological analysis. in addition, testosterone and estradiol levels were assayed by radioimmunoassay. the weight of the animals at PND 90 did not change markedly, but growth was less in the group treated with AgNP at 50 g/kg from PND 34 to PND 53. AgNP exposure produced a delay in puberty in both treated groups. Decreased sperm reserves in the epididymis and diminished sperm transit time were observed at PND 53, while a reduction in sperm production occurred at PND 90. the morphology of the seminiferous epithelium was markedly altered. Data demonstrated that prepubertal exposure to AgNP altered reproductive development in prepubertal male Wistar rats, as evidenced by impairment in spermatogenesis and a lower sperm count in adulthood.

40|$|Phytosterol esters (PE) are {{intended}} {{for use as a}} novel food ingredient with plasma cholesterol lowering activity which works by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the gut. Although PE are naturally present in the normal diet, the levels are insufficiently large to ensure lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. Therefore PE may be added to spreads to achieve the desired cholesterol lowering activity. As part of an extensive programme of safety evaluation studies a two-generation reproduction study has been conducted in Wistar rats, in which the possible effect of PE on male and female reproductive performance and on the growth and development of the offspring was studied. Rats were fed diets containing PE at levels of 0, 1. 6, 3. 2 and 8. 1 % (w/w) PE over two successive generations, and a wide range of reproductive and developmental parameters, including sexual maturation parameters and oestrous cycle length, were determined. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were conducted including a histological examination of selected organs from F 1 - and F 2 -weanlings and from F 0 - and F 1 -parental animals. Daily clinical observations did not reveal any unusual findings. In both generations, no effects of PE were observed on pup mortality (calculated on litter basis), precoital time, mating index, male and female fertility index, female fecundity index, gestation index, duration of gestation, number of females with stillborn pups, post-implantation loss and pup development. Furthermore, PE had no effect on sexual maturation parameters (<b>preputial</b> <b>separation</b> and vaginal opening) and oestrous cycle length. In addition, there were no dose-related effects on selected organs following histological examination. In conclusion, dietary administration of up to 8. 1 % PE (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 to 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day, dependent on the period of the study) during two generations had no effect on reproduction of parental F 0 - and F 1 -generation Wistar rats, nor {{on the development of the}} F 1 - and F 2 -pups, nor on the sexual maturation of the F 1 -weanlings. Therefore, a nominal dietary PE concentration of 8. 1 % (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 - 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day or 1. 54 - 5. 62 g phytosterol/kg body weight/day dependent on the period of the study) was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level following daily oral administration of PE for two successive generations.
