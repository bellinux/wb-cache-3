40|$|The {{equivalent}} {{test circuit}} that can deliver both short-circuit current and recovery voltage {{is used to}} verify the performance of high-voltage circuit breakers. Most of the parameters in this circuit {{can be obtained by}} using a simple calculation or a simulation program. The ratings of the circuit breaker include rated short-circuit breaking <b>current,</b> rated short-circuit <b>making</b> <b>current,</b> rated operating sequence of the circuit breaker and rated short-time current. Among these ratings, the short-circuit making capacity of the circuit breaker is expressed in peak value and not in RMS value similar to breaking capacity. A series resistor or super-excitation is used to control the peak value of the short-circuit current in the equivalent test circuit. When using a series resistor, a higher rating of circuit breakers leads to a higher thermal capacity, thereby requiring additional space. Therefore, an effective, optimal design of the series resistor is essential. This paper proposes a method for reducing thermal capacity and selecting the optimal resistance to limit the <b>making</b> <b>current</b> by controlling the DC time constant of the test circuit...|$|R
