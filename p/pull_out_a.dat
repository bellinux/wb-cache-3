5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the floor. When he leans over her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April, United took on Toronto FC at Toronto's BMO Field. In the 2010 campaign, United {{were able}} to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 victory against the Reds; this time, D.C. was able to earn a 3–0 victory at Toronto. Their game against Toronto quickly went into good fortune for the Black-and-Red, as United found {{the back of the}} net twice within the first 10 minutes of play. The opening goal was scored by Chris Pontius, which was his first in MLS league play since his hat trick against Seattle Sounders FC last June, prior to his calf injury. Pontius netted in the 5th minute as well as the 73rd minute of the match. Additionally, Charlie Davies netted his fifth MLS goal of the year, and his second in the run of play. Davies' goal was a follow up shot in the 9th minute {{following}} a strike from winger Josh Wolff. Additionally, the game saw United not only pull out their first away win of the season, but their first shout-out since the Carolina Challenge Cup; which was also Bill Hamid's first shutout in MLS play.|$|E

With the notable exceptions of CHiPs, Diff'rent Strokes and its spin-off The Facts of Life, Real People and the miniseries Shōgun, Silverman was unable to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hit. Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch (such as Hello, Larry, Supertrain, Pink Lady and Jeff, The Krofft Superstar Hour and The Waverly Wonders).

25|$|The French cycling union, the Union Vélocipédique Française, {{heard from}} dozens of {{competitors}} and witnesses and in December disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers: Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Hippolyte Aucouturier. The UVF did not say precisely {{what had happened and}} the details were lost when Tour archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and never seen again. Stories spread of riders spreading tacks on the road to delay rivals with punctures, of riders being poisoned by each other or by rival fans.

25|$|In the 1997 Ford Motor City Bowl against Ole Miss, Moss {{added his}} 26th {{touchdown}} {{of the season}} on Marshall's first offensive play from scrimmage. He streaked down the right sideline and caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to tie the score at 7–7. NCAA rules at the time did not allow for statistics from bowl games to be combined with regular season stats, so the touchdown did not officially increase his season touchdown record. The two teams traded the lead {{several times in the}} fourth quarter before Ole Miss running back Deuce McAllister scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 31 seconds to play, giving them a 34–31 lead. Trying to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> last-second win, Pennington connected with Moss on a 40-yard pass on the final play of the game, but he was stripped of the ball as time expired. Moss finished the game with 6 receptions for 173 yards.|$|E

25|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops {{for the change}} to the soft {{compound}} tyres; Ferrari brought both their drivers in {{to enable them to}} reach the end of the race without making another pit stop. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington warned him about the debris but Hamilton did not receive the warning fast enough and drove over shards of wing. He asked his team about tyre pressures and was told no issues had been discovered. Sutil was issued with a five-second stop-and-go penalty for the collision with Pérez. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of the}} 37th lap and racing resumed with Hamilton leading the field back up to speed. Hamilton set the fastest lap of the race at one minute and 50.417 seconds on lap 39 to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 5.8 second advantage over Vettel. Sutil's car developed a water leak and retired two laps later to prevent the risk of his engine failing. Button drew closer to Bottas while Hülkenberg moved ahead of Kvyat for 11th position. Pérez took advantage of a battle between Ericsson and Kvyat and overtook both drivers for 14th on lap 49.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, O'Brien {{was again}} {{nominated}} for the Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year Award, this time alongside two other Ireland players (there were 16nominees in all); the award was given to Netherlands Ryan ten Doeschate. O'Brien was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. On 2March O'Brien hit the fastest century in World Cup history, off just 50 balls against England helping his team to successfully chase down a target of 328 when at one stage they were struggling at 111/5.In that World Cup match against England he along with Alex Cusack set the highest ever 6th wicket partnership in World Cup history(162) Ireland won two of their matches, but failed to progress beyond the first round, finishing six out of seven in their group. With 198runs {{at an average of}} 39.60, O'Brien finished as Ireland's second highest run-scorer in the tournament. On 23/05/2013, at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground, Dublin, he scored an unbeaten 84 in 47 balls against Pakistan which helped the Ireland to tie the match. Ireland required 15 runs in the last over to win the match, O'Brien hit last ball of Saeed Ajmal to boundary to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> thrilling 'tie' for the Irish team.|$|E
25|$|Heidfeld placed {{pressure}} onto Abt but Vergne {{was drawing}} closer to him, allowing Abt to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small {{advantage over the}} two drivers. Vergne began his attack before {{the opening of the}} pit stop window and moved ahead of Heidfeld at the turn two chicane for third on lap 18. Further down the field, Carroll and Félix da Costa battled each other and both cars made contact, littering the track with debris. On the 21st lap, Abt fell to third when he was passed by Vergne. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap when Lynn entered the pit lane after being passed by Sarrazin for sixth position. Bird and Vergne made their pit stops on the same lap, handing the lead back to Abt. Engel set the race's fastest lap on the same lap. He completed a circuit in one minute and 3.883 seconds, and earned him one point. Abt was on an alternative strategy, and held the lead for one lap before handing it back to Bird. After the pit stops, Bird led Vergne by 2.2 seconds, with Abt five seconds adrift of the Virgin car. Sarrazin gained the most places as swift work from his pit crew moved him to fourth, while Rosenqvist was now running in sixth after starting from 17th position, though his teammate Heidfeld fell to eighth.|$|E

25|$|In fall of that year, Sweetland began {{football}} {{practice on}} September 4, 1900 with 10 returning {{players from the}} 1899 team. His team finished {{the season with a}} 7–2–1 record including victories over Amherst and Oberlin. One of his losses was to his former school, Cornell by a score of 6–0. Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans optimistic that the Orange could <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's Percy Field, Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, Raymond Starbuck, had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went {{through a hole in the}} Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's halfback A. B. Morrison caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until about two minutes to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown. After the game Cornell accused Coach Sweetland's team of rough and dirty play.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} series against the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw threw seven shutout innings {{in the first game}} of the series, leading the Dodgers to a 6–0 victory. In the second game, the Dodgers dropped the contest 3–2 in ten innings as reliever Octavio Dotel threw three wild pitches that led to the go-ahead run scoring. The Dodgers came up on top in the final game of the series, when Ted Lilly pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout and Reed Johnson hit a two-run home run for the only runs of the game, 2–0. The Cincinnati Reds came to town for the next series. The Reds came into the series with a streak of not having won a game at Dodger Stadium since 2005. They snapped that streak the first game, when Reds starter Homer Bailey shut down the Dodgers offense and the Reds capitalized on a throwing error by Dodger starter Carlos Monasterios to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 victory. Monasterios started the game after Vicente Padilla was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The Dodgers offense, dormant for much of the second half of the season, finally showed up in the second game of the series. The Dodgers slugged back-to-back homers in both the second and third innings off Reds starter Johnny Cueto and held on for an 8–5 victory. However, the bats vanished again the following day as the Dodgers lost 5–2 despite a strong start from Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 in seven innings. In an effort to bolster their catching corps, depleted by Russell Martin's season-ending injury, the Dodgers acquired Rod Barajas off waivers from the New York Mets on August 22.|$|E

Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment’s window onto the street below, and often started arguments with the audience, so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him, but it was Fascher’s job to protect Lennon and the group.

Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. I guess they thought I could <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E
500|$|By 1946, Robinson {{had fought}} 75 fights to a 73–1–1 record, and beaten every top {{contender}} in the welterweight division. However, {{he refused to}} cooperate with the Mafia, which controlled much of boxing at the time, and was denied a chance to fight for the welterweight championship. Robinson was finally given a chance to win a title against Tommy Bell on December 20, 1946. Robinson had already beaten Bell once via decision in 1945. The two fought for the title vacated by Servo, who had himself lost twice to Robinson in non-title bouts. In the fight, Robinson, who only a month before had been involved in a 10-round brawl with Artie Levine, was knocked down by Bell. The fight was called a [...] "war", but Robinson was able to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> close 15-round decision, winning the vacant World Welterweight title.|$|E

The two were part of a gang of at least a dozen men who had headed off to beat up Wessel. They went to the flat, where Wessel, who was expecting a visit from the leader of another SA Sturm group, opened the door. Wessel was shot almost immediately, although it was later claimed that Wessel had attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun, and therefore had been shot in self-defense; this was denied by eyewitnesses, who said that Wessel did not have time enough to react. The attackers searched the room, removed a pistol from the wardrobe and a rubber truncheon, and then fled the scene, meeting up with the rest of the men in the street. The entire group then returned to their usual nighttime activities.|$|E

Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing but talk, playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois is tempted to buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by money and power, which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide who gets to be the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E
