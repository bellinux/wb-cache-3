5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another <b>periodicity</b> in the data unaccounted for by the first planet. This <b>periodicity</b> {{could be explained by}} assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the <b>periodicity</b> could not be explained by stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical <b>periodicity</b> seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such <b>periodicity</b> is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical <b>periodicity</b> would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical <b>periodicity,</b> each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} a Milankovitch cycle {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the <b>periodicity</b> of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant <b>periodicity</b> corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E

30|$|The wavelet and FFT {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} lunar and solar <b>periodicities</b> are mingled. The summary in Table  2 showed several cycles presenting both Sun- and Moon-related <b>periodicities.</b> In Střeštík (1998), <b>periodicities</b> around 27  days and 29 and 30  days appeared as significant, although the author associated {{the latter to}} the modulation by the annual wave in solar tides. Table  2 also shows that during maxima, most <b>periodicities</b> {{are related to the}} Sun or mainly the Sun, which is expected since during these epochs the solar activity is higher and should dominate the lunar effects. During minima, the Sun–Moon-related <b>periodicities</b> are more numerous, indicating that the Moon effect is more evident than in times of higher solar activity. Because the lunar cycle and solar rotation have slightly different periods, the relative phase drifts should produce random peaks/dips as shown in Figs.  3 and 4.|$|R

5|$|Transits of Venus {{are among}} the rarest of {{predictable}} astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years.

5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such <b>periodicity</b> to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the periodic variations observed in OGLE I-band light curves of SMC Be/X-ray binaries, discovering new optical <b>periodicities</b> in 9 systems. We find that these <b>periodicities</b> derive {{from a number of}} mechanisms, notably disturbance of the decretion disk on the orbital period of the system, and aliased non-radial pulsations. We de-velop metrics that allow these mechanisms to be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} shape of the folded optical light curve, and use these metrics to categorise the <b>periodicities</b> present in ∼ 50 SMC binary systems. We conclude that extreme care must be taken in the interpretation of the OGLE light curves since only around 30 % of the <b>periodicities</b> present can be unambiguously attributed to orbital periods...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>periodicities</b> {{associated with}} the last two-and-a-half solar activity cycles with the novel Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method. Raw data signals of five different observational proxies: the 10. 7 cm radio flux intensity, the helioseismic frequency shift, and the sunspot area signals recorded from the whole solar disc, and separately from the Northern and Southern hemispheres, were expanded into a set of intrinsic modes with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique. Instant and mean periods of each empirical mode were obtained {{with the use of}} the Hilbert transform applied independently to each separate mode. The <b>periodicities</b> were allocated to three distinct groups: short-term variations (with periods shorter than 0. 5 yr), quasi-biennial oscillations (with typical periods from 0. 5 yr to 3. 9 yr), and longer <b>periodicities,</b> e. g. such as the 11 yr cycle. All <b>periodicities</b> detected in the examined solar cycles 22 – 24 are consistent with the well-known results found in the earlier solar epochs. We have demonstrated that the HHT method is a good tool for characterizing <b>periodicities</b> in the helioseismic data, which are necessarily relatively limited in terms of their time resolution. <b>Periodicities</b> obtained using the helioseismic data are, nevertheless, consistent with those found in other proxies. Since helioseismic oscillations are sensitive to the solar interior, this indicates that the behaviour of surface and atmospheric magnetic activity reflects that of the Sun's internal magnetic field. All identified intrinsic modes are seen to have clear amplitude modulation highly correlated with the 11 yr cycle. This amplitude modulation is most pronounced in the short-period modes. The short-term <b>periodicities</b> were found to be multiples of the shortest period, of 25 d. This ordering of the short-term <b>periodicities</b> is consistent with the previous findings. Signatures of the north–south asymmetry were detected in the individual hemisphere sunspot area indices. Furthermore, evidence of the last ‘extended’ solar minimum was detected too...|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{point out}} another {{important}} result. Figure 3 suggests that pairs of 11 -year and (24 ± 4)-year <b>periodicities</b> occurred five times, {{corresponding to the}} Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton minima. However, we can also identify <b>periodicities</b> around 320 CE, 400 CE, 630 CE, and 820 CE. They {{may be related to}} global cold periods, since they coincide with the extension peaks of Swiss glaciers (Holzhauser et al. 2005). Among them, the <b>periodicities</b> around 400 CE and 630 CE may be induced by the solar activity suggested by Usoskin et al. (2007).|$|R
5|$|As the 100,000-year <b>periodicity</b> only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is {{insufficient}} information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The <b>periodicity</b> and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E
5|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, wave <b>periodicity</b> and heights, tides, and precipitation.

5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S.

A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend.

5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period planet in an orbit at around 5 AU from the star. Even when both of the two planets were accounted for, there was still a <b>periodicity</b> at around 43 days. However, this period is close to the rotation period of 55 Cancri A, which led to the possibility that the 43-day period was caused by stellar rotation rather than a planet.

Even after accounting for these two planets, a <b>periodicity</b> at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity.
