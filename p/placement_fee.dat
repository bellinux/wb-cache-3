5000|$|There {{are several}} sites {{that claim to}} be the first PPC model on the web, with many {{appearing}} in the mid-1990s. For example, in 1996, the first known and documented version of a PPC was included in a web directory called Planet Oasis. This was a desktop application featuring links to informational and commercial web sites, and it was developed by Ark Interface II, a division of Packard Bell NEC Computers. The initial reactions from commercial companies to Ark Interface II's [...] "pay-per-visit" [...] model were skeptical, however.

50|$|Recognizing {{that the}} cost could be an {{impediment}} to students of limited means, {{a number of states}} and municipalities independent of the College Board have partially or fully subsidized the cost. For example, the state of Florida reimburses schools districts for the exam costs of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the Montebello Unified School District, the Hawaii Department of Education, New York City Department of Education, and the state of Indiana subsidize all AP Examination fees in subjects of math and science, and the Edmonds School District in suburban Seattle currently subsidizes Advanced <b>Placement</b> <b>fees</b> of students who enroll in the free school lunch program.

5000|$|Be aware, {{there are}} many small {{businesses}} which recruit foreign teachers and find them either a formal job or tutoring positions for a <b>placement</b> <b>fee.</b> Many of these small businesses are known to rip off unsuspected foreigners. If offered positions or you feel {{this may be the}} case, a good search with Google may produce hopefully good reports. If possible, always try to skype or talk to a westerner currently working at that school to verify the quality of the position. For larger cities, there are large expat communities and many online groups which can be used for researching as well. Chinese app 'wechat' (similar to the Western Whats App) has a large number of these expat groups. There are also a few Facebook groups such as 'teachingjobsaroundchina' and 'ChinaTEFLers teachers and applicants' which were created by Expats listing quality safe jobs that the Expats have experience with. Also, blogs ran by TEFL teachers such as chinatefler.com or harro! are a good source of first hand information for building a picture of what to expect there.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{high-end}} executive search, delimited or engaged search, {{is often}} improperly categorized as retained search, {{although there are}} distinct differences. Similar to retained search firms, delimited/engaged search firms require an up-front fee before engaging the search. Unlike a conventional retainer, however, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee is refundable if the recruiter fails to achieve a hire or other deliverable specified in the contract. Moreover, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee does not follow the typical 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model of retainers, but rather is a relatively small up-front fee which is discounted from the final <b>placement</b> <b>fee</b> of 25-35% of the successful candidate’s first year compensation. Both retained and delimited/engaged searches involve partial payment prior to filling the job, and the contracted recruiter has the search exclusively. Therefore, the search can be customized to the client organization’s needs, with the search professional providing a consultative service throughout the process. While both retained and delimited/engaged searches serve client employers rather than job-seeking executives, delimited/engaged search contracts always (as opposed to sometimes) state a future date when the project must be completed or the downpayment refunded.|$|E
30|$|Initially, {{government}} agencies were tasked to regulate recruitment agencies {{that act as}} middlemen between overseas jobs and potential migrants. However, {{with the rise of}} incidents of illegal recruiters and the problems brought by debt bondage, i.e., high <b>placement</b> <b>fees</b> that force migrants to give a substantial percentage of their salary to their job brokers, led the state to concentrate on regulation. While these measures, together with the introduction of pre-departure orientations and worker contracts processed through the POEA, they are often reactive and are still limited in terms of migrant protection. As the years and succeeding governments continued their policies of labor export, migrant communities and advocacy groups began to see the limitations of national-level policies, especially as migrants working abroad were not afforded external citizenship rights and were still prone to abuse. This includes problems brought about by physical and sexual abuse, human trafficking, underpayment of wages, and debt bondage.|$|R
50|$|Texas {{serves as}} a hub to traffic victims to Chinese {{restaurants}} {{to other parts of}} the United States. In one case, the Hong Li Enterprise and Texas Job Agency out of Houston charged workers $300-$630 a person for transportation, job <b>placement</b> and housing <b>fees.</b> In 2014, authorities arrested the owners of Asian Garden Chinese Restaurant as part of a major human trafficking ring in San Marcos.|$|R
30|$|Other than state {{agencies}} and laws, the Philippine government also enters into bilateral agreements with other migrant receiving states. Since these agreements are state-level and official in nature, {{it is hoped}} that it will offer protection to migrant workers. One of the main pillars on how bilateral labor agreements are implemented is through the POEA. Since it started, it was initially tasked to find new labor markets and was the primary official deployment agency of the country. However, through the years it has become more of a regulatory body and is solely responsible in creating work contracts between Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) and their employers abroad. While these contracts are transparent and have clear provisions on benefits, salaries and expected work responsibilities for the worker, in reality, these contracts are often not honored in the work place abroad. A good example is the contract between an entertainer working in Japan and her placement agency. Although the contract stipulates that she receives a certain amount as salary per month, this base salary is often deducted once the worker is abroad. Deductions that are not included in the contract can include payment for housing and transportation, uniform, clothes, and food. Also, debt payments or <b>placement</b> <b>fees</b> given to the recruitment/placement agencies are deducted from {{the first few months of}} the contract. It is this system that led to OFWs trying to renew their work contract in spite of the harsh work conditions since it is only during their second or third contract renewal/migrant journey that they have already repaid their debts and can start earning money for their families (Guevarra 2010; Rodriguez 2010; Ballescas 1992).|$|R
50|$|The Labor Export Policy (LEP) of the Philippines aims {{to protect}} and support its migrant workers. For a country who chooses to solve its {{unemployment}} by making work abroad more convenient for Filipinos, the Philippines has made several processes in order {{to protect and}} support its citizens. To be able to work abroad, Filipinos must go through a licensed recruiter or a government agency or have their contracts approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). In order to protect its migrants, the Philippines has made private recruiters pass through certain government standards. In order to be a licensed recruitment agency, it must be Filiipino-owned, meet capitalization and bonding requirement as well as not charging the worker more than one month’s salary as a <b>placement</b> <b>fee.</b> To be able to provide quality labor to other countries and support to Filipinos, the Philippine government provides a number of subsidized benefits such as pre-migration training on social and work conditions abroad, life insurance and pension plans, medical insurance and tuition assistance for the migrant and his or her family, and eligibility for pre-departure and emergency loans. Registration for these benefits, which are administered by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) is compulsory. This is paid for by the agency from the direct wages of the migrant or directly from the migrant himself/herself. In the case of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2011-2016, Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are to be required to apply for all social security schemes of the government Asset Reform. e.g. SSS, Philhealth.|$|E

40|$|Information gatekeepers such as Internet {{search engines}} and shopbots {{play a crucial}} role in the {{information}} society. Recently, such gatekeepers have begun implementing a paid placement strategy, where some content providers are given, in return for a <b>placement</b> <b>fee,</b> prominent positioning in response to user queries. Generally, users have disutility toward the bias created by paid placement, and the search engine can manipulate the placement strategy to affect users ’ disutility. We analyze the gatekeeper’s tradeoff between revenue from paid placement and the potential loss in advertising revenue from the loss of credibility. In the optimal paid placement strategy, an increase in the gatekeeper’s quality of service allows it to improve profits from paid placement, moving it closer to the ideal. However, an increase in the advertising rate motivates the gatekeeper to increase market share by reducing further its reliance on paid placement and fraction of paying providers. When there is competition between search engines of identical quality, they will choose the same bias level. For heterogeneous search engines with different qualities, the equilibrium outcome depends largely on the users ’ cognitive or other limitations on the number of search results they effectively consider. ...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{investment}} banks' {{networking function}} in capital markets, using {{a sample of}} Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs). We argue that investment banks develop relationships with investors through repeat dealings, and that investment banks' networks of relationship investors {{form the basis of}} their networking function. We find that investment banks, especially those with larger investor networks, help issuers attract investors. Correspondingly, an issuer that desires more investors is more likely to hire an investment bank than place the shares directly. We also find that issuers pay higher fees to hire investment banks with larger investor networks. Our empirical findings suggest that the networking function of investment banks is important in securities offerings.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{a market}} information and linkage system (MILS) developed and {{tested by the}} Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange Limited (KACE) that increases the efficiency of agricultural markets to work better for smallholder farmers and other small and medium sized agro-enterprises (SMEs). The MILS involves harnessing modern {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) to empower farmers with low-cost reliable and timely market information to enhance the bargaining power of the farmer for a better price in the market place, and to link the farmer to markets more efficiently and profitably. The components of the KACE MILS are (www. kacekenya. com) : Rural based Market Information Points (MIPs) which are information kiosks located in rural markets, District-level Market Information Centres (MICs), Mobile Phone Short Messaging Service (SMS), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Internet based database system, rural FM radio and the Central Coordinating Hub in Nairobi. KACE has adopted a business approach to the provision of its services: users pay for the services. For instance it charges: <b>placement</b> <b>fees</b> per initial offer or bid (US$ 1. 5 - 15), commissions on concluded deals (0. 5 %- 5 %), subscriptions to price information recipients (US$ 65 for 6 months or US$ 125 for 12 months), fees to visiting foreign groups (US$ 2, 000 - 5, 000 /visit) and revenue sharing agreements with SMS and IVR service providers. When the KACE MILS services are scaled out and widely used by many farmers and SMEs across Kenya, the system will generate sufficient revenue to sustain its services without reliance on development partner funding. To enhance the financial sustainability of the MILS services further, KACE has recently initiated two innovations: franchising MIPs and MICs to local entrepreneurs, and establishing a virtual trading floor to improve the matching of offers and bids through a rural-based FM Radio program. A recent study {{of the impact of the}} KACE MILS concluded that the proportion of farmers and traders that say their incomes has increased and their bargaining positions have improved is very high (75 % farmers and 60 % commodity traders). Furthermore, the study concluded that it was clear that during the years in which the KACE MILS has been operational, market integration improved for two commodities studied (i. e. maize and beans). This study also highlights the challenges faced by the KACE MILS, including poor infrastructure that imposes high transport costs to markets, high costs of mobile phone calls and SMS and small quantities of produce of varying quality offered.

5000|$|Taiwan is {{primarily}} a destination for men, women, and children trafficked {{for the purposes of}} forced labor and sexual exploitation. It is also a source of women trafficked to Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Women and girls from the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.) and Southeast Asian countries are trafficked to Taiwan through fraudulent marriages, deceptive employment offers, and illegal smuggling for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Many trafficking victims are workers from rural areas of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, employed through recruitment agencies and brokers to perform low skilled work in Taiwan’s construction, fishing, and manufacturing industries, or to work as domestic servants. Such workers are often charged high job <b>placement</b> and service <b>fees,</b> up to $14,000, resulting in substantial debt that labor brokers or employers use as a tool for involuntary servitude. Many foreign workers remain vulnerable to trafficking because legal protections, oversight by authorities and enforcement efforts are inadequate. Taiwan authorities reported that traffickers continued to use fraudulent marriages to facilitate labor and sex trafficking, despite increased efforts by the authorities to prevent this practice. Some women who are smuggled onto Taiwan to seek illegal work were sometimes sold in auctions to sex traffickers, and subsequently forced to work in the commercial sex industry. NGOs reported a sharp increase during the reporting period in the number of boys rescued from prostitution, mainly discovered during police investigations of online social networking sites suspected of being front operations for prostitution rings.|$|R
