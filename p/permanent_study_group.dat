5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI <b>Permanent</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} metric is the San Marino Scale for {{quantifying}} potential hazard of deliberate transmissions from Earth. While the Rio Scale {{rests on the}} relatively well-accepted science {{of the search for}} extraterrestrial signals (SETI), the San Marino scale seeks to bring objectivity to the reciprocal enterprise – that of human civilization sending transmissions that could be found by extraterrestrial civilizations (METI). The San Marino Scale was first proposed in 2005 and was adopted by the IAA SETI <b>Permanent</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> in September 2007.|$|E

After 40 years of the Paris Declaration of Principles, in 1961, it started a re-examination of the cataloguing practices and rules, under the responsibility of a <b>study</b> <b>group</b> from the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section of IFLA – International Federation Library Associations and Institutions. The result was the final report: FRBR - Functional requirements for bibliographic records. The FRBR represents a significant improvement in the bibliographic representation area. It was publish in 1982, presenting concepts and definitions of entities, relationships and attributes, giving a new look of the bibliographic object, focalizing users and their actions. The model became the object of theses, dissertations, <b>permanent</b> <b>study</b> <b>groups,</b> seminary issue and a research subject internationally.

40|$|Purpose: Uncontrolled {{studies with}} intraplaque {{electromotive}} administration of verapamil and dexamethasone have demonstrated objective improvements in Peyronie's disease. We performed a prospective controlled study {{to assess the}} efficacy of intraplaque electromotive verapamil/ dexamethasone vs electromotive lidocaine. Materials and Methods: Patients with Peyronie's disease were randomized into a <b>study</b> <b>group</b> (47 patients) and a control group (49 patients). For each treatment session an electrode receptacle was sited over the plaque and filled with either 5 mg verapamil and 8 mg dexamethasone (<b>study</b> <b>group)</b> or 2 % lidocaine (control group), and a 2. 4 mA electric current was applied for 20 minutes. All patients were scheduled for 4 sessions per week for 6 weeks. Assessment before and after treatment included measurements of plaque volume and penile curvature, and pain on erection (from questionnaire). Results: A total of 37 patients in the <b>study</b> <b>group</b> and 36 {{in the control group}} completed treatment courses. In the <b>study</b> <b>group</b> there were significant decreases in median plaque volume 3 from 824 to 348 mm, and in penile curvature from 43 to 21 degrees. In the control group median volume and curvature were unchanged. The difference in results after treatment between the 2 groups was also significant. Significant pain relief occurred in both groups, transient in the control group and <b>permanent</b> in the <b>study</b> <b>group.</b> All patients experienced temporary erythema at the electrode site. There were no other side effects. Conclusions: Intraplaque electromotive verapamil and dexamethasone induce substantial objective improvement in Peyronie's disease compared to electromotive lidocaine administration...|$|R

25|$|There are two {{proposed}} {{scales for}} quantifying {{the significance of}} transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 {{as a means of}} quantifying the significance of a SETI detection. The scale was designed by Iván Almár and Jill Tarter to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection’s potential consequences. The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs). The IAA SETI <b>Permanent</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.|$|E
