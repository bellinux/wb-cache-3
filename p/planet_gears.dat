25|$|On 28 June the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report where they {{stated that the}} most likely cause to the accident was a fatigue fracture {{in one of the}} second stage <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> They had not yet determined what initiated the fracture. AIBN draws similarity to the 2009 Bond Helicopters Eurocopter AS332 crash, also caused by a gearbox fracture. Whereas particles had been detected in the Scottish gearbox's oil prior to the crash, no such indication was present for the Norwegian gearbox. , AIBN continued investigations with no indication of when a conclusion could be made. Also in February 2017, EASA issued a notice for operators to investigate the oil cooler for 16NCD13 alloy from the gearbox.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 2017 the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report {{with an update}} of the investigation progress {{one year after the}} accident. In this report they stated that the accident was a result of a fatigue fracture in one of the eight second stage <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox and that the crack initiation appeared to be a surface micro-pit. The origin of the micro-pit was considered unknown at the time when the report was published. Also unknown is whether the fracture occurred momentarily or over several flight hours, and whether fracture fragments were spalled for detection by maintenance systems as happened in G-REDL. The issue is related to the airworthiness certificate of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied.

The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> to orbit around the sun gear. The <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together.

40|$|Comparing with {{fixed shaft}} gearbox, {{vibration}} properties {{of planetary gearbox}} are much more complicated. In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources as several pairs of sun-planet gears and several pairs of ring-planet gears mesh simultaneously. In addition, the signal transmission path changes due to {{the rotation of the}} carrier. To facilitate fault detection of a planetary gearbox and avoid catastrophic consequences caused by gear failures, it is essential to understand the vibration properties of a planetary gearbox. This paper aims to simulate vibration signals and investigate vibration properties of a planetary gear set when there is a cracked tooth in a <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> Displacement signals of the sun <b>gear</b> and the <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> and resultant acceleration signals of the whole planetary gear set will be simulated and investigated.

50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one <b>gear,</b> called the <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> around the other, called the sun <b>gear.</b> The <b>planet</b> and sun <b>gears</b> mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip.

50|$|Epicyclic gearing or {{planetary}} gearing is a gear system consisting {{of one or}} more outer gears, or <b>planet</b> <b>gears,</b> revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound planetary gears involve {{one or more of the}} following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|E
