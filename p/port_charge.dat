Who soever studieth the laws of the realm, who so abideth in the university, giving his mind to his book, or professeth physic and the liberal sciences, or beside his service in the room of a captain in the wars, or good counsel given at home, whereby his commonwealth is benefited, can live without manual labour, and thereto is able and will bear the <b>port,</b> <b>charge</b> and countenance of a gentleman, he shall for money have a coat and arms bestowed upon him by heralds (who in the charter of the same do of custom pretend antiquity and service, and many gay things) and thereunto being made so good cheap be called master, which is the title that men give to esquires and gentlemen, and reputed for a gentleman ever after. Which is so much the less to be disallowed of, for that the prince doth lose nothing by it, the gentleman being so much subject to taxes and public payments as is the yeoman or husbandman, which he likewise doth bear the gladlier for the saving of his reputation.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to identify the factors affecting shipping companies' port choice based on a survey {{to a sample of}} shipping companies. Six factors were considered relatively important: local cargo volume; terminal handling charge; berth availability; port location; transshipment volume and feeder network. Exploratory factor and confirmatory factor analyses identified five port choice categories, i. e. advancement/convenience of port; physical/operational ability of port; operational condition of shipping lines; marketability; and <b>port</b> <b>charge.</b> A comparison between the main trunk and feeder service providers indicated that the former face more intense competition than the latter.

40|$|AbstractLonger {{dwelling}} {{time in a}} port cause cost inefficiency and uncertainty in ship scheduling. Due to higher <b>port</b> <b>charge,</b> unnecessary queue in a port should be avoided since it will reduce ship utilization and increase operation cost. In the context of industrial shipping, the lateness of a trip of a ship may also cause inventory stock out in the destination ports. These risks will be disadvantages for the supplier since he is also responsible to manage the inventory of commodity in the depot of buyers. The supplier will be charged penalty cost for the lateness under the agreement of Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). The model which combines transportation and inventory decisions in literature is called Inventory Routing Problem (IRP). In this research, we modify the basic model of IRP for ship scheduling to include some decisions dynamically made to response the information of {{dwelling time}} received during the journey: speed of ships and rerouting. We called the proposed model Dynamic-Inventory Ship Routing Problem (D-ISRP). We develop a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) to solve this problem. The objective is to minimize the total cost while avoiding the inventory stock out. The total cost consists of sail bunker consumption cost, port bunker consumption cost, ship operational cost, <b>port</b> <b>charge,</b> loading/unloading cost, and penalty cost for late delivery. Since the proposed model is an NP-hard problem thus a heuristic model is preferred. Specifically, we design a new efficient heuristic algorithm based {{on the model of}} interaction theory. The algorithm determines the ship schedule based on the interaction coefficient of ships and ports. The matrices of interaction coefficient of ships and ports is determined by considering the ability of ships to supply port's demand and vice versa. In order to examine the behavior of the model, we conduct some numerical experiments. Our experiments concluded that the proposed algorithm has a high reliability to solve the D-ISRP problem in efficient computational time. We also conduct some experiments to compare between the decisions of speed reduction and rerouting in anticipating updated dwelling time information...|$|E
40|$|In {{two-stroke}} S. I. engines, direct {{fuel injection}} prevents fuel short-circuiting from the exhaust <b>port.</b> <b>Charge</b> stratification helps solving combustion problems at light loads due to excessive ratio of residual-to-fresh gas, however it requires precise determination of the air-fuel ratio. Unfortunately, this ratio undergoes unpredictable variations during engine life, on account of variations of trapping efficiency, mainly caused by carbon deposits. A customary closed-loop control strategy cannot be adopted, since exhaust gas contains short-circuit air. The purpose of the paper {{is to show that}} the problem can be solved with the adoption of an innovative diagnostic and control method. A special test strategy, which is activated both periodically and/or when suitable data are not congruent, allows to acquire and refresh information on short-circuit oxygen. This makes it possible to operate an adaptive control of air-fuel ratio, based on the use of a proportional oxygen sensor...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was done to}} identify and assess the key determinants of service quality {{and the level of}} quality service from customer’s perception offered by Northport, Klang. The literature review identified eight important service quality factors in a port. Data for this research were collected via questionnaire directed to operational managers or marketing managers of shipping companies, the customers of Northport, Klang. The first step in this research is to examine the gap between customer’s service expectation and the actual services received. In the second step, importance-performance analysis was used to construct service attributes evaluation map to identify areas for improvement. Results revealed that all of satisfaction rating for 26 attributes were lower than the expectation rating. The gap between customer satisfaction and customer expectation exist. These results indicate that respondents did not receive the services as expected. Other results showed that respondents were not concerned about two service factors in Northport, Klang, <b>port</b> <b>charge</b> or cost and port location. They are more concerned about port management, employee, information availability of port related activities, facilities available, customer convenience and time factor...|$|E

Its structure is hampered by administrative rigidity which easily disguises the effects of rate changes and complicates the comparison of rates between vessel size segments.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{attractiveness}} of ports in West Africa {{through the development of}} a container shipping lines' port choice methodology. Although many multi-criteria decision-making methods have been developed and applied to facilitate a rational port choice process, few have investigated the criteria used by shipping lines when selecting ports in West Africa. With the rapid economic development of West Africa, the task of establishing a rational model to guide shipping lines to choose their favourite ports in the region becomes urgent. In this work, 16 criteria are identified to assist shipping lines in port choice from four perspectives including adequate infrastructure, port location, <b>port</b> <b>charge,</b> and port administration/port efficiency. In order to quantitatively evaluate these criteria, an analytical hierarchy process approach is used to make use of subjective judgements to compensate the incompleteness of objective data. One of the important findings from this study is that port infrastructure is the most crucial criterion in terms of the port attractiveness in West Africa. It is followed by port draught, political stability, market size/cargo volume, and international networks. The research outcomes also indicate that the port of Abidjan is the most attractive container port in West Africa, followed by Dakar when all the identified important criteria are taken into account...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{inconsistency}} in relation to <b>port</b> <b>charging</b> practices. Some <b>port</b> <b>charges</b> are of a discriminatory nature, and can serve to restrict the level of international trade. For example, in seaport charging there appears to be no relationship between the level of cargo dues and port costs. Cargo dues are nothing more than a tax levied on the movement of goods through ports, and such taxes generally do not apply to other, often competing, transport modes (eg long distance trucking). Such charges reflect the monopoly power of a port. However, in a changing environment, consolidation amongst major shipping lines and terminal operators means that the largest firms and alliances can now influence changes in port pricing. Yet, it is inevitable that many other port users remain unable to exert such influence. Nevertheless, in this new environment there do seem to be increased opportunities to reform port pricing. A port authority can benefit, for example, through receipt of secure long term income from renting out of port concessions, although a concern must always be to ensure markets remain contestable. As well as advocating a change to port pricing practices, the authors redefine marginal costs to take account of differences in the timing of port investments.
