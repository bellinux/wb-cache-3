Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought <b>professional</b> <b>help</b> for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E

5|$|Introduced in {{the series}} premiere on July 5, 1999, Simone Russell is the {{youngest}} daughter of T. C. and Eve Russell, and the younger sister of Whitney Russell. The family lives in the fictional town of Harmony. Simone's early storylines concentrate on her reluctant participation in her friend Kay Bennett's schemes to separate Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald from Charity Standish, and her attraction to Chad-Harris Crane. Chad and Whitney hide their relationship from Simone {{to the point where}} Chad pretends to be Simone's boyfriend to keep her happy. After catching Chad and Whitney having sex, she ends the relationship with him and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with her sister. Disconnected from her sister, Simone becomes close friends with Kay's younger sister Jessica Bennett and Miguel's younger sister Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, and turns to them for support. Simone acts primarily in a supporting role for these two characters' storylines, for instance advising Jessica to divorce her abusive husband Spike Lester and seek <b>professional</b> <b>help</b> for her drug addiction. She briefly dates John Hastings, the son of David Hastings. At the time, John was mistakenly believed to be Grace Standish's son and the half-brother of Kay and Jessica. Simone's relationship with John ends in 2004 when he moves to Italy with David and Grace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{review of}} {{previous}} researches {{indicated that the}} likelihood of seeking <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> among students is related to fears of psychological treatment, attitudes towards seeking <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help,</b> gender and prior contact with counselor. A total of 320 students in Malaysia, aged between 15 to 17 {{were used in the}} present study to investigate factors influencing the likelihood of students seeking <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> for socialisation, social psychological, personal psychological, family, career and study, school work adjustment andhealth problems related to substance abuse. One way repeated measures ANOVA and multiple regressions were used in the analysis.

Victoria had planned to study at Uppsala University, but after intense media speculation and public discussion when pictures of an evidently emaciated Victoria in sleeveless dresses at the Order of the Innocence’s ball and the gala dinner for the incoming state visit from Austria surfaced in April 1997, the Royal Court decided to confirm what was feared.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the extent to which perceptions of various aspects of the quality of marriage and marital instability, i. e. the potential for divorce, is related to the intention of women to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help,</b> we were examined 777 wives living in the formal or informal marriage. The quality of the marital relationship was measured by a Dyadic Adjustment Scale - DAS (Spanier, 1976, 1989), and marital instability was measured by indicators of the potential for divorce (Booth, Johnson, & Edwards, 1983). Intention to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> was measured with the instrument (Šakotić-Kurbalija, 2011), which includes past and present experiences, intention to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> in the future, as well as the reasons why the respondent has or does not intend to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help.</b> The results of the multiple regression analysis are suggesting that a correlation between the set of predictors and the intention of wives to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> is statistically significant, but the association is very low R= 0. 23 (F (5. 771) = 8. 28, p < 0. 000) while the adjusted R 2 = 0. 045, thus it seems that the intention to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help</b> is much more influenced by another factors. Based on the qualitative data collected in this study (questions about why women have or do not intend to seek <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help),</b> it is assumed that the attitudes toward seeking <b>professional</b> psychological <b>help,</b> and their prejudices on this issue play important role in forming their intentions and actual seeking of professional psychological assistance. Since the early and adequate professional psychological support is one of the basic protective factors of mental health, therefore is of great importance to promote the work of professionals and mental health agencies...|$|R

However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find <b>professional</b> <b>help</b> if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s self-esteem, social skills and behavior. There is research dedicated to the psychosocial development of individuals with cleft palate.

25|$|Deacon and Valentiner (2000) {{conducted}} a study that examined co-morbid panic attacks and substance use in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular panic attacks. The authors found that compared to healthy controls, therapeutic alcohol and sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced panic attacks. These {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate if they believe that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek <b>professional</b> <b>help</b> {{as a result of their}} own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit.|$|E

25|$|Bell and Weinberg {{documented}} {{efforts by}} homosexuals {{to change their}} sexual orientation, finding that depending on factors such as sex and race, between 29 and 38 per cent of its subjects had considered abandoning homosexual behavior. Between 40 and 75 per cent {{of those who had}} considered abandoning homosexuality actually attempted it, some making repeated attempts. The attempts included measures such as withdrawing from gay sociosexual involvement, increasing heterosexual sociosexual involvement, stopping homosexual feelings, and seeking <b>professional</b> <b>help.</b> Between 11 and 23 percent of the subjects had consulted a professional to seek help in giving up homosexuality. When asked whether, had it been possible to take a magic pill at birth that would have guaranteed that they would have become heterosexual, between 72 and 89 per cent indicated that they would not have wanted to take the pill. When asked whether they would want to take such a pill now, between 86 and 95 per cent said no. Those who regretted their sexual orientation did so primarily because it exposed them to societal rejection (about 50 per cent gave this as a reason).|$|E
