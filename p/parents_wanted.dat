5|$|Born in Purworejo, Dutch East Indies, Oerip {{exhibited}} {{leadership skills}} {{from an early}} age. As his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> {{him to become a}} regent, after elementary school Oerip was sent to the School for Native Government Employees in Magelang. His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). Upon graduating in 1914, he became a lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army; during almost 25 years of service he was stationed on three different islands and promoted several times, eventually becoming the highest-ranking Native officer in the country.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{grew up as}} a prince. According to {{the second}} chapter of the Śvētāmbara text Acharanga Sutra, both of his parents were {{followers}} and lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Jain traditions do not agree on whether Mahavira ever married. According to the Digambara tradition, Mahavira's <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> him to marry Yashoda but Mahavira refused to marry. According to the Śvētāmbara tradition, {{he was married to}} Yashoda at a young age and had one daughter, Priyadarshana, also called Anojja.|$|E

Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor.

He decided to take up medical studies {{at the end of his}} third year of undergraduate study, but his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.|$|E

She first attended Our Lady of the Lake Catholic High School for Girls in San Antonio, Texas, and then in 1945 changed to Blackstone College for Girls in Virginia.

5|$|Luongo {{graduated}} from Antoine de St-Exupéry in Montreal, a Francophone high school, in 1996. He began playing organized hockey {{at the age}} of eight as a forward. His father taught all his sons soccer and Luongo played until he was 14, at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey. Although he initially had the desire to play in net, his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> him to develop his skating first. Several years later, after Luongo was cut from a peewee team, he made the switch to goaltender. At 11 years old, his team's usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother, still hesitant about Luongo playing the position, he went in net and posted a shutout. In August 2009, the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena. It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goalie after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Plante {{was playing}} for five {{different}} teams – the local factory team, and {{teams in the}} midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his father {{told him that the}} other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week—a considerable sum in those days—to play for a team in England, and a similar offer to play for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante passed them up because his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he {{took a job as a}} clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.|$|E

25|$|When she was 10 years old, Cruzado's parents {{enrolled}} {{her in an}} all-girl {{parochial school}} in Mayaguez. After school, she returned home in her school uniform and played in the coffee mill (her clothes still smelling of fresh coffee at school the next day). She found school boring compared to her grandmother's lessons, and frequently got into trouble. As punishment, {{she was forced to}} read novels aloud to a blind nun. The experience taught her a love of literature which influenced her choice of major in college.

She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it {{at the behest of}} her parents. Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules. She lost {{in the first round of}} qualifying to then 18-year-old American Annie Miller, winning just two games.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.|$|E

25|$|Willing to {{give their}} {{children}} the best education possible, Victoria and her husband entrusted this task to the bright but strict Calvinist philologist Georg Ernst Hinzpeter. Reputedly a liberal, Hinzpeter {{was in fact a}} staunch conservative who made William and Henry undergo a rigorous and puritanical upbringing, without praise or incentives. To complete their education, the princes were sent to a school in Kassel, despite the opposition of the King and court. Finally, William was enrolled at the University of Bonn, while his younger brother, who didn't show the same intellectual interests, was sent to the Navy at 16 years old. The education received by the children didn't allow them to have the open and liberal personalities that their <b>parents</b> <b>wanted.</b>|$|E
25|$|As an amateur, he {{finished}} second in the 1995 junior World Championships and his first big result was winning the U-23 World Championships in 1998. In his youth he fiercely competed with fellow Italian riders Giuliano Figueras and especially Danilo Di Luca who proclaimed he would have won the U-23 World Championship himself {{had it not been for}} the team tactics. Before Basso could turn professional, his <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> to see him finish his Technical Geometry studies. He turned professional with Davide Boifava's Riso Scotti-Vinavil team in 1999, where he rode his first Giro d'Italia. He did not finish the three-week race, but he made it a priority to win it some day. In 2000, with the team now called Amica Chips-Tacconi Sport, he won his first professional victories in the 2000 Regio-Tour.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{later called}} Guru Dev by Maharishi {{and in the}} TM movement, {{was born into a}} Mishra Brahmin (priest caste) {{community}} in the village of Gana, near Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, India. He was called Rajaram in his younger days and was also known as Maha Yogiraj. At the age of nine Rajaram left his home unannounced to follow a spiritual path of renunciation but was soon returned to his parents by a policeman. On returning home, he asked his parents for permission to leave home and begin the life of a recluse. His <b>parents</b> <b>wanted</b> him to marry and live the life of a householder and asked their family guru to convince Rajaram to forget his dream of a reclusive life. The family guru, however, was so impressed with Rajaram's advanced state of wisdom and spiritual evolution that he gave up any attempt to change the boy's mind. The parents then also acquiesced and gave their permission for Rajaram to leave. Two days later Rajaram formally renounced his family life and left his boyhood home in search of solitude in the Himalayas. Rajaram traveled by foot to the town of Haridwar and then on to Rishikesh, the gateway to the Himalayas. Here he began the search for a suitable guru or spiritual master. Rajaram met many wise sages, but none of them met his requirements of lifelong celibacy and an intimate knowledge and experience of the Vedas.|$|E
