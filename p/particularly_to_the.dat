5|$|On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma {{struck the}} Florida Keys {{and then made}} {{landfall}} near Marco Island in southwest Florida as a Category 3 storm. Irma moved north up {{the length of the}} Florida peninsula and had weakened to a Category 1 storm by the time it neared central Florida. On the night of September 10 and 11, the eye passed east of Tampa through eastern Hillsborough County, bringing at least tropical storm winds to the entire Tampa Bay area. Irma caused significant damage to the region, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> electrical grid.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and the early nineteenth centuries.

5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|A {{company from}} the 2/28th Battalion {{captured}} Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10:45 am. One of the battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition {{as the day}} progressed, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill (at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead {{by the end of}} the day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition.|$|E
5|$|During the Investiture Controversy, {{both the}} {{legitimate}} Popes {{as well as}} Antipope Clement III developed another, not entirely new, practice. They appointed their cardinals to the important Episcopal sees in Italy in order to assure their government by their own trusted collaborators. Antipope Clement III named cardinals Hugo Candidus and Roberto of S. Marco bishops of Fermo and Faenza respectively. Popes Victor III and Urban II appointed their cardinals to the episcopal sees of Brescia (Herimanus) and Reggio-Emilia (Bonussenior). The practice was continued by successive popes, who named their cardinals <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento). Also, three successive archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133–1137/38), Balduino (1138–1145) and Villano Caetani (1146–1175) were initially the cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, McEwan's {{acquired}} {{the trade and}} goodwill of Alexander Melvin & Co of central Edinburgh. By 1914, McEwan's bottled beers were distributed across the United Kingdom. In December 1930, McEwan's merged with Edinburgh rival William Younger's Brewery to form Scottish Brewers in a defensive move after the Great Depression diminished revenues. Each entity was initially run separately, and only certain financial and technological resources were amalgamated. During this period the company became an early pioneer of container beer, largely due to its dependence on exports, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, where beer might be stored on board ships {{for up to a}} year. The NAAFI continued to be an important McEwan's customer throughout the century. In the early 1930s, Jardine Matheson approached the company regarding a potential brewing venture in China, but McEwan's did not welcome the threat to their export business.|$|E
5|$|M-17 {{begins at}} exit37 along US Highway 23 (US23) on the Ann Arbor– Pittsfield Township border. West of this {{cloverleaf}} interchange, Washtenaw Avenue is Business Loop Interstate 94 (BLI-94) and Business US23 (Bus. US23). M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue east of this interchange through Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township. The street is five lanes wide through {{an urban area}} between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti running east-southeasterly. Although there are many residential areas near M-17, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, the road itself is dominated by commercial development, including numerous restaurants. M-17 crosses into the city of Ypsilanti at Hewitt Road. This intersection provides access north to Rynearson Stadium, home field for the Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Eagles football team.|$|E
5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining {{the assets of the}} British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{mountain}} railways was conceived by the British Raj {{in order to}} establish control over the Himalayas and other mountain ranges within India. In 1844, Sir John Lawrence, Viceroy of India, embraced the idea of making the mountains more accessible, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British military. In a proposal called Hill Railway, the British planned for a system of train stations across the Indian subcontinent. The locations proposed included: Shimla, deemed the summer capital of British India; Darjeeling, located in the state of West Bengal, known for its tea gardens and scenic views; Ootacamund, located in the Nilgiri mountains of the Tamil Nadu state; and the Matheran hill station, located in the Western Ghats near Bombay (now Mumbai).|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} group of Scottish artists {{to emerge in}} the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was retrosepctively given to John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). They knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914 and looked for inspiration to Paris, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and Cézanne, whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Fergusson in particular would later be a major influence on bringing modernism to Scottish art.|$|E
