40|$|Forestry Commission and Fera pest risk {{analysts have}} {{identified}} the PPM as a <b>priority</b> <b>pest</b> for evaluation. Until recently it was only found in the Mediterranean region, North Africa and {{some areas of the}} Middle East and southern Europe. However, since the 1990 s the pest has been moving north through France and is now breeding near Paris. Unsubstantiated reports also state that PPM is found in the USA and Canada. The recent expansion of PPM in France has raised concerns for the UK and in particular for the south coast of England which is climatically similar to areas of northern France where the pest is now known to be established. At present plants for planting are considered an unlikely potential pathway for introduction into the UK. This assumption is based partly on the low volume of trade in host material and the low level of previous findings. Should either of these variables change then the likelihood would need to be revised accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Stinging {{insects are}} a high <b>priority</b> <b>pest</b> in the {{community}} landscape due to their potential threat to human health and their attraction to human activity and man-made structures. New York State IPM Program specialists and other Cornell extension scientists have made efforts to promote IPM and least-toxic management practices for stinging insects in 2004. A research project tested the effectiveness of baited traps placed at the perimeter of a space in preventing wasps from entering the perimeter. Results indicated that traps were somewhat attractive and may increase wasp activity. Another project was designed to test the theory that sky blue paint acted as a nest-building deterrent for paper wasps. Results were mostly negative, {{with the exception of}} one study. There may be a reason to continue to investigate this idea. Additionally, outreach was accomplished through the development of a fact sheet on acceptable least-toxic management of stinging insects and a PowerPoint slide presentation that was used on several occasions...|$|E
40|$|General {{surveillance}} {{activities have}} an important role in plant biosecurity for the early detection of pests (includes diseases) and for demonstrating area freedom. Currently general surveillance information for the grains industry in Western Australia is mainly collected though reports of suspect high priority pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food (DAFWA). Little information is available on the likelihood that members of the grains industry would report a suspect high <b>priority</b> <b>pest,</b> where and who they report pests to, and the factors that influence their decisions to report pests. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry conducted to determine the reporting practices relating to plant pest and diseases in the grains industry. Results of the study indicate that growers preferentially report to agricultural consultants and the local DAFWA staff; whereas agricultural consultants and researchers are more likely to report to the DAFWA head office. Factors that influenced participants' reporting of suspect high priority pests included the ability to eradicate the pest or disease, free examination of suspect samples and the desire for more information about high priority pests. The ranking of factors varied with the role the individual had in the grains industry...|$|E

40|$|Initial {{detection}} of plant pests (includes diseases) is often {{made by the}} growers and consultants that work directly with crops; this form of detection {{is referred to as}} general surveillance. General surveillance activities have an important role in plant biosecurity for the early {{detection of}} pests and for demonstrating area freedom. In the Western Australian grains industry, reports of suspect high priority pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food is the main form of general surveillance. There is little information on the level of knowledge of high priority pests in the grains industry in Western Australia and the ability of members to detect high priority pests if they were present. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry to determine their knowledge of the signs of high priority grains pests and the likelihood that they would detect a high <b>priority</b> <b>pest</b> if it were present in grain or crops. Knowledge of the signs of the high priority grain diseases, Karnal bunt and Barley stripe rust, were found to be higher than those of the high priority insect pests, Khapra beetle and Russian wheat aphid. A wide range of responses was collected from respondents' self-rated likelihood of detecting each of these pests and diseases in crop or harvested grain. However, respondents were more confident in their ability to detect the two plant diseases than the two insect pests. The {{results of this study suggest}} that further training in recognition of the signs and symptoms of high priority grains pests is required to increase the ability of members of the grains industry to confidently detect and differentiate high priority pests from common pests in the course of routine activitie...|$|E

40|$|Cuba has an {{international}} reputation for implementing widespread biological control of pests, and microbial biocontrol {{is an integral}} component of most pest management programs. One class of microbial pesticides however, has not been developed in Cuba, bio-insecticides based on the Baculoviridae. This class of safe and environmentally protective microbial pesticides is used ever more commonly worldwide {{as an alternative to}} chemical pesticides. The characteristics of the viruses of this family, particularly their high host specificity, safety to non-target organisms, capacity to persist in nature and create epizootics, and the economy with which they can be produced "in vivo", all make them attractive for incorporation into pest management programs along with other pesticides developed in Cuba. The mass production technology is well understood in Cuba and biofactories already exist for a number of microbial biocontrol products. In the province of Sancti Spíritus, the Plant Protection Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, with the cooperation of the Institute for Sustainable Horticulture, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, are resuming the work which began in the 90 ´s to develop baculovirus products in support of sustainable agriculture in Cuba. This work is being carried out with the participation of young Canadian and Cuban students and professionals. The program includes research with the multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis viruses of Spodoptera frugiperda (SfMNPV) and S. exigua (SeMNPV) and the search for native isolates of Baculovirus in Plutella xylostella, three <b>priority</b> <b>pests</b> in Cuba. In other jurisdictions they are well controlled by baculoviruses, and the expectation is that this same result is possible in Cuba...|$|R

Under extreme uncertainty, program managers may decide to research the severity of threats, develop prevention or control actions, and estimate cost-effectiveness {{in order to provide}} better information and more options when making decisions to choose strategies for specific pests. We examine decision rules based on the minimax and relative cost criteria in order to express a cautious approach for decisions regarding severe, irreversible consequences, discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these rules, examine the roles of simple rules and sophisticated analyses in decision making, and apply a simple rule to develop a list of <b>priority</b> plant <b>pests.</b> invasive species, decision criteria, uncertainty, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|The {{terminal}} Pleistocene and Early Holocene, {{a period}} from 15 000 to 18 000 Before Present (BP), was critical {{in establishing the}} current Holarctic fauna, with temperate-climate species largely replacing cold-adapted ones at mid-latitudes. However, the timing and nature of this process remain unclear for many taxa, a point that impacts on current and future management strategies. Here, we use an ancient DNA dataset to test more directly postglacial histories of the water vole (Arvicola amphibius, formerly A terrestris), a species that is both a conservation <b>priority</b> and a <b>pest</b> {{in different parts of}} its range. We specifically examine colonization of Britain, where a complex genetic structure can be observed today. Although we focus on population history at the limits of the species' range, the inclusion of additional European samples allows insights into European postglacial colonization events and provides a molecular perspective on water vole taxonomy...|$|R
40|$|Biosecurity {{encompasses}} protecting {{against any}} risk through ‘biological harm’, not least being {{the economic impact}} from the spread of pest insects. Molecular diagnostic tools provide valuable support for the rapid and accurate identification of morphologically indistinct alien species. However, these tools currently lack standardization. They are not conducive to adaptation by multiple sectors or countries, or to coping with changing <b>pest</b> <b>priorities.</b> The data presented here identifies DNA barcodes as a very promising opportunity to address this. DNA of tussock moth and fruit fly specimens intercepted at the New Zealand border {{over the last decade}} were reanalysed using the cox 1 sequence barcode approach. Species identifications were compared with the historical dataset obtained by PCR–RFLP of nuclear rDNA. There was 90 and 96 % agreement between the methods for these species, respectively. Improvements included previous tussock moth ‘unknowns’ being placed to family, genera or species and further resolution within fruit fly species complexes. The analyses highlight several advantages of DNA barcodes, especially their adaptability and predictive value. This approach is a realistic platform on which to build a much more flexible system, with the potential to be adopted globally for the rapid and accurate identification of invasive alien species...|$|R
40|$|Many {{wildlife}} species cause {{extensive damage}} {{to a variety of}} agricultural commodities in California, with estimates of damage in the hundreds of millions annually. Given the limited availability of resources to solve all human–wildlife conflicts, we should focus management efforts on issues that provide the greatest benefit to agricultural commodities in California. This survey provides quantitative data on research needs to better guide future efforts in developing more effective, practical and appropriate methods for managing these species. We found that ground squirrels, pocket gophers, birds, wild pigs, coyotes and voles were the most common agricultural wildlife pest species in California. The damage caused by these species could be quite high, but varied by agricultural commodity. For most species, common forms of damage included loss of crop production and direct death of the plant, although livestock depredation was the greatest concern for coyotes. Control methods used most frequently and those deemed most effective varied by pest species, although greater advancements in control methods were listed as a top research priority for all species. Collectively, the use of toxicants, biocontrol and trapping were the most preferred methods for control, but this varied by species. In general, integrated pest management practices were used to control wildlife pests, with a special preference for those approaches that were efficacious and quick and inexpensive to apply. This information and survey design should be useful in establishing research and management <b>priorities</b> for wildlife <b>pest</b> species in California and other similar regions...|$|R
40|$|Recent advancements in {{technologies}} of high-resolution, thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing, {{along with the}} affordability and availability of small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in the marketplace provide {{a unique opportunity to}} evaluate the use of these technologies for detecting invasive species across different scales, as illustrated in Figure 1. This project aims to provide end-users with the value of these technologies in guiding decisions and adopting systems based on capabilities to detect species on varying host plants and in diverse environments. Specific and measurable benefits will include reductions in sampling time or changes in efficiency, cost-savings, more effective use of resources, and potential reductions in harvest losses and control costs. The aim of this project is to use predictive models combined with advanced detection systems to increase sampling efficiency and improve first detection rates. The project objectives are as follows: 1. 	Modelling region-wide environmental changes to identify criteria for selecting high-risk surveillance areas and compare these predictors to current selection methods deployed by biosecurity personnel; 2. 	Prioritise sampling times and areas within targeted areas to direct surveillance efforts and increase rate of first detection using higher-resolution surveillance technologies and unique spectral signatures; 3. 	Evaluate utility of higher-resolution cameras and robotic technologies on multi-rotor UASs to categorise and/or collect target pests on different plant structures for identification by trained diagnosticians; and 4. 	Synthesise modelling and improved UAS technologies to demonstrate a practical application for surveillance of high <b>priority</b> plant <b>pests</b> in commercial crops. The project has begun compiling a national database encompassing information on past incursions of stripe rust throughout grain growing regions of Australia. The database includes information on the location and timing of past incursions as well as environmental data including minimum and maximum temperatures associated with each stripe rust occurrence. This database will be used to help develop predictive models that are used to determine the best time and place to sample stripe rust in order to ensure accurate and early disease identification and to minimise the likelihood of yield reduction as a result of stripe rust infections. This will help identify potential surveillance areas for further investigation by UAS equipped with advanced remote sensing technologies, namely, high-resolution, thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors.
