40|$|Recently, some antiulcer {{agents have}} been {{reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, which is highly associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. In-vitro and in-vivo activity of <b>plaunotol,</b> a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, against H. pylori was investigated. Antibacterial activity of <b>plaunotol</b> against a standard strain (NCTC 11637) and 14 clinical isolates was compared with those of other cytoprotective antiulcer agents: benexate, sofalcone, teprenone, cetraxate, and gefarnate, by an agar dilution method. The MIC » and MIC » of <b>plaunotol</b> against 15 strains were 6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/L, respectively, making it the most potent of the cytoprotective antiulcer agents. The bactericidal effect of <b>plaunotol</b> was investigated using an in-vitro killing assay. <b>Plaunotol</b> at concentrations of more than 6 mg/L induced a rapid reduction of culture turbidity, with an extensive loss of viability, within 30 min. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed that <b>plaunotol</b> caused autolysis and treated cells were deformed. In-vivo activity of <b>plaunotol</b> against H. pylori was examined in a nude mouse gastritis model. <b>Plaunotol</b> significantly decreased the number of H. pylori in the stomach of nude mice. In addition, the antiulcer agent enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin or clarithromycin in the infection model...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Recently, {{there has}} been a {{decrease}} in the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori due to the increase in antibiotic resistance of this bacterium. <b>Plaunotol,</b> a cytoprotective anti-ulcer agent, exhibits antibacterial activity against H. pylori. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of <b>plaunotol</b> in combination with clarithromycin against clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori clinical isolates. Methods and results: In the chequerboard titration method, the combination of <b>plaunotol</b> and clarithro-mycin showed a synergistic effect against 67 % (10 / 15) clarithromycin-resistant strains and an additive effect against the other strains. No indifferent and antagonistic effects were observed against any of the strains tested. In a gastritis model of Mongolian gerbils infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, the <b>plaunotol</b> (40 mg/kg) and clarithromycin (66. 6 mg/kg) combination exhibited synergistic effects; however, neither <b>plaunotol</b> nor clarithromycin alone showed bactericidal effects. Conclusions: These results suggest that <b>plaunotol</b> may play a useful role in combination with anti-H. pylori drugs in the treatment of diseases associated with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the bactericidal effect of <b>plaunotol,</b> an oily antiulcer agent, against Helicobacter pylori, comparative studies were conducted using its derivatives, M- 4, M- 5, and M- 6, whose hydrophobicity decreased {{in the order of}} plaunotol> M- 6 > M- 5 > M- 4 by log P determination. <b>Plaunotol</b> rapidly reduced the viability of H. pylori in vitro, and cell death was associated with cell lysis. In addition, <b>plaunotol</b> showed eightfold stronger bactericidal activity against H. pylori than M- 6 and M- 5, while the compound with the lowest hydrophobicity, M- 4, showed no bactericidal activity. The bactericidal activities of <b>plaunotol</b> and its derivatives were related to the hydrophobicity of these compounds. To investigate a possible interaction between these compounds and the cell membrane of H. pylori, their effects on liposomal membranes prepared from phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, which are known to be present in the membrane of H. pylori, were determined by detection of glucose release from the liposomes. <b>Plaunotol</b> showed eight-fold higher activity than M- 6 and M- 5, while M- 4 showed no activity. The effects of <b>plaunotol</b> and its derivatives on liposomal membrane were therefore related to their bactericidal activities. In addition, it was confirmed that the bactericidal effect of <b>plaunotol</b> against H. pylori was neutralized by the liposomal membrane, and that <b>plaunotol</b> led to an increase in permeability of the membrane, as evidenced by measurement of the leakage of 260 nm absorbing-material from H. pylori. These results suggest that the bactericidal effect of <b>plaunotol</b> against H. pylori is due to the interaction between this compound and the bacterial cell membrane...|$|E
40|$|A gas chromatography-flame {{ionization}} detector (GC-FID) was established and validated for simultaneous {{determination of the}} diterpenes (phytol, GGOH, <b>plaunotol)</b> and phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and -sitosterol) in plant leaves,callus and suspension cultures of Plaunoi (Croton stellatopilosus). Under the developed GC-FID conditions, the diterpenesand phytosterols were separated in a single run. The limit of quantification (LOQ) and the limit of detection (LOD) of eachstandard sample were determined. Interday and intraday precisions were less than 5 %. The average recoveries of the methodwere 102. 4 - 109. 9 % and all compounds showed linearity with r 2 values all  0. 9994. According to this newly establishedGC-FID method, the metabolites that accumulated in the leaves, green callus and suspension cultures of Plaunoi were determined. Phytol, GGOH and <b>plaunotol</b> were present at relatively high concentrations in plant leaves, and in considerablyreduced amounts in green callus cells.

40|$|<b>Plaunotol,</b> an acyclic diterpenoid {{with highly}} {{effective}} antigastric ulcer properties, has been commercially isolated from leaves of Croton stellatopilosus Ohba. This Thai medicinal plant was traditionally {{used in the}} form of crude extracts, suggesting {{that it is possible to}} administer these plaunotol-containing extracts without toxicity. To confirm its safety, the oral toxicity of a partially purified <b>plaunotol</b> extract (PPE) was evaluated in vivo.

The obtained extract was analyzed and found to contain 43 %[*]w/w of <b>plaunotol</b> and another compound, likely a fatty acid-plaunotol conjugate that is considered a major impurity. Oral administration of PPE to ICR mice and Wistar rats was conducted to evaluate acute and chronic toxicity of the <b>plaunotol</b> extract, respectively. The acute toxicity study demonstrated that PPE was practically nontoxic based on its high median lethal dose value (LD 50 = 10. 25 [*]g/kg). The chronic toxicity studies also showed the absence of mortality and clinical symptoms in all rats treated with 11 – 1, 100 [*]mg/kg/day of PPE during a 6 -month period. Histopathological and hematological analyses revealed that altered liver and kidney function and increased blood platelet number, but only at the high doses (550 – 1, 100 [*]mg/kg/day).

40|$|AbstractThe cDNAs for {{cytochrome}} P 450 monooxygenase (designated as CYP 97 C 27 by D. Nelson's group) and NADPH-cytochrome P 450 reductase (designated as CPR I {{based on}} its classification) were isolated from Croton stellatopilosus leaves, which actively biosynthesise <b>plaunotol</b> (18 -OH geranylgeraniol). CYP 97 C 27 and CPR I contain open reading frames encoding proteins of 471 and 711 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 53 and 79 kDa, respectively. By aligning the deduced sequences of CYP 97 C 27 and CPR I with other plant species, all functional domains of CYP 97 C 27 (heme and oxygen binding) and CPR I (CYP- and FMN, FAD, and NADPH cofactor binding) were identified. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that both CYP 97 C 27 (85 – 93 %) and CPR I (79 – 83 %) share high sequence identities with homologous proteins in other plant species, suggesting that CYP 97 C 27 belongs to the CYP 97 C subfamily and that CPR I belongs to class I of the dicotyledonous CPR. Functional characterisation of both enzymes, produced in Escherichia coli (pET 32 a/BL 21 (DE 3)) as recombinant proteins, showed that simultaneous incubation of CYP 97 C 27 and CPR I with the substrate geranylgeraniol (GGOH) and coenzyme NADPH led to formation of the product <b>plaunotol.</b> In C. stellatopilosus, the levels of the CYP 97 C 27 and CPR I transcripts were highly correlated with those of several mRNAs involved in the <b>plaunotol</b> biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that CYP 97 C 27 and CPR I are the enzymes that catalyse the last hydroxylation step of the pathway...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Novel enzymes {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites have been discovered in our laboratory from both differentiated plants and in vitro cultures of Thai medicinal plants. The discovered enzymes included (1) geranylgeraniol- 18 -hydroxylase from Croton sublyratus containing <b>plaunotol,</b> an anti-peptic ulcer diterpenoid, (2) dopamine-secologanin condensing enzymes from Alangium lamarckii containing emetine, an amoebicidal tetrahydroisoquinoline monoterpene alkaloid, (3) lawsone-forming multienzyme complex from Impatiens balsamina root cultures containing lawsone, an antimicrobial naphthoquinone, and (4) 1, 2 -dehydroreticuline reductase from Papaver somniferum seedlings containing morphinan alkaloids. Each of these enzymes was isolated, partially purified, characterized and evaluated for its role {{involved in}} the biosynthetic pathway of each secondary metabolite accumulated in its producing plant...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis mainly describes {{the development of new}} reactions of β-lithiooxyphosphonium ylides to access stereodefined substituted alkenes in a highly convergent fashion. Firstly, β-lithiooxy ylides prepared from aldehydes and phosphonium ylides were shown to react with halogen electrophiles to provide a highly stereoselective route to E -alkenyl bromides and iodides. This methodology was successfully applied to the first total synthesis of naturally occurring (5 E, 9 Z) - 6 -bromohexadeca- 5, 9 -dienoic acid. Secondly, an experimentally straightforward method was developed for the stereocontrolled formation of trisubstituted Z-allylic esters by in situ trapping of β-lithiooxyphosphonium ylides with readily available halomethyl esters. The synthetic utility of this methodology was demonstrated with the synthesis of <b>plaunotol</b> [(2 Z, 6 E) - 2 -((E) - 4, 8 -dimethylnona- 3, 7 -dien- 1 -yl) - 6 -methylocta- 2, 6 -diene- 1, 8 -diol] and the first asymmetric synthesis of the naturally occurring geranylgeraniol-derived diterpene (6 S, 7 R, Z) - 7 -hydroxy- 2 -((E) - 6 -hydroxy- 4 -methylhex- 4 -enylidene) - 6, 10 -dimethylundec- 9 -enyl acetate. Furthermore, the chemistry of β-lithiooxyphosphonium ylides was expanded to access synthetically useful disubstituted Z-allylic esters. The synthetic utility of Z-allylic esters was also demonstrated in a versatile and diastereoselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangement to access γ,δ-unsaturated acids. Finally, the synthesis of the side-chain of the 6, 7 -dideoxysqualestatin H 5 was also investigated. It was demonstrated that the side-chain of 6, 7 -dideoxysqualestatin H 5 could be accessed by a convergent and stereoselective organozinc-based strategy This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E
