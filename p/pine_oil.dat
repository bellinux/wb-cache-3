40|$|For many herbivorous mammals, oils from {{conifers}} are feeding repellents. Our {{study investigated}} effects of <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> on feeding and other behaviors of northern pocket gophers. In one-choice feeding trials pocket gophers were offered sweet potato from single feeding stations placed into each subject 2 ̆ 7 s home cage. Stations contained either a scent dispenser with <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> or with mineral <b>oil.</b> <b>Pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> did not inhibit food retrieval under these conditions. Responses to <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> {{and to a}} control odorant, d-pulegone, were also tested in mazes where subjects were offered choices between two goal boxes, each containing food associated with an odorant. To examine the possibility that pocket gophers avoid any unfamiliar odor because of neophobia, freshly caught animals were tested in a maze offering a choice between goals scented with d-pulegone and goals containing mineral oil. The behavior of the animals {{in the side of}} the maze containing pulegone did not differ from their behavior in the side containing mineral oil, indicating indifference to this stimulus. <b>Pine</b> needle <b>oil,</b> however, elicited aversive responses. When one goal box contained <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil,</b> the second mineral oil, subjects were less frequently located {{in the side of the}} maze containing pine scent and consumed less food there. Responses of northern pocket gophers to <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> in mazes are similar to those of plains pocket gophers studied earlier under comparable conditions. Results obtained with both species suggest that <b>pine</b> needle <b>oil</b> may be an effective repellent for all species of pocket gophers...|$|R
