5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>separation</b> {{allows for}} {{three-dimensional}} sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds {{to be created}} {{without the use of}} specialized equipment. The five steps involved in <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> are polymer dissolution, <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water. The final product is a continuous fiber network. <b>Phase</b> <b>separation</b> can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. <b>Phase</b> <b>separation</b> is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{previous}} technique, the TIPS <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> procedure {{requires the use of}} a solvent with a low melting point that is easy to sublime. For example, dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid, then <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water: a polymer-rich and a polymer-poor phase are formed. Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum-drying to sublime the solvent, a porous scaffold is obtained. Liquid-liquid <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> presents the same drawbacks of emulsification/freeze-drying.|$|E

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} {{analysis of}} suspensions of animal cell plasma membranes consistently reveals four characteristic temperatures for lateral <b>phase</b> <b>separations</b> in the membrane lipids. Similar analysis of an aqueous dispersion of lipids extracted from these membranes reveals only two characteristic temperatures, indicating that {{some aspect of}} lipid organization in membranes is destroyed by the extraction procedure. The characteristic temperatures for surface membranes from two different species of homeothermic animals were nearly identical and were approximately 37 °, 31 °, 21 °, and 15 °. A treatment of the physical data revealed that these temperatures could identify independent phase transitions for two hydrocarbon compartments of approximately equal size with lower and upper characteristic temperatures of 21 ° and 37 °, and of 15 ° and 31 °. The analysis {{of the effects of}} temperature on a number of physiological parameters indicates that 21 ° and 37 ° are likely to define the boundaries for lateral <b>phase</b> <b>separations</b> in the inner monolayer and 15 ° and 31 ° the boundaries for lateral <b>phase</b> <b>separations</b> in the outer monolayer...|$|R

These <b>phase</b> <b>separations</b> can be induced {{by changes in}} temperature, pressure, ionic strength or {{by the addition of}} divalent cations or proteins. The question of whether such lipid microdomains observed in model lipid systems also exist in biomembranes had motivated considerable research efforts.

25|$|The {{fraction}} {{of water that}} an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> increases with the percentage of ethanol. For example, E30 can have up to about 2% water. If {{there is more than}} about 71% ethanol, the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> does not occur. The fuel mileage declines with increased water content. The increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits E30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase. Somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures. For E10 it is about 0.5% v/v at 70 F and decreases to about 0.23% v/v at −30 F.|$|E

40|$|An {{array of}} weakly coupled {{oscillators}} can generate multiphase signals, i. e., multiple sinusoidal signals with specific <b>phase</b> <b>separations.</b> Multiphase oscillators are attractive solutions in many electronic {{applications such as}} the synchronization of multiple processing units in digital electronics and the frequency synthesis in mixed-signal radio frequency circuits.

25|$|Hydrogels are a {{class of}} {{biomaterials}} that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, {{and the ability to}} be injected as a liquid that gels. When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> for gelation; the <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> is temperature-dependent and reversible. Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously. Hydrogels have low interfacial tension, meaning cells can easily migrate across the tissue-implant boundary. However, with hydrogels it is difficult to form a broad range of mechanical properties or structures with controlled pore size.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{treatment}} is a treatment process for wastewater (or sewage) {{to achieve a}} certain degree of effluent quality by using a sewage treatment plant with physical <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> to remove settleable solids and a biological process to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds.

25|$|Ethanol is hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.|$|E

25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E
25|$|Prior to HPLC {{scientists}} used standard liquid chromatographic techniques. Liquid chromatographic {{systems were}} largely inefficient {{due to the}} flow rate of solvents being dependent on gravity. Separations took many hours, and sometimes days to complete. Gas chromatography (GC) {{at the time was}} more powerful than liquid chromatography (LC), however, it was believed that gas <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> and analysis of very polar high molecular weight biopolymers was impossible. GC was ineffective for many biochemists because of the thermal instability of the solutes. As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{research}} has revealed some shortcomings and simplifications {{in the original}} theory. For instance, channel proteins are described as having a continuous water channel through their center, which is now known to be generally untrue (an exception being nuclear pore complexes, which have a 9nm open water channel). Also, free diffusion on the cell surface is often limited to areas a few tens of nanometers across. These limits to lateral fluidity are due to cytoskeleton anchors, lipid <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> and aggregated protein structures. Contemporary studies also indicate that much less of the plasma membrane is “bare” lipid than previously thought and in fact much of the cell surface may be protein-associated. In spite of these limitations, the fluid mosaic model remains a popular and often referenced general notion for the structure of biological membranes.|$|E

The results from the analysis reveal that only after 2005 the research efforts focused on SILMs became significant, since the references found before that year are scarce. The most important research works on the four main application groups for SILMs defined in this work (carbon dioxide <b>separation,</b> other gas <b>phase</b> <b>separations,</b> pervaporation and liquid <b>phase</b> <b>separations)</b> were summarized in this paper.

The glass main component silica (SiO2) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%.

25|$|Distinct phases {{may also}} exist {{within a given}} state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be {{differentiated}} based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low solubility (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is {{the maximum amount of}} a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> extends to solids, i.e., solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases.

25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
