40|$|Ultrashort {{electric}} pulses {{applied to}} similar cell lines such as Jurkat and HL- 60 cells can produce markedly different results, {{which have been}} documented extensively {{over the last few}} years. We now report changes in electrical conductivity of Jurkat cells subjected to traditional electroporation pulses (50 ms pulse length) and ultrashort pulses (10 ns pulse length) using time domain dielectric spectroscopy (TDS). A single 10 ns, 150 kV/cm pulse did not noticeably alter suspension conductivity while a 50 ms, 2. 12 kV/cm pulse with the same energy caused an appreciable conductivity rise. These results support the hypothesis that electroporation pulses primarily interact with the cell membrane and cause conductivity rises due to ion transport from the cell to the external media, while pulses with nanosecond duration primarily interact with the membranes of intracellular organelles. However, multiple ultrashort pulses have a cumulative effect on the plasma membrane, with five pulses causing a gradual rise in conductivity up to ten minutes <b>post-pulsing...</b>|$|R

This is the shortest pulse duration achieved via compression of SC spectra generated in PCF to date.

40|$|Standard {{model of}} electropration (EP) has long {{emphasized}} a single pore lifetime to explain <b>post-pulse</b> transport across cell membranes. However, pore lifetimes estimated from molecular dynamics (MD) models and and those measured from experimental data differ by several orders of magnitude. We hypothesize that a broad distribution of lifetimes may describe the <b>post-pulse</b> behavior. Here, {{we show that}} pore distribution, number and size of pores, show interesting behavior in different ranges of pore lifetimes. Interestingly, for large electric fields (greater than 1 kV/cm) and short pore lifetimes (approximately 100 ns), an significant loss in pore number occurs during the pulse.

40|$|We review some of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} and the possible pore structures associated with electroporation (EP) for times after electrical pulsing. We purposefully give only a short description of pore creation and subsequent evolution of pore populations, as these are adequately discussed in both reviews and original research reports. In contrast, <b>post-pulse</b> pore concepts have changed dramatically. For perspective we note that pores are not directly observed. Instead understanding of pores is based on inference from experiments and, increasingly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the past decade concepts for <b>post-pulse</b> pores have changed significantly: The idea of pure lipidic transient pores (TPs) that exist for milliseconds or longer <b>post-pulse</b> has become inconsistent with MD results, which support TP lifetimes of only ∼ 100 ns. A typical large TP number during cell EP pulsing is of order 10 ^ 6. In twenty MD-based TP lifetimes (2 us total), the TP number plummets to ∼ 0. 001. In short, TPs vanish 2 us after a pulse ends, and cannot account for <b>post-pulse</b> behavior such as large and relatively non-specific ionic and molecular transport. Instead, an early conjecture of complex pores (CPs) with both lipidic and other molecule should be taken seriously. Indeed, in the past decade several experiments provide partial support for complex pores (CPs). Presently, CPs are "dark", in the sense that while some CP functions are known, little is known about their structure(s). There may be a wide range of lifetimes and permeabilities, not yet revealed by experiments. Like cosmology's dark matter, these unseen pores present us with an outstanding problem.

40|$|Seeding of free-electron lasers (FELs) using {{external}} coherent optical pulses recently {{became an}} area of interest as users demand spectrally and temporally coherent FEL radiation which is not achievable in traditional self-amplified spontaneous emission operation mode.

Rain pulses reset δ R with the dominant water source isotope composition, followed by progressive enrichment of δ R. Transpiration (E T) {{was significantly related to}} <b>post-pulse</b> δ R enrichment because the leaf water δ 18 O value showed strong enrichment with increasing vapor pressure deficit that occurs following rain. <b>Post-pulse</b> δ R enrichment was correlated with both E T and the ratio of E T to soil evaporation (E T / E S).

Model simulations captured the large <b>post-pulse</b> δ R enrichments only when the offset between xylem and leaf water δ 18 O value was modeled explicitly and when a gross flux model for CO 2 retro-diffusion was included. Drought impacts δ R through the balance between evaporative demand, which enriches δ R, and low soil moisture availability, which attenuates δ R enrichment through reduced E T.

The study was performed in vitro with full-thickness hairless mt skin, skin electroporation being carried out with five exponentially-decaying pulses of 100 V applied voltage and around 600 ms pulse duration. Results. Transport during and after pulsing are both important in transdermal delivery of fentanyl by skin electroporation. Rapid transport occurred during pulsing due to electrophoresis and diffusion through highly permeabilized skin. No electroosmosis was observed. The slow <b>post-pulse</b> passive transport was explained by lasting changes in skin permeability.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the effects of electron beam pulse parameters on the utilization of the reactive free radicals for removal of NO{sub x} from diesel generator exhaust. A dose per pulse less than 1 kGy has been determined to be optimum for effective radical utilization. During each <b>post-pulse</b> period, the radicals are utilized in the removal of NO{sub x} in a timescale of around 100 microseconds; thus, with pulse frequencies of around 10 kHz or less, the radical concentrations remain sufficiently low to prevent any significant competition between radical-pollutant and radical-radical reactions. It is shown that a pulsed electron beam reactor, operating with a dose per pulse of less than 1 kGy/pulse and pulse repetition rate of less than 10 kHz, will have the same plasma chemistry efficiency (parts per million of removed NO{sub x} per kGy of electron beam dose) as an electron beam reactor operating with a low dose rate of 50 kGy/s in continuous mode.

40|$|Context. During the {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) phase, stars undergo thermal pulses - short-lived {{phases of}} explosive helium burning in a shell around the stellar core. Thermal pulses {{lead to the}} formation and mixing-up of new elements to the stellar surface. They are hence fundamental to the chemical evolution of the star and its circumstellar envelope. A further consequence of thermal pulses is the formation of detached shells {{of gas and dust}} around the star, several of which have been observed around carbon-rich AGB stars. Aims. We aim to determine the physical properties of the detached gas shell around R Sculptoris, in particular the shell mass and temperature, and to constrain the evolution of the mass-loss rate during and after a thermal pulse. Methods. We analyse 12 CO(1 - 0), 12 CO(2 - 1), and 12 CO(3 - 2) emission, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during Cycle 0 and complemented by single-dish observations. The spatial resolution of the ALMA data allows us to separate the detached shell emission from the extended emission inside the shell. We perform radiative transfer modelling of both components to determine the shell properties and the <b>post-pulse</b> mass-loss properties. Results. The ALMA data show a gas shell with a radius of 19 ″. 5 expanding at 14. 3 km s- 1. The different scales probed by the ALMA Cycle 0 array show that the shell must be entirely filled with gas, contrary {{to the idea of a}} detached shell. The comparison to single-dish spectra and radiative transfer modelling confirms this. We derive a shell mass of 4. 5 × 10 - 3 M⊙ with a temperature of 50 K. Typical timescales for thermal pulses imply a pulse mass-loss rate of 2. 3 × 10 - 5 M⊙ yr- 1. For the <b>post-pulse</b> mass-loss rate, we find evidence for a gradual decline of the mass-loss rate, with an average value of 1. 6 × 10 - 5 M⊙ yr- 1. The total amount of mass lost since the last thermal pulse is 0. 03 M⊙, a factor four higher compared to classical models, with a sharp decline in mass-loss rate immediately after the pulse. Conclusions. We find that the mass-loss rate after a thermal pulse has to decline more slowly than generally expected from models of thermal pulses. This may cause the star to lose significantly more mass during a thermal pulse cycle, which affects the lifetime on the AGB and the chemical evolution of the star, its circumstellar envelope, and the interstellar medium...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a concept that}} has the potential to change how we think about the underlying mechanisms of cell membrane electroporation (EP). Prior experimental, theoretical and modeling have emphasized a single pore lifetime as adequate for particular conditions. Here we introduce a much more complex response: The rapid creation of many types of pore structures, of which some are traditional transient lipidic pores (TPs), but the great majority are complex pores (CPs) based on both lipids and other molecules or molecular segments. At the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane (PM) non-lipidic molecules come from the over-crowded cytoplasm. At the outer leaflet they originate from the extracellular medium and extracellular matrix. Some partially or fully insert into TPs during or shortly after TP formation, or bind to the membrane nearby. This process is complex, leading to mostly short-lived structures, with relatively few lasting for long times. We speculate that the characteristic pore lifetimes range from ∼ 100 ns to 1, 000 s, based on implications from experiments. The frequency-of-occurrence probably falls off extremely rapidly with increasing lifetime, τ_CP, which implies that most are inaccessible to traditional experimental methods. It also suggests that unexpected behavior can occur early in pulsing, vanishing before <b>post-pulse</b> observations begin. Comment: Version 01 August 24, 201...|$|E

The suppressed component had a sigmoidal voltage distribution with V =- 56. 6 (SEM 1. 1) mV, k = 2. 5 (SEM 0. 5) mV, and qmax/Cm = 9. 2 (SEM 1. 5) nC/~F, suggesting that the tetracaine-sensitive charge had a steep voltage dependence, a characteristic of the Q ~ component. An intermediate concentration (0. 1 - 0. 5 raM) of tetracaine shifted V ~ and partially suppressed the tetracaine-sensitive charge, resulting in a difference Q-V plot that rose to a peak and then decayed to a plateau level. Following a TEST pulse to>- 60 mV, the slow inward current component during a <b>post-pulse</b> to ~- 60 mV was also tetracain...|$|E
