The methods used are mainly two: collection of residual gases and total gases. Both are valid, but for different use. In residual gases one can analyze ratio gas/steam, minus and major components but no carbon monoxide because interference with sodium idroxide. In total gas {{is difficult to}} analyze minus components but it`s good for carbon monoxide and isotopic composition in carbon dioxide. In both sampling methods the problem is to choose a good way for sampling. This manual shows the methods we consider the best in use. Another problems is to minimize analytical error. It depends from the quality of instrumentation {{and the quality of}} methods we use. We describe the methods in use in IGG laboratories that give good results, according with quality of instrumentation, quality of standard and reproducibility.

The infant formula can become contaminated through the raw ingredients used in the production of the formula, through contamination of the formula after pasteurization or through contamination of the reconstituted formula used by the caregivers at the hospital or at home prior to feeding.

The reasons for nutritional problems investigated were partly referred to enormous feeding and other sociocultural factors as beliefs. The investigators {{felt the need to}} study nutritional beliefs and practices of Saudi mothers during the infancy period, which will help in identifying and understanding reasons of nutritional problems in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to formulate a plan of action. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the beliefs and practices related to breast-feeding, artificial feeding and weaning through the infancy period. The study was conducted in the maternity and children’s hospitals in Riyadh. The sample size presented 10 % of the total number of Saudi mothers attending the maternity clinics of the hospital in a month. The first 300 mothers, who met the criteria established for selection, were interviewed. Data collected were revised, coded, and analyzed using a computer system (SPSS statistical package). For the purpose of analysis and presentation of data, mothers’ nutritional beliefs were categorized to useful, harmless and harmful based on review of literature. Useful beliefs are those that encourage good health. The harmless beliefs are those which can do not seem to affect health. The harmful beliefs are those ones that cause ill health and may lead to diseases. Practices related to bottle feeding were grouped as satisfactory and unsatisfactory, using score system. This classification was done according to the percentage of correct practices (unsatisfactory practice is less than 70 % and satisfactoty is 70 % or more. The study displayed that 44. 3 % of the mothers had the proper practice of breast feeding their babies on the first day. It was also believed by 30 % of the sample that colostrum is harmful. Unsatisfactory practices related to <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> feeding were reported by 64 % of the mothers. 20. 3 % of mothers did not start weaning their infants before nine months of age. Mothers living in extended, large families had high percentage of harmful beliefs and practices, which might be due to the traditional influence of the old ladies and mothers in law on the young mothers. The finding of the present study helps health workers in Saudi Arabia to plan for health education programs that are implemented to encourage and promote useful beliefs and practices and discourage the harmful ones.
