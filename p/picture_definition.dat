Technical standards for television broadcasting were in flux as well. Between the time experimental transmissions began in 1935 {{and the beginning of}} commercial television service in 1941, <b>picture</b> <b>definition</b> increased from 343 to 441 lines, and finally (in 1941) to the 525-line standard used for analog television from the start of full commercial service until the end of analog broadcasts in mid-2009. The sound signal also was changed from AM to FM, and the spacing of sound and vision carriers was also changed several times. Shortly after NBC began a semi-regular television transmission schedule in 1938, DuMont Laboratories announced TV sets for sale to the public, a move that RCA was saving for the opening of the World's Fair on April 30, 1939, the day that regularly scheduled television programming was to begin in New York on NBC with much fanfare. In response, NBC ceased all TV broadcasting for several weeks until RCA sets went on sale and regular NBC telecasts commenced the day the fair opened.|$|E

Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now a video camera than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic discrete light elements, he didn't have storage. Therefore, <b>picture</b> <b>definition</b> was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method." [...] Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent #2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the [...] "charge storage plate" [...] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a [...] "low velocity" [...] method of electron scanning, also describes [...] "discrete particles" [...] whose [...] "potential" [...] is manipulated and [...] "saturated" [...] to varying degrees depending on their velocity.

40|$|Wooded grasslands {{have always}} played an {{important}} role in rural life with changing issues: They are of high importance for questions of biodiversity, soil, and water resources and in preserving agricultural heritage, but their maintenance is labor intensive. Abandoned wooded grasslands undergo succession, and food production alone does not support their survival. They require special attention and at the beginning a well-established subsidy system can help to contribute to their survival. Their sustainable use in the present-day landscapes can only be conceivable in complexity where food production, reintroduction of their cultural values, biodiversity and landscape protection, and ecotourism are playing an important role. This chapter gives an overview on the recent situation of wooded grasslands and their historical development, based on the work done by the Institute for Research on European Agricultural Landscapes (www. ​eucalandnetwork. ​eu). National <b>pictures,</b> <b>definitions,</b> history (including local names), threats, potentials, cultural values, spatial distributions, subtypes, and available databases have been collected, described, and analyzed.

50|$|Taking {{the example}} of a current high {{definition}} (HD) video system, with 1920 by 1080 pixels, the Nyquist theorem states that it should be possible, in a perfect system, to resolve fully (with true black to white transitions) a total of 1920 black and white alternating lines combined, otherwise referred to as a spatial frequency of 1920/2=960 line pairs per picture width, or 960 cycles per <b>picture</b> width, (<b>definitions</b> in terms of cycles per unit angle or per mm are also possible but generally less clear when dealing with cameras and more appropriate to telescopes etc.). In practice, this is far from the case, and spatial frequencies that approach the Nyquist rate will generally be reproduced with decreasing amplitude, so that fine detail, though it can be seen, is greatly reduced in contrast. This gives rise to the interesting observation that, for example, a standard <b>definition</b> television <b>picture</b> derived from a film scanner that uses oversampling, as described later, may appear sharper than a high <b>definition</b> <b>picture</b> shot on a camera with a poor modulation transfer function. The two pictures show an interesting difference that is often missed, the former having full contrast on detail up to a certain point but then no really fine detail, while the latter does contain finer detail, but with such reduced contrast as to appear inferior overall.|$|R
