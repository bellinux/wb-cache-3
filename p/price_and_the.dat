The rating was then used to {{determine}} the <b>price</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> percentage of the price that growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the dynamic interaction between housing <b>prices,</b> stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> repo {{rate in the}} Stockholm region by using the Johansen tests for cointegration. Several {{studies have been done}} on this topic, but the results are mixed across <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> not many have been done in Scandinavia. This study contributes to the literature by examining eleven years of monthly data for the housing prices in the Stockholm region. We find evidence of a long-run relationship between housing <b>prices,</b> stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interest rate. There is a negative relationship between housing <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interest rate as well as between stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interest rate, but a positive relationship between housing <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>prices.</b>   However, the results are somewhat sensitive to model specification and therefore further studies on the topic are encouraged...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} fifty-nine {{different}} {{managers in the}} team's franchise history: four while it {{was known as the}} Cincinnati Red Stockings (1882–1889), four while it was known as the Cincinnati Redlegs (1953–1958) and the other fifty-one under the Cincinnati Reds (18821952, 1959–present). In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. Pop Snyder was the first manager of the Reds and managed from 1882 to 1884. Sparky Anderson is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) and regular-season game wins (863). He is followed by Bill McKechnie in both categories with 1,386 and 744, respectively. Anderson is the only Reds manager to have won the World Series twice, in 1975 and 1976. Pat Moran, Lou Piniella, and McKechnie have one World Series victory each; Moran was the manager during the Black Sox Scandal, which refers to the events {{that took place in the}} 1919 World Series. McKechnie led the team to the championship in 1940, while Piniella led the team to it in 1990. Jack McKeon is the only manager to have won the Manager of the Year Award with the Reds, which he won in 1999. The most recent manager of the Reds is Bryan <b>Price,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> current owner is Robert Castellini.|$|E

For this aim, we employ cointegration methodology with structural breaks to empirically investigate the simultaneous relationship between deregulation, ticket <b>prices,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> number of passengers in the Turkish airline industry. The findings confirm that deregulation increases quantity <b>and</b> decreases <b>prices</b> through accessibility to air transport service and actual competition, respectively. Also, structural breaks suggest that deregulation of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> entry into <b>the</b> market has remarkable effect on the change in ticket <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> number of passengers...|$|R
