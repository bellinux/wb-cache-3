25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual output shaft, there is only one <b>power</b> <b>pulse</b> per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E

5000|$|These engines deliver <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> {{more often}} than engines with six or eight {{cylinders}}, and the <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> have triple overlap (at any time three cylinders are on different stages of the same power stroke) which eliminates gaps between <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> and allows for greater refinement and smoothness in a luxury car engine, {{at the expense of}} much greater cost. In a racing car engine, the rotating parts of a V12 can be made much lighter than a V8 with a crossplane crankshaft because {{there is no need to}} use heavy counterweights on the crankshaft and less need for the inertial mass in a flywheel to smooth out the power delivery. Exhaust system tuning is also much more difficult on a crossplane V8 than a V12, so racing cars with V8 engines often use a complicated [...] "bundle of snakes" [...] exhaust system, or a flat-plane crankshaft which causes severe engine vibration and noise. This is not important in a race car if all-out performance is the only goal. Since cost and fuel economy are usually important even in luxury and racing cars, the V12 has been largely phased out in favor of engines with fewer cylinders.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for {{detecting}} ultrasound con-trast agents using a three-stage pulsing sequence is pro-posed. The method {{is based on}} observations showing that the scattering properties of contrast agents are modified by ultrasonic insonation at high power, but remain unchanged at low power. The objective of {{the first stage of}} the pulsing sequence is to use low <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> to obtain a high reso-lution reference image without altering the agent. Higher <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> in the second stage modify the contrast agent. The third stage detects the changes imposed to the contrast agent using low <b>power</b> <b>pulses.</b> A temporal filter is proposed to discriminate contrast response from clutter signal. The method is similar to power Doppler methods in that it uses several pulses to survey the target while destroying the agent. The new idea is to separate detection and destruction to circumvent a trade-off between sensitivity and resolution. Results from in vitro experiments with three different con-trast agents are presented. The results are compared with harmonic power Doppler processed from the same data and show that an improvement in sensitivity is achievable by in-cluding the high power burst in the pulsing sequence. The results also show that the proposed filter reduces clutter artifacts from moving tissue. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{significant}} operational advantages {{offered by}} CO 2 lasers, {{operating in the}} 10. 6 micron region of the spectrum, over current solid state lasers, emitting in the near IR region, have prompted increased interest {{in the development of}} compact, reliable, rugged CO 2 laser sources. Perhaps the most critical aspect associated with achieving a laser compatible with military use is the development of lasers which require no gas replenishment. Sealed, single shot, CO 2 TEA lasers have been available for a number of years. Stark et al were first to demonstrate reliable sealed operation in single shot CO 2 TEA lasers in 1975 using gas catalysis. GEC Avionics reported the compact, environmentally qualified, MKIII CO 2 TEA laser with a pulse life of greater than 10 to the 6 th <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> in 1980. A sealed laser lifetime of greater than 10 to the 6 th <b>power</b> <b>pulses</b> is acceptable for single shot cases, such as direct detection rangefinders for tank laser sights. However, in many other applications, such as tracking of fast moving targets, it is essential that a repetition rate of typically 30 Hz to 100 Hz is employed.
