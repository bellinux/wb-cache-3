5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.|$|E
5|$|Thomas F. Wilson {{was cast}} as Biff Tannen because the {{producers}} {{felt that the}} original choice, J. J. Cohen, wasn't physically imposing enough to bully Stoltz. Cohen was recast as Skinhead, one of Biff's cohorts. Had Fox been cast from the beginning, Cohen probably would have won the <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was sufficiently taller than Fox.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part {{so that he could}} return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} {{commissioned}} by the BBC's director of serials Laura Mackie at the outline stage. Marchant {{did not want to}} extend the script to any more than two <b>parts</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> thought two was the right length. He previously worked with Morrissey and producer David Snodin on the 1997 television series Holding On. The script went through five drafts; refinements included making Joe's wife less judgmental, and seeing other characters in the wider world reacting to Joe. It was filmed over 30 days.|$|R
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign {{outside of the}} navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although {{the bulk of his}} policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Landlord, {{the leader}} of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office hits from 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is the ideal actor to play a character who persuades others to do bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
2500|$|By December 2007, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{charged that}} Obama's campaign was getting much more favorable media treatment than their own, especially once their campaign began faltering. [...] Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz found {{a number of}} journalists who agreed with the claim, with Mark Halperin, Time magazine's editor-at-large for political news, saying, [...] "Your typical reporter has a thinly disguised preference that Barack Obama be the nominee. The narrative of him beating her is better than her beating him, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> she's a Clinton and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a young African American. ...

5000|$|Born in San Francisco, Tong {{lived in}} Palo Alto before moving {{with his family}} to Honolulu. He {{graduated}} from Stanford University. Tong attempted to break into acting on the stage during the Depression, forming an act called the [...] "Three Celestials" [...] that played in neighborhood theaters and was booked into the Los Angeles Orpheum.. [...] He found he could not get <b>parts</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was of Chinese descent. He worked in Chinese nightclubs in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco where he sang and performed comedy routines.

40|$|Both Bart and Lisa {{were asked}} to contact Honor Council by their Computer Science {{professor}} Homer. Professor Homer suspected {{that one of the}} students had copied the other's Project 3 folder, as the work turned in by both students was very similar, and, for functions # 3 and # 4, the work was identical. Professor Homer spoke with both students about his concern, and both students denied any wrongdoing on their <b>parts.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> could not tell which student had copied, but was sure that one file was copied, Professor Homer asked both Bart and Lisa to take the matter to Honor Council...|$|R
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only one who}} confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
2500|$|Corgan's {{desire for}} musical {{perfection}} put further {{strain on the}} already-frayed relationships between the band members. Vig later recalled, [...] "D'arcy would lock herself in the bathroom, James wouldn't say anything, or Billy would lock himself in the control room". Corgan often overdubbed Iha's and Wretzky's parts with his own playing. Wretzky stated that Corgan only performed most of the guitar and bass <b>parts</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could lay them down more easily in recording [...] and with far fewer takes. Stories of the album's recording had circulated in the music press. Corgan admitted there was some truth to accusations of tyrannical behavior, though he felt the press misunderstood the situation.|$|R
25|$|Unlike his predecessors, Robert was impetuous and violent, in <b>part,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had {{inherited}} a severe form of gout from his grandfather. He was also unreliable {{and lacking in}} political sophistication. Almost {{as soon as he}} took control of his estate, he attacked the priory of Tutbury, which his family were patrons of.|$|R
50|$|Despite Teppei Teranishi {{typically}} {{being the}} band's lead guitarist, Kensrue both wrote {{and played the}} song's lead guitar part in the song, something attributed {{to the fact that}} he wrote the <b>part,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt it sounds better coming from his particular guitar rig and guitar pedal setup, specifically the Electro-Harmonix POG 2.|$|R
5|$|In <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was {{overlooked}} {{until the}} mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers {{and was not}} widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained {{in a series of}} private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It {{does not appear to have}} been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|In the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles won the {{championship}} 7–0 during a blizzard in Philadelphia's Shibe Park. Following the win, Eagles owner Alexis Thompson advocated a championship {{game between the}} top teams in the NFL and the AAFC, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was losing money and felt an inter-league championship would draw large crowds. Thompson was also a leading proponent among NFL owners of negotiation with the AAFC over a deal to ease the leagues' competition for talent, which had driven up salaries and was eating into owners' profits. Thompson met with Browns owner Mickey McBride and agreed to a playoff – either one game in Yankee Stadium or a best-of-three series with games in Philadelphia, Cleveland and possibly New York. Thompson's proposal was shot down by other NFL owners, however, and {{he was given a}} reprimand by commissioner Bert Bell for suggesting the NFL-AAFC championship. Frustrated with his financial losses and lack of support among the owners, Thompson sold the Eagles shortly after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{negotiations}} led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino {{resulted in}} the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held {{and the city of}} Dorpat to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva.|$|E

50|$|There {{is nothing}} else known about Antoninus' life, aside from the high {{position}} {{in the court of}} Shapur II. This may in <b>part</b> have been <b>because</b> <b>he</b> spoke both Greek and Latin.|$|R
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E
5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only one who}} was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the nature}} of God and the divine attributes, the Ash'ari {{rejected}} the Mu'tazili position that all Quranic references to God as having real attributes were metaphorical. The Ash'aris insisted that these attributes were as they [...] "best befit His Majesty". The Arabic language is a wide language in which one word can have 15 different meanings, so the Ash'aris endeavor to find the meaning that best befits God and is not contradicted by the Quran. Therefore, when God states in the Quran, [...] "He who does not resemble any of His creation," [...] this clearly means that God cannot be attributed with body <b>parts</b> <b>because</b> <b>He</b> created body <b>parts.</b> Ash'aris tend to stress divine omnipotence over human free will and {{they believe that the}} Quran is eternal and uncreated.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, he {{recorded}} only 1.5 sacks, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> although <b>he</b> was the starting left defensive end {{he moved to}} defensive tackle in the Bears [...] "nickel defense," [...] perhaps cutting down on his pass-rush opportunities. He was slated to play that spot again in 1992, however, the development of Alonzo Spellman allowed Armstrong to play end in all situations. As a result, his sack total was a 6.5.|$|R
50|$|While {{invisible}} to most, McCay becomes {{visible to the}} Justice League on one occasion when the Flash grabs him from the dimension through which he travels. He attempts to tell Superman that the apocalypse will result from their actions. Superman, however, is confused by his appearance and refuses his warning in <b>part</b> <b>because,</b> knowing <b>he</b> is trapped, McCay delivers the warning {{in the form of}} repeating a biblical passage spoken to him by Dodds.|$|R
25|$|Earl Long {{endorsed}} Davis in {{the runoff}} in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had a longstanding personal dislike of Morrison. Long's gubernatorial running-mate, James A.

25|$|In December 2007, the Philadelphia Inquirer {{reported}} that Scarfo Jr. had been demoted within the Lucchese crime family {{in part because}} of ongoing media coverage of his activities and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> intended to start a mob war to regain control of the Philadelphia outfit.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} socialist ideals, he {{proposed}} that Power Jets be nationalised; in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> saw that private companies would profit from the technology freely given during the war.

50|$|Haines {{turned down}} a peerage from Wilson in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours in <b>part,</b> <b>he</b> claimed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did not wish to}} be awarded one in a list also {{consisting}} of Joe Kagan and Eric Miller, already under suspicion of criminal activity at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not {{volunteer}} for the service," [...] Francis said. [...] "I {{was asked by the}} admiral to undertake it, and even had I wished it, I could hardly have refused.
