It should also be {{punishable}} {{on the part of a}} mother to leave children below a certain age alone for longer than a certain interval. It is absurd to punish people as we do, for the injuries inflicted by them upon their children during uncontrollable anger, and not to punish them for the injuries inflicted by uncontrolled carelessness. Such legislation should ensure children space, air and attention. [Footnote: It is less within the range of commonly grasped ideas, it is therefore less within the range of <b>practical</b> <b>expedients,</b> to point out that a graduated scale of building regulation might be contrived for use in different localities. Districts could be classed in grades determined by the position of each district in the scale of infant mortality, and in those in which the rate was highest the hygienic standard could be made most stringent and onerous upon the house owner. This would force up the price of house- room, and that would force up the price of labour, and this would give the proprietors of unwholesome industries a personal interest in hygienic conditions about them. It would also tend to force population out of districts intrinsically unhealthy into districts intrinsically healthy. The statistics of low-grade districts could be examined to discover the distinctive diseases which determine their lowness of grade, and if these were preventable diseases they could be controlled by special regulations. A further extension of these principles might be made. Direct inducements to attract the high birth-rates towards exceptionally healthy districts could be contrived by a differential rating of sound families with children in such districts, the burthen of heavy rates could be thrown upon silly and selfish landowners who attempted to stifle sound populations by using highly habitable areas as golf links, private parks, game preserves, and the like, and public- spirited people could combine to facilitate communications that would render life in such districts compatible with industrial occupation. Such deliberate redistribution of population as this differential treatment of districts involves, is, however, quite beyond the available power and intelligence of our public control at present, and I suggest it here as something that our grandchildren perhaps may begin to consider. But if in the obscurity of this footnote I may let myself go, I would point out that, in the future, a time may come when locomotion will be so swift and convenient and cheap that it will be unnecessary to spread out the homes of our great communities where the industrial and trading centres are gathered together; it will be unnecessary for each district to sustain the renewal and increase of its own population. Certain wide regions will become specifically administrative and central--the home lands, the mother lands, the centres of education and population, and others will become specifically fields of action. Something of this kind is to a slight degree already the case with Scotland, which sends out its hardy and capable sons wherever the world has need of them; the Swiss mountains, too, send their sons far and wide in the world; and on the other hand, with regard to certain elements of population, at any rate, London and the Gold Coast and, I suspect, some regions in the United States of America, receive to consume.] ...|$|E

50|$|However, {{although}} he is often connected with absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a <b>practical</b> <b>expedient,</b> to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, {{and to use the}} Estates as a means of communicating with the people. Furthermore, he emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin’s sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being. Bodin believed that “the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically”. With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the divine right of kings.|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThe sixth-form {{college is}} an {{experiment}} in the organisation of education for the sixteen to nineteen year old student. An examination of the historical context of its evolution reveals its origins in the demands for expansion of upper secondary education and in the concern for a more equitable and broader-based provision for the expanded student body. Further examination exposes {{the social and political}} factors promoting and retarding its development. What began in most cases as a <b>practical</b> <b>expedient</b> became an institution providing a wide range of courses and study options to students, the academic or vocational emphasis depending on local conditions. The separate college idea attracted some idealists who saw an opportunity of establishing in the public sector of education an institution capable of rivalling the sixth-form of the better independent school. It had {{at the same time a}} strong appeal in its apparent economy and efficiency. It could offer a centralisation and concentration of specialist teachers and resources to provide for perhaps eight hundred students. Establishment of actual colleges has been cautious, few authorities being prepared, like the Tasmanian Education Department or the Teesside Education Committee to give the scheme unqualified approval. Earlier ideas of academic exclusiveness have been modified by the emergence of the "new sixth-former", the fifteen-plus student whose staying-on in full-time secondary education is as much a matter of law as of inclination. For the most part the purely academic college enjoyed a limited period of existence before the change in political or educational philosophy ordered its modification. The colleges of 1974 may differ rather significantly from those intended by their founders. However, what was enthusiastically regarded as a panacea for the problems of upper secondary organisation must now be soberly accepted as one of a number of possible ways of organising sixth-form education.

40|$|According to {{official}} Norwegian policy, the Armed Forces may not employ {{the services of}} private military companies, nor enter into any operational collaboration with such firms. Norway considers its position to be {{in compliance with the}} Geneva Conventions, under which it is an offence to employ mercenaries. This study finds a discrepancy between official Norwegian policy on the use of private military companies and the experience of Norwegian forces serving in international operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. As Svendsen found in his interviews with Norwegian Armed Forces personnel, it is difficult to comply with official policy in the field. There are several reasons for this, the main being the extensive use of private military companies by other countries, most notably the US. In joint allied operations, formal and informal contact with private military companies is often unavoidable, and military personnel are, moreover, often unaware of the official Norwegian stance. Finally, collaborating with these firms is often a <b>practical</b> <b>expedient.</b> Svendsen also found that Norwegian personnel often regard private military companies as a liability. They do not belong to the same chain of command {{and it is difficult to}} take account of them when planning ahead. Private military companies also tend not to communicate with each other; some of their personnel are insufficiently trained and equipped. Contact with private military companies therefore affects the manner in which Norwegian military units operate abroad. Last, but not least, the study reveals how Norwegian military personnel are approached and recruited by private military companies as a result of formal and informal contact in the field. Svendsen urges improvements in the information given to Norwegian soldiers on Norwegian policy on the use of private military companies. They also need to learn how they should deal with private military companies before deployment to international operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{engineering}} of new {{enzymes that}} efficiently and specifically modify DNA sequences {{is necessary for}} the development of enhanced gene therapies and genetic studies. To address this need, we developed a robust strategy for evolving site-specific recombinases with novel substrate specificities. In this system, recombinase variants are selected for activity on new substrates based on enzyme-mediated reassembly of the gene encoding β-lactamase that confers ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli. This stringent evolution method was used to alter the specificities of catalytic domains {{in the context of a}} modular zinc finger-recombinase fusion protein. Gene reassembly was detectable over several orders of magnitude, which allowed for tunable selectivity and exceptional sensitivity. Engineered recombinases were evolved to react with sequences from the human genome with only three rounds of selection. Many of the evolved residues, selected from a randomly-mutated library, were conserved among other members of this family of recombinases. This enhanced evolution system will translate recombinase engineering and genome editing into a <b>practical</b> and <b>expedient</b> endeavor for academic, industrial and clinical applications...|$|R

Pressures induced by explosions {{are one of the}} most destructive loads a structure may experience. While designing structures for great explosions may be expensive and impractical, engineers are looking for methods for preventing destructions resulted from explosions. A favorable structural system is a system which does not disrupt totally due to local explosion, since such structures sustain less loss in comparison with structural ones which really bear the load and suddenly disrupt. Designing and establishing vital and necessary installations in a way that it is resistant against direct hit of bomb and rocket is not <b>practical,</b> economical, or <b>expedient</b> in many cases, because the cost of construction and installation with such specifications is several times more than the total cost of the related equipment. system parts [1]- [3]...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1998 Dr. Simon FoaleA proper understanding of the management of small-scale subsistence and artisanal fisheries requires not only detailed sociocultural study, but comprehensive analysis {{of the state of}} the fished population(s) using rigorous stock assessment and other fisheries biology tools. This study comprises such an interdisciplinary approach taken in an attempt to understand subsistence and artisanal fishing at West Nggela, with a particular focus on the management of the artisanal trochus fishery. The importance of an understanding of Customary Marine Tenure is dealt with in some detail. An analysis of the various categories of fishers’ ecological knowledge about marine fauna, with an emphasis on trochus, is also presented, and discussed with respect to the categories of biological and ecological information considered by most fisheries biologists as essential to the assessment and management of a fishery. The theoretical basis of my approach to the study of local knowledge, which could broadly be termed “rationalist”, is discussed and defended against “postmodernist” criticisms. Trochus are currently overfished at most of the reefs I studied at West Nggela. Densities measured using mark-recapture were apparently low compared to well-managed fisheries elsewhere in the Pacific. The current market demand, and the ease of capture, storage and marketing of the product, indicate that pressure on the fishery (which includes some poaching) is likely to remain high, and some improvement in management is required. Egg-per-recruit and yield-per-recruit modeling indicates that enforcement of a minimum size limit of 8 cm basal diameter would bring about immediate improvement in yields and recruitment in the fishery. Such a measure would not only be <b>practical</b> and <b>expedient</b> but also more culturally sensitive than many of the alternatives. The system of customary marine tenure at West Nggela, which includes a system of serial prohibitions on harvesting, appears not to be adapted to the high levels of pressure currently being exerted on this valuable species. An analysis of the property tenure system at Nggela, including two case studies of formal disputes, outlines some of the reasons for this problem. Local ecological knowledge about marine fauna in general, and trochus in particular, appears to mostly concur with, and in some cases extend, scientific knowledge. However, there appear to be subject areas in which local knowledge is lacking, and these typically include parameters related to yield and recruitment, such as growth, natural mortality, lifespan and reproductive ecology. In particular, for broadcastspawning species such as trochus, the relationship between dwindling stock densities and recruitment failure is usually not recognised by most fishers at West Nggela. Customary manne tenure and local ecological knowledge thus appear to be insufficient for maximising and sustaining yields of trochus at current levels of fishing pressure. Nevertheless, any new management measures, or fisheries developments, should remain sensitive to the dynamic and competitive nature of the property tenure system. Collaboration between fishery biologists and local fishers is recommended wherever possible. Efforts by fishery biologists to extend, to rural fishers, their knowledge of reproductive biology and ecology of broadcast spawning organisms are encouraged. Outside knowledge is likely to be embraced by fishers only if it is communicated in a way that is compatible with the cognitive framework in which most local knowledge is situated. Such an input of expertise, when combined synergistically with the extensive local knowledge of rural fishers, cannot fail to result in improvements to strategies for community-based fishery management.
