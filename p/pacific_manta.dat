These {{are a series of}} islands which protrude from the Pacific and are home to a huge amount of marine life including the majestic giant <b>pacific</b> <b>manta.</b> Many scuba diving shops also offer diving to nearby destinations such as the Bat Islands as well as diving in the Gulf de Papagayo.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} ten years, Colbert did not {{publicly}} exhibit his art or show any films. Instead, he traveled to such places as Antarctica, India, Egypt, Burma, Tonga, Australia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, China, the Arctic, the Azores, and Borneo. Elephants, whales, manatees, sacred ibis, cranes, eagles, gyrfalcons, rhinoceros hornbills, cheetahs, leopards, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), caracals, baboons, eland, meerkats, gibbons, orangutans, penguins, pandas, polar bears, lions, giant <b>Pacific</b> <b>manta</b> rays, and saltwater crocodiles are among the animals he has filmed and photographed. Human collaborators include San bushmen, Tsaatan, Lisu, Massai, Chong, Kazakhs, and people from other indigenous tribes around the world. Colbert, who calls animals [...] "nature's living masterpieces," [...] photographs and films both wild animals and {{those that have been}} habituated to human contact in their native environments. The images record what he saw through the lens of his camera without the use of digital collaging.|$|E
40|$|The {{decline of}} most Mexican {{fisheries}} has occurred {{so rapidly that}} few Mexicans and Americans alike fully appreciate the loss. The major focus of this paper will examine the false impression that Mexico is engaging in marine conservation; in reality, its conservation efforts are responses to after-the-fact actions brought on by world critics and {{as a vehicle to}} pacify conservationists. The Mexican government can pass a law but lacks the resources to administer and enforce the law and subsequently manage its fisheries in an effective manner. Rather than survey the state of every fishery found in Mexican waters, this paper will examine only four fisheries because of their unique economic, political and ecologic impact, and how the Mexican government allowed their demise. These fisheries are California gray whale, <b>Pacific</b> <b>manta,</b> sea turtle, and totoaba...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of this dive the conservation {{and protection of}} manta rays has become a priority for dive operators and organizations. Manta rays {{in other parts of}} the Pacific Ocean have been hunted by fishermen as a result of {{the increasing}} demand for manta ray gill plates. Local organizations, such as the <b>Manta</b> <b>Pacific</b> Research Foundation, try to protect the local manta rays and educate the public about manta rays and other sea life. The <b>Manta</b> <b>Pacific</b> Research Foundation's mission is to [...] "study manta rays in their natural habitat, conduct scientific research, provide education programs for the public about manta rays and the marine environment, and to establish and promote global manta ray conservation". As a result of manta rays' fragile biological composition, guidelines to protect the health of the manta rays at this dive have been set forth by The Ocean Recreation council of Hawaii and PADI's Project AWARE. The guidelines are strictly enforced by dive operations that conduct this dive.|$|R

50|$|On 16 May 1735, La Condamine sailed from La Rochelle {{accompanied}} by Godin, Bouguer, and a botanist, Joseph de Jussieu. After stopovers in Martinique, Saint-Domingue, and Cartagena (Colombia), {{they came to}} Panama where they crossed the continent. Finally (on 10 March 1736) the expedition arrived at the <b>Pacific</b> port of <b>Manta.</b> La Condamine's associations with his colleagues were unhappy. The expedition was beset by many difficulties, and finally La Condamine split from the rest {{and made his way}} to Quito, Ecuador separately, becoming the first European to encounter rubber in the process. He joined the group again on 4 June 1736 in the city of Quito. La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the Académie Royale des Sciences of France in 1736. In 1751, he presented a paper by François Fresneau to the Académie (eventually published in 1755) which described many of the properties of rubber. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.|$|R
