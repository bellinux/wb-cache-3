5|$|The tambu is an instrument, and a form {{of music}} and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is {{sometimes}} known as bari), and Curaçao. The tambu is an especially important symbol of Curaçaoan identity. Instrumentation for the tambu uses the agan, chapi, triangle, wiri and other instruments, {{many of which are}} also part of the African-derived muziek di zumbi, or spirit music, of Curaçao. Curaçao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with apentatonic lyrics sung in Guene or a <b>Papiamento</b> variant called seshi. The Simadan harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the cachu trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable {{for the use of the}} becu, an aerophone made from the stalk of a sorghum plant, and the kinkon, made from a conch shell and known elsewhere as the carco. Folk song forms range from the harvest seu, simadan and wapa. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American joropo and pasillo, Spanish Caribbean merengue and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the tumba.|$|E
25|$|<b>Papiamento</b> has a {{standardized}} orthography. There are two Languages of <b>Papiamento,</b> one spoken {{on the island}} of Aruba and the other on the islands of Curaçao and Bonaire. The orthographies of these dialects differ slightly. The orthography of the Aruban dialect is more etymological in nature, while the other is more phonemic. Among {{the differences between the two}} dialects, one obvious difference is the way the name of the language is written. In Aruba it is called <b>Papiamento,</b> while in Curaçao it is called Papiamentu. Though what is spoken on Bonaire isn't a separate dialect, there it is sometimes called Papiamen. The governments of Curaçao and Aruba formally accepted orthographic rules according to their dialects in 1976 and 1977, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In Curaçao, Spanish and Portuguese Jews {{contributed to}} the {{formation}} of <b>Papiamento,</b> a creole of Portuguese and various African languages. It is still used as an everyday language on the island.|$|E
25|$|Judæo-Portuguese {{was used}} by Sephardim— {{especially}} among the Spanish and Portuguese Jews. The pidgin forms of Portuguese spoken among slaves and their Sephardic owners were an influence {{in the development of}} <b>Papiamento</b> and the Creole languages of Suriname.|$|E
25|$|English has {{a formal}} {{status in the}} special {{municipalities}} of Saba and Sint Eustatius. It is widely spoken on these islands. <b>Papiamento</b> has a formal status in the special municipality of Bonaire. Yiddish and the Romani language were recognised in 1996 as non-territorial languages.|$|E
25|$|Other Creole {{languages}} with Dutch linguistic {{roots are}} <b>Papiamento</b> still spoken in Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and Sint Eustatius; Saramaccan and Sranan Tongo still spoken in Suriname; Berbice spoken but {{in danger of}} extinction in Guyana; Pecok spoken but in danger of extinction in Indonesia and the Netherlands; Albany Dutch spoken but in danger of extinction in the USA.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Papiamento,</b> vowels {{appear in}} {{succession}} only when each is pronounced separately e.g. reeduca (to reeducate). This rule {{is part of}} the Papiamentu orthography as well. Moreover, in Papiamentu a diaeresis or trema , as may be used in the language of origin of various loan words, is never used to distinguish separate sounds like in Dutch (ideeën) or Spanish (vergüenza).|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this process}} of reform of the language's orthography were {{elevations}} in formal recognition of the language. The Algemene wet bestuursrecht (General administrative law) of the Netherlands was reformed in 1995 in great part to allow {{the use of the}} West Frisian language in governmental administration within the province of Friesland. This reform also allowed <b>Papiamento</b> and English to be used alongside Dutch within Aruba and the islands of the Netherlands Antilles. In 2003 the Aruban government had passed a law concerning the official language of the island, making <b>Papiamento</b> and Dutch the official languages of Aruba. Four years later in 2007, the government of the Netherlands Antilles passed a similar law making Papiamentu, Dutch and English the official languages of the islands. With the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, the Government of the Netherlands has maintained the official status of Papiamentu, English and Dutch in the Caribbean Netherlands. The official languages of Curaçao since then remain Papiamentu and Dutch.|$|E
25|$|In {{search of}} a global vision on Indo culture and in a {{continued}} effort to resist assimilation Tjalie Robinson traveled to Latin America where he compared the Indo community with the racially mixed people of that continent. Already in the Dutch East Indies he had admired {{the status of the}} Creole language <b>Papiamento</b> and the cultural expressions of the Dutch Antilles. He also sympathised with the philosophical writings of the Spanish essayist Jose Ortega y Gasset, an outspoken proponent of perspectivism and in 1961 even initiated the creation of an Indo enclave in Spain, named 'El Atabal'.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} synagogues, or esnogas, {{as they are}} usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, are the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam and those in London and New York. Amsterdam is still the historical centre of the Amsterdam minhag, as used in the Netherlands and former Dutch possessions such as Surinam. Also important is the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London, the historical centre of the London minhag. The Curaçao synagogue (built in 1732 and known as the Snoa, the <b>Papiamento</b> form of esnoga) of the Mikvé Israel-Emanuel congregation {{is considered one of}} the {{most important}} synagogues in the Jewish history of the Americas.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the colonies in the East Indies, from {{the second half of}} the 19th century onwards, the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the West Indies. Until 1863, when slavery was abolished in the West Indies, slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch, with the effect that local creoles such as <b>Papiamento</b> and Sranan Tongo which were based not on Dutch but rather other European languages, became common in the Dutch West Indies. However, as most of the people in the Colony of Surinam (now Suriname) worked on Dutch plantations, this reinforced the use of Dutch as a means for direct communication.|$|E
500|$|On December 18, 2007, {{prosecutor}} Hans Mos officially {{declared the}} case closed, {{and that no}} charges would be filed {{due to lack of}} evidence. The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Van der Sloot (though they legally ceased to be suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a chat room message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from <b>Papiamento</b> to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway. Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, [...] "Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one of these kids, there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Papiamento</b> (spoken in Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao in the Caribbean) is a Portuguese-based creole that is {{undergoing}} significant Spanish influence.|$|E
2500|$|The word y (meaning [...] "and") is {{the only}} example of [...] as a vowel and only appears in <b>Papiamento</b> (in Papiamentu, the word is written as i).|$|E
2500|$|Consonants {{are seldom}} doubled in Papiamento/u. According to the orthographies of both dialects, this only {{occurs when a}} word takes on a prefix, e.g. - as in innatural (unnatural), or a suffix, e.g. - as in pannan (breads). In Papiamentu, numerals are written as one word, e.g. dosshen (two hundred) and are another example of where consonants may appear twice, but in <b>Papiamento</b> they are not, e.g. dos cien/shen. In <b>Papiamento</b> where the letter [...] is often used, the first [...] in words like acceso and occidente is {{pronounced}} [...]|$|E
2500|$|The four {{official}} digraphs are , , [...] and , representing , , [...] and [...] respectively. The combination [...] {{appears in}} <b>Papiamento</b> in loan {{words such as}} adolescente, {{but it is not}} considered a digraph.|$|E
2500|$|Note: the {{pronunciation}} of <b>Papiamento</b> {{words with}} a [...] {{does not change}} when such words are contracted with di or e, i.e. the [...] in sac’i lamunchi, though followed by an , retains its [...] sound.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pronunciation}} of [...] in both dialects {{follows the}} general rule of the hard and soft [...] as in Latin-based orthographies of various European languages, i.e. pronounced [...] before [...] and , and [...] elsewhere. However, the use of [...] differs per dialect. As <b>Papiamento</b> is focused more on etymology than phonemic spelling, the [...] is far more commonly used compared to Papiamentu, where its use is limited to proper names.|$|E
2500|$|Often, the European {{words on}} which Interlingua is based gain {{extensive}} currency in non-Western languages. Hospital, for example, appears in Celtic languages such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, and Breton; Germanic languages such as Dutch, Danish and Afrikaans; Slavic languages such as Ukrainian and Polish; Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Urdu and Bengali; Altaic languages such as Mongolian, Turkmen and Azerbaijani; Austronesian languages such as Indonesian, Ilocano, Tagalog, Tetum and Chamorro; African languages such as Swahili, Kongo and Setswana; and creoles and [...] linguistically isolated languages such as <b>Papiamento,</b> Albanian, Mapunzugun and Basque. In many other languages, however, the word hospital is not found, including Finnish, Arabic, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Hungarian.|$|E
2500|$|St. Martin's Dutch side {{is known}} for its festive nightlife, beaches, jewellery, drinks made with native rum-based guavaberry liquors, and [...] casinos. The island's French side {{is known for}} its nude beaches, clothes, {{shopping}} (including outdoor markets), and French and Indian Caribbean cuisine. [...] English is the most commonly spoken language along with a local dialect. The official languages are French for Saint-Martin, and both Dutch and English for Sint Maarten. Other common languages include various French-based creoles (spoken by immigrants from other French Caribbean islands), Spanish (spoken by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and various South American countries), and <b>Papiamento</b> (spoken by immigrants from Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao).|$|E
2500|$|Portuguese ( [...] or, in full, [...] ) is {{a western}} Romance {{language}} and the sole official language of Portugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, and São Tomé and Príncipe. It also has co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea and Macau in China. As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers are also found in Goa, Daman and Diu in India; in Batticaloa {{on the east coast}} of Sri Lanka; in the Indonesian island of Flores; in the Malacca state of Malaysia; and the ABC islands in the Caribbean where <b>Papiamento</b> is spoken, while Cape Verdean Creole is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based Creole. A Portuguese-speaking person or nation may be referred to as [...] "Lusophone" [...] in both English and Portuguese.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{consistency}} in <b>Papiamento</b> {{in terms of}} when a hard [...] is used instead of a [...] and when a soft [...] is used instead of an [...] Before the vowels , [...] and , a [...] is used instead of a , e.g. cas (house), cos (thing) and cushina (kitchen) instead of kas, kos and kushina. Moreover, a [...] is used instead of a [...] when it appears before an , , [...] or [...] A soft [...] is used instead of an [...] most often in the final syllable, in verbs ending in [...] or , e.g. conoce (to know), traduci (to translate), or words with [...] or [...] in the final syllable, e.g. social, servicio. This extends to derivatives of such words, such as socialisacion. Less regular examples {{of the use of}} a soft [...] instead of an [...] are words like ciego (blind) and placer (pleasure).|$|E
50|$|<b>Papiamento</b> was not {{considered}} important on Aruba until 1995. It was officially included in school curriculum in 1998 and 1999. Since then, the island has embraced the native language of <b>Papiamento.</b> A <b>Papiamento</b> dictionary and fairy tales written in <b>Papiamento</b> are now readily available on the island.|$|E

5000|$|Venezuelan Spanish and American English are {{constant}} influences today. Code-switching and lexical borrowing between <b>Papiamento,</b> Spanish, Dutch and English {{among native}} speakers is common. This {{is perceived as}} a threat to the further development of <b>Papiamento</b> due to a language ideology that is committed to preserving the authentic African or Creole [...] "feel" [...] of <b>Papiamento.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aruba's State Constitution {{approved}} unanimously on August 9, 1985, was proclaimed in the Dutch {{language on}} August 19, and although its translation in <b>Papiamento,</b> Aruba's National language, was already completed in 1985, {{it still has}} not been proclaimed in <b>Papiamento.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Languages: Dutch, English and <b>Papiamento</b> are {{official}} languages. <b>Papiamento</b> (a Portuguese-West African creole with Dutch and Spanish influence) predominates on Curaçao and Bonaire, while English {{is widely}} spoken.

50|$|The precise {{historical}} {{origins of}} <b>Papiamento</b> {{have not been}} established. Historical constraints, core vocabulary and grammatical features that <b>Papiamento</b> shares with Cape Verdean Creole suggest that the basic ingredients are Portuguese, and that other influences occurred {{at a later time}} (17th and 18th centuries, respectively).|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the lasting}} effects of Trinta di Mei was the {{increased}} use and prestige of <b>Papiamento.</b> According to Frank Martinus Arion, a Curaçaoan writer, [...] "Trinta di Mei allowed us to recognize the subversive treasure we had in our language". It empowered <b>Papiamento</b> speakers and sparked discussions {{about the use of}} the language. Vitó, the magazine that had played a large part in the build-up to the uprising, had long called for <b>Papiamento</b> to become Curaçao's official language once it became independent of the Netherlands. Indeed, it was recognized as an official language on the island, along with English and Dutch, in 2007. Curaçaoan parliamentary debate is now conducted in <b>Papiamento</b> and most radio broadcasts are in this Creole language. However, most schools still teach in Dutch.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{evidence}} of {{widespread use of}} <b>Papiamento</b> in Aruba can be seen through the Curaçao official documents in the early 18th century. In the 19th century, most materials in the islands were written in <b>Papiamento</b> including Roman Catholic schoolbooks and hymnals. The first <b>Papiamento</b> newspaper was published in 1871 and titled Civilisado (The Civilized). Civilizado (stress on /za/) is Spanish and Portuguese for [...] "civilized" [...] but can also be understood as having a suppressed final [...] "r" [...] in the word Civilizador (stress on /do/) (Civilizer).|$|E
