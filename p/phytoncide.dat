50|$|One {{volatile}} <b>phytoncide,</b> sophoraflavanone G, is {{of particular}} interest, due to its use in treating methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Sophoraflavanone G is a {{volatile}} <b>phytoncide,</b> {{released into the}} atmosphere, soil and ground water, {{by members of the}} Sophora genus. Due to an increase in the rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, scientific efforts have focused on finding either naturally-made or genetically modified compounds that can treat and or prevent these harmful and sometimes deadly bacteria. Sophoraflavanone G, due to its use as a <b>phytoncide,</b> has been found to impact the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and enhance the effect of currently used antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} produce phytoncides is a quality common among plants. The release of phytoncides {{increase}} when a plant is injured. <b>Phytoncide</b> compound composition's vary {{depending on whether the}} compound is considered a glycoside, terpenoid, or other secondary metabolites (not found in the major classes of natural compounds).|$|E
50|$|Some <b>phytoncides</b> effect only insects {{feeding on}} the plant, {{acting on the}} insect’s {{autonomic}} nervous system. Other <b>phytoncides</b> target mainly microbes. The antimicrobial potency and range of <b>phytoncides</b> vary greatly among species. Some can kill many types of protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and insects within minutes or seconds, while others may take hours or only harm the pest. In addition to acting as a “plant protector”, <b>phytoncides</b> can also impede the reproduction of pests.|$|R
5000|$|... 1st {{discovered}} by B.P. Tokin, the word “phytoncide” literally means, exterminated by the plant. <b>Phytoncides</b> are a biologically active substance of plant origin that kills or inhibits {{growth and development}} of bacteria, microscopic fungi, and protozoa. <b>Phytoncides</b> {{play an important role}} in plant immunity and in the relationships between organisms within an ecosystem.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{categories}} of phytoncides: 1) Nonexcretory phytoncides (found in the protoplasma of cells) and 2) Volatile phytoncides (released into the atmosphere, soil and water) Examples of plants releasing each type of <b>phytoncide</b> are: (nonexcretory)onion, garlic, and horseradish,and (volatile) pine, oak, eucalyptus, {{and members of the}} Sophora genus.|$|E
50|$|Flavonoids are a {{class of}} {{secondary}} metabolites found in plants that fulfill {{a wide variety of}} functions.

It has not been until recently that their use as a <b>phytoncide</b> was made known.|$|E
50|$|Birch tree {{water is}} a {{traditional}} beverage in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, {{and other parts of}} Northern Europe, and in parts of Northern China. Renowned for centuries for its taste and health benefits, people have used it to help prevent kidney stones, treat ulcers, headaches, colds, rheumatism, radiculitis, and arthritis. Some believe it is immunity-boosting and regenerative, and that it flushes out harmful substances and stimulats the metabolism. It contains antimicrobial substances (e.g., <b>phytoncide)</b> and {{has been used as a}} cosmetic face wash.|$|E
50|$|Regarding how <b>phytoncides</b> {{effect a}} plant’s immunity, for example, 1 hectare of pine forest will release {{approximately}} 5 kg of volatile <b>phytoncides</b> {{into the atmosphere}} in one day, {{reducing the amount of}} microflora in the air and essentially sterilizing the atmosphere among the forest, containing only about 200-300 bacterial cells/m3. This effect is found more commonly in coniferous forests as opposed to deciduous; something to consider when planning resort locations and urban landscaping.|$|R
50|$|More than 5,000 {{volatile}} substances {{defend the}} surrounding plants from bacteria, fungi and insects. <b>Phytoncides</b> work by preventing {{the growth of}} the attacking organism.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} further the {{understanding}} of <b>Phytoncide,</b> we developed several teaching materials. They were the effect of plants of E. coli, the effect of plants on Eugelna {{and the effect of}} plants on fruit fly. The results of our work found that garlic inhibited the growth of E. coli, and a lemon solution inhibited the activity of Euglena. We made the lesson about <b>Phytoncide</b> in two high schools. The students got good experimental results and they could understand the function of <b>Phytoncide.</b> Therefore, it is considered that the teaching materials about <b>Phytoncide</b> which we developed, were useful for high school education...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 140 weaning pigs ((Landrace×Yorkshire) ×Duroc, BW = 6. 47 ± 0. 86 kg) {{were used in}} a 5 -wk growth trail to {{determine}} the effects of <b>phytoncide</b> supplementation on growth performance, nutrient apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), blood profiles, diarrhea scores and fecal microflora shedding. Pigs were assigned randomly by BW into 5 treatments, dietary treatments were: i) NC, basal diet; ii) PC, NC+ 0. 05 % tylosin; iii) EO, NC+ 0. 1 % essential oil; iv) PP, NC+ 0. 2 % PP (<b>phytoncide</b> with 2 % citric acid), and v) PA, NC+ 0. 2 % PA (<b>phytoncide).</b> Each treatment had 7 replicate pens with 4 pigs per pen. All pigs were housed in pens with a self-feeder and nipple drinker to allow ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the experimental period. During 0 to 2 wks, supplementation with essential oil and PA decreased (p 0. 05) was observed in diarrhea scores among treatments. In conclusion, <b>phytoncide</b> can elevate feed efficiency, nutrient digestibility, and improve the fecal Lactobacillus counts in weaning pigs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} adding <b>phytoncide</b> oil extracted from Korean pine nut cone byproduct to the diet of dairy cows on milk yield and compositions, fatty acid characteristics, complete blood count and stress response. A total of 74 Holstein cows were used for 30 days and divided into two groups. Each group was given a basal diet (C) or an experimental diet containing <b>phytoncide</b> additives at 0. 016 % (T) in feed. The results showed that <b>phytoncide</b> feeding had no effect on milk yield. In addition, there were no observed effects on milk composition, but the ratio of fatty acid in milk was significantly affected by the <b>phytoncide</b> diet, and it showed a positive effect. Not only were the major functional fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid increased, but also ω 6 :ω 3 fatty acid ratio was reduced in milk of T group (p< 0. 05). In blood analysis, the complete blood count showed no significant difference between C and T group on all parameters. However, the cortisol concentration was significantly decreased in T group compared to control (p< 0. 05). Taken together, we suggest that <b>phytoncide</b> oil does not have a great influence on the physiological changes, but can be a potential feed additive that improves the milk fatty acid and stress resilience in dairy cows. In addition, it will contribute to the development of feed resource, a reduction in feed cost and a lessening of environmental pollution...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} this 10 -wk {{experiment to}} evaluate the effects of dietary <b>phytoncide,</b> Korean pine extract as phytogenic feed additive (PFA), on growth performance, blood characteristics, and meat quality in finishing pigs. A total of 160 pigs ([Landrace×Yorkshire]×Duroc, body weight (BW) = 58. 2 ± 1. 0 kg) were randomly allocated into 1 of 4 treatments according to their BW and sex, 10 replicate pens per treatment with 4 pigs per pen were used (2 barrows and 2 gilts). Dietary treatments were: CON, control diet; PT 2, CON+ 0. 02 % PFA; PT 4, CON+ 0. 04 % PFA; PT 6, CON+ 0. 06 % PFA. Overall, average daily gain (ADG) was higher in PT 4 (p< 0. 05) than in PT 6, average daily feed intake (ADFI) was lower in PT 6 than in CON (p< 0. 05). Besides ADFI decreased linearly (p< 0. 05) with the increased level of <b>phytoncide</b> and gain:feed ratio in PT 4 treatment was higher (p< 0. 05) than CON treatment. During 5 to 10 weeks and overall, quadratic (p< 0. 05) effect was observed in ADG among the treatments. At {{the end of this}} experiment, pigs fed with PT 4 diet had a greater (p< 0. 05) red blood cell concentration compared to the pigs fed CON diet. Water holding capacity increased linearly (p< 0. 05) with the increased level of <b>phytoncide</b> supplementation. Moreover, firmness, redness, yellowness, and drip loss at day 3 decreased linearly (p< 0. 05) with the increase in the level of <b>phytoncide</b> supplementation.

30|$|Forest-air bathing {{and walking}} (shinrin-yoku) is {{beneficial}} to human heath. In this study the <b>phytoncide</b> (volatile compounds) released from Cryptomeria japonica plantation forest {{was characterized by}} using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main volatile compounds were α-pinene (19.35 %), β-myrcene (16.98 %), d-limonene (15.21 %), and γ-muurolene (7.42 %). Furthermore, the neuropharmacological activity of the essential oils from leaves of C. japonica (ECJ) was evaluated by several animal behavior tests. ECJ could prolong the sleeping phase of ICR (imprinting control region) mice in the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time model. Furthermore, both EJC {{and one of its}} monoterpenes, d-limonene, possessed potent anxiolytic and analgesic activities based on the results obtained from elevated plus maze and writhing tests. The volatile compounds released from C. japonica provide relaxing and stress-relieving effects on mice, and further study on the effect of <b>phytoncide</b> on humans is worthwhile.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phytoncides,</b> {{which are}} {{volatile}} substances emitted from plants for protection against plant pathogens and insects, {{are known to}} have insecticidal, antimicrobial, and antifungal activities. In contrast to their negative effects on microorganisms and insects, <b>phytoncides</b> have been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. Essential oil from Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) is mostly used in commercial products such as air purifiers. However, the physiological/behavioral impact of essential oil from C. obtusa on insects is not established. In this study, we tested the effects of essential oil extracted from C. obtusa on the physiologies and behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica. Exposure to essential oil from C. obtusa decreased the lifespan, fecundity, locomotive activity, and developmental success rate of D. melanogaster. In addition, both fruit flies and house flies showed strong repellent behavioral responses to the essential oil, with duration times of about 5 hours at 70 μg/ml. These results suggest that essential oil from C. obtusa {{can be used as a}} 'human-friendly' alternative insect repellent...|$|R
30|$|Following the {{completion}} of the first experiment in May 2013, corrective thinning of the study area was carried out in August of the same year. Crews used two chain saws and one portable winch during the thinning operation, with a target of approximately 15 – 20 % thinning. Four workers from Fuji Iyashinomori Woodland Study Center worked for a total of 9  h for 2  days in late August. The second experiment was conducted in October of the same year. The period between the two experiments was important because the smell of the trees, typified by <b>phytoncide,</b> would be stronger immediately after the thinning. In the experimental period, we provided warm coats for the participants so they could control the experimental conditions in comfort.

40|$|Purpose: Forests have {{positive}} effects on health due to <b>phytoncide,</b> thus increasing physical activity and stress relief. However, research has not been conducted on the daily health benefits of existing forests. Therefore, this study attempts to compare the health status and behaviors of residents in urban and forested areas. Methods: This cross-sectional study used anthropometric measures, blood tests, heart rate variability, depression, stress, and health behavior self-reports for adults between 35 and 79 years from two regions. Results: Adults living in a forested region had better health consequences-including lower prevalence of osteoarthritis (6. 4 %) and mean bone mineral density (- 0. 84) -than those in an urban region (osteoarthritis: 13. 7 %; bone mineral density:- 1. 55). The percentage of ‘physically active ’ participants (measured in MET-minutes) differed significantly different be-tween the forested (49. 1 %) and urban (7. 3 %) areas. However, health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol con-sumption, and regular heath check-up rates were worse among residents from the forested, than the urban area.

40|$|Due to the {{presence}} of secondary metabolites exhibiting pharmacological activity, the flowers of Rosa rugosa Thunb. have found application in traditional and folk medicine. The essential oil obtained from them is also considered to be a <b>phytoncide.</b> The morphological and anatomical characters of glandular trichomes located on the sepals of R. rugosa were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Using histochemical tests, the type of secretion produced in the trichomes was determined and its contents were compared with the secretion produced by the papillae on the petals. 			 			It was found that multicellular glandular trichomes, having the features of colleters, and non-glandular trichomes were located on the abaxial epidermis, while only non-glandular trichomes were situated on the adaxial epidermis. The stalk cells of the glandular trichomes are arranged in multiple rows, whereas the epidermal cells of the head are arranged radially. The capitate trichomes were classified into two types: short and long trichomes. The largest density of glandular trichomes was recorded in the basal abaxial epidermis and in the middle part of the sepals. During the initial stages of bud development, the glandular hairs were green colored, whereas in the next development stages they changed the color to red. The histochemical tests used allowed us to find that the trichomes on the sepals and the papille on the petals produced lipid substances, polyphenols, tannins, and flavonoids.

30|$|More than 30  years {{have passed}} since Ulrich’s (1984) {{scientific}} study of the restorative effect of green and nature, during which time the primary {{focus has been on}} psychology in relation to city life (Herzog and Chernik 2000; Hartig et al. 2003; Laumann et al. 2003; Morita et al. 2009; Velarde et al. 2007). According to Haluza et al. (2014), since the beginning of this century, the physical and psychological restorative effects or other immune-related effects of forest enclosures have been investigated primarily in developed countries, in which aging populations and declining birth rates have become serious issues. In Japan in particular, since the concept of forest bathing was defined in 1982 (Morita et al. 2009), studies on the physical and psychological restorative effects of the forest have rapidly advanced, specifically {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. For example, in the areas of medicine and physiology, Ohira et al. (1999) reported that forest bathing was effective for immune restoration, and Li et al. (2007; 2008 a) found that immune cells were more active after a 3 -day stay in the forest. Li et al. (2008 b) also indicated that the benefits of forest bathing were influenced not only by the components of air, such as <b>phytoncide,</b> but also by the environment itself, compared with staying in urban areas for the same duration. Ochiai et al. (2015 a; 2015 b) showed that 2  h of forest bathing reduced physiological parameters such as stress hormones, blood pressure, and adrenaline in middle-aged and elderly people. The Profile of Mood States (POMS; McNair et al. 1964) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al. 1970; Spielberger et al. 1983) are commonly applied to analyze mood (Oishi et al. 2003; Park et al. 2009; Tsunetsugu et al. 2010; Park et al. 2010) and anxiety state (Takanashi 2011). Moreover, research using newly developed indices such as the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS; Korpela and Hartig 1996; Hartig et al. 1997 a; Hartig et al. 1997 b), the Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS; Korpela et al. 2008; Korpela et al. 2010), and the Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS; Ryan and Frederick 1997) has shown that forest bathing results in psychological restoration and improved vigor (Takayama and Kagawa 2013; Takayama, Korpela, Lee et al. 2014 b; Tyrväinen et al. 2014). Furthermore, Kobayashi et al. (2015) performed a large-scale field experiment throughout Japan in 60 forests known as “therapy bases” maintained for forest bathing. Finally, a few notable studies have confirmed the considerable physiological and psychological effects not only of remote forests but also of urban forests (Tsunetsugu et al. 2013; Tyrväinen et al. 2014 b). Thus, studies have shown that forest environments result in physical and mental restorative effects and have detailed the mechanisms behind these effects.|$|E

50|$|When closely {{arranged}} on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (切り笹). These dividers prevent {{the flavors of}} neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (葉蘭 haran) and Sasa veitchii (熊笹 kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had {{the added benefit of}} releasing antimicrobial <b>phytoncides</b> when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.|$|R
