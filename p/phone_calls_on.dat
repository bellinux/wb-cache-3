25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Wizarding World are {{depicted}} as being less-than-modern {{in comparison to the}} Muggle world, sometimes even old-fashioned or quaint. The technological development of the Wizarding World is substantially behind that of its Muggle counterpart — for instance, candles are used for the illumination instead of electrical or gas bulbs/tubes and owls, a more cumbersome and slower way, are used to send messages than simple <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, an owl can be sent to deliver a message without the sender needing to know the recipient's exact location or phone number.|$|E

500|$|The book {{suggests}} that the September 11 attacks were self-inflicted: a covert operation aimed at influencing domestic opinion and to persuade Americans to support the invasions of Afghanistan and of Iraq. It is written in a speculative style, laden with terms such as [...] "could", [...] "might", [...] "maybe" [...] and [...] "if", and does not directly accuse the Central Intelligence Agency of direct responsibility for the attacks. It does, however, attempt to demolish the [...] "conventional" [...] account of the 9/11 attacks, and while it does not build up a substantive account to replace it, it leaves insinuations and rumours to suggest possibilities. For instance, while {{it is argued that}} such well-organized attacks could only occur with [...] "the support of the intelligence agencies", the exact details of that support are left unspecified. The book {{suggests that}} no plane crashed into The Pentagon and none in Pennsylvania on 9/11, and that the alleged mobile <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> United Airlines Flight 93 were not real.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, they {{received}} <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> their dormitory pay phone from record companies seeking out {{the band and}} wanting to sign them for an album. The band then decided that they should pursue the avenue of music and move to Nashville, putting their college careers [...] "on hold". Matt Bronleewe decided to continue with school for the time, and was getting married as well, so decided not to move to Nashville with the band. Because the band's sound included an acoustic guitar duo, {{it was necessary to}} find a new member to fill the gaps, and Charlie's best friend from high school decided after much debate to join the band and move to Nashville in August. Matt Odmark had been at the University of Rochester as an English major but enjoyed playing his guitar at small cafe's. His assimilation into the band was difficult due to his lack of involvement in the music industry, but by August the band was very comfortable together while they lived in close quarters in a small two bedroom apartment in Antioch, TN. They also accepted jobs during this time, at places such as pizza shops, mall stores and book warehouses while waiting for the contract, and wondered if they ever really would be able to sign with a company.|$|E

2500|$|Plans by the US {{to engage}} in peace talks with the Taliban have {{resulted}} in suspension of bilateral security discussions between the US and Afghanistan on 13 June 2013. [...] "In a special meeting chaired by President Hamid Karzai, the president has decided to suspend talks about a security pact with the U.S. because of their inconsistent statements and actions {{in regard to the}} peace process," [...] spokesman Aimal Faizi told Reuters. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the flare-up with Karzai in <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> 19 June 2013, Afghan and U.S. officials said, part of the latest round of crisis diplomacy between Washington and Afghanistan's mercurial leader. Negotiations on the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) began earlier 2013 and, if completed, will define the shape of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan for years to come. The security discussions between the U.S. and Afghanistan would provide for a limited number of military trainers and counterterrorism forces to remain in the country. The talks have been complicated by several disagreements, including over the immunity that U.S. troops would enjoy from Afghan laws. Speaking to reporters days before the suspension, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the commander of the U.S.-led coalition, said, [...] "The bilateral security agreement is critical to any post-2014 presence. So it needs to be taken seriously on both sides." [...] It was not clear how long Karzai would withdraw from the security talks with the US, meant to finalise arrangements for keeping a small US presence in the country after the last of the NATO troops leave 2014. Karzai has said the negotiations would not resume until the Taliban met directly with representatives of the Afghan government, essentially linking the security negotiations to a faltering peace process and making the United States responsible for persuading the Taliban to talk to the Afghan government.|$|E
