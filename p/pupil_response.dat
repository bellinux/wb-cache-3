40|$|Changes in pupil {{diameter}} can reflect high-level cognitive {{signals that}} depend on central neuromodulatory mechanisms. However, brain mechanisms that adjust pupil size are also exquisitely sensitive to changes in luminance and other events that {{would be considered a}} nuisance in cognitive experiments recording pupil size. We implemented a simple auditory experiment involving no changes in visual stimulation. Using finite impulse-response fitting we found <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> triggered by different types of events. Among these are <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to auditory events and associated surprise: cognitive effects. However, these cognitive responses were overshadowed by <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> associated with blinks and eye movements, both inevitable nuisance factors that lead to changes in effective lumi- nance. Of note, these latter <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> were not recording artifacts caused by blinks and eye movements, but endogenous <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> that occurred in the wake of these events. Furthermore, we identified slow (tonic) changes in pupil size that differentially influ- enced faster (phasic) <b>pupil</b> <b>responses.</b> Fitting all <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> using gamma functions, we provide accurate characterisations of cognitive and non-cognitive response shapes, and quantify each response's dependence on tonic pupil size.

Comparison of pupil color and <b>pupil</b> grating <b>responses</b> of equivalent amplitude reveals similar onset response latencies. However, both are approximately 40 ms longer than the corresponding pupil light reflex latency. In general these <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> are qualitatively similar to those observed in humans.

40|$|Background: Fear {{conditioning}} and extinction are prevailing experimental and etiological models for normal and pathological anxiety. <b>Pupil</b> dilations in <b>response</b> to conditioned stimuli are increasingly {{used as a}} robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates of <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to threat and safety cues during a fear learning task. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear {{conditioning and}} extinction paradigm with simultaneous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to threat and safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general linear models. Results: Trial-wise magnitude of <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to both conditioned and safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> did not show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear (declining) time modulation. Conclusion: Pupil dilations during fear conditioning and extinction provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil diameter may reflect changes in general arousal...|$|R

40|$|The {{link between}} arousal and pupil {{dilation}} is well studied, {{but it is}} less known that other cognitive processes can trigger <b>pupil</b> <b>responses.</b> Here we present evidence that <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> can be induced by high-level scene processing, independent of changes in low-level features or arousal. In Experiment 1, we recorded changes in pupil diameter of observers while they viewed a variety of natural scenes {{with or without a}} sun that were presented either upright or inverted. Image inversion had the strongest effect on the <b>pupil</b> <b>responses.</b> The <b>pupil</b> constricted more to the onset of upright images as compared to inverted images. Furthermore, the amplitudes of pupil constrictions to viewing images containing a sun were larger relative to control images. In Experiment 2, we presented cartoon versions of upright and inverted pictures that included either a sun or a moon. The image backgrounds were kept identical across conditions. Similar to Experiment 1, upright images triggered pupil constrictions with larger amplitudes than inverted images and images of the sun evoked greater pupil contraction than images of the moon. We suggest that the modulations of <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> were due to higher-level interpretations of image content...|$|R

[...] Methods of reliable measurement of cognitive load, such as the dilation or constriction of the pupils, are used in marketing research to assess the attractiveness of TV commercials. Dilation of the pupils reflects an increase in mental processes, whether it be attentiveness, or psychomotor responsiveness.

5000|$|This {{research}} was continued, using portraits by Rembrandt featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus. [...] Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects {{this way to}} elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored. In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was due to unpleasantness. As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.|$|E
50|$|These {{effects are}} also seen when {{investigating}} the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek {{is found in}} the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations. Theories for this preference suggest that {{the left side of the}} face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better. <b>Pupil</b> <b>response</b> tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images. Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.|$|E

This ensured that <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> reflected endogenous arousal fluctuations opposed to differences in stimulus content. We found that pupil hazard rates predicted the classification of sub-second intervals (steeper dilation =“Longer” classifications). This shows that the accumulation of endogenous arousal signals informs gaze-shift timing judgements. We also found that participants relied exclusively on the 2 nd stimulus to perform the classification, providing insights into timing strategies under conditions of maximum uncertainty. We observed no dissociation in <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> when timing equivalent neutral spatial displacements, indicating that a stimulus-dependent timer exploits arousal to time gaze-shifts...|$|R
40|$|Objectively {{measuring}} the operators’ task workload in goal-directed motor {{tasks such as}} surgical operations, is important for performance and safety. This thesis presents an approach for objectively measuring task workload in goal-directed movements using an important eye response: the pupil diameter. We demonstrate how to capture movement-related pupil size changes during motor tasks, investigate how the pupil responds to task requirement, and show that the pupil diameter can be employed as an objective and quantitative indicator of task workload in motor tasks. In particular, we studied tasks where a tool is used to manipulate a target. The challenges include how to quantitatively define the task requirement, accurately detect the movement-related <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> from other event-evoked pupil changes, and separate the <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> from consecutive movements. We quantify the task requirements using Fitts’ index of difficulty. The movement-related pupil events are captured from a time window aligned at a specific moment of tool movement which is automatically detected from recorded task videos. To separate overlapping movement responses, each tool movement {{is divided into two}} phases: the Transport and Landing phases. Three experiments were conducted to verify correlations between <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> and task difficulty of goal-directed movements, including two discrete target-pointing tasks and a continuous target-pointing task. We also investigated the <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to task difficulty in a realistic situation: that is, during performance of a simulated surgical task, where we found that the <b>pupil</b> <b>responses</b> to the subtasks were related to the task difficulty. Overall, we found the pupil diameter can be employed to objectively measure task workload in goal-directed movements, by conducting three experiments of discrete and continuous target-point tasks and a study of real-life motor task. The findings constitute the foundation for developing methods to objectively and quantitatively evaluate task workload of motor tasks using pupil diameter, and have a variety of implications in enhancing psychophysiological interactions in human-centered HCI and evaluating mental workload in high skill-demanding domains such as driving, aviation, and surgery...|$|R

5000|$|The most crutial aspect for {{recovery}} {{in patients with}} severe hematomas is rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment. [...] Once the clot has been removed the intracranial pressure is monitored for several days. Conditions which are also monitored after surgery are seizures, clot accumulation, and infection. If complications do occur, sometime the hematoma needs to be re-drained. [...] Additional complications following a surgical or nonsurgical treatment may include temporary or permanent weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, memory loss, dizziness, headache, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, seizures, and/or brain herniation. [...] The most helpful predictors of the treatment outcome is the glasgow coma scale (GCS). This is a standardized <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> assessment of the neurologic status of the patient. GCS helps assess {{many different types of}} head injuries and predicts how a patient will recover following a hematoma. Factors such as elevated intracranial pressure, increased patients age, and abnormal GCS results lead to a poor prognosis. The mortality rate following a hematoma could be as high as 80% and survivors many not regain the same pre-injury function. [...] Subdural and epidural hematomas are serious injuries and recovery varies widely depending on the severity of the hematoma. [...] Severity depends on type and location of the injury, the size of the blood collection, and how quickly treatment is obtained. [...] Hence, {{it is difficult to determine}} when an athlete can return to sports after his/her injury. A variety of multidisciplinary people such as sports medicine physicians, neurologist/neurosurgeons, athletic trainers, coaches, and family require input. If an athlete is approved to return, he or she is required to complete asymptomatic at rest and with exertion. The athlete also has to clear a CT scan indicating the hematoma has entirely resolved. Lastly, the athlete needs to be slowly brought back into the sport with close monitoring to be sure the symptoms do not recur.|$|E
40|$|Pupillary {{reactions}} {{independent of}} light conditions {{have been linked}} to cognition for a long time. However, the light conditions can impact the cognitive pupillary reaction. Previous studies underlined the impact of luminance on pupillary reaction, but it is still unclear how luminance modulates the sustained and transient components of pupillary reaction – tonic pupil diameter and phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response.</b> In the present study, we investigated the impact of the luminance on these two components under sustained cognitive load. Fourteen participants performed a novel working memory task combining mathematical computations with a classic n-back task. We studied both tonic pupil diameter and phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> under low (1 -back) and high (2 -back) working memory load and two luminance levels (gray and white). We found that the impact of working memory load on the tonic pupil diameter was modulated by the level of luminance, the increase in tonic pupil diameter with the load being larger under lower luminance. In contrast, the smaller phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> found under high load remained unaffected by luminance. These results showed that luminance impacts the cognitive pupillary reaction – tonic pupil diameter (phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response)</b> being modulated under sustained (respectively, transient) cognitive load. These findings also support the relationship between the locus-coeruleus system, presumably functioning in two firing modes – tonic and phasic – and the pupil diameter. We suggest that the tonic pupil diameter tracks the tonic activity of the locus-coeruleus while phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> reflects its phasic activity. Besides, the designed novel cognitive paradigm allows the simultaneous manipulation of sustained and transient components of the cognitive load and is useful for dissociating the effects on the tonic pupil diameter and phasic <b>pupil</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E

The curve relating flash energy and <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was clearly divisible into two parts commensurate with the duplex character of the human retina. A similar dichotomy appears in curves relating response amplitude to response latency.

40|$|PURPOSE: Nonvisual light-dependent {{functions}} in humans are conveyed mainly by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which express melanopsin as photopigment. We aimed {{to identify the}} effects of circadian phase and sleepiness across 24 hours on {{various aspects of the}} <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> to light stimulation. METHODS: We tested 10 healthy adults hourly in two 12 -hour sessions covering a 24 -hour period. Pupil responses to narrow bandwidth red (635 ± 18 nm) and blue (463 ± 24 nm) light (duration of 1 and 30 seconds) at equal photon fluxes were recorded, and correlated with salivary melatonin concentrations at the same circadian phases and to subjective sleepiness ratings. The magnitude of pupil constriction was determined from minimal pupil size. The post-stimulus <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was assessed from the pupil size at 6 seconds following light offset, the area within the redilation curve, and the exponential rate of redilation. RESULTS: Among the measured parameters, the pupil size 6 seconds after light offset correlated with melatonin concentrations (P < 0. 05) and showed a significant modulation over 24 hours with maximal values after the nocturnal peak of melatonin secretion. In contrast, the post-stimulus <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> following red light stimulation correlated with subjective sleepiness (P < 0. 05) without significant changes over 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The post-stimulus <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> to blue light as a marker of intrinsic melanopsin activity demonstrated a circadian modulation.

40|$|A recent pupillometry {{study on}} adults with normal hearing {{indicates}} that the <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> during speech perception (cognitive processing load) is strongly affected {{by the type of}} speech masker. The current study extends these results by recording the <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> in 32 participants with hearing impairment (mean age 59 yr) while they were listening to sentences masked by fluctuating noise or a single-talker. Efforts were made to improve audibility of all sounds by means of spectral shaping. Additionally, participants performed tests measuring verbal working memory capacity, inhibition of interfering information in working memory, and linguistic closure. The results showed worse speech reception thresholds for speech masked by single-talker speech compared to fluctuating noise. In line with previous results for participants with normal hearing, the <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was larger when listening to speech masked by a single-talker compared to fluctuating noise. Regression analysis revealed that larger working memory capacity and better inhibition of interfering information related to better speech reception thresholds, but these variables did not account for inter-individual differences in the <b>pupil</b> <b>response.</b> In conclusion, people with hearing impairment show more cognitive load during speech processing when there is interfering speech compared to fluctuating noise. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E

This was achieved by using masker voices with either the same (female) gender as the target speech or different gender (male) and/or by spatially separating the target and masker speech using HRTFs. We assessed {{the relation between the}} signal-to-noise ratio required for 50 % sentence intelligibility, the <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> and cognitive abilities. We hypothesized that the <b>pupil</b> <b>response,</b> a measure of cognitive processing load, would be larger for co-located maskers and for same-gender compared to different-gender maskers. We further expected that better cognitive abilities would be associated with better speech perception and larger pupil responses as the allocation of larger capacity may result in more intense mental processing. In line with previous studies, the performance benefit from different-gender compared to same-gender maskers was larger for co-located masker signals. The performance benefit of spatially-separated maskers was larger for same-gender maskers. The <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was larger for same-gender than for different-gender maskers, but was not reduced by spatial separation. We observed associations between better perception performance and better working memory, better information updating, and better executive abilities when applying no corrections for multiple comparisons. The <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> was not associated with cognitive abilities. Thus, although both gender and location differences between target and masker facilitate speech perception, only gender differences lower cognitive processing load. Presenting a more dissimilar masker may facilitate target-masker separation at a later (cognitive) processing stage than increasing the spatial separation between the target and masker. The <b>pupil</b> <b>response</b> provides information about speech perception that complements intelligibility data. <br/...|$|E
