50|$|He made {{a careful}} {{study of the}} {{contemporary}} state of weights and measures before proposing reform in the British House of Commons on 5 February 1790. In France, Charles Maurice Talleyrand was pursuing similar goals with a unit of length based on the seconds pendulum, as was Thomas Jefferson in the US having been charged by President George Washington with measurement reform. Talleyrand had ambitions that France would establish itself at the centre of a new international measurement system that would {{form the basis of}} global trade and, on hearing of Riggs-Miller's initiative, proposed a tripartite collaboration. After some diplomatic manoeuvring by Talleyrand, the definitive <b>pendulum</b> <b>measurement</b> was agreed to take place in France. However, France's official approach for collaboration was then rejected by Foreign Secretary the Duke of Leeds. Riggs-Miller continued to campaign on the matter but, when parliament was dissolved in 1790, he was not re-elected. Ultimately, in 1791, the French National Assembly vetoed the pendulum in favour of the meridional definition of the metre, bringing an effective end to hopes of collaboration. France unilaterally adopted the metric system in 1793.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 After {{more than}} 200 years, the torsion balance/pendulum {{is still one}} of the most precise means for {{measuring}} weak, macroscopic-range forces. Historically, two primary measurement techniques have been developed for this instrument. In one, the signal is the equilibrium angular displacement of the pendulum resulting from the presence of an external torque. In the other, this torque is detected by the associated fractional change in the natural frequency of torsion oscillations. Both techniques have been refined to the point that some experiments are now limited by temporal variations in torsion fiber temperature, despite special efforts to insure temperature stability. We have devised and tested another torsion <b>pendulum</b> <b>measurement</b> technique for which the effect of fiber temperature variations is suppressed by more than four orders of magnitude. Our observable is the amplitude of the second harmonic of the pendulum motion. A data set of 10 runs, each approximately 3 days in duration, using a magnesium/beryllium composition-dipole pendulum yielded a variation in the second harmonic amplitude of 0. 29 +/- 0. 47 nanoradians which corresponds to a differential acceleration between the magnesium and beryllium of 2. 5 +/- 4. 0 x 10 [...] 12 cm/sec 2. This new technique suggests that a continued improvement in the precision of these fundamental physics experiments may be realized with a moderately high Q, room-temperature apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{under this}} contract {{can be divided}} into two main areas: hypervelocity (in the range up to 7 km/s) and high velocity (less than 1 km/s). Work in the former was performed at NASA-MSFC using the Light Gas Gun Facility. The lower velocity studies were conducted at Auburn University using the ballistic gun. The emphasis of the project was on the hypervelocity phenomenon especially in the characterization of the debris cloud formed by the primary impact events. Special devices were made to determine the angular distributions of momentum and energy of the debris cloud as a function of impact conditions. After several iteration processes, it was decided to concentrate on the momentum effort. Prototype devices were designed, fabricated, and tested. These devices were based on the conservation of momentum. Distributions of the debris cloud formed were measured by determining the amount of momentum transferred from the debris cloud to strategically placed <b>pendulum</b> <b>measurement</b> devices. The motion of the pendula was monitored using itegrated opto-interrupters. The distribution of momentum in the debris cloud was found to be a strong function of the impact condition. Small projectiles at high velocities were observed to produce finely dispersed debris whereas large projectiles generated discrete particles in the debris. Results also show that the momentum in the forward direction was enhanced due to the impact. This phenomenon of momentum multiplication was also observed in other studies and in computer simulations. It was initially planned to determine the energy distribution using deformation energy in a rod with strain gauges. Results from preliminary studies show that this technique is acceptable but too tedious. A new technique was explored based on measuring the heating effect of the debris cloud using an IR camera. The feasibility and sensitivity was established at Auburn University. This type of energy distribution measurement method can easily be adapted to the gas gun facility at MSFC. The objective of the lower velocity studies at Auburn was to simulate the damage produced in advanced materials by the lower energy debris cloud...|$|E

40|$|An {{absolute}} gravity measurement {{was carried}} {{out for the first}} time at the class A absolute gravity station of International Absolute Gravity Basestation Network (IAGBN) in Syowa Station by the 33 rd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 33). A transportable absolute gravimeter, which adopts a symmetrical free rise-and-fall method (called Sakuma-type gravimeter) was used. In 1962,JARE- 6 carried out a gravity measurement at Syowa Station using a pendulum-type gravimeter. The gravity value which was obtained has been used as the reference gravity value at Syowa Station (69. 0 °S, 39. 6 °E). However, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>measurement</b> is not an absolute gravity measurement and the precision does not meet recent geodetic and geophysical standards. Moreover, the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics/International Association of Geodesy (IUGG/IAG) meeting has selected Syowa Station as one of the IAGBN stations. This station is going to be the reference point for relative gravity measurements around Syowa Station, and secular change of gravity will be detected by repeated absolute gravity measurements. Our absolute gravity measurement {{was carried out}} on the IAGBN station in the gravity observation hut which had been built by JARE- 32 (February 1991). The total number of measuring days was 15 during the period from January 4 to January 28, 1992. The adopted corrections for the data processing were as follows; (1) Earth tides reduction : The observed tidal parameters (OGAWA et al. : J. Geod. Soc. Jpn., 37, 13, 1991) were used. (2) Response to air pressure : The actual observed air pressure variations were used.

Fluctuations in the temperature difference across the enclosure surrounding the free-falling test mass can produce noisy forces through several processes, including the radiometric effect, radiation pressure, and outgassing.
