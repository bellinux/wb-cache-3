40|$|The work {{addresses}} the operational inefficiency {{problem in a}} semiconductor equipment manufacturing warehouse of Applied Material's Varian Semiconductor Business Unit. At Varian, the target <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> time from the warehouse to the production floor is 24 hours. However, during busy periods, parts are not delivered on time. Late <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> from the warehouse to the production floor could delay the machine laydown date, which in turn could result in late or missed shipment of tools to the customers, which can be very costly. To improve the efficiency and {{the reliability of the}} warehouse, picking efficiency is to be improved. Parts from the warehouse are picked from three picking locations- Vertical Lift Modules (VLMs), GL, and RK. VLMs are automated machines, while GL and RK are manual picking zones. Picking an order from GL takes the most amount of time. The overall picking efficiency at the warehouse can be improved by partially shifting the workload from GL to the VLMs, and by further improving the picking efficiency at the VLMs. The workload from GL to the VLMs is shifted by transferring fast moving parts from GL to the VLMs. The picking efficiency of the VLMs is improved by balancing the workload of all five VLM pods, and by employing a more efficient 'pick-and-consolidate' picking strategy. The workload at GL is decreased by 25 % and the workload at VLMs is increased by 13 %. Despite the increase in workload at VLMs, 23 % time savings could be achieved by balancing the utilization of all five VLM pods. Additional time savings of 20 minutes per order (8 %) could be achieved by using 'pick-and-consolidate' picking strategy over 'pick-and-pass' picking strategy. by Paramveer Singh Toor. Thesis: M.

40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{an operational}} inefficiency problem at a semiconductor equipment manufacturing warehouse, Varian Semiconductors Associates and Equipment (VSEA). This problem {{is important because}} if unresolved, the warehouse is unable to meet the <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> time target of 24 hours during the busy period. The downstream effects of the late <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> are delayed production schedules and in the worst case scenario, a missed shipment to the customer, which is very costly. In order to improve {{the efficiency of the}} warehouse so as to consistently deliver parts on time, the picking efficiency needs to be enhanced. Parts are primarily picked from two types of storage locations - GL shelves and Vertical Lift Modules (VLMs). The picking efficiency can be improved by the simultaneous reduction in workload on GL and improvement in the VLM picking efficiency. The first part of this thesis focuses on improving the picking inefficiency at the VLMs by employing a more efficient picking method. From our time study, we find that the pick-and-consolidate (parallel picking) is more efficient than pick-and-pass (sequential picking). The average makespan time savings per order by pick-and-consolidate is 8 % (20 minutes). The second part of this paper discusses what is required to maintain a high VLM picking efficiency. New metrics to measure the workload distribution of the VLMs and the average flow time per order are proposed. Three dynamic slotting methods that maintain a balanced workload distribution across the VLMs without the need for periodic review are also examined. The methods are evaluated based on how balanced is the workload distribution across the VLMs and the cost of implementation. by Hui Ni Grace Fong. Thesis: M.

40|$|In an {{automotive}} manufacturing system, {{material handling}} {{is a critical}} activity in terms of increasing system efficiency and reducing overall cost. Due to its higher efficiency and better safety, multi-dolly material handling systems are widely used to replace forklifts for <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> in assembly process. In order to support online multi-dolly material handling decision making, this study aims to estimate and predict the system performance using an efficient model, to develop dispatching & routing polices {{as well as the}} drivers’ working zones formation algorithm for multi-dolly system to achieve minimum material handling related cost. An integrated modeling approach is developed to mathematically describe a dynamic production system including production operation and material handling system. A modified max-plus algebra based model with “switching” mechanism is addressed to overcome the synchronization constraints of traditional max-plus properties, and to estimate the dynamic change of the system under various conditions such as starvation caused by material handling. The case study shows that the integrated modeling approach is accurate and efficient in predicting general assembly system dynamics. Based on the system dynamics derived from the max-plus modeling approach, several multi-dolly dispatching policies based on looking forward and penalty prediction are proposed to improve the performance of the material handling system, which outperform existing policies in both time and cost. The integrated model with VRPTW based routing strategy shows the potential to further reduce the material handling related cost. In general assembly systems, line-side buffers need to be carefully assigned to a limited number of material handlers for <b>part</b> <b>delivery,</b> which is referred to as drivers’ zoning assignment problem (DZA). To investigate the DZA problem and form initial zoning, DZA is formulated and solved by the sequential zoning assignment (SZA), which is developed based on the similarity between DZA problem and the PMS problem. Based on the initial zoning formation, meta-heuristic algorithm PSO has been implemented. The results from real working circumstances demonstrate that the 2 -stage approach performs effectively in solving large DZA problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grasping {{individual}} {{objects from}} an unordered pile {{in a box}} has been investigated in stationary scenarios so far. In this work, we present a complete system including active object perception and grasp planning for bin picking with a mobile robot. At {{the core of our}} approach is an efficient representation of objects as compounds of simple shape and contour primitives. This representation is used for both robust object perception and efficient grasp planning. For being able to manipulate previously unknown objects, we learn object models from single scans in an offline phase. During operation, objects are detected in the scene using a particularly robust probabilistic graph matching. To cope with severe occlusions we employ active perception considering not only previously unseen volume but also outcomes of primitive and object detection. The combination of shape and contour primitives makes our object perception approach particularly robust even in the presence of noise, occlusions, and missing information. For grasp planning, we efficiently pre-compute possible grasps directly on the learned object models. During operation, grasps and arm motions are planned in an efficient local multiresolution height map.

Next, a searching algorithm is utilized to yield all possible combinations of regions that can connect a starting point to a destination throughout the plant layout. Finally, physical paths are constructed by drawing line segments within the obstacle-free regions and through the intersections between the regions.

40|$|An {{optimization}} model is proposed to redesign {{the supply chain}} of spare <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> under demand uncertainty from strategic and tactical perspectives in a planning horizon consisting of multiple periods. Long term decisions involve new installations, expansions and elimination of warehouses and factories handling multiple products. It is also considered which warehouses should be used as repair work-shops in order to store, repair and deliver used units to customers. Tactical planning includes deciding inventory levels (safety stock and expected inventory) {{for each type of}} spare part in distribution centers and customer plants, as well as the connection links between the supply chain nodes. Capacity constraints are also taken into account when planning inventory levels. At the tactical level it is determined how demand of failing units is satisfied, and whether to use new or used parts. The uncertain demand is addressed by defining the optimal amount of safety stock that guarantees certain service level at a customer plant. In addition, the risk-pooling effect is taken into account when defining inventory levels in distribution centers and customer zones. Due to the nonlinear nature of the original formulation, a piece-wise linearization approach is applied to obtain a tight lower bound of the optimal solution.

40|$|Abstract—In {{systems of}} general {{assembly}} line with material handling, line-side buffers {{need to be}} carefully assigned to {{a limited number of}} material delivers (drivers) for <b>part</b> <b>delivery</b> to avoid production stoppage due to material shortage. Such a problem is referred to as Line-side Buffer Assignment Problem (LBAP). In this paper, we focus on fixed zoning version of LBAP. We formulate the problem, prove its NP-hardness, and propose an algorithm based on two structural characteristics of the LBAP problem–one being the analogousness between our problem and the Parallel Machine Scheduling (PMS) problem and the other being the monotonicity of the system throughput in the course of assigning line-side buffers to drivers. The developed algorithm globally converges with probability one when there exist feasible assignments. The algorithm is tested on a real system, and the results show that it is effective for solving the LBAP problem. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the needs to develop systematic methods to assign line-side buffers to a limited number of drivers in systems of general assembly line with material handling in automotive industry, such that the system throughput is maintained above a desired level. In practice, line-side buffers are typically assigned to drivers by the trial-and-error methods based on engineers ’ experience. In this paper, the fixed zoning version of the Line-side Buffer Assignment Problem (LBAP) is mathematically formulated. In order to solve the problem, two key structural characteristics of the problem are exploited and employed to design an algorithm. Numerical experiments on the real system show that the developed algorithm is effective for solving the LBAP problem. The flexible zoning version of the LBAP problem would be the future work.
