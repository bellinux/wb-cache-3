Also, the rings on the rotors could {{be put in a}} different order each day — for example, on one day the first rotor could be set at B, the next day at F, and so on.The military version of Enigma was provided with a <b>plug</b> <b>board,</b> like an old telephone switchboard. This allowed an extra switching of the letters, both before they entered the rotors and after leaving them. The <b>plug</b> <b>board</b> had 26 holes. Connections were made with wires and plugs.

5000|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, {{electro-mechanical}} machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, {{and a kind of}} [...] "additive" [...] substitution. In rotor machines, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while <b>plug</b> <b>boards</b> provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British Bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods.|$|R

A study by Lieutenant Henno Lucan, second radio officer on the battleship SMS Elsass, reported that the Naval Enigma met neither modern physical or cryptographic security. During this time, the Army (Reichswehr) suggested that the Navy use the Army Enigma. The Army's Enigma had the <b>plug</b> <b>board</b> (Enigma machine#Plugboard) which {{increased the number of}} enciphering circuits by 2 to 3 billion, and of course lost 5,213 starting positions.|$|E
50|$|The Fialka rotor {{assembly}} has 10 rotors mounted on an axle and a 30 by 30 commutator (Kc 30x30). The commutator {{consists of two}} sets of 30 contact strips set {{at right angles to}} each other. A punched card is placed between the two sets of contacts via a door on the left hand side of the unit. Each punched card has 30 holes, with exactly one hole per row and column pair, and thereby specifies a permutation of the 30 rotor contact lines. This feature is comparable to the <b>plug</b> <b>board</b> on the Enigma machine. A triangular plate was used to enter the null permutation for testing purposes.|$|E

Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles may include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.|$|E
50|$|Dilly Knox's {{last great}} cryptanalytical success before his {{untimely}} death in February 1943, was the breaking, in 1941, of the Abwehr Enigma. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter indicator sequence before the usual 5-letter groups {{led to the}} suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used. The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice. The machine itself was similar to a Model G Enigma, with three conventional rotors, though {{it did not have}} a <b>plug</b> <b>board.</b> The principal difference to the model G was that it was equipped with a reflector that was advanced by the stepping mechanism once it had been set by hand to its starting position (in all other variants, the reflector was fixed). Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed cycles (or boxes as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the Poles in the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Setting up {{a machine}} {{involved}} building a suitable network of linkages. According to one user, this {{was achieved by}} locating above the reading block, {{in contact with the}} tops of the matrix pins, a removable Y-shaped 'connection box' (equivalent to the Hollerith <b>plug</b> <b>board)</b> which was hard-wired [...] to the job. The box had at the base as many rods as were needed to read the positions within the used data fields, so that, when forced down, appropriate features of the machine - printheads, counters or control links were physically set as a reaction to the moving tops of the connecting box rods. Thus while many connection wires were straight-through, some sensed holes needed to allow multiple actuation, while some multiple code-punching needed to be combined to achieve a single purpose. Designing the system, including setting up the tabulator, was the sales engineers job, while soldering the 'conn-box' forest of cranked rods to meet the design requirement was down to the skill of the Powers Engineer who was thus the doyen of the machine room.|$|E

Further success eluded him however. He crucially failed to identify the primary and most important weakness of the Enigma machine: the lack of fixed points (letters encrypting to themselves), due to the reflector, was missed.

40|$|A {{ground plane}} is a {{continuous}} conducting sheet, usually copper, which forms the bottom layer of a RF circuit board’s foundation. If you envision signals traveling in An RF board as propagating waves, it’s {{easy to understand}} {{the need for a}} ground plane. It forms the continuous common reference for propagation and impedance throughout the board. Those with experience prototyping audio and low speed digital circuits are no doubt familiar with the standard jumper boards with binding posts for power connections. Don’t use these for RF! Although they contain ground pins or traces, they lack the continuous conducting ground plane sheet which is essential at radio frequencies. And, their multi pin structure contains a host of unwanted stray reactances which can spell disaster at frequencies above a few MHz. Substrate The substrate forms the middle layer in the foundation. It can be made from a variety of dielectric materials, depending on the board’s intended frequency range and application. At {{the low end of the}} frequency and price range are fiberboard (G 10) and fiber epoxy series (FR 4) commercial board materials generally usable up to about 1 GHz, above which dielectric losses increase rapidly. Duroid and other trade name microwave board materials are usable at higher frequencies (and prices). Conductor The top layer of the board contains the copper traces that connect circuit elements. Layout and interconnection of these traces is critical at radio frequencies since every trace is a transmission line and every pad contains some inductance or capacitance-whether intended or otherwise. The importance of proper board layout is one of the key differences between low frequency and RF prototyping. Fig. 1. This type of <b>plug</b> <b>board</b> is suitable for prototyping bias networks and audio amplifiers. Don’t try to use it for RF. Signal Routin...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using <b>plug</b> <b>board,</b> punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|E
