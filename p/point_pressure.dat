25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little <b>point</b> <b>pressure.</b> This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
25|$|The lip angle {{determines the}} amount of support {{provided}} to the cutting edge. A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under {{the same amount of}} <b>point</b> <b>pressure</b> as a bit with a smaller lip angle. Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} distributions {{across the}} test model {{have historically been}} measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured {{by the use of}} pressure-sensitive paint, in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence of the paint at that <b>point.</b> <b>Pressure</b> distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of pressure-sensitive pressure belts, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the aerodynamic surface with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.|$|E

500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprises}} internal fuel tanks {{located in the}} wings and fuselage with a capacity of they are refuelled through a single <b>point</b> <b>pressure</b> refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One [...] drop tank can be mounted on the aircraft's centerline hardpoint under the fuselage and two 800-litre or [...] drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints. The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refuelling (IFR), allowing tanker aircraft to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly. All production aircraft for the PAF are to be fitted with IFR probes. In June 2013, PAF Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt said ground tests on the JF-17's refuelling probes had been successfully completed and the first mid-air refuelling operations would commence that summer.|$|E
