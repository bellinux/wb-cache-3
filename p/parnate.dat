40|$|The {{process of}} epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) which {{is required for}} cancer cell invasion is regulated by a family of E-box binding transcription repressors which include Snail (SNAI) and Slug (SNAI 2). Snail appears to repress {{the expression of the}} EMT marker E-cadherin by epigenetic mechanisms dependent on the interaction of its N-terminal SNAG domain with chromatin modifying proteins including lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1 /KDM 1 A). We assessed whether blocking Snail/Slug-LSD 1 interaction by treatment with <b>Parnate,</b> an enzymatic inhibitor of LSD 1, or TAT-SNAG, a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the SNAG domain of Slug, suppresses the motility and invasiveness of cancer cells of different origin and genetic background. We show here that either treatment blocked Slug-dependent repression of the E-cadherin promoter and inhibited the motility and invasion of tumor cell lines without any effect on their proliferation. These effects correlated with induction of epithelial and repression of mesenchymal markers and were phenocopied by LSD 1 or Slug down-regulation. <b>Parnate</b> treatment also inhibited bone marrow homing/engraftment of Slug-expressing K 562 cells. Together, these studies support the concept that targeting Snail/Slug-dependent transcription repression complexes may lead to the development of novel drugs selectively inhibiting the invasive potential of cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDemethylation of histone H 3 lysine 4 {{is carried}} out by BHC 110 /LSD 1, an enzyme with close {{homology}} to monoamine oxidases (MAO). Monoamine oxidase A or B are frequent targets of selective and nonselective small molecular inhibitors used for treatment of depression. Here we show that in contrast to selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as pargyline, nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors potently inhibit nucleosomal demethylation of histone H 3 lysine 4. Tranylcypromine (brand name <b>Parnate)</b> displayed the best inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of less than 2 μM. Treatment of P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells with tranylcypromine resulted in global increase in H 3 K 4 methylation as well as transcriptional derepression of two BHC 110 target genes, Egr 1 and the pluripotent stem cell marker Oct 4. These results attest {{to the effectiveness of}} tranylcypromine as a small molecular inhibitor of histone demethylation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Histone modifications, such as {{acetylation}} and methylation, {{are important}} epigenetic marks that regulate diverse biological processes that use chromatin as the template, including transcription. Dysregulation of histone acetylation and methylation {{leads to the}} silencing of tumor suppressor genes and contributes to cancer progression. Inhibitors of enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of these epigenetic marks thus have therapeutic potential for treating cancer. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) is the first discovered histone lysine demethylase and, {{with the help of}} its cofactor CoREST, specifically demethylates mono- and dimethylated histone H 3 lysine 4 (H 3 -K 4), thus repressing transcription. Because LSD 1 belongs to the family of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -dependent amine oxidases, certain inhibitors of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), including the clinically used antidepressant trans- 2 -phenylcyclopropylamine (PCPA; tranylcypromine; <b>Parnate),</b> are also capable of inhibiting LSD 1. In this study, we have further measured the kinetic parameters of the inhibition of LSD 1 by PCPA and determined the crystal structure of LSD 1 -CoREST in the presence of PCPA. Our structural and mass spectrometry analyses are consistent with PCPA forming a covalent adduct with FAD in LSD 1 that is distinct from the FAD-PCPA adduct of MAO B. The structure also reveals that the phenyl ring of the FAD-PCPA adduct in LSD 1 does not form extensive interactions with active-site residues. This stud...|$|E
30|$|Introducing {{exogenous}} {{genetic material}} and altering the genome raise safety concerns (Barrilleaux and Knoepfler, 2011). Therefore, using small molecules to active endogenous TFs is an attractive method for cellular reprogramming. By high-throughput screening, BRD 7552 was shown to be an inducer of PDX 1 expression (Yuan et al., 2013). In another report, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5 -aza-dC was capable of increasing the expression of Ngn 3 in PANC- 1 cells (Lefebvre et al., 2010). In our previous study, we found that several specific small molecules could enhance the endodermal conversion process, including CHIR 99021, NaB, <b>Parnate,</b> RG 108, and 5 ’-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, and promote pancreatic β-like cell differentiation and maturation, including Compound E, Vitamin C, and Bayk 8644 (Zhu et al., 2016). More recently, Wang et al. described the derivation of human induced endodermal progenitor cells from gastrointestinal epithelial cells using a cocktail of defined small molecules, including Bayk 8644, BIX 01294, RG 108, and SB 431542, along with support from tissue-specific mesenchymal feeders (Wang et al., 2016). Induced endodermal progenitor cells could subsequently differentiate into more specified cell types, including pancreatic β-like cells. However, the therapeutic potentials of these pancreatic β-like cells have not been investigated so far. Obviously, using small molecules to replace master TFs as well as promote reprogramming to mature pancreatic β cells is a promising therapy for treating diabetes. However, transferring these findings for efficient in vivo pancreatic reprogramming, preferably be an all-chemical approach is waiting to be achieved in the future.|$|E
30|$|Compared with neurons, {{expandable}} and multipotent iNSCs are {{desirable for}} downstream applications, like disease modeling and drug screening. In {{the past few}} years, many groups reported the generation of iNSCs using neural lineage-specific TFs. These iNSCs are multipotent and can differentiate into functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo (Ring et al., 2012; Zhou and Tripathi, 2012). Recently, we achieved both mouse and human iNSC reprogramming by a cell-activation signaling-directed (CASD) strategy (Kim et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2015). The CASD strategy uses transient exposure of somatic cells to reprogramming factors (Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and c-Myc) in conjunction with soluble lineage-specific signals to reprogram cells into other cell types, such as iNSCs. Several interesting small molecules could promote OCT 4 -mediated iNSC reprogramming process, including A 83 - 01, CHIR 99021, NaB, Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), Rolipram and SP 600125 (Zhu et al., 2014 a). Furthermore, similar to iN reprogramming, there are also great advances in iNSC reprogramming by using small molecules alone. In 2014, Cheng and colleagues used three small molecules VPA, CHIR 99021, and RepSox to derive iNPCs from somatic cells (Cheng et al., 2014). More recently, Zhang et al. achieved more efficient mouse iNSC reprogramming by using a cocktail of nine components (CHIR 99021, LDN 193189, A 83 - 01, Retinoic acid (RA), Hh-Ag 1.5, RG 108, <b>Parnate,</b> SMER 28, and bFGF) (Zhang et al., 2016 a). They provided definitive evidence that these iNSCs could be reprogrammed from fibroblasts using a genetic lineage-tracing system. Interestingly, further mechanistic studies uncovered that these small molecules could gradually and specifically activate key neurogenic regulators, such as Sox 2, and then facilitated the neural cell fate transition.|$|E
30|$|All {{chemical}} induced pluripotent reprogramming {{can provide}} a promising paradigm for cell fate transitions. In 2013, Hou et al. demonstrated successful reprogramming of mouse cells into iPS cells {{for the first time}} by using a novel cocktail of seven small molecules, including VPA, CHIR 99021, E 616452, Tranylcypromine, Forskolin, 3 -deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), and TTNPB (Hou et al., 2013). Further refinement of this all-chemical reprogramming led a 1000 -fold greater efficiency with additional small molecules, including AM 580, EPZ 004777, SGC 0946, and 5 -aza- 2 -deoxycitidine (5 -aza-dC) (Zhao et al., 2015 b). Interestingly, chemical induced pluripotent reprogramming process required the early formation of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN)-like cells and a late transition from XEN-like cells to iPSCs, which fundamentally distinct from the pathway of TF-induced pluripotent reprogramming. However, it is still largely unknown how small molecules activate the endogenous gene regulation network, and gradually enable cell fate transitions. The remaining question is obvious: how to achieve chemical induced pluripotent reprogramming of human cells? We previously made some progress and reported that a chemical cocktail of Sodium butyrate (NaB), <b>Parnate,</b> PS 48, CHIR 99021, A 83 - 01 and PD 0325901 enabled OCT 4 -induced reprogramming of human primary somatic cells (Zhu et al., 2010). These human OCT 4 -only iPSCs were pluripotent and could give rise to cells of all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is an important step in iPSC reprogramming. More efforts are required to identify chemical substitutes for OCT 4 in human cell reprogramming. The demonstration of human pluripotent reprogramming by an all-chemical approach will greatly benefit the study of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.|$|E
30|$|Small {{molecules}} {{can potentially}} replace TFs {{and provide a}} novel approach for cardiac reprogramming. Interestingly, the addition of TGF-β inhibitor SB 431542 or A 83 - 01 improved the efficiency of iCM generation (Fu et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015 a). Other small molecules, including Y- 27632, JAK inhibitor I, LY- 364947, SD- 208 and GW 788388, did also enhance cardiac reprogramming (Lalit et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015 a, b). Tamakawa et al. showed that adding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2, FGF 10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to GMT enhanced cardiac reprogramming about 100 -fold compared with GMT only (Yamakawa et al., 2015). Wang et al. identified a small molecule cocktail, including CHIR 99021, SB 431542, <b>Parnate,</b> and Forskolin, that enabled efficient conversion of mouse fibroblasts into iCMs with Oct 4 alone employing the CASD paradigm. These iCMs spontaneously contracted and exhibited a ventricular phenotype (Wang et al., 2014). Recently, there have been significant achievements in cardiac reprogramming by using small molecules alone. Fu et al. showed that a chemical cocktail (CHIR 99021, RepSox, Forskolin, and VPA) could induce beating clusters of cardiac cells from mouse fibroblasts. Other small molecules, including ICARIIN, PD 169316 and Rolipram also increased the efficiency of cardiac reprogramming (Fu et al., 2015). Nan et al. showed that human iCMs could be generated from fibroblasts by {{a specific set of}} small molecules (Cao et al., 2016). This combination of nine compounds was termed 9 C, including CHIR 99021, A 83 - 01, BIX 01294, AS 8351, SC 1, Y- 27632, OAC 2, SU 16 F, and JNJ 10198409. Remarkably, at both transcriptome and epigenetic levels, these human iCMs resembled human cardiomyocytes. The authors observed enrichment of H 3 K 4 me 3 as well as H 3 K 27 ac, and decrease of H 3 K 27 me 3 on a cohort of heart developmental genes during 9 C-induced cardiac reprogramming. Mechanistically, 9 C treatment epigenetically and transcriptionally activated key cardiac developmental genes and facilitated the cardiac fate transition. Interestingly, unlike human iCMs from TF-based reprogramming, these human 9 C-induced iCMs uniformly contracted. More efforts are required to apply this chemical cardiac reprogramming approach to patient cells.|$|E
30|$|In 2006, {{the first}} {{generation}} of iPSCs were derived by using four transcription factors (Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and c-Myc, termed OSKM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). During the last 10  years, substantial efforts have been made to improve the efficiency and safety of iPSC reprogramming by non-integrating viral vectors, synthetic RNAs, recombinant proteins and small molecules (Gonzalez et al., 2011). Particularly, screenings have been applied to identify chemical compounds that can replace individual or multiple Yamanaka factors. Ichida et al. carried out a high-content chemical screening and identified RepSox (also named as E 616452, an ALK 5 inhibitor) as a chemical replacer of Sox 2 (Ichida et al., 2009). The authors suggested that RepSox promoted the completion of reprogramming through induction of Nanog. In addition, RepSox possibly promoted mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during the early phase of reprogramming (Li et al., 2010). Using a Nanog-Luciferase reporter as readout, Kenpaullone was found to functionally replace Klf 4 in the presence of OSM (Lyssiotis et al., 2009). Shi et al. found that the combination of BIX 01294 and Bayk 8644 or BIX 01294 and RG 108 enabled OK-induced reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts, and Li et al. further reported successful OK-reprogramming of human somatic cells by using CHIR 99021 and Tranylcypromine (also named <b>Parnate)</b> (Li et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2008). Huangfu et al. reported that Valproic acid (VPA) could promote OS-induced reprogramming of human fibroblasts (Huangfu et al., 2008). Taken together, these studies demonstrated that epigenetic regulators play important roles in iPSC reprogramming. Subsequently, several groups have focused on Oct 4 -only reprogramming by employing different chemical cocktails. Chen et al. found that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) could support efficient mouse Oct 4 -alone reprogramming partly through the promotion of MET (Chen et al., 2011). Interestingly, Yuan et al. reported that AMI- 5 and A 83 - 01 enabled Oct 4 -induced reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts. Remarkably, these Oct 4 -only iPSCs were truly pluripotent and could give rise to live-born pups by tetraploid complementation assay (Yuan et al., 2011). Furthermore, Li et al. identified a specific chemical combination, including VPA, CHIR 99021, E 616452 and Tranylcypromine, which was sufficient to reprogramming mouse fibroblasts to iPSCs with Oct 4 alone (Li et al., 2011). Subsequently, some interesting chemical substitutes of Oct 4 in mouse iPS-reprogramming were identified, including Forskolin, D 4476, and 2 -Methyl- 5 -hydroxytryptamine (2 -Me- 5 -HT) (Hou et al., 2013).|$|E
