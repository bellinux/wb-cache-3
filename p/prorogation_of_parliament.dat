5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E

25|$|Member of Parliament John H. Bryden {{put forward}} an {{amendment}} that would remove the sovereign from the oath altogether: In pledging allegiance to Canada, I take my place among Canadians, a people united by God whose sacred trust is to uphold these five principles: equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights, {{and the rule of}} law. Bryden's proposal was defeated in a vote of 189 to 31, and Bill C-63 itself never received Royal Assent; after approval by the House of Commons and a second reading in the Senate, the bill was under consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when a federal election was called, resulting in the bill's demise on the Order Paper. Subsequent Bills C-16 (2000) and C-18 (2002) also proposed the same changes to the Oath of Citizenship; the former also died on the Order Paper due to the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament,</b> while the latter never made it past second reading in the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|The {{option of}} prorogation (ending the {{parliamentary}} session without dissolving parliament {{in advance of}} new elections) presented various possible scenarios: One was a long-term prorogation, lasting up to a legal maximum of one year, while another was a short prorogation period lasting {{a few weeks to}} a few months. Each would delay any parliamentary activity, including the registering of a motion of non-confidence, and the Conservative government would therefore continue, though without new funding, which requires parliamentary approval. After discussions with the Governor General, Harper advised the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> until January 26, 2009, with the Cabinet scheduled to present the budget the following day. On December 3, Dion wrote to the Governor General with his opinion that she must refuse the prime minister's advice to prorogue parliament as, in his opinion, it would be an abuse of power denying the right of the legislature to give or withhold its confidence in the government. He also suggested that the government had already, in effect, lost the confidence of the House of Commons and that Harper was therefore incompetent to tender official advice as prime minister.|$|E
500|$|Even before Cartier's death, Macdonald {{attempted}} to use delay to extricate the government. The Opposition responded by leaking documents to friendly newspapers. On 18 July, three papers published a telegram dated August 1872 from Macdonald requesting another $10,000 and promising [...] "it {{will be the}} last time of asking". Macdonald was able to get a <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> in August by appointing a Royal Commission to look into the matter, but when Parliament reconvened in late October, the Liberals, feeling Macdonald could be defeated over the issue, applied immense pressure to wavering members.|$|E

50|$|The {{move and}} its {{packaging}} as a confidence motion prompted the Liberals and the NDP {{to take steps}} toward forming a coalition government in the event the confidence motion was defeated.

500|$|With the {{addition}} to the conspiracy of Thomas Percy (John Wright's brother-in-law), the five plotters met at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London, on 20 May 1604. [...] From hereon Thomas Wintour remained {{at the heart of}} the conspiracy. [...] The group leased properties in London, one in Lambeth for storing the gunpowder that was rowed across the Thames to its destination. [...] His confession has the plotters digging a tunnel toward their target during one <b>of</b> the several <b>prorogations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> abandoned when the chamber directly beneath the House of Lords became available.|$|R
2500|$|In late 2008, the Governor General had {{to return}} to Canada {{in the midst of a}} state visit in Europe to contend with a {{parliamentary}} dispute, as a coalition of three opposition parties in parliament threatened to rescind their confidence in the Cabinet under the leadership of Stephen Harper and subsequently form the government. After two and half hours of deliberation, Jean chose to follow the constitutional precedent of accepting her prime minister's advice, which was to prorogue parliament until late January 2009. At the end of Jean's viceregal tenure, Peter H. Russell, one of the constitutional experts from whom Jean sought advice, disclosed that the Governor General granted the prorogation on two conditions: parliament would reconvene soon and, when it did, the Cabinet would produce a passable budget. This, Russell said, set a precedent that would prevent future prime ministers from advising the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> [...] "for any length of time for any reason." [...] Jean thus prevented the approaching non-confidence vote, as well as a resulting situation wherein she would be required to choose between asking the coalition to form a government or dissolving parliament and dropping the writs, after having a federal election only six weeks earlier. Along with the subsequent <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> in December 2009 and the earlier calling of an election in October 2008, Jean was for almost two years part of a controversy in the Canadian media that focused on the constitutional relationships between the governor general and the prime minister or the leaders of the parties in opposition.|$|E
2500|$|A Parliamentary session concludes {{in one of}} two ways. First, the President, on Cabinet's advice, may [...] Parliament by {{proclamation}} in the Government Gazette. Prorogation has {{the effect}} of suspending the sitting of Parliament, but MPs retain their seats and it is not necessary for an election to be held. Uncompleted Parliamentary business is not affected by a prorogation, and is carried over from one session to the next. For instance, Standing Order 88(1) of the Standing Orders of Parliament states: [...] "A Bill before Parliament shall not lapse upon the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> and all business and proceedings connected therewith shall be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament and continue from the stage that it had reached in the preceding session." [...] The period between sessions is called a recess.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{at the same time}} said by Peter H. Russell, one of the {{constitutional}} experts from whom Jean sought advice, that Canadians ought not regard the Governor General's decision to grant Harper's request as an automatic rubber stamp; Russell disclosed that Jean granted the prorogation on two conditions: parliament would reconvene soon and, when it did, the Cabinet would present to parliament a proposed budget, a vote on which is automatically a matter of confidence. This, Russell said, set a precedent that would prevent future prime ministers from advising the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> [...] "for any length of time for any reason." [...] He in 2012 also speculated that, though it was likely not [...] "an overriding factor", Jean may have been concerned that, should she have refused Harper's advice, the vote of non-confidence proceeded and succeeded, and a new coalition cabinet was installed, the Conservative Party would launch a public campaign painting the new government and, by extension, the actions of the Governor General as illegitimate, creating [...] "a crisis of confidence in Canada’s political system." [...] Peter Hogg disagreed with Russell's supposition.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{appointment}} of academic David Johnston, former principal of McGill University and subsequently president of the University of Waterloo, there was a signalled emphasis for the Governor General to vigorously promote learning and innovation. Johnston stated in his inaugural address: [...] " [...] a society that innovates, embraces its talent and uses the knowledge of each of its citizens to improve the human condition for all." [...] There was also a recognition of Johnston's expertise in constitutional law, following the controversial <b>prorogations</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> in 2008 and 2009, which initiated some debate about the governor general's role as the representative of Canada's head of state.|$|R
25|$|Since the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> Northern Ireland in 1972, the Attorney General for England and Wales {{was also}} Attorney General for Northern Ireland.

Anderson was Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs from 26 October 1971 until 1972.|$|R
2500|$|In 1768 Lucas {{strongly}} opposed the scheme for the augmentation of the army, {{on the ground}} partly that he favoured {{the establishment of a}} national militia, but chiefly because in his opinion, [...] "Standing parliaments and standing armies have ever proved the most dangerous enemies to civil liberty." [...] In this year he caused considerable sensation by trying to institute a parliamentary inquiry into the case of a soldier whom he regarded as the victim of military discipline. His efforts in parliament proving unsuccessful, he published a pamphlet entitled A Mirror for Courts-Martial: in which the Complaints, Trial, Sentence, and Punishment of David Blakeney are examined. It is probably to his conduct on this occasion that Lord Townshend referred {{in a letter to the}} Marquess of Granby, [...] "Here is a Doctor Lucas, the Wilkes of Ireland, who has been playing the devil here and poisoning all the soldiery with his harangues and writings; but I have treated this nonsensical demagogue as he deserves, with his mob at his heels." [...] Lord Townshend's protest against the right of the Irish House of Commons to originate money bills, and his sudden <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> in December 1769 drew from Lucas early in 1770 a pamphlet entitled The Rights and Privileges of Parliament asserted upon constitutional Principles. It was announced in the newspapers that an answer, [...] "published by authority," [...] entitled The Usage of holding Parliaments and of preparing Bills of Supply in Ireland, stated from Record, would shortly appear. The book appeared on the day announced, but was instantly suppressed. A copy, however, came into Lucas's possession, and finding that it told more against than for the government he immediately republished it, with a sarcastic introduction and commentary.|$|E
6000|$|In {{one most}} {{unexpected}} quarter {{the same idea}} has been endorsed.

60|$|A month {{had nearly}} elapsed since the Montfort ball; {{the season was}} over and the session was nearly finished. The {{pressure}} of parliamentary life for those in office is extreme during this last month, yet Endymion would have contrived, were it only for a day, to have visited his sister, had Lady Roehampton much encouraged his appearance. Strange as it seemed to him, she did not, but, on the contrary, always assumed that the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> would alone bring them together again.

6000|$|The Commons {{instantly}} resolved on stern measures.

Besides committing Crosby and Oliver to the Tower, the House summoned the Lord Mayor's clerk to attend with his books, and then and there forced him to strike out the record of the recognisances into which their messenger had entered on being committed at the Mansion House. No Stuart ever did anything more arbitrary and illegal. The House deliberately intended to constitute itself, as Burke had said two years before, an arbitrary and despotic assembly.

50|$|After {{serving with}} the British Army in Dunkirk and Burma, {{he was an}} Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) member of Belfast City Council from 1955 to 1972.

50|$|In 1541-2, he {{was elected}} sheriff of the City of London.

The King, Henry VIII, took the side of the House of Commons in this case of member's privilege; however, he showed favour to Hill shortly after the affair by knighting him on 18 May 1542.

60|$|I here present your Highness {{with the}} fruits of a very few leisure hours, stolen from the short {{intervals}} of a world of business, and of an employment quite alien from such amusements as this; the poor production of that refuse of time which has lain heavy upon my hands during a long <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> a great dearth of foreign news, and a tedious fit of rainy weather. For which, and other reasons, it cannot choose extremely to deserve such a patronage as that of your Highness, whose numberless virtues in so few years, make the world look upon you as the future example to all princes. For although your Highness is hardly got clear of infancy, yet has the universal learned world already resolved upon appealing to your future dictates with the lowest and most resigned submission, fate having decreed you sole arbiter of the productions of human wit in this polite and most accomplished age.

60|$|Very {{shortly after}} the <b>prorogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament,</b> an {{incident}} occurred which materially affected the position of Endymion. Lord Roehampton had a serious illness. Having a fine constitution, he apparently completely rallied from the attack, and little was known of it by the public. The world also, at that moment, was as usual much dispersed and distracted; dispersed in many climes, and distracted by the fatigue and hardships they annually endure, and which they call relaxation. Even the colleagues of the great statesman were scattered, and before they had realised {{that he had been}} seriously ill, they read of him in the fulfilment of his official duties. But there was no mistake as to his state under his own roof. Lord Roehampton had, throughout the later period of his life, been in the habit of working at night. It was only at night that he could command that abstraction necessary for the consideration of great affairs. He was also a real worker. He wrote his own despatches, whenever they referred to matters of moment. He left to the permanent staff of his office little but the fulfilment of duties which, though heavy and multifarious, were duties of routine. The composition of these despatches was a source to Lord Roehampton of much gratification and excitement. They were of European fame, and their terse argument, their clear determination, and often their happy irony, were acknowledged in all the cabinets, and duly apprehended.|$|E
