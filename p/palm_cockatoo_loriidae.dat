50|$|The <b>palm</b> <b>{{cockatoo}}</b> is 55 to 60 cm {{in length}} and weighs 910 - 1200 g. It may be the largest cockatoo species and largest parrot in Australia, although large races of yellow-tailed black cockatoos and sulphur-crested cockatoos broadly overlap in size. It is a distinctive bird with a large crest and {{has one of the}} largest bills of any parrot (only the hyacinth macaw's is larger). This powerful bill enables <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> not only to eat very hard nuts and seeds, but also enables males to break off thick (about 1 in) sticks from live trees to use for a drumming display. The male has a larger beak than the female. The bill is unusual, as the lower and upper mandibles do not meet for much of its length, allowing the tongue to hold a nut against the top mandible while the lower mandible works to open it. The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> also has a distinctive red cheek patch that changes colour when the bird is alarmed or excited.|$|R
50|$|The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is {{distributed}} in rainforests and woodlands of New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia. It {{can still be}} found near Sorong, West Papua, Indonesia, where it is sometimes seen in trees along the roads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only member}} of the {{monotypic}} genus, Probosciger, the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> {{is a member of the}} white cockatoo subfamily Cacatuinae. Earlier limited genetic studies found it to be the earliest offshoot from the ancestors of what have become the cockatoo family.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> Probosciger aterrimus was studied for 3 years from July 1999 to February 2002 {{in and around}} Iron Range National Park, Cape York Peninsula, Australia. <b>Palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> were weakly seasonal breeders, with the peak of egg-laying occurring in September; 41 breeding attempts were monitored at 28 nesting hollows. Nearly all (27 / 28) nests were in tropical savanna woodland and an average distance of 320 m to rainforest. Males defended about four nest sites, only a subset of which were used for breeding. The typical active nest tree was in a near-vertical hollow with an opening that faced skywards; 62. 1 % of active nests were in living trees and the most common species of nest tree was Eucalyptus tetrodonta (48. 3 %). DNA fingerprinting revealed that some pairs reused the same nest hollow even when breeding attempts were separated by 1 {{or more years of}} no breeding activity, but that changes in hollow ownership also occurred. Nest usurpation, male territorial displays at the nest and evidence of interference competition by conspecifics suggest strong competition for nest sites, which is probably driven by variation in hollow quality and high investment in the nesting platform. Of active nests, 81 % failed to produce a fledgling, thereby ranking the breeding success of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> among the lowest reported for any species of parrot. They also invariably laid a single egg and seemed to breed infrequently, and thus they use an extremely slow life-history strategy. We suggest that this slow life history makes <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> on Cape York Peninsula sensitive to environmental perturbations, with fire being the most probable threatening process...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} individuals within a population is often essential for a detailed understanding of the ecology and conservation of a species. However, some species, including large parrots, are notoriously difficult to catch and mark for individual identification. <b>Palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (Probosciger aterrimus) are a large, poorly understood species of parrot which are likely in severe decline within the eastern part - and possibly the western part - of their range on Cape York Peninsula, Australia. Here, we investigated whether three different <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> call types are sufficiently individually distinctive {{to function as a}} non-invasive "marker" for identifying individuals over time. Using Discriminant Function Analysis, overall identification accuracy among 12 putative individuals for all call types was 81 % (i. e. 148 out of 183 calls were assigned to the correct individual) on the basis of multiple temporal, energy (amplitude) and frequency measurements on the spectrogram. For three different call types, individual identification accuracy among males and females ranged from 69 to 95 %. However, based on a limited sample sizes of five putative individuals between years, our data suggest that individual call structure, as quantified by call parameters, was not stable between years. We discuss the applicability of these results for future studies of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> and other parrot species...|$|R
50|$|Four {{subspecies}} are recognized, three poorly differentiated and one distinctive. The Cape York cockatoo (P. a. aterrimus), {{the larger}} goliath cockatoo (P. a. goliath), P. a. macgillivrayi, intermediate in size, {{and the northern}} <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> (P. a. stenolophus, similar to the goliath, but crest feathers are much narrower).|$|R
50|$|The <b>palm</b> <b>{{cockatoo}}</b> (Probosciger aterrimus), {{also known}} as the goliath cockatoo or great black cockatoo, is a large smoky-grey or black parrot of the cockatoo family native to New Guinea, Aru Islands, and Cape York Peninsula.

5000|$|According to Roger Bringas and Sheldon Dingle {{from the}} American Federation of Aviculture {{who visited the}} facility, [...] "some of BII's other notable successes have been {{breeding}} and hand rearing the Pesquet's parrot, the black <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> the guaiabero parrot and Victoria crowned pigeons to name but a few".|$|R
50|$|The YUS area {{provides}} {{habitat for}} 268 species of bird, 44 species of mammal and 26 species of frog.

Mammals include the common spotted cuscus, striped possum, small dorcopsis, Brown's pademelon and mountain cuscus.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> was {{originally}} described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788 as Psittacus aterrimus [...] Its specific name, Probosciger aterrimus, is from Latin proboscis, long thin nose + -ger, carry, and Latin superlative adjective for ater, black, hence a [...] "black bird {{with a long}} thin nose (beak)".|$|R
5|$|The ACT Government {{adopted the}} gang-gang {{cockatoo}} as its official faunal emblem on 27 February 1997. The short-lived budget airline Impulse Airlines featured a sulphur-crested cockatoo on its corporate livery (and aeroplanes). The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> {{which has a}} unique beak and face colouration, {{is used as a}} symbol by the World Parrot Trust.|$|R
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|R
50|$|The zoo has 95 Species Survival Plan projects, which {{includes}} threatened {{and endangered species}} and species of special concern. These include chimpanzees, Bornean orangutans, mandrills, siamangs, black-and-white colobus monkeys, golden lion tamarins, Indian rhinoceroses, clouded leopards, sloth bears, babirusa, red wolves, African elephants, Bali mynah, Victoria crowned pigeon, great Indian hornbills, <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> and Komodo dragon programs.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a unique}} {{territorial}} display where the bird (typically the male) drums with a large (i.e. up to 2.5 cm diameter, 15 cm long) stick or seed pod against a dead bough or tree, creating a loud noise that can be heard up to 100 m away. After drumming, the male occasionally strips the drum tool into small pieces to line the nest.. Although this drumming behaviour was discovered over two decades ago (in 1984 by G.A. Wood), the reason why <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> drum is still a mystery. One reason could be that females can assess the durability of the nesting hollow by the resonance of the drumming. Another possibility could be that males drum to mark their territory against other males. The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is an unusual bird, being an ancient species {{and one of the}} few bird species known to use tools.|$|R
50|$|The <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> often feeds {{during the}} early hours of the day on a diet that {{consists}} mostly of wild growing pandanus palm fruit and nuts from the kanari tree, Canarium australasicum. They have also been seen eating fruit from Darwin stringy bark Eucalyptus tetradonta and nonda tree, as well as seeds from the cocky apple tree, beach almond, and black bean tree.|$|R
50|$|The vocalizations of <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> {{are similar}} to those of most wild parrots, but they have also been shown to produce a variety of {{additional}} syllables in display and exchange with neighbouring individuals. These additional syllables are mainly produced by males and are often combined to form long, complex sequences. In a population in the Iron Range, 30 different syllables were distinguished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As an order, Parrots (Psittaciformes) {{are both}} the longest lived birds {{and among the}} most endangered. <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> (Probosciger aterrimus) have an {{extremely}} slow life history, including {{one of the lowest}} rates of breeding success reported for parrots. Here we use population viability analysis (PVA) to examine whether populations of <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> are viable in the long term with such low rates of reproduction. We built PVA models for two field sites with robust data on reproductive success and availability of nest-hollows: Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (Queensland, Australia) and Crater Mountain (Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea). Our Iron Range models incorporate a fluctuating resource base of nest-hollows resulting from natural losses from fire, wind and tree decay and natural replenishment through tree breakages in tropical cyclones. The number of females allowed to breed each year in the simulations was limited by the availability of hollows. Our Iron Range models suggest that the population is only viable if juvenile and adult mortality rates are very low, and that at least some birds in the population live to 100 years old. Based on known maximum lifespans in the Cacatuidae, we conclude that <b>Palm</b> <b>Cockatoos</b> at Iron Range are unlikely to live for long enough on average to support their low rates of reproduction, and highlight the possibility that the population may be in decline. At Crater Mountain, where nestlings are harvested for food by local people, the models suggest that the reported current rate of 40 % of nestlings taken is not sustainable...|$|R
50|$|Completed in July 2011, this Australian-themed {{section of}} the zoo brings you into the great Australian outback, which {{includes}} an Australian themed barn, and many Australian animals including double-wattled cassowary, laughing kookaburra, red-necked wallaby, common peafowl, and emu. The Australian aviary within this exhibit is home to birds such as rainbow lorikeet, red lory, cattle egret, chestnut teal, <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> woodland kingfisher, Nicobar pigeon, and budgerigar.|$|R
50|$|Examples are the tonal sound {{produced}} by the tail-feathers of the Anna's hummingbird Calypte anna, the drumming of the tail-feathers of the African snipe and common snipe, bill-clattering by storks or the deliberate territorial tapping practised by woodpeckers and certain members of the parrot family, such as <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> which drum on hollow trees using broken-off sticks. The clapper lark's (Mirafra apiata) display flight includes a steep climb with wing rattling.|$|R
50|$|The {{pool with}} Australian pelicans, swans, and ducks {{located near the}} entrance. Several large aviary and smaller bird cages host the zoo's bird collection, {{including}} Javan peafowl, Indian peafowl including the white one, Javan hawk-eagle, brahminy kite, white-bellied sea eagle, crested serpent-eagle, Bali starling, lesser bird-of-paradise, <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> common hill myna, flamingo, several kinds of hornbills, crowned pigeons, cockatoos, parrots, and pheasants. Large birds such as cassowary, emu, and ostrich are displayed in separate compounds.|$|R
50|$|Also {{present in}} the area are several birds whose Australian range is limited to the Cape York Peninsula, {{including}} <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> yellow-billed kingfishers, red-bellied pittas, trumpet manucodes, magnificent riflebirds, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, northern scrub robins, yellow-legged flycatchers, tropical scrubwrens and frill-necked monarchs. The endangered southern cassowary was recorded in Lockerbie Scrub in 1986 but is now probably extinct there. Bush stone-curlews, silver-crowned friarbirds and yellow honeyeaters have been recorded on rare occasions. Graceful honeyeaters are common. White-streaked honeyeaters are present.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|R
25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut to hold it in place. This behaviour is also shown by <b>palm</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|R
