5000|$|The opening episode {{received}} poor {{reviews from}} The Guardians Sam Wollaston who branded it [...] "lame, tired, predictable and uninteresting"; Christopher Hooton, of the Metro, who {{described it as}} a [...] "3-part disaster-piece" [...] and [...] "pretty much beyond repair"; and Paddy Shennan, in the Liverpool Echo, who described the actors as [...] "playing cardboard cutouts acting out a painful, pitiful pathetic and patronising plot". Writing in The Stage, Harry Venning praised the first ten minutes before adding that the goodwill they generated [...] "was squandered in the truly dreadful 50 minutes that followed". Tom Sutcliffe, in The Independent {{described it as a}} mis-scheduled childrens <b>programme,</b> <b>writing,</b> [...] "its hard to see Sugartown as anything else, so guileless is its plotting and so jauntily empty of threat are its characterisations." [...] Sutcliffe conceded {{that it was not a}} bad show of its type but doubted it would appeal to many, summarizing it as [...] "cocoa for the mind". Writing in The Herald, Alan Morrison judged that [...] "cliche is the stuff that Sugartown is made of" [...] but that its feel good simplicity was of a piece with Sunday night TV and that [...] "Sugartown is ready to wrap itself around viewers for the next two weeks like a snuggly blanket on the living-room sofa". In conclusion he stated that Sugartown [...] "won’t (and needn’t) do a whole lot more than satisfy the sweet tooth of a Sunday-night audience." [...] In The Scotsman, Paul Whitelaw, was scathing about the general type of cosy northern comedy dramas and Sugatown in particular. He compared it unfavourably with Victoria Wood and Ealing Comedy and finished by saying, [...] "Pastel-coloured in sugary shades of CBBC, it should be studiously avoided if youre lactose intolerant or simply intolerant of vacuous entertainment." ...|$|E
