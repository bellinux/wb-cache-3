5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (<b>PAR),</b> which was the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the <b>PAR</b> agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the <b>PAR</b> were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E

Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the hypophysis and the immunocharacteristics of the adenohypophyseal {{cells in}} the viviparous reptile Chalcides chalcides were studied by light microscopy, using conventional staining methods and an indirect antibody technique (ABC method), respectively. The general morphology of the C. chalcides hypophysis was {{comparable to that of}} other reptiles, showing three main regions: the <b>pars</b> distalis, the <b>pars</b> intermedia and the <b>pars</b> nervosa. The gland appeared as an elongated body in a cephalic-caudal direction and was almost completely enclosed in the sella turcica. For this reason, the hypophysis was studied in toto with the brain in decalcified specimens. The <b>pars</b> distalis accounted for most of the whole organ. The <b>pars</b> intermedia surrounded the <b>pars</b> nervosa as a goblet. The <b>pars</b> tuberalis was lacking. The immunohistochemical identification of the adenohypophyseal cells was performed using rabbit antisera against mammalian/ synthetic hypophyseal hormones. Prolactin cells were clustered in small cellular cordons in the rostral <b>pars</b> distalis and in the medial <b>pars</b> distalis in both male and female specimens. Somatotropic cells were found in the caudal <b>pars</b> distalis. Corticotropic cells were observed in the medio-rostral <b>pars</b> distalis, {{as well as in the}} <b>pars</b> intermedia, where melanotropic cells were also present. Melanotropic cells were confined to the <b>pars</b> intermedia. Gonadotropic cells were mostly distributed in the ventral and lateral portions of the <b>pars</b> distalis, where they were found isolated or in small clusters. Thyrotropic cells were detected in the <b>pars</b> distalis with a distribution similar to that of the gonadotropic cells; however, atypically, they were also found in the <b>pars</b> intermedia. Therefore, the cytological characteristics of the adenohypophyseal cells appeared mostly conserved...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{evidence}} for a factor secreted by bovine hypophyseal <b>pars</b> tuberalis that stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) release from rat <b>pars</b> distalis cells is shown. The secretion products of bovine <b>pars</b> tuberalis cells into the culture medium were assayed on dispersed rat <b>pars</b> distalis cells in 30 min incubations and superfusion experiments. The culture medium from <b>pars</b> tuberalis total cell populations, added at a dose of 6 &# 956;g per tube, induced the greater LH release from <b>pars</b> distalis cells, without effect on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release. After <b>pars</b> tuberalis cells separation on a discontinuos Percoll gradient, only the culture medium of cells from 50 and 60 % strength Percoll were able to release LH from rat <b>pars</b> distalis cells. Therefore, cell fractions from 50 and 60 % strenght Percoll were cultured together. To elicit maximal LH release (6 times the basal output), {{with the addition of}} 2 &# 956;g of <b>pars</b> tuberalis protein was required, suggesting that these cells produce the factor or factors which affect <b>pars</b> distalis gonadotrope cells. After applying the <b>pars</b> tuberalis culture medium on 12 % SDS-PAGE, the band with biological activity was that of 66 -kDal. Fifty ng protein of its eluate released almost 9 times the basal output of LH from <b>pars</b> distalis cells.
