On May 31, 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission requested that the Board of Estimate rescind the above resolution so that bids of construction alone might be asked for, and it authorized the preparation of the plans and contracts. On June 4, 1907, a resolution was passed by the Board of Estimate that authorized the Rapid Transit Commission that rescinded the resolution and authorized the Rapid Transit Commission to let out bids of construction only.

40|$|The {{notion of}} persistence, {{based on the}} rule "no action can disable another one" {{is one of the}} {{classical}} notions in concurrency theory. It {{is also one of the}} issues discussed in the Petri net theory. We recall two ways of generalization of this notion: the first is "no action can kill another one" (called l/l-persistence) and the second "no action can kill another enabled one" (called the delayed persistence, or shortly e/l-persistence). Afterwards we introduce a more precise notion, called e/l-k-persistence, in which one action disables another one for no longer than a specified number k of single sequential steps. Then we consider an infinite hierarchy of such e/l-k <b>persistencies.</b> We prove that if an action is disabled, and not killed, by another one, it can not be postponed indefinitely. Afterwards, we investigate the set of markings in which two actions are enabled simultaneously, and also the set of reachable markings with that feature. We show that the minimum of the latter is finite and effectively computable. Finally we deal with decision problems about e/l-k <b>persistencies.</b> We show that all the kinds of e/l-k <b>persistencies</b> are decidable with respect to steps, markings and nets...|$|R

The jump relation is based on a converse of Feferman's Theorem: if a sentence is interpretable over a theory U, it is, in a sense, an inconsistency statement over U. We introduce an antipode of the inconsistency statement the presistency statement. The jump relation allows one to 'jump' from <b>persistencies</b> to inconsistencies. We show that for a wide classes of theories U the jump relation coincides with interpretability over U and for an even wider class it coincides with Π 1 -conservativity over U. Thus, the jump relation provides a new way of looking at interpretability and Π 1 -conservativity. On the other hand, we will show that the jump relation admits variations that are distinct from interpretability and Π 1 -conservativity. We show that the jump relation satisfies the interpretability logic ILM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) {{problems}} {{concern the}} minimization of quadratic polynomials in n{ 0, 1 }-valued variables. These problems are NP-complete, but prior work has identified {{a sequence of}} polynomial-time computable lower bounds on the minimum value, denoted by C 2,C 3,C 4,…. It is known that C 2 can be computed by solving a maximum flow problem, whereas the only previously known algorithms for computing Ck(k> 2) require solving a linear program. In this paper we prove that C 3 can be computed by solving a maximum multicommodity flow problem in a graph constructed from the quadratic function. In addition to providing a lower bound on the minimum value of the quadratic function on { 0, 1 }n, this multicommodity flow problem also provides some information about the coordinates of the point where this minimum is achieved. By looking at the edges that are never saturated in any maximum multicommodity flow, we can identify relational persistencies: pairs of variables that must have the same or different values in any minimizing assignment. We furthermore show {{that all of these}} <b>persistencies</b> can be detected by solving single-commodity flow problems in the same network...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{demonstrate}} that the apparent length of a thin white arc on a black disk, rotating concentrically at 2. 5 rps, varies with angular length and exposure duration. While short arcs (9 – 18 °) gradually expand, long arcs (36 – 72 °) first undergo a brief contraction, before they also expand. On average, perceived elongation asymptotes after 15 s equivalent to visual <b>persistencies</b> ranging from 68 to 170 ms. Using bi- and tri-colored arcs, {{we find that the}} apparent increase in length derives from the rear end of the rotating stimulus, while the initial shrinkage derives from contraction of the middle. After 15 s of adaptation, perceived length of the arc decays to actual stimulus length within an average of 6 s and, upon re-exposure of the arc, reaches its former value after only 5 s (priming). When the rotating arc is presented first to one eye and then to the other, apparent elongation transfers partially (46 %), suggesting a contribution by the binocular cells in the visual cortex. A partial transfer (26 %) also occurs from clockwise to counterclockwise rotation. When tested interocularly, the directional transfer is more pronounced (47 %) and equals the interocular transfer under equidirectional conditions, suggesting that the directional transfer (cw versus ccw) might derive from non-directional cortical units. Whereas the initial contraction may be attributable to backward masking, the observed elongation likely reflects a cumulative build-up of after-discharge in cortical neurons over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{disciplinary}} {{emergence of}} the human sciences, specially Geography and Ethnology, has evolved, {{from the beginning of}} the century, alongside the formation of photographic collections and other figurative series inscribed in the construction of internationally comparable national representations, anchored on regionalism. In this article, Percy Laus drawings for the series Types and Aspects of Brazil, in a section of the Revista Brasileira de Geografia magazine from 1939 onwards, are compared to other iconographic views of modern Brazil in this case the photographs by Frenchmen Pierre Monbeig and Marcel Gautherot. A visual culture in the process of generalization is highlighted in the association of images in correlated series, at a moment when both the solo journey and the act of photographing ad become increasingly common and accessible practices. The convergence of representations by one same generation invites us to detect in the mise-en-serie the visual conventions and the documentary style parameters of one and the other, so that a synthesis of the imagistic thought of the era is arrived at. The images evidence geographically coincident figurative itineraries, resulting in representations that, by extension and repetition, become icons. The types and aspects of Percy Laus series and the texts accompanying it are inscribed within the Vidalian geography, one of the intellectual matrices of Brazilian geography, in its moment of institutionalization, during the Estado Novo period.

40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of the transformations and <b>persistencies</b> in the image­-power­-knowledge relationship that result from the spread of digital communication's technologies, our goal is to characterize the emergence of a conflict that, in the politics of visuality and the cyberspace's techno­political configuration, reflects similar tensions that constitute the actual power relations diagram. The research begins with an investigation of the historical background that influenced Thomas Hobbes Leviathan's images production, where a given visual order corresponds to a new power order. Then, we analyze the changes of this specific configuration – that is perceptible as the Leviathan image regime's metaphor - in face of the analog and digital image production technologies. Our hypothesis is that the disputes (aesthetic, legal, economic) that attempt to regulate the image within the digital media domain and that shape a particular politics of visibility, are similar to those tensions that affect the cyberspace conditions to become a different 'sensible' surface (medium), that potentially mobilizes other forms of knowing, other models of organization and production. To examine this issue, we analyze the ongoing conflict between different social forces that point out both for new practices and meanings that emerge in the cybercultural arena, and for the trends that attempts to impose over the digital medium the regulatory mechanisms established in the context of analog medium. At the end we characterize the current power diagram, and we argue that cyberspace aesthetic and political configuration depend upon a capacity to intervene over the very fundamentals that regulate its field of enunciation and visibility. Finally, we take it as a struggle for others modes of thought and social organization models, as a war over the virtual and imaginary production, therefore a war that is oriented to the future...|$|R
60|$|Character is doubtless of {{far more}} {{importance}} than mere intellectual opinion. We only too often see highly rationalised convictions in persons of weak purpose or low motives. But while fully recognising this, {{and the sort}} of possible reality which lies at the root of such a phrase as 'godless intellect' or 'intellectual devils'--though the phrase has no reality when it is used by self-seeking politicians or prelates--yet it is well to remember the very obvious truth that opinions are at least an extremely important part of character. As it is sometimes put, what we think has a prodigiously close connection with what we are. The consciousness of having reflected seriously and conclusively on important questions, whether social or spiritual, augments dignity while it does not lessen humility. In this sense, taking thought can and does add a cubit to our stature. Opinions which we may not feel bound or even permitted to press on other people, are not the less forces for being latent. They shape ideals, and it is ideals that inspire conduct. They do this, though from afar, and though he who possesses them may not presume to take the world into his confidence. Finally, unless a man follows out ideas to their full conclusion without fear what the conclusion may be, whether he thinks it expedient to make his thought and its goal fully known or not, it is impossible that he should acquire a commanding grasp of principles. And a commanding grasp of principles, whether they are public or not, is at the very root of coherency of character. It raises mediocrity near to a level with the highest talents, if those talents are in company with a disposition that allows the little prudences of the hour incessantly to obscure the persistent laws of things. These <b>persistencies,</b> if a man has once satisfied himself of their direction and mastered their bearings and application, are just as cogent and valuable a guide to conduct, whether he publishes them ad urbem et orbem, or esteems them too strong meat for people who have, through indurated use and wont, lost the courage of facing unexpected truths.|$|R

40|$|Objective: HPV {{infections are}} {{very common in}} women, only very few develop {{clinically}} relevant dysplastic lesions or even cancer. Some infected cases experienced spontaneous regression, and some showed persistent infection. On the other hand, cervical dysplasia that displays a certain persistent process from the normal to tumorigenic state in the tissues, is a precancerous lesion on the histopathological viewpoint. Unfortunately, long-term follow-up cases on HPV-infected uterocervixes are limited. In this study, patients with cervical dysplasia were monitored with the attempt of detecting the continuous changes in cervical lesions. Furthermore, treatments for the HPV-infected cases in progression group were attempted and progresses in these cases were observed. Materials and methods: We examined 573 women aged 16 - 81 who visited our Department of OB/Gyn between April 1992 and October 2002 for Papanicolaou Smear Testing and HPV examination. All the patients were divided into 3 groups. Progression group includes patients with developed process of cervical lesions, which were from smear ≦ Class II to mild dysplasia, or from mild to severe dysplasia, or from dysplasia to carcinoma in situ. Regression group consisted of patients with regression, or reducing from dysplasia to smear ≦ Class II or from severe to mild dysplasia. In the dysplasia cases, patients whose lesions persisted in one stage were classified in persistence group. Results: Of 206 women who were followed-up for 2 years, 118 (57. 3 %) were HPV-positive. Among these, the numbers {{of the three groups}} were 56 (47. 5 %) in regression group, 35 (29. 6 %) in persistence group, and 27 (22. 8 %) in progression group. Among 29 women infected with HPV- 16, their distribution in the three groups were 5 (17. 2 %), 12 (41. 4 %) and 12 (41. 4 %) respectively. Eighty-eight (42. 7 %) cases of 206 women were HPV-negative and their distribution in the three groups were 57 (64. 7 %), 26 (29. 5 %), and 5 (5. 7 %), respectively. Of the post-operation cases, 16 were followed-up and their HPV <b>persistencies</b> were reevaluated. Within these 16 cases, 14 were turned out to be HPV-negative and got a smear ≦ Class II.

40|$|While {{for many}} years two {{alternative}} approaches to building intelligent systems, symbolic AI and neural networks, have each demonstrated specific advantages and also revealed specific weaknesses, in recent years {{a number of researchers}} have sought methods of combining the two into a unified methodology which embodies the benefits of each while attenuating the disadvantages. This work sets out to identify the key ideas from each discipline and combine them into an architecture which would be practically scalable for very large network applications. The architecture is based on a relational database structure and forms the environment for an investigation into the necessary properties of a symbol encoding which will permit the singlepresentation learning of patterns and associations, the development of categories and features leading to robust generalisation and the seamless integration of a range of memory <b>persistencies</b> from short to long term. It is argued that if, as proposed by many proponents of symbolic AI, the symbol encoding must be causally related to its syntactic meaning, then it must also be mutable as the network learns and grows, adapting to the growing complexity of the relationships in which it is instantiated. Furthermore, it is argued that in order to create an efficient and coherent memory structure, the symbolic encoding itself must have an underlying structure which is not accessible symbolically; this structure would provide the framework permitting structurally sensitive processes to act upon symbols without explicit reference to their content. Such a structure must dictate how new symbols are created during normal operation. The network implementation proposed is based on K-from-N codes, which are shown to possess a number of desirable qualities and are well matched to the requirements of the symbol encoding. Several networks are developed and analysed to exploit these codes, based around a recurrent version of the non-holographic associati ve memory of Willshaw, et al. The simplest network is shown to have properties similar to those of a Hopfield network, but the storage capacity is shown to be greater, though at a cost of lower signal to noise ratio. Subsequent network additions break each K-from-N pattern into L subsets, each using D-from-N coding, creating cyclic patterns of period L. This step increases the capacity still further but at a cost of lower signal to noise ratio. The use of the network in associating pairs of input patterns with any given output pattern, an architectural requirement, is verified. The use of complex synaptic junctions is investigated as a means to increase storage capacity, to address the stability-plasticity dilemma and to implement the hierarchical aspects of the symbol encoding defined in the architecture. A wide range of options is developed which allow a number of key global parameters to be traded-off. One scheme is analysed and simulated. A final section examines some of the elements that need to be added to our current understanding of neural network-based reasoning systems to make general purpose intelligent systems possible. It is argued that the sections of this work represent pieces of the whole in this regard and that their integration will provide a sound basis for making such systems a reality...|$|R
