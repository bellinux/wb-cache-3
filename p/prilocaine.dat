25|$|Infants under 6 {{months of}} age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin {{reduction}} enzyme (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase) in their red blood cells. This results in a major risk of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water, dehydration (usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea), sepsis, or topical anesthetics containing benzocaine or <b>prilocaine.</b> Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak {{into the ground and}} may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically set to protect infants. Benzocaine applied to the gums or throat (as commonly used in baby teething gels, or sore throat lozenges) can cause methemoglobinemia.|$|E
25|$|In Peru, {{the ancient}} Incas are {{believed}} to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought {{to play a role in}} the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was isolated in 1860 and first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, bupivacaine in 1957, and <b>prilocaine</b> in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, <b>prilocaine,</b> bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E

2500|$|Met{{hemoglobin}}emia is {{a process}} where iron in hemoglobin is altered, reducing its oxygen-carrying capability, which produces cyanosis and symptoms of hypoxia. [...] Benzocaine, lidocaine, and <b>prilocaine</b> all produce this effect, especially benzocaine. The systemic toxicity of <b>prilocaine</b> is comparatively low, but its metabolite, o-toluidine, is known to cause methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. [...] Classical drug {{causes of}} methemoglobinaemia include {{antibiotics}} (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, and <b>prilocaine),</b> and aniline dyes, metoclopramide, rasburicase, [...] chlorates, and bromates. Ingestion of compounds containing nitrates (such as the patina chemical bismuth nitrate) {{can also cause}} methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{analgesia}} {{is generally}} recommended to avoid systemic side-effects. [...] Painful joints, for example, may {{be treated with}} an ibuprofen- or diclofenac-containing gel (The labeling for topical diclofenac has been updated to warn about drug-induced hepatotoxicity.); capsaicin also is used topically. [...] Lidocaine, an anesthetic, and steroids may be injected into painful joints for longer-term pain relief. [...] Lidocaine is also used for painful mouth sores and to numb areas for dental work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the blood stream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and <b>prilocaine</b> in a cream, ointment, or gel.|$|E

50|$|A topical spray {{consisting}} of an aerosol formulation of lidocaine and <b>prilocaine</b> was evaluated {{under the name}} PSD502 for use in treating premature ejaculation. The spray is applied on the penile skin prior to intercourse. While this formulation was not approved by the FDA, a similar product, Promescent, is available over-the-counter in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Felypressin is a non-catecholamine {{vasoconstrictor}} that is chemically {{related to}} vasopressin, the posterior pituitary hormone. It {{is added to}} some local anaesthetics such as <b>prilocaine</b> in a concentration of 0.03 IU/ml. Felypressin is a Vasopressin 1 agonist, and will thus have effects at all Arginine vasopressin receptor 1As. It will, however, have its main physiological effects on vascular SMC's due to the form {{in which it is}} administered.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prilocaine</b> (...) {{is a local}} {{anesthetic}} of {{the amino}} amide type first prepared by Claes Tegner and Nils Löfgren. In its injectable form (trade name Citanest), it is often used in dentistry. It is also often combined with lidocaine as a topical preparation for dermal anesthesia (lidocaine/prilocaine or EMLA), for treatment of conditions like paresthesia. As it has low cardiac toxicity, {{it is commonly used}} for intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA).|$|E
5000|$|EMLA. EMLA is {{a topical}} {{anesthetic}} cream {{that is a}} eutectic mixture of lidocaine and <b>prilocaine.</b> It is a prescription cream in the United States, and is available without prescription in some other countries. Although not as effective as iontophoresis, since EMLA does not penetrate as deeply as iontophoresis-driven anesthetics, EMLA provides a simpler application than iontophoresis. EMLA penetrates much more deeply than ordinary topical anesthetics, and it works adequately for many individuals.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{paper by}} the same authors, 19 {{reported}} paresthesia cases in Ontario for 1994 were reviewed, concluding {{that the incidence of}} paresthesia was 2.05 per million injections of 4% anesthetic drugs. Another follow up study by Miller and Haas published in 2000, concluded that the incidence of paresthesia from either <b>prilocaine</b> or articaine (the only two 4% drugs in the dental market) was close to 1:500,000 injections. (An average dentist gives around 1,800 injections in a year.) ...|$|E
50|$|Amide {{local anesthetics}} (e.g., lidocaine, <b>prilocaine,</b> bupivicaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, mepivacaine, dibucaine and etidocaine) are {{generally}} heat-stable, {{with a long}} shelf life (around 2 years). They have a slower onset and longer half-life than ester anesthetics, and are usually racemic mixtures, {{with the exception of}} levobupivacaine (which is S(-) -bupivacaine) and ropivacaine (S(-)-ropivacaine). These agents are generally used within regional and epidural or spinal techniques, due to their longer duration of action, which provides adequate analgesia for surgery, labor, and symptomatic relief.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{treatment of the}} underlying disorder, palliative care can {{include the use of}} topical numbing creams, such as lidocaine or <b>prilocaine.</b> Care must be taken to apply only the necessary amount, as excess can contribute to the condition. Otherwise, these products offer extremely effective, but short-lasting, relief from the condition.Paresthesia caused by stroke may receive some temporary benefit from high doses of Baclofen multiple times a day. HIV patients who self-medicate with cannabis report that it reduces their symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Separately, {{lidocaine}} and <b>prilocaine</b> {{are solid}} bases. When mixed in equal quantities by weight, however, {{they form a}} eutectic mixture - that is the melting point of the mixture {{is lower than the}} melting points of the individual components. The lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture is an oil with a melting point of 18°C, thus can be formulated into preparations without the use of a non-aqueous solvent. This allows higher concentrations of anaesthetic to be formulated into the preparation and maintained during application.|$|E
5000|$|Lidocaine/prilocaine {{eutectic}} mixture is marketed as a 5% oil-in-water emulsion incorporated in a cream base (EMLA cream) or a cellulose disk (EMLA patch). The cream is applied under an occlusive dressing, while the patch incorporates an occlusive dressing to facilitate absorption of lidocaine and <b>prilocaine</b> {{into the area}} where anaesthesia is required. Local dermal anaesthesia is achieved after approximately 60 minutes, whereupon the occlusive dressing (or patch) is removed. The duration of anaesthesia is approximately two hours following removal of the occlusive dressing.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that E. Fougera & Co., makers of the generic cream widely used in the United States as Lidocaine and <b>Prilocaine</b> Cream, 2.5%/2.5%, recommends different timing for application of the cream as well as length of anesthesia. They state the cream must be applied at least one hour before the start of a routine procedure and for two hours before the start of a painful procedure. Additionally, they state that the duration of effective skin anesthesia will be at least one hour after removal of the occlusive dressing.|$|E
5000|$|Procaine is used less {{frequently}} today since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and <b>prilocaine),</b> procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine {{for the purpose}} of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.|$|E

50|$|Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is {{the local}} {{anaesthetic}} most commonly used, although lidocaine (lignocaine), tetracaine, procaine, ropivacaine, levobupivicaine, <b>prilocaine</b> and cinchocaine may also be used. Commonly opioids are added to improve the block and provide post-operative pain relief, examples include morphine, fentanyl, diamorphine or buprenorphine. Non-opioids like clonidine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension). In the United Kingdom, since 2004 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section is supplemented with intrathecal diamorphine and this combination is now the modal form of anaesthesia for this indication in that country. The peculiar legal status of diamorphine (heroin) means that this cannot easily occur elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{analgesia}} {{is generally}} recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.
