500|$|Boren {{had been}} {{recruited}} {{as either a}} center or a guard, but he preferred to play guard. In spring practice the following year, Boren was moved to center. [...] At {{the end of the}} National Collegiate Athletic Association-sanctioned 15 days of spring football practice, he was announced as the starting center, replacing Mark Bihl. [...] This decision was confirmed when training camp started in the fall, even though Boren had never before played center. [...] Thus, the starting offensive line was composed of veterans Long and Adam Kraus on the left and then Boren, right guard Jeremy Ciulla and right tackle Stephen Schilling neither of whom had ever started a game. The 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season was eagerly anticipated for the 2007 Wolverines with returning seniors Long, Mike Hart and Chad Henne in key roles, but the season quickly began to fall apart when the team lost to the two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers in the opening game. When Ryan Mallett played in place of Henne during the September 15, Notre Dame rivalry game, left-handed snapper Boren switched positions with right-handed snapper Kraus who otherwise played left guard. [...] The switch occurred after Mallett fumbled two snaps from Boren, whose left-handed snaps were foreign to the right-handed Mallett. The switch caused a little confusion with official starting lineups the following week when Mallett started. [...] On September 22 against Penn State, both Boren and Kraus had casts on their snapping hands and Boren played center despite the fact that Mallett was starting. During Mallett's October 27 start in the Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota, Kraus started at center. [...] The following week during the Paul Bunyan Trophy against Michigan State, the <b>position</b> <b>switch</b> was made permanent. After the regular season, Boren was recognized as an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection. Prior to the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Boren was expected to return to center because Henne had returned to full strength. However, during the game, Boren played guard and Kraus played center. [...] After the season, both Boren and Kraus were named to Jewish Sports Reviews 2007 College Football All-America Team.|$|E

50|$|Away {{from the}} plane in those regions where {{only one or two}} {{relatively}} narrow CO lines are found, frequency-switching by 10-20 MHz at a rate of 1 Hz was often used instead of <b>position</b> <b>switching.</b> Since spectral lines remain within the range of the spectrometer in both phases of the switching cycle, data could be obtained twice as fast as with <b>position</b> <b>switching,</b> although higher order polynomials, typically 4th or 5th order, were required to remove the residual baseline. A telluric emission line from CO in the mesosphere, variable in both intensity and LSR velocity, is detected in frequency-switched spectra; because the LSR velocity of the line could be predicted exactly, blending with Galactic emission could be avoided by appropriate scheduling of the observations. In a few cases of large surveys (e.g., Taurus and Orion) a model of the telluric line was fit daily to spectra free of Galactic emission and used to remove the line from all spectra.|$|R

50|$|Only {{three years}} after the playing <b>position</b> <b>switch,</b> van Dijk made his goalkeeping debut in Feyenoord's first team.

Phillip Cocu scored the penalty kick and became the first player to score against van Dijk on professional level. Van Dijk had his highlight two years after his debut: on 30 November 1994, he replaced the injured de Goey in the cup contest against Willem II (1-1 aet), performing well enough to earn Man of the match accolades, after a penalty shootout.|$|E

During the split second of the power transfer the flow of electricity is interrupted.

50|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year in 2016, Elflein handled a <b>{{position}}</b> <b>switch,</b> moving from guard to the center position as a fifth-year senior, with aplomb, starting all 13 games for the Buckeyes. He ended up garnering the Rimington Trophy as the nation’s top center and helping Ohio State make the College Football Playoff semifinals. Elflein also {{was one of three}} finalists for the Outland Trophy and won the Pace Big Ten Offensive Linemen of the Year. Elflein was named the Rimington-Pace Offensive Lineman of the Year and was a First Team All-Big Ten selection in 2016.

50|$|Other {{changes over}} the Tekken 4 design {{included}} {{the removal of}} the positional change techniques (throws became once again controlled by combinations of LP+LK or RP+RK instead of designating LP+LK as a <b>position</b> <b>switch</b> manoeuvrer; only Steve Fox was given a position change attack), bringing back traditional air combat (Tekken 4 removed back and vertical leaps in favor of a more fluid 3D combat model) and using a juggle system more akin to Tekken 3 as opposed to the 4th game's less juggle-friendly gameplay. The fighters were also forced to remain stationary prior to the round beginning (Tekken 4 allowed the fighters to move freely before the opening of a round, fitting in with the more position-based gameplay of that game).|$|E

50|$|During Italy's closely fought 1-0 over Australia in {{the round}} of 16, Zambrotta {{received}} a booking in the 91st minute. In the quarter-final on 30 June, Italy defeated Ukraine 3-0, with Zambrotta scoring the opening goal after six minutes with a left-footed long-range shot after a one-two with Francesco Totti. This was his second goal for his country. Zambrotta's outstanding performance continued as he saved his team by a goal-line clearance in the 58th minute. After Lippi made some substitutions, Zambrotta was pushed up to a left midfield position. He immediately showed {{the effect of this}} <b>position</b> <b>switch.</b> In the 69th minute, he dribbled down the left flank into the edge of the penalty area and passed the ball across to Luca Toni to score his second goal of the match.|$|E
50|$|Following the disappointing campaign, Girard {{sought to}} change the team's style of play. One of his changes was to move Belhanda into the playmaker {{position}} just behind the striker. To coincide with the <b>position</b> <b>switch,</b> Belhanda was given the number ten shirt. The move was ultimately a success as Belhanda opened the campaign scoring two goals in his first three matches in wins over Auxerre and Rennes. On 27 August 2011, in a 2-1 defeat to Lyon, Belhanda received a straight red card after kicking out at Lyon midfielder Miralem Pjanić following a challenge. He returned to the team following the September international break and, after two matches, scored his third goal {{of the season in}} a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux. Two weeks later, Belhanda scored and assisted on a goal in a 3-1 away win against Caen. For his performances in the month of November, Belhanda was awarded the UNFP Player of the Month award.|$|E
