As it was peacetime, the ship carried {{primarily}} <b>practice</b> <b>ammunition,</b> with {{only a small number}} of live rounds. She was back in Germany when war began in September 1939. On the 4th, the day after the British declaration of war, Gneisenau was attacked by fourteen Wellington bombers, though they made no hits. In November, KzS Förste was replaced by KzS Harald Netzbandt. The ship's first combat operation, under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, began on 21 November 1939; the ship, in company with her sister , the light cruiser , and nine destroyers, was to patrol the area between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The intent of the operation was to draw out British units and ease the pressure on the heavy cruiser , which was being pursued in the South Atlantic. Two days later, the German flotilla intercepted the auxiliary cruiser [...]|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, {{it became}} known {{according}} to a report in a news magazine profile that Lichal had an order for 50,000 pieces of tracer <b>practice</b> <b>ammunition</b> for antiaircraft guns worth 35 million Austrian Schilling that had been awarded to the Swiss manufacturer Rheinmetall Air Defence, although the French supplier Matra Manurhin Defense an offer for 15 million Schillings. At the time of the award, the Bundesheer had ammunition reserves of 2 years. Lichal had ordered the Bundesheer at least three times to pass the more favorable offer from Matra. In 1988, a criminal investigation for abuse of authority was introduced, which included house searches at Lichal's home, his secretaries Michael Spindelegger and Walter Schön home's, and the then Oerlikon-General representatives in Austria's homes'. Lichal and Schön were close friends and Spindelegger was a member of Cartellverband. One sticky note found read [...] "2 party financing; and two million: Value of contract: 35 million Spindelegger: 1". Prosecutors suspected an illegal party financing for the ÖVP, after which was considered non-partisan, but the ÖVP Minister of Justice Egmont Foregger initiated disciplinary proceedings against the investigating prosecutor and the case of the Supreme Public Prosecutor that rendered the investigations invalid in 1990.|$|E

Ammunition used for practice contains live components and is designed to inflict minimum damage to or at the target. It is used primarily to reduce costs associated with using operational ammunition for maintaining those skills acquired during initial training programs. This report investigates the feasibility of producing locally a low cost purpose designed practice projectile to be used by the Medium Gun Regiment for training with 155 mm howitzers. The overall aim was to review the current processes for manufacturing high explosive filled projectiles and then to identify those processes which might not be necessary for the manufacture of practice projectiles, thereby reducing production costs.

40|$|Warfare has changed. Out-of-area {{operations}} {{have increased the}} awareness that we are unfamiliar {{with the performance of}} the current conventional medium and large calibre ammunitions in day-to-day practice. Current ammunition is primarily developed and procured to defeat the traditional ‘steel’ targets, but in reality also used to defeat opposing parties operating in urbanized terrain. Not only the unfamiliarity with the ammunition performance and effect against urban infra targets or protections, but also restrictions due to operating in confined spaces are topics to be dealt with by the operational commander. The Netherlands Defence Organisation started a large scale experimental research program in collaboration with international partners to become conversant with the performance and effect of conventional ammunitions (12. 5 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 120 mm, 155 mm, AT, …) including target <b>practice</b> <b>ammunition</b> against typical infra structural targets (brick, concrete, adobe, …). In 2010 an associated research program started at TNO. The experimental and theoretical research program, in combination with the operational lessons-learned, contributes to improve the safe, effective and efficient use of ammunition in out-of-area operations as well as on future related ammunition procurement requirement programs. The impact on and challenges for the supporting theoretical and simulation assessment methodology are evident. Confined, urban areas include multiple participating and non-participating parties. Due to own firepower and ammunition performance, operational safety and risk issues are introduced in the theatre {{in the vicinity of the}} target area and firing platform to be dealt with by the operational commander. Survivability Prepared for the 5 th European Survivability Workshop, Alesund (NO), 8 - 10 June 2010 issues implicit implies that opposing forces will represent the threat to be considered. In this paper, the operational safety and risk issues for own forces to be considered will be induced by the own (or friendly) forces during their engagement of the opposing entities. Some of the topics identified are highlighted. Modern warfare will have impact on the appreciation of operational safety and risk issues compared to cold war theatre. It is time to start thinking, discuss and reconsider the ideas and definitions stemming from the cold ware era. The objective is evident, the need for (inter) national accepted metrics and assessment methods to address operational safety and risk issues in modern warfare is urgent.

40|$|High-profile {{incidents}} of weapon-involved violence have galvanized public outrage, legislative proposals, and executive orders concerning individuals {{with mental illness}} and weapon access, particularly firearms. A review of public surveys and policy polls reveals multiple assumptions {{about the relationship between}} mental illness and violence, which have informed firearm prohibitions aimed at the mentally ill. However, few of these assumptions have been empirically investigated. With community (n = 154) and forensic psychiatric samples (n = 80), this study utilized a series of questionnaires to assess policy opinions, psychopathic traits, experiences with firearms, and perpetration rates for weapon-involved violence. Mental health files were also reviewed for psychiatric patients. Results indicated the prevalence of firearm violence was low among both samples but relatively higher among psychiatric patients. When looking at experiences with firearms more generally between the samples, psychiatric patients reported significantly more exposure to firearms in youth, {{were more likely to have}} acquired firearms from illegal means in the past, and were disproportionately more often victims of violence and violence with a weapon. By contrast, community participants endorsed greater knowledge of firearm safety <b>practices,</b> <b>ammunition,</b> and federal firearm regulations. Weapon-involved violence that did not entail a firearm was also examined. All firearm perpetrators also identified as “other weapon perpetrators. ” Similar to firearm violence, psychiatric patients were significantly more likely than community participants to report using other types of weapons to threaten or harm another person. Approximately half of the psychiatric sample endorsed weapon violence with some other type of weapon. Correlates of other weapon violence included features of childhood disruption, criminal history, and substance abuse. Among the psychiatric sample, a classification model using these covariates successfully distinguished between other weapon perpetrators and non-perpetrators. Notably, severe mental illness did not differentiate between groups. Overall, the majority of psychiatric patients did not report engaging in weapon-involved violence, either with a firearm or another weapon. Features of weapon-involved violence were comparable to those of violence generally. Findings did not support the underlying assumptions about weapon-involved violence and mental illness. Results of this study have implications for policy, clinical practice, and research in this area. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{ship was}} {{launched}} on 12 March 1910. Her first captain was Captain Ioannis Damianos, who took command of her on 16 May 1911. Averof sailed for Britain, {{in order to}} participate in the festivities for the coronation of King George V and to receive her first load of ammunition. The stay in Britain was troubled, however, including running aground at Spithead on 19 June, forcing her to be drydocked for repairs, brawls with locals and a near-mutiny resulting from the unfamiliarity of the Greek sailors with blue cheese. It was clear that Captain Damianos was inadequate, so he was replaced by the highly esteemed Captain Pavlos Kountouriotis, who quickly reimposed discipline and set sail for Greece. During the journey, Kountouriotis took care to train the crew, with the notable exception of gunnery <b>practice,</b> since <b>ammunition</b> was limited. Averof finally sailed into Faliro Bay, near Athens, on 1 September 1911. Averof was at the time the most modern and powerful ship in the navies of either the Balkan League or the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} relates corruption {{with high}} levels of military spending. This paper tests empirically whether such a relationship exists. The empirical analysis is based on data from four different sources for up to 120 countries in the period 1985 – 98. The association between military spending and corruption is ascertained by using panel regression techniques. The results suggest that corruption is indeed associated with higher military spending as a share of both GDP and total government spending, as well as with arms procurement in relation to GDP and total government spending. This evidence indicates that defense spending can be considered for constructing governance indicators.

The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away.

Female aviators were contracted as civil service personnel and placed in different units to ferry planes {{across the country and}} to tow targets during live <b>ammunition</b> <b>practice</b> by combat soldiers. These units were later combined to form the Women Air force Service Pilots (WASPs). The anomaly of the WASPs was that they were the only women’s unit who joined a men’s only division of the Army, though they were not considered to be full military personnel. Never before had the United States government allowed female pilots to participate in the military. While providing aerial support services for the United States Air Force, the WASPs were not granted military benefits, nor were they considered part of the military, despite being required to follow all military protocols. In 1977, after Congressional hearings, the WASPs were finally granted full military honors.

5000|$|A declassified US {{analysis}} of the feed system, based on models captured during the Korean War, reads: An interesting departure was made from the heretofore orthodox <b>practice</b> of feeding <b>ammunition</b> to a gun of this caliber. The feed, somewhat resembling a grooved revolver cylinder, {{is an integral part}} of the gun, and the cartridges remain axial throughout the entire operation.The cylindrical feed cage is rotated by an arm that engages a slot in the gas piston. A helical groove in the drum arrangement withdraws the cartridges from the metal disintegrating link belt as it moves through the feedway by engaging their rims and gradually camming the cartridges rearward. The freed cartridges are then presented at the bottom of the receiver for chambering by final rotation.This circular type of feed holds ten rounds. Several phases are required to completely delink a round and roll it up into position for being shoved into the chamber. A small folding handle held on the top side is used to rotate the feed drum when filling with cartridges.Camming the round slowly out of the belt with this type of feeder causes practically no drag when the weapon is fired at high speed. It has belt pull enough to take care of practically any length belt desired. ...The Russian Air Force nicknamed this circular arrangement the [...] "bird-cage" [...] feed. It is an adaptation of a system first used by the Polish designer, Gabriel Szakats. (Ian V. Hogg called the ShKAS feeding system a [...] "squirrel cage".) ...|$|R
