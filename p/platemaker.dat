50|$|Before {{releasing}} the 914, Xerox tested {{the market by}} introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385. The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation. As a consequence, it was sold as a <b>platemaker</b> to the offset lithography market, perhaps most notably as a <b>platemaker</b> for the Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses. It {{was little more than}} a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera, complete with photo-flood lighting and timer. The glass film/plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate. Clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film. A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method. Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset's market share.|$|E

50|$|Creo was {{the leading}} {{manufacturer}} of computer-to-plate technology in the 1990s, using thermal laser technology to capture a significant market share of the offset prepress industry. Because computer to plate technology allowed printers to image large numbers of plates at great speed, there arose a corresponding need to engineer a workflow that could process large amounts of data to feed the <b>platemakers</b> and ultimately the offset presses.|$|R
5000|$|Affordable copper, {{magnesium}} and photopolymer <b>platemakers</b> and milled aluminum bases {{have allowed}} letterpress printers to produce type and images derived from digital artwork, fonts and scans. Economical plates have encouraged {{the rise of}} [...] "digital letterpress" [...] in the 21st century, allowing {{a small number of}} firms to flourish commercially and enabling a larger number of boutique and hobby printers to avoid the limitations and complications of acquiring and composing metal type. At the same time there has been a renaissance in small-scale type foundries to produce new metal type on Monotype equipment, Thompson casters and the original American Type Founders machines.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{products}} were iron forgings, nails and cast artifacts such as pots, pans and so-called [...] "Takenplatten", decorative iron plates {{that carried the}} heat of the kitchen over into the adjacent living space by conduction and radiation. Production was gradually optimized over succeeding years, with plate beginning to predominate in the mill's product mix as from 1802, following the construction of the first plate rolling-mill in continental Europe. These developments brought the factory to the forefront as Prussia's largest black and tin plate producer. With approval from emperor Napoléon Bonaparte, Dillinger Hütte in 1809 became Germany's first joint stock company, {{and one of the first}} in Europe. The company adopted the name Anonyme Gesellschaft der Dillinger Hüttenwerke in 1828. State-of-the-art rolling facilities and blast furnaces were installed, and by the beginning of the 19th century the workforce had grown to over 2,500. The so-called [...] "Dillingen <b>platemaker's</b> gauge", covering twenty-four different plate thicknesses, had by then long become the definitive standard throughout Europe.|$|R
