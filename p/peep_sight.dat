25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds {{up and over the}} receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E
2500|$|The 416 had a {{dramatically}} oversized bull barrel {{and a large}} wooden stock. [...] The heavy barrel design added {{a great deal of}} weight which compared unfavorably with larger rifles such as the military's various [...]30 caliber offerings. [...] It had adjustable <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> apertures, a hooded front sight, and a small, removable magazine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! look at him!" [...] I yelled. A strong, hot gust {{of blood}} ran {{all over me}} and I thrilled till I shook. When I aimed at the bear I could see him through the circle of my <b>peep</b> <b>sight,</b> but when I moved the bead of the front sight upon him it almost covered him up. The {{distance}} was far--more than a thousand yards--over half a mile--we calculated afterward. But I tried to draw a bead on the big, wagging brown shape and fired till my rifle was empty.|$|E
50|$|Aperture sights, {{also known}} as <b>peep</b> <b>sights,</b> range from the ghost ring sight, whose thin ring blurs to near invisibility (hence ghost), to target {{aperture}} sights that use large disks or other occluders with pinhole-sized apertures. In general, the thicker the ring, the more precise the sight, and the thinner the ring, the faster the sight.|$|R

50|$|The {{sighting}} for {{the device}} was originally {{intended to be a}} cheap pentaprism device, which would allow the user to look down from above and see the sight picture. After locating a suitably low-cost device, the engineers found that fumes from either the C-3 explosive or the cement used to adhere the sight {{to the top of the}} mine corroded the plastic mirrors, rendering them unusable. They adopted simple <b>peep</b> <b>sights,</b> which were later replaced by a knife blade sight.|$|R
6000|$|Copple fired. [...] "Turkey number one!" [...] {{he called}} out. I missed a big gobbler on the run. Copple shot again. [...] "Turkey number two!" [...] he called out. I {{could not see}} what he had done, but of course I knew he had done execution. It roused my ire {{as well as a}} desperate ambition. Turkeys were running up hill everywhere. I aimed at this one, then at that. Again I fired. Another miss! How that gobbler ran! He might just as well have flown. Every turkey {{contrived}} to get a tree or bush between him and me, just at the critical instant. In despair I tried to hold on the last one, got a bead on it through my <b>peep</b> <b>sight,</b> moved it with him as we moved, and holding tight, I fired. With a great flop and scattering of bronze feathers he went down. I ran up the slope and secured him, a fine gobbler of about fifteen pounds weight.|$|E

50|$|Target {{shooting}} range for larger-caliber centerfire rifles are no shorter than 100 m, {{except in the}} case of “Zero” ranges used for setting or checking the open (iron) or aperture (<b>peep)</b> <b>sights</b> of the rifle and telescopic sight “Zero”. Military ranges are typically at least 500 - 1000 m to safely accommodate the range of most rifles. Public ranges can be as long as 2000 yd and typically accommodate hunters and sportsman participating in sports such as 300 m Standard Rifle, metallic silhouette or benchrest shooting.|$|R
50|$|In August 1943, Winchester {{management}} {{decided to}} offer the same <b>peep</b> <b>sights</b> used on the Model 68 as options for the Model 67, effectively rendering the Model 68 redundant, although it was curiously not formally discontinued until September 1944. Sales from inventory continued into 1945 and the rifle was listed in the 1946 price list although stocks had already been depleted. Approximately 98,496 to 100,730 Model 68s were produced. The Model 68 was never produced with serial numbers, which were not required on American firearms prior to the Gun Control Act of 1968.|$|R

50|$|Some weapon aiming sights (e.g. FN FNC) {{require the}} user to align a <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> (rear, nearby sight, i.e. which {{will be out of}} focus) with a tip (which should be focused and {{overlaid}} on the target) {{at the end of the}} barrel. When looking through the <b>peep</b> <b>sight,</b> the user will notice an Airy disk that will help center the sight over the pin.|$|E
5000|$|Ruger offered several {{variants}} {{including the}} RS model that had factory sling swivels and a rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> {{close to the}} rear receiver lug. The International Model was similar, but lacked the rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> and had a Mannlicher-type stock. The Sporter was the same, but made use of a Monte-Carlo style of stock. These three variants were dropped from production in 1971. In {{the final year of}} production, Ruger offered a [...] "25th Anniversary Edition" [...] that featured a Ruger medallion embedded in the stock.|$|E
50|$|Sako never totally {{forgot the}} target rifle {{origins of the}} TRG system. The {{necessary}} accessories to attach sighting components such as match grade <b>peep</b> <b>sights</b> or target aperture sights and a mirage strap are all available. Equipped with these accessories the TRG {{can be used for}} non military or law enforcement tasks such as 300 m UIT standard rifle competition, CISM competition or other kinds of full bore target shooting. The rifle is commonly seen in long-range competition where it has done very well. Besides civilian target shooting the TRG system can and is sometimes used for hunting.|$|R
5000|$|McGivern, {{along with}} his friend Elmer Keith, were {{instrumental}} in pushing the envelope {{in the early days}} of magnum revolvers. While Keith was primarily interested in hunting, McGivern was more interested in police use of the revolver. McGivern demonstrated that with proper sights and use, the [...]357 Magnum could be used on man-sized targets at ranges of up to 600 yards. McGivern experimented with different types of iron <b>sights,</b> including <b>peep</b> <b>sights,</b> and telescopic sights. His preferred type of iron sight for this use was a small-diameter rear aperture and a post with a gold bead for the front. McGivern went on to instruct police agencies, including the FBI, in his shooting techniques.|$|R

5000|$|The {{sighting}} line {{consists of}} a ∧-type post or an inverted [...] "V" [...] height adjustable front sight on a folding post and a leaf rear sight with an open V notch sliding on a ramp, graduated from 200 to 2,000 m. There is an antiaircraft rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> hinged on the open rear sight base. An auxiliary anti-aircraft ring sight is kept in the maintenance kit, and fitting on the barrel jacket {{to be used in}} conjunction with the folding antiaircraft rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> attached to the rear sight base.|$|E

50|$|At {{the ancient}} times, {{it was a}} {{tremendous}} jade called south jade that {{in the bottom of the}} lake. It was said that people who bathed in that lake would have bright white skin. So there were seven fairies from the welkin spending a whole day for bathing in that lake on midsummer every year. One year, a cow boy who gazed his cattle and horses near the lake and then <b>peeped</b> the <b>sight</b> of bathing by those fairies. After one of those fairies called Scarlet who found that they had been peeped by that cowboy, she breathed on the lake surface, leading to make the mountain surrounded by wind and fog so that the cowboy was not able to see them at all, which is the reason of the name of DaWu mountain.|$|R
5000|$|Most commonly, [...]22 Long Rifle {{cartridges}} are used, especially initially, {{since the}} ammunition is inexpensive and recoil is negligible - factors that bear {{consideration in the}} face of two or more days of very intense shooting practice, firing 500+ rounds. A magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifle with quality iron <b>peep</b> <b>sights</b> and a military loop sling is what is most commonly used; example rifles are the Ruger 10/22 and the Marlin 795.The unofficial preferred rifle is a so-called [...] "Liberty Training Rifle" [...] (LTR), consisting of a Ruger 10/22 with military-style aftermarket sights made by Tech-Sights, and an inexpensive military-style web sling. Tube-fed magazine rifles, such as the Marlin Model 60, can be used, but are not as amenable to learning all the skills that are taught since they do not have removable magazines, and the action of changing out a magazine has to be simulated. Some participants prefer to use a telescopic sight if their eyes are not able to work well with iron sights. [...] Appleseed shooting clinics require approximately 500+ rounds of ammunition for the two-day course.<<ref name=BHM/> [...] The skill sets that are taught include shooting from standing, sitting/kneeling, and prone (flat on the ground) positions, as well as shooting after transitioning from standing to sitting/kneeling, and after transitioning from standing to prone, all of which are shot with time limits. Rifles are generally never loaded when transitioning from standing to either sitting or prone positions, in keeping with the 4 Rules, except when doing a 4 Minute AQT containing transitions from standing to sitting and from sitting to prone, during which times the rifle's safety is engaged. Extensive use of the loop sling is made for accuracy, and multiple sling techniques/positions are taught (e.g., hasty-loop two-point sling, hasty-hasty two point sling, single point loop sling, high-loop sling, etc.). These sling positions are variously suitable for shooting accurately either quickly or slowly, over low/medium/high ground cover, among standing/sitting/kneeling/prone positions, as situations merit. Different techniques for shooting off-hand are also taught, dependent on the style of stock on one's rifle (e.g., using a high [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a straight rifle stock vs. using a low [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a pistol-grip rifle stock).|$|R
50|$|The JM mount {{consisted}} of a thick, metal, square frame, sized {{to fit into a}} standard French fortification embrasure (opening); the guns were mounted on an equally heavy-duty pivoting cradle inside this frame. The square frame fit snugly into the embrasure and was attached by hinges and bolts. This ensured that there were no gaps where enemy bullets could enter into the bunker (except the very small opening that the telescopic <b>sight</b> <b>peeped</b> through), yet allowed the guns to be aimed and trained on anyone outside the walls. Emplacements were often shared with an anti-tank gun sharing the same embrasure opening; the JM mount would be hinged back, and the anti-tank gun slid forward on its ceiling-mounted rail, until its barrel was outside and breech inside. It was surrounded by a similar square frame, which fit tightly into the embrasure. The only time the occupants of the bunker were exposed to enemy fire, was in the brief moments when switching the machine gun mounting for an artillery mount.|$|R
5000|$|The 416 had a {{dramatically}} over sized bull barrel {{and a large}} wooden stock. The heavy barrel design added {{a great deal of}} weight which compared unfavorably with larger rifles such as the military's various [...]30 caliber offerings. It had adjustable <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> apertures, a hooded front sight, and a small, removable magazine.|$|E
50|$|The rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> is a noted {{improvement}} over the standard Kalashnikov notch and post. The muzzle brake is intended to significantly reduce weapon report and muzzle flash. The AN-94 design is stated to be vastly more accurate than the AK-74M. And unlike the AK-74M, it can mount a GP-25 family grenade launcher and bayonet simultaneously.|$|E

60|$|The {{house was}} low, stone built, and roofed with rough slate, {{with a narrow}} {{verandah}} in front, and creepers in bud covering it. Then came a terrace just wide enough for a carriage to drive up; and below, flower-beds bordered with stones found what vantage ground they could between the steep slopes of grass that led almost precipitously down to the stream, where the ground rose equally rapidly on the other side. Moss, ivy, rhododendrons, primroses, anemones, {{and the promise of}} ferns were there, and the adjacent beds had their full share of hepaticas and all the early daffodil kinds. Behind and on the southern side, lay the kitchen garden, also a succession of steps, and beyond as the ravine widened were small meadows, each with a big stone in the midst. The gulley, (or goyle) narrowed as it rose, and there was a disused limestone quarry, all wreathed over with creeping plants, a birch tree growing up all white and silvery in the middle, and above the house and garden was wood, not of fine trees, and interspersed with rocks, but giving shade and shelter. The opposite side had likewise fields below, with one grey farm house <b>peeping</b> in <b>sight,</b> and red cattle feeding in one, and above the same rocky woodland, meeting the other at the quarry; and then after a little cascade had tumbled down from the steeper ground, giving place to the heathery peaty moor, which ended, more than two miles off in a torr like a small sphinx. This could not be seen from Magdalen's territory, but from the highest walk in her kitchen garden, she could see the square tower of Arnscombe, her parish church; and on a clear day, the glittering water of Rockstone bay.|$|R
5000|$|The Full Bore {{range is}} used for the long distance, 300 metre to 800 metre, target {{shooting}} disciplines using precision target rifles fitted with aperture (<b>peep)</b> or telescopic <b>sights.</b> The term Full Bore refers to the military calibres including; [...]303 British, 7.62×51mm NATO / [...]308 Winchester and 5.56×45mm NATO / [...]223 Remington as sanctioned by the NRAA rules although other calibres are also used. This range {{is used for}} national and international target rifle competitions, the most notable of which was the Australian Bicentenary Celebrations attended by approximately 900 competitors from Australia, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Channel Islands, Scotland, USA, Wales and Kenya in 1988. Two matches were held, The Australia Match (formerly The Empire Match) on 14 April 1988 and the US Palma Match on 16 April 1988 with a prize of $100,000 and the Palma Trophy. The range also hosts the annual NSW Queen's prize competition. The Queen's Prize was originally sponsored by Queen Victoria in 1860, the competition has been held annually (with the exception of the war years) by [...] "The Empire" [...] countries and all states in Australia since 1878.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} M1 and M1A1 rocket launchers were {{equipped with}} simple fixed sights {{and used a}} launch tube without reinforcements. During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used a rear iron sight and a front rectangular [...] "ladder" [...] sight positioned at the muzzle. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected [...] "rung" [...] on the front sight. On the M9, the ladder sight {{was replaced by the}} General Electric T43 aperture sight. Ranging was accomplished by looking through the rear <b>sight's</b> <b>peep</b> hole while rotating the assembly (which had graduations of 100, 200, and 300 yards) so it lined up with the blade positioned at the muzzle. In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming. The T43 and T90 sights were interchangeable. Various types of blast deflectors were tried, and an additional strap iron shoulder brace was fitted to the M9 launcher.|$|R
50|$|Most {{parts of}} this rifle, like the M59, were made from former Mauser M98 rifles but fitted with a heavy target barrel, a new {{oversize}} target stock, Busk target front and rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight,</b> and a rubber recoil pad. From 1975 the rifles had an adjustable trigger (M75), before that they had military M98K triggers. From 1990 the rifles had an adjustable UIT target stock.|$|E
50|$|The SG 510-1/Stgw 57 has a straight-line stock design, and an {{elevated}} iron sights line. Both {{the front and}} rear sights can be folded down when not in use.The rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> of the Stgw 57 can be adjusted from 100 m to 640 m. From 100-200 m the sight adjusts in 50 m increments. From 200-300 m in 30 m increments, and from 300-640 m in 20 m increments.|$|E
50|$|It is {{fitted with}} a <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> set {{which is much more}} {{accurate}} than regular iron sights. The rifle is lightweight and sturdy. It comes with a 5-round detachable loading magazine that inserts from underneath the firing chamber. The only problem with this rifle is that the magazine was built cheaply and sometimes splits in half, however this does not affect the rifle in any way except in the speed in which you reload.|$|E
50|$|It {{features}} a standard back-up iron sights {{that are made}} of the same polymer as the weapon's receiver. The front sight post is adjustable for windage and elevation and the rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> has six positions to fire in increments from 100-600 meters. The primary optical sight is the Aimpoint ACIES, a domestic version of the Aimpoint CompM2. Telescopic sights, night vision systems, vertical forward grips, and other accessories will be available through the Soldato Futuro program.|$|E
50|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight</b> moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds {{up and over the}} receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E
5000|$|Daisy also makes, {{as part of}} the Avanti line, the Model 499B Champion, {{billed as}} the [...] "world's most {{accurate}} BB gun". This is a true competition BB gun, with a micrometer adjustable rear <b>peep</b> <b>sight,</b> a sling, and a precision smoothbore barrel. It is to be used with Daisy's precision-ground steel BBs that are made for the 499. The 499 is unusual in that it is a single-shot, muzzleloading spring airgun. The 499 is most commonly used in [...] BB gun competitions by youth groups such as 4H and Boy Scouts.|$|E
