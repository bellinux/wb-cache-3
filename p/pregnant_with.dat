40|$|Background. According to the WHO, {{hypertension}} {{is associated}} with 20 - 33 % of maternal death during pregnancy within extragenital pathology statistics. There are complications of the fetus and newborn associated with hypertension at 140 / 90 mm Hg and higher. Objective. A comparative analysis of antihypertensive therapy effectiveness in <b>pregnants</b> <b>with</b> arterial hypertension was performed using modern clinical and instrumental methods of endothelial function diagnostic, central and utero-placental hemodynamic estimation. Methods. We examined 63 <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> hypertension at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation. Women were randomized into three groups:group I (control group – 20 women), that included <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> hypertension treated with basic antihypertensive therapy as recommended by Health Ministry of Ukraine standards (metildofa and nifedipin); group II – 21 pregnant women receiving metildofa and metoprolol; group III (22 pregnant women) receiving metildofa and nebivolol. Conclusions. It {{was found that the}} brachial artery ultrasound measuring and occlusive plethysmography procedure by Dietz is an early and safe method of endothelial dysfunction diagnostic in <b>pregnants</b> <b>with</b> hypertension. Doppler ultrasound of blood flow in uterine, umbilical arteries, and middle cerebral arteries of the fetus allows timely diagnosis of the side effect of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus. The therapy of choice for <b>pregnants</b> <b>with</b> Stage II Arterial Hypertension should be based on methyldopa and calcium channel antagonists or selective beta-blockers combination. Highly selective beta-blockers with vasodilative effect (nebivolol hydrochloride) and L-arginine (Tivortin) allow to prevent perinatal adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy, to correct hemodynamic disorders and endothelial dysfunction in <b>pregnants</b> <b>with</b> arterial hypertension.

40|$|Enhancing the Care of <b>Pregnant</b> Women <b>with</b> Epilepsy BACKGROUND: Through {{a long-standing}} {{collaboration}} with the Medical Center’s Maternal-Fetal Medicine program, a clinical pharmacist from the Comprehensive Epilepsy program works <b>with</b> <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> epilepsy in the High-Risk Obstetrics Clinic. Through this clinical collaboration, {{it has been observed}} that some women stop or lower their antiepileptic drug therapy during pregnancy out of concern for their baby. This puts the woman and her baby at risk from increased seizure activity during the pregnancy. PURPOSE: The aim of this qualitative project was to learn why pregnant women may or may not alter their antiepileptic drug therapy. This aim was achieved by conducting small focus groups in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> epilepsy. METHODS: <b>Pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> epilepsy were recruited from the OSU Medical Center’s High-Risk Obstetrics Clinic and the Comprehensive Epilepsy program. The 60 to 90 minute sessions were held at the offices of the Epilepsy Foundation of Central Ohio in {{collaboration with the}}ir Social Worker. Our target sample size is 20 <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> epilepsy.

40|$|Background/aim: Ureaplasma urealyticum, {{a common}} {{commensal}} {{of the female}} lower genital tract, has been observed as an important opportunistic pathogen during pregnancy. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the degree of cervical colonization with U. urealyticum in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> risk pregnancy and in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> normal term delivery and to evaluate the correlation between high-density cervical U. urealyticum colonization and premature rupture of membranes (PROM) as well. Methods. This research was conducted on the samples comprising 130 hospitalized <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> threatening preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes. The control group consisted of 39 <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> term delivery without PROM. In addition to standard bacteriological examination and performing direct immunofluorescence test to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, cervical swabs were also examined for the presence of U. urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis by commercially available Mycofast Evolution 2 test (International Microbio, France). Results. The number of findings with isolated high-density U. urealyticum in the target group was 69 (53. 08 %), while in the control group was 14 (35. 90 %). Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) occurred in 43 (33. 08 %) examinees: 29 were pPROM, and 14 were PROM. The finding of U. urealyticum ≥ 104 was determined in 25 (58. 14 %) <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> rupture, 17 were pPROM, and 8 were PROM. There was statistically significant difference in the finding of high-density U. urealyticum between the <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> PROM and the control group (χ² = 4. 06, p < 0. 05). U. urealyticum was predominant bacterial species found in 62. 79 % of isolates in the PROM cases, while in 32. 56 % it was isolated alone. Among the 49 <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> preterm delivery, pPROM occurred in 29 (59. 18 %) examinees, and in 70. 83 % of <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> findings of high-density U. urealyticum pPROM was observed. Conclusion. Cervical colonization with U. urealyticum ≥ 104 is more frequent in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> risk pregnancy than in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> normal term delivery. High-density cervical U. urealyticum colonization should be observed as a possible etiological factor for PROM...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} {{the rate of}} preterm birth and low birth weight in the newborns of <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> early and late onset pre-eclampsia according to folic acid supplementation. Study design. Birth outcomes of newborns were evaluated in 1, 017 (2. 7 %) <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> medically recorded pre-eclampsia and 37, 134 pregnant women without pre-eclampsia as reference in the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Abnormalities, 1980 – 1996, in addition these study groups were differentiated according to the supplementation of high dose of folic acid alone from early pregnancy. Results. <b>Pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> pre-eclampsia associated with {{a higher rate of}} preterm birth (10. 2 % versus 9. 1 %) and low birthweight (7. 9 % versus 5. 6 %). There was a lower risk of preterm birth (6. 8 %) of newborn infants born to <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> early onset pre-eclampsia after folic acid supplementation from early pregnancy though the rate of low birthweight was not reduced significantly. There was no significant reduction in the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> late onset pre-eclampsia after folic acid supplementation. Conclusion.

40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, GM-CSF, IFNγ, TNFα) were determined in blood serum of <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> {{different types of}} metabolic disorders, i. e., gestational diabetes, obesity, and a combination of those disorders. The study was performed by means of flow fluorimetry, using a multiplex test system. Changes of cytokine profiles in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> overweight or obesity, and <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> gestational diabetes showed some similarities. In <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> overweight or obesity we have found an increase in blood {{concentrations of}} IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 10, IFNγ, and TNFa. Meanwhile, an increase in blood levels of IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNFα was revealed in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> gestational diabetes. The changes in cytokine profile were most pronounced in cases of pregnancy complicated with gestational diabetes and obesity. In these women, increased IL- 6, TNFα, GM-CSF and IFNg concentrations were revealed in blood, along with low contents of IL- 2 and IL- 10. Potential causes and consequences of suggested subclinical inflammation in pregnant women are discussed. We conclude that <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> metabolic disorders may develop a subclinical inflammation at {{the early stages of}} obesity, or metabolic disturbances.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of Review This review {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} three questions: What is the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses among <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> opioid use disorder (OUD) ? How do comorbid psychiatric illnesses impact <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> OUD? And how do comorbid psychiatric illnesses affect the ability of <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> OUD to adhere to and complete OUD treatment? Recent Findings Based on this literature review, 25 – 33 % of <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> OUD have a psychiatric comorbidity, with depression and anxiety being especially common. However, of the 17 studies reviewed only 5 have prevalence rates of dual diagnosis in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> OUD as their primary outcome measures, their N’s were typically small, methods for determining psychiatric diagnosis were variable, {{and many of the}} studies were undertaken with women presenting for treatment which carries with its implicit selection bias. Of the women enrolled in treatment programs for SUD, those with psychiatric comorbidity {{were more likely to have}} impaired psychological and family/social functioning than those without psychiatric comorbidity. Greater severity of comorbid psychiatric illness appears to predict poorer adherence to treatment, but more research is needed to clarify this relationship with the psychiatric illness is less severe. Summary While cooccurrence of psychiatric disorders in <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> opioid use disorder appears to be common, large population-based studies with validated diagnostic tools and longitudinal assessments are needed to obtain definitive rates and characteristics of cooccurring illnesses. Integrated prenatal, addiction, and psychiatric treatment in a setting that provides social support to <b>pregnant</b> patients <b>with</b> OUD is most effective in maintaining women in treatment. More research is still needed to identify optimal treatment settings, therapy modalities, and medication management for dually diagnosed <b>pregnant</b> women <b>with</b> OUD...|$|R
