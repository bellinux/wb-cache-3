5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most <b>primitive</b> member of the Dromaeosauridae, more <b>primitive</b> than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most <b>primitive</b> member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E

30|$|Motor <b>primitives</b> {{are very}} important, {{given that the}} UAVs fly by {{selecting}} and performing motor <b>primitives</b> repeatedly. Motor <b>primitives</b> decide {{the quality of the}} UAVs. Therefore, the way to define motor <b>primitives</b> is very important. Traditionally, motor <b>primitives</b> are defined by setting the values of motor <b>primitives</b> linearly, which means that UAVs only fly according to the predefined path. However, because of dynamic environments, {{it is very hard to}} perform selected motor <b>primitives</b> completely. The motor <b>primitives</b> that reflect dynamic environments are demanded. In this paper, motor <b>primitives</b> are expressed by graph, which means that graph-based motor <b>primitives</b> are performed completely more than linear motor <b>primitives.</b> Therefore, graph-based motor <b>primitives</b> are proper to dynamic environments. In the future, the way to perform graph-based motor <b>primitives</b> needs to be handled.|$|R

5|$|Ants of this genus are {{considered}} to be the most <b>primitive</b> within the family Formicidae. The body presents a wasp-like structure but with several ant-like characteristics. These ant-like characteristics, however, are <b>primitive</b> compared to more modern ants, and thus it is intermediate with other <b>primitive</b> ants and aculeate wasps. The presence of the metapleural gland, the nodiform (a structure resembling a node, which is a segment found between the mesosoma and gaster, the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma), the structure of the petiole and its general physical appearance of an ant concludes Sphecomyrma species are ants rather than wasps; the absence of the metapleural gland would mean that it is most likely a wasp instead of an ant. It is not exactly known which group of wasps are the descendants of Sphecomyrma, but members of the family Tiphiidae, particularly those in the genus Methocha are strikingly similar with Sphecomyrma. Wilson placed the genus closest to the Tiphiidae among extant wasps, but a later study published in 1975 derives the ants from a later clade and not to the Tiphiidae.|$|E

5|$|Sphecomyrma {{may hold}} a close {{relationship}} with extant <b>primitive</b> ants. The Australian dinosaur ant (Nothomyrmecia macrops) is recognised as the most <b>primitive</b> living ant today, and both ants closely resemble each other. The Eocene genera of Aneuretini also resemble Sphecomyrma ants, which are believed to be the ancestors of Dolichoderinae. The subfamily Myrmeciinae was thought to be the ancestor of Aneuretini because the elongated mandibles (a well-known feature in Myrmeciinae ants), were considered <b>primitive</b> and short mandibles were derived. This theory was proven false after Sphecomyrma specimens had small mandibles. Currently, phylogenetic analyses recognise Sphecomyrma as a sister group to modern living ants, meaning that is a stem-group formicid. This means that it is more closely related to the ants in contrast to any other organism, but the crown-group formicids (as in the most recent common ancestor of modern ants and their descendants) are more closely related to each other and distantly related to Sphecomyrma. By the end of the Mesozoic, the sphecomyrmines including these ants vanished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic system-based motor <b>primitives</b> [1] {{have enabled}} robots to learn complex tasks ranging from Tennisswings to locomotion. However, to date {{there have been}} only few {{extensions}} which have incorporated perceptual coupling to variables of external focus, and, furthermore, these modifications have relied upon handcrafted solutions. Humans learn how to couple their movement <b>primitives</b> with external variables. Clearly, such a solution is needed in robotics. In this paper, we propose an augmented version of the dynamic systems motor <b>primitives</b> which incorporates perceptual coupling to an external variable. The resulting perceptually driven motor <b>primitives</b> include the previous <b>primitives</b> as a special case and can inherit some of their interesting properties. We show that these motor <b>primitives</b> can perform complex tasks such as Ballin-a-Cup or Kendama task even with large variances in the initial conditions where a skilled human player would be challenged. For doing so, we initialize the motor <b>primitives</b> in the traditional way by imitation learning without perceptual coupling. Subsequently, we improve the motor <b>primitives</b> using a novel reinforcement learning method which is particularly well-suited for motor <b>primitives.</b> I...|$|R
