5|$|As Africa's most {{populated}} country, Nigeria has repositioned {{its military}} as a <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> on the continent. Since 1995, the Nigerian military, through ECOMOG mandates, {{have been deployed}} as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), and Sierra Leone (1997–1999). Under an African Union mandate, it has stationed forces in Sudan's Darfur region to try to establish peace.|$|E

Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his Temple of Sol. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1999, the United Nations Security Council {{expressed}} concern at the deteriorating situation in East Timor, and issued UNSC Resolution 1264 {{calling for a}} multinational force to restore peace and security to East Timor, to protect and support the United Nations mission there, and to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations {{until such time as}} a United Nations <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> could be approved and deployed in the area.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} resumed in Arusha, and {{the resulting}} set of agreements, known as the Arusha Accords, were signed in August 1993. The RPF were given positions in a broad-based transitional government (BBTG) and in the national army. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force,</b> arrived and the RPF were given a base in the national parliament building in Kigali to use during {{the establishment of the}} BBTG.|$|E

5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|In February {{following}} the reassertion {{of the central}} government's authority in Katanga, the UN began phasing out its <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force,</b> {{with the goal of}} completing a total withdrawal {{by the end of the}} year. At the government's request, the UN authorised a six-month extension to ONUC's deployment, albeit with a reduced number of personnel. The last troops left the Congo on 30 June 1964. The civilian aid mission remained longer to provide technical assistance to the government.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force.</b> However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E

5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E
5|$|A 3 January 1992 ceasefire {{allowed the}} {{implementation}} of the Vance plan, which protected civilians in areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) and deployed UN peacekeepers in Croatia. One of the UNPAs defined by the plan, UNPA Western Slavonia, encompassed parts of the municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradiška and all of Daruvar, Grubišno Polje and Pakrac. This UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January, additional territory to the north (recaptured by the HV in late 1991) and towns never under SAO Western Slavonia control (such as Grubišno Polje and Daruvar). The <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> (United Nations Protection Force, or UNPROFOR), initially expected to be 10,000-strong, began its deployment on 8 March.|$|E
5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B.

As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.|$|E

5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions. Some {{of the more}} radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the UN {{deployed}} United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), {{the largest}} military force of its early decades, to bring {{order to the}} breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to {{the control of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964. While travelling to meet with rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskjöld, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General, died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN <b>Peacekeeping</b> <b>Force</b> in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.|$|E

Selected division units began deploying in late summer, approximately 3,000 division soldiers deployed. After successfully performing their mission in Bosnia, the division units conducted a Transfer of Authority, relinquishing their assignments to soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard. By early summer 2000, all 10th Mountain Division soldiers had returned safely to Fort Drum.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central {{government}} to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{air strikes}} that year helped bring the Yugoslav wars to an end, {{resulting}} in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force,</b> under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto European Union Force Althea. Following the lead of its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force.</b> Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
