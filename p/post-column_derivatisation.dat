40|$|Artemisinin a {{representative}} of Endoperoxide class of drugs and its derivatives particularly artesunate {{are the most important}} class of antimalarial drugs used in clinical practice. They are recommended as the first-line treatment of malaria in combination with other longer-acting antimalarial drugs (lumefantrine, piperaquine). As the main skeleton of these compounds lacks UV visible or fluorescent chromophore, earlier methods of detection have used <b>post-column</b> on-line <b>derivatisation</b> or electrochemical detection in the reductive mode. However, these methods suffer from poor sensitivity and selectivity. Within this thesis the whole LC-MS method development for the analysis of artesunate and its major metabolite dihydroartemisin in biological samples from the very beginning was performed. It included tuning of ESI - triple quadrupole MS detector and optimization of chromatographic conditions, particularly mobile phase pH. Artesunate (ARST) and dihydroartemisin (DHA) were assayed in human plasma using artemisisnin as an internal standard.

40|$|Abstract. An automated, {{ground-based}} {{instrument was}} used to measure gas-phase hydroperoxides at the Jungfraujoch High Altitude Research Station as part of the Free Tro-pospheric EXperiment (FREETEX) during February/March 2003. A nebulising reflux concentrator sampled ambient air twice hourly, prior to on-site analysis by HPLC speciation, coupled with <b>post-column</b> peroxidase <b>derivatisation</b> and flu-orescence detection. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) concentra-tions reached up to 1330 pptv over the 13 -day period with a mean of 183 ± 233 pptv (± one standard deviation). Methyl hydroperoxide (CH 3 OOH) reached up to 379 pptv with a mean of 51 ± 55 pptv. No other organic hydroperoxides were detected. The lack of an explicit diurnal cycle suggests that hydroperoxide concentrations are chiefly influenced by trans-port processes rather than local photochemistry at this moun-tainous site. There was some evidence that elevated concen-trations of H 2 O 2 existed in air-masses originating from the south-west, suggesting higher concentrations of HOx due to more active photochemistry. Air which had been recently polluted exhibited low H 2 O 2 concentration due to a combi-nation of suppression of HO 2 by NOx and deposition. The concentrations of H 2 O 2 sampled here are consistent with pre-vious box modelling studies of hydroperoxides, except in pe-riods influenced by the boundary layer, where agreement re-quired a depositional sink. ...|$|R

40|$|The natural {{heterogeneity}} of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins requires that chromatography be {{an essential part}} of structural elucidation. Until recently, the rapid analysis of underivatised carbohydrates by HPLC was hampered, due to the extensive structural heterogeneity, by the absence of a chromatographic medium for satisfactory separation and by the lack of a sufficiently sensitive detection system. This problem has been overcome by the introduction of high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed electrochemical detection (PED) which separates oligosaccharides as their oxyanions on micropellicular quaternary ammonium resins [1 - 10].

40|$|In PressUnroasted cocoa {{beans are}} rich in monomeric flavanols and {{particularly}} epicatechin-based proanthocyanidin oligomers, with the latter making up to 60 % of the total polyphenol content. Although the antioxidant activity of cocoa polyphenols is well known, {{it is still a}} challenging analytical field, especially, {{when it comes to the}} determination of condensed polyphenols and the evaluation of their single contribution to the overall activity. Therefore, an online NP-HPLC-DPPH assay was developed to separate the homologous series of condensed polyphenols for assessing their antioxidant capacity in relation to their degree of polymerization (DP), simultaneously. In this context, normal-phase chromatography allows separation of polyphenols based on their degree of polymerization. This study showed that an unroasted cocoa extract contains condensed polyphenols with a DP of up to 10 monomer units. By means of the online <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> with 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), the antioxidant capacity of the separated condensed polyphenols was assessed.

However, from the single proanthocyanidins identified, nonameric and decameric proanthocyanidins were found to have the highest values for the antioxidant capacity. The degree of polymerization associated with each molecular weight fraction was further confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with reverse-phase liquid chromatography.

40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> and visible detection are regularly employed in ion chromatography (IC) to detect poorly absorbing species. Although this mode is often highly sensitive, one disadvantage is {{the increase in}} repeating baseline artifacts associated with out-of-sync pumping systems. The work presented here will demonstrate {{the use of a}} second generation design paired emitter–detector diode (PEDD-II) detection mode offering enhanced sensitivity to transition metals in IC by markedly reducing this problem and also by improving signal noise. First generation designs demonstrated the use of a single integrated PEDD detector cell as a simple, small (15 × 5 mm), highly sensitive, low cost photometric detector for the detection of metals in IC. The basic principle of this detection mode lies in the employment of two linear light emitting diodes (LEDs), one operating in normal mode as a light source and the other in reverse bias serving as a light detector. The second generation PEDD-II design showed increased sensitivity for Mn(II) - and Co(II) - 2 -(pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) complexes as a result of two simultaneously acquiring detection cells – one analytical PEDD cell and one reference PEDD cell. Therefore, the PEDD-II employs two wavelengths whereby one monitors the analyte reaction product and the second monitors a wavelength close to the isosbestic point. The optimum LED wavelength to be used for the analytical cell was investigated to maximise peak response. The fabrication process for both the analytical and reference PEDD cells was validated by determining the reproducibility of detectors within a batch. The reproducibility and sensitivity of the PEDD-II detector was then investigated using signals obtained from both intra- and inter-day chromatograms...|$|E

The synthesis, analysis, derivatisation and application of the label to certain analytical problems have been studied. The label was obtained in a high state of purity by a straightforward sulphonation of the counarin nucleus. Characterisation of the label was carried out using mass spectrometry, NMR and IR, its purity was verified by elemental analysis. The label was found to be highly stable and react at room temperature with phenolic and amino groups. The luminescence properties of the label and its derivatives were investigated both at room temperature and at 77 K. The room temperature fluorescence showed a strong pH dependence which was not observed at 77 K. Environmental effects on the fluorescence properties of the derivatives at room temperature were investigated. Linearity range, quantum yields and the detection limits of the derivatives were determined. The optimum derivatisation conditions for various compounds were determined by HPLC. The analytical applications of the label were investigated by studying the behaviour of the derivatives in HPLC and TLC systems.

40|$|The {{co-occurrence of}} mycotoxins in baby foods, {{including}} aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) and ochratoxin A (OTA), {{has been reported}} in previous studies, but data on their potential combined toxic effects are still missing. The present work aimed at (1) validating an in-house multi-mycotoxin high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method for AFM 1, total aflatoxins (aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), aflatoxin B 2 (AFB 2), aflatoxin G 1 (AFG 1), aflatoxin G 2 (AFG 2)) and OTA in infant formulae (milk powders) and cereal baby foods (flours), and (2) assessing the combined cytotoxic effects of AFM 1 and OTA in an intestine-derived cell line. The HPLC-FLD method, which included a chloroform extraction, liquid-liquid extraction, immunoaffinity column clean-up and fluorescence detection after <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> with electrochemically generated bromine, was adequate for the analysis of baby foods and met the requirements of validation and quality control for the studied working ranges. The limits of quantification for AFM 1, AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1, AFG 2 and OTA were 0. 069, 0. 032, 0. 020, 0. 047, 0. 020 and 0. 244 μg/kg, respectively. The mean recovery values were 96, 114, 112, 107, 101 and 87 %, respectively. A dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed for individual and combined AFM 1 and OTA using the Caco- 2 cell line, which represents a site of contact of both mycotoxins in the body, after oral exposure. Interactions between both mycotoxins were disclosed by application of the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models, revealing the predominance of an antagonistic pattern. In conclusion, this study proposes a HPLC-FLD method for multi-mycotoxin monitoring in baby foods and provides evidence for the interaction between AFM 1 and OTA, and for the applicability of CA/IA models to predict the effect of mycotoxins mixtures, further contributing to the prevention of mycotoxins-associated adverse health effects...|$|E

The concentration levels of the target analyte at which the validation experiments have been carried out varied between 12. 8 and 51. 3 mg kg− 1 in compound feed, covering the authorised levels of semduramicin according to European Union legislation. Furthermore, the method has been validated for a premixture sample containing semduramicin at 3 g kg− 1 and the feed additive containing semduramicin at 51 g kg− 1. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats with acetonitrile from the feed samples followed by a filtration of the supernatants. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. When analysing the feed additive and the premixture samples, the extraction solution was appropriately diluted prior to LC-UV-PCD analysis. The analytes were quantified through an external calibration curve prepared with pure semduramicin standards. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and for intermediate precision varied from 2. 4 to 8. 8 % and from 2. 6 to 8. 8 %, respectively, and the values for the relative recovery rate ranged from 89 to 95 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be below 1 mg kg− 1 and 3 mg kg− 1, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a comparable performance profile, when using methyl isobutyl ketone instead of acetonitrile as extraction solvent. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed at authorised level, in premixtures and in the feed additive, hence allowing the enforcement of the European Union legislation regarding the control and the monitoring in feedingstuffs.

40|$|Coccidiosis is {{a common}} {{parasitic}} disease of broiler chickens caused by single-celled protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria which are {{commonly referred to as}} coccidian. This is an infective disease of the digestive tract which is most frequent with poultry, causing a decrease in daily increment, prolonged fattening, poorer skin pigmentation, slower feed conversion and increased mortality. The disease is caused by Protozoas from the genera of Eimeria, Isospora and Cryptospora, and it is manifested by damaging the intestine epithelial cells, less frequently the bile duct and renal tubuli. Coccidiosis is traditionally controlled by chemotherapy. There are many anticoccidial preparations which are used in the prevention of coccidiosis. We are chose a polyether monocarboxylic acid - salinomycine. Salinomycin is monovalent carboxyl-polyether ionophores. Salinomycin, produced by Streptomyces albus, destroys the cell membranes and causes their lysis. Salinomycin and other ionophoric antibiotics combine with a number of mono and divalent cations and in the form of bi-complexes make it possible to transfer metal ions through lipid hydrophobic membrane, and when they are added to diet, they change bioavailability, gut uptake and absorption and reserves of nutrient tissues. In this paper has been developed and validated process of Liquid chromatography determination of ionophoric coccidiostat salinomycin with UV spectrophotometric detection and <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> with dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMAB).

40|$|During {{the gold}} cyanidation process, cyanide can be lost from the {{leachate}} by various chemical routes. Since cyanide is generally {{the most expensive}} reagent in this process, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to monitor these cyanide losses. The products of these cyanide losses include base metal cyanide complexes, thiocyanate and cyanate. The two most significant cyanicides in order of importance are sulfides and copper bearing minerals. The problems caused by cyanide soluble copper minerals are well known to the gold processing industry and have been reviewed by several authors (e. g. 1, 2). One particular facet of this problem concerns the effect of the CN:Cu mole ratio, R, on the gold leaching kinetics. In order to efficiently leach cupriferous ores, it is important that R is maintained at a level that allows sufficiently rapid leaching without excessive use of cyanide. An additional consideration when leaching cupriferous ores is the oxidation of cyanide by Cu(11) minerals, resulting in the formation of cyanate. Ion chromatography (IC) has been successfully used for the determination of cyanide, metal cyanide complexes, thiocyanate and cyanate in leachates. Most of the important metal-cyanide complexes and thiocyanate can be determined by reverse phase ion interaction chromatography (e. g. 3, 4, 5, 6). Cyanide and cyanate are both unretained in the separation of the metal cyanide complexes and are not detectable as their respective anions. However, it has been possible to determine cyanide in this separation by either precolumn derivatisation with Ag to form [Ag(CN) J (4) or <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> with a selective colourimetric reaction to produce a visible dye (5). There are no reactions suitable for the analogous pre or post column derivatisation of cyanate in the above separation of metal cyanide complexes. Cyanate has been determined separately on an anion exchange column (e. g. 7, 8, 9). This paper presents two new IC techniques that enable the rapid determination of cyanate concentration and R in samples containing large concentrations of Cu(I) -cyanide complexes. Other metal cyanide complexes, in addition to Cu(I), can also be determined in conjunction with R, while other anions such as chloride and sulfate can be determined in conjunction with cyanate.

Ozonolysis of thymine (k = 3. 4 x 10 (4) dm(3) mol(- 1) s(- 1)) leads {{to the formation of}} the acidic (pK(a) = 4) hydroperoxide 1 -hydroperoxymethylene- 3 -(2 -oxopropanoyl) urea 5 (similar to 34 %), neutral hydroperoxides (possibly mainly 1 - hydroperoxyhydroxymethyl- 3 -(2 -oxopropanoyl) urea 6, total similar to 41 %) and H 2 O 2 (25 %, with corresponding formation of 1 -formyl- 5 -hydroxy- 5 -methylhydantoin 11). The organic hydroperoxides decay (similar to 1. 1 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1) at 20 degreesC, 1. 3 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1) at 3 degreesC) releasing formic acid (formation of 5 -hydroperoxy- 5 -methylhydantoin 18) and also to some extent H 2 O 2 (and 11). After 100 min, the formic acid yield is 75 %. Upon treatment at high pH, it increases to 100 %. Reduction of the organic hydroperoxides with bis(2 - hydroxyethyl) sulfide (k = 50 dm(3) mol(- 1) s(- 1)) leads to 11 whose subsequent treatment with base yields 5 -hydroxy- 5 - methylhydantoin 13 in 100 % yield. It is suggested that the Criegee ozonide formed upon reaction with ozone at the C(5) - C(6) double bond opens heterolytically in two directions with subsequent opening of the C(5) -C(6) bond. In the preferred route (75 %), the positive charge resides at C(6). Deprotonation at N(1) gives rise to 5, while its reaction with water yields 6. Loss of formic acid yields 5 -hydroperoxy- 5 - methylhydantoin 18. Reduction of 5 and 6 with the sulfide yields 11. In the minor route (25 %), the positive charge remains at C(5) followed by a reaction with water. The resulting alpha-hydroxy hydroperoxide rapidly loses H 2 O 2 (formation of 11). In basic solution, singlet dioxygen is formed (8 %). The concomitant product, 5, 6 -dihydroxy- 5, 6 -dihydrothymine has been detected. In the ozonolysis of thymidine, the rapid formation of conductance (k = 0. 55 s(- 1)) is due to the release of acetic acid (18 %). In this reaction a short-lived hydroperoxide is destroyed. As a consequence of this, 25 s after ozonolysis the total hydroperoxide yield is only 78 % (including 8 % H 2 O 2). The products corresponding to acetic acid are suggested to be CO 2 and N-(2 -deoxy-beta-D-erythropentofuranosyl) formylurea 22. A number of organic hydroperoxides have been detected by HPLC by <b>post-column</b> <b>derivatisation</b> with iodide. An acidic hydroperoxide such as 5 in the case of thymine is not among the products. Upon sulfide reduction, the organic hydroperoxides yield mainly (43 - 50 %) N- 1 -(2 -deoxy-beta-D-erythropentofuranosyl) - 5 -hydroxy- 5 -methylhydantoin 23. The reasons for some striking differences in the ozonolyses of thymine and thymidine are discussed...|$|E
