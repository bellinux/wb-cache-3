50|$|Low-pressure {{permanent}} mold (LPPM) casting uses a gas at low pressure, usually between 3 and 15 psi (20 to 100 kPa) {{to push the}} molten metal into the mold cavity. The pressure {{is applied to the}} top of the pool of liquid, which forces the molten metal up a refractory <b>pouring</b> <b>tube</b> and finally into the bottom of the mold. The <b>pouring</b> <b>tube</b> extends to the bottom of the ladle so that the material being pushed into the mold is exceptionally clean. No risers are required because the applied pressure forces molten metal in to compensate for shrinkage. Yields are usually greater than 85% because there is no riser and any metal in the <b>pouring</b> <b>tube</b> just falls back into the ladle for reuse.|$|E

40|$|Ames Laboratory has {{successfully}} used plasma sprayed ceramic components made from yttria stabilized zirconia as melt <b>pouring</b> <b>tubes</b> for gas atomization for many years. These tubes {{have proven to}} be strong, thermal shock resistant and versatile. Various configurations are possible both internally and externally. Accurate dimensions are achieved internally with a machined fugitive graphite mandrel and externally by diamond grinding. The previous study of the effect of spray parameters on density was extended to determine the effect of the resulting density on the thermal shock characteristics on down-quenching and up-quenching. Encouraging results also prompted investigation of the use of plasma spraying as a method to construct a melt pour exit stopper that is mechanically robust, thermal shock resistant, and not susceptible to attack by reactive melt additions. The Ames Laboratory operates two close-coupled high pressure gas atomizers. These two atomizers are designed to produce fine and coarse spherical metal powders (5 {mu} to 500 {mu} diameter) of many different metals and alloys. The systems vary in size, but generally the smaller atomizer can produce up to 5 kg of powder whereas the larger can produce up to 25 kg depending on the charge form and density. In order to make powders of such varying compositions, it is necessary to have melt systems capable of heating and containing the liquid charge to the desired superheat temperature prior to pouring through the atomization nozzle. For some metals and alloys this is not a problem; however for some more reactive and/or high melting materials this can pose unique challenges. Figure 1 is a schematic that illustrates the atomization system and its components...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} and locating foreign inclusions in a drilled cylindrical shaft includes {{the steps of}} positioning at least one logging tube within the drilled shaft in parallel relation to a longitudinal axis of the drilled shaft, providing a temperature sensing means, identifying a plurality of temperature locations along {{the extent of the}} logging <b>tube,</b> <b>pouring</b> concrete into the drilled shaft, covering the at least one logging tube and monitoring in real time the temperature at various depths and radial directions within the logging tube during the hydration phase of the concrete curing. Temperature readings that differ from expected readings are deemed positioned in the vicinity of an anomalous inclusion. The range over which these anomalous readings are detected, the magnitude of the variance, and the orientation are used to predict the size and location of anomalies prior to the full curing of the concrete...|$|R
50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Sitaram, a typical farmer in central India, seeking {{to provide for}} his family of five. Sitaram is faced with the difficulty of raising crops in the Indian monsoon climate. Despite his best efforts, Sitaram's field yields nothing but weeds. Sitaram's efforts to quench the thirst of his land lead him to dig a well. In the process of digging the well he strikes the dreadful black rock known as Kalichaat, and cracking Kalichaat and reaching water beneath will require measures beyond his means. To get the resources he needs, he approaches the local bank specifically established {{to meet the needs}} of farmers, only to realize that getting help there is even more complex than breaking Kalichaat. In his state of despair, the showering water <b>pouring</b> from a <b>tube</b> well drilling at his village makes him wonder why he can't have one on his land. Sitaram clings to this hope, regardless of the doubt expressed by his wife and many others. Sitaram must combat authorities, loan sharks, and religious gurus if he has any hope of giving his family a better future.|$|R
