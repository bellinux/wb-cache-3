40|$|Molecular {{simulation}} technique {{together with}} spectroscopic methods were utilized {{to study the}} phase separation behavior of thermoplastic elastomers. Several kinds of systems were investigated, which included diacetylene-containing <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers,</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers</b> with monodisperse hard segments, and a bio-degradable polyester elastomer. ^ For the semi-rigid segmented <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers,</b> {{we found that the}} chain rigidity of hard segment is the dominating factor responsible for their phase separation behavior. Chemical immiscibility, crystallization, and presence of hydrogen bonding are not necessary to drive phase separation even though they can promote it. ^ The phase diagrams for semi-rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers</b> associated with different lengths in hard/soft segments were explicitly calculated using molecular simulation technique based on rod-coil model. It was found that longer hard segment or shorter soft segments have higher degree of phase separation than their counterparts. This result was verified by vibrational spectroscopy. It was also shown that DSC is not appropriate to evaluate the phase composition of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers.</b> ^ The phase separation kinetics and the ultimate degree of phase separation for ultra-thin films of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomers</b> are different from their bulk forms. Hard segments will also show preferential orientation onto the substrate surface. These are the direct consequence of hard segment chain rigidity effect. All the experimental results were successfully reproduced by Monte Carlo simulation based on rod-coil model. ^ Finally, the phase transformation process and mechanical deformation process of a bio-degradable thermoplastic elastomer, PHO, was investigated by FT-Raman spectroscopy and normal coordinate analysis. The long side-chains of PHO will form more extended conformations when PHO undergoes crystallization. It was also found that the strain-induced crystallization and crystalline break-up are not significant for deformed sample. We proposed that the high permanent tensile set associated with PHO comes from the amorphous part rather than from the crystalline part of the system. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The thermal {{insulation}} properties of thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> nanocomposites were characterized at different heat fluxes. Thermo-plastic <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> was modified with different loadings of montmorillonite nanoclays and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) via twin screw extrusion processing. The addition of nanoparticle into thermoplastic poly-urethane elastomer {{resulted in the}} formation of a char layer and modified the thermal insulative properties of the material. It was found that thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> with 10 wt % CNFs and with 5 wt % nanoclays gave the best thermal performance with respect to protecting a substrate. The surface temperature of the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer-clay nanocomposites did not vary much with addition of clay particles while the surface temperature of the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer-CNF nanocomposites varied more substantially. Some of the trends in surface and substrate temperature measurements with nanomodification can be described using a simple energy balance model that takes into account the basic heat transfer mechanisms.

40|$|Mechanical {{testing and}} {{modelling}} of a material for biomedical applications {{have to be}} based on conditions representative of the application of interest. In this work, an ether-based <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> is used to build mock arteries. The aim is to study the behaviour of arteries under pulsatile loading conditions and how that behaviour changes with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Polyurethane elastomers are widely used as biomaterials, e. g. in tube form for bypasses and catheters. However, their mechanical behaviour has not been extensively characterised. This work establishes the variations in the behaviour of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> with temperature, humidity and strain rate and also reports planar and equibiaxial tension, relaxation, creep and cyclic test results, providing a comprehensive characterisation of the material. Test results are used to determine the properties of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>elastomer</b> and in the selection of a representative material model for future simulations of arterial behaviour and the development of atherosclerosis. The results show that the behaviour of the elastomer is significantly dependent on both humidity and temperature, with Young’s modulus of 7. 4 MPa, 5. 3 MPa and 4. 7 MPa under dry-room temperature, wet-room temperature and wet at 37 ∘C conditions, respectively. The elastomer also exhibits rate-dependent viscoelastic behaviour. Yeoh’s hyperelastic material model provided the best fit to the entire range of experimental data. The Neo-Hookean model provides a good fit at small strain but significantly diverges at large strains. Nevertheless, in applications where deformations are relatively small, i. e. below 15 %, the Neo-Hookean model can be used...|$|E
