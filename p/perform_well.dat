5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative.

5|$|Dumbo, in {{production}} during {{the midst of}} the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941 and proved to be a financial success.

Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, Bambi was released, and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia, did not <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> at the box office.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the concept of}} a propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA), discusses pilot controls, displays, and procedures; and presents the results of a PCA piloted simulation test and evaluation of the B 747 - 400 airplane conducted at NASA Ames Research Center in December, 1996. The purpose of the tests was to develop and evaluate propulsion control throughout the full flight envelope of the B 747 - 400 including worse case scenarios of engine failures and out of trim moments. Pilot ratings of PCA performance ranged from adequate to satisfactory.

5|$|Sea lions have color vision, {{though it}} {{is limited to the}} blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an {{adaptation}} for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. Sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still <b>perform</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
