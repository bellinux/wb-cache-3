40|$|AbstractIn the Philippines, {{there has}} been a growing {{population}} of businesses engaging in the industry of providing personal care services. From the statistics provided by the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics, in 2008 to 2010, {{there has been}} a 34. 7 % increase in the people employed in this sector. [1] These services include that of salons, with pedicure and manicure services consisting 23 % and 19 % respectively. [2] Manicurists and <b>pedicurists</b> suffer severe discomfort and pain due to the awkward posture and repetitive motions involved in their work. Manicurists and <b>pedicurists</b> are commonly seen hunching over, bowing and tilting their heads, and sitting in stools lower than their popliteal height. Because of this, the proponents of this study aim to design an ergonomically-fit chair suitable for manicurists and <b>pedicurists.</b> In line with this goal, the proponents conducted a survey in areas near the University of the Philippines Diliman to backup observations regarding the workersâ€™ working posture and ailments occurring due to this. The need to change their working posture was analyzed through Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) and necessary anthropometric measurements were obtained. From the survey conducted among the workers, the body parts which most often experienced pain were the neck, shoulders, and back. In addition, the legs, back, and hands were the areas perceived to experience the most severe pain while working. The legs and the back were also seen to be the areas where pain frequently occurs, as well as the chest part. Furthermore, the nature of their job entails that manicurists and <b>pedicurists</b> frequently tilt and bow their heads while working. These factors were taken into consideration for the design of the chair. Postures of the workers were evaluated by the proponents to support the claims of the participants. REBA of their working posture revealed that manicurists and <b>pedicurists</b> adopt high-risk postures that require immediate investigation to implement change. Using all the data gathered, the proponents designed a chair allowing workers to have a better posture. Regarding the improved ergonomic chair design for nail salon workers, it was suggested that further studies could include customer's anthropometric measurements to supplement the design of the chair {{and come up with a}} better set up beneficial for both the worker and the customer. In addition, attention should also be paid to the selection of the materials used in the chair...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The risk of {{microbial}} transmission potentially increases when manicurists and <b>pedicurists</b> {{are unaware}} of or do not use biosecurity procedures. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and adherence to biosecurity procedures for manicurists/pedicurists who work in beauty salons. This was a cross-sectional survey with manicurists in beauty salons and in a technical school of podiatry, which evaluated the adherence to and knowledge of biosecurity procedures, with 75 % of correct answers taken as the minimum for adequate adherence and knowledge. A total of 84 manicurists/pedicurists were interviewed, all female. There was poor adherence {{to the use of}} personal protection equipment (45 %) and to methods of reprocessing equipment. The oven was the most widely used method of sterilizing, insufficient for cleaning and decontamination of material. A significant portion did not use an apron/uniform or closed shoes at work. The intervening factor most cited for non-adherence to the measures was the lack of information. The results reinforce the need for increased assistance regarding biosecurity procedures for professionals in this sector. DESCRIPTORS: Beauty and aesthetic centers. Podiatry.

40|$|The {{estimated}} rate for Hepatitis B is 6. 9 per hundred thousand in Turkey. The prevention of transmission {{is a crucial}} strategy particularly for adults {{since there is no}} comprehensive immunization program targeting them. A cross-sectional survey was carried out {{in order to determine the}} knowledge, attitude and practices of manicure-pedicurists in the Maltepe district of Istanbul. Face to face interviews were conducted with 55 manicure-pedicurists and infection prevention measures were evaluated in their work places. 98 % of the participants stated that they used sterilization as an infection prevention measure. However it was observed that the equipments used for sterilization were not reliable and effective. Moreover they were applying different methods for decontamination before the sterilization process. Only two of the participants were using sodium hypochloride, but they were not using it appropriately. We can conclude that there are risks for Hepatitis B transmission through the practices of manicure and <b>pedicurists.</b> Supervision as well as training aimed to improve the skills for infection prevention is needed targeting manicure-pedicurists.

50|$|In March 2010, when Li Hongzhong, then Governor of Hubei, was {{attending}} the 11th National People's Congress in Beijing, Beijing Times journalist Liu Jie {{asked him to}} comment on the case of Deng Yujiao, a Hubei <b>pedicurist</b> who killed a government official who tried to rape her. Li refused {{to comment on the}} case, which was considered an embarrassment to the government of Hubei, and instead grabbed the recorder from her. The incident was widely reported in Chinese media, but Li refused to apologize to Liu Jie, stating that she stuttered when he asked her which newspaper she represented, and that he was unsure about her identity. A week later, at least 210 intellectuals and journalists, including dramatist Sha Yexin, scholars Cui Weiping and Hu Yong, and the prominent former People's Daily editor Zhou Ruijin, signed an open letter demanding Li to resign.|$|E
5000|$|In her 2009 essay, From Darna to Zsazsa Zaturnnah: Desire and Fantasy and Other Way, Reyes {{compared}} two Filipino superheroines {{existing in}} contemporary Philippine {{popular culture and}} literature, namely Darna and Zsazsa Zaturnnah. According to Reyes, Darna was the modern-day superheroine rooted and molded in Philippine folklore and tradition, while ZsaZsa Zaturnnah was [...] "unarguably a postmodern text that could have emerged only in the twenty-first century, a period of awesome advances in science and technology, and/or frightening borderless wars." [...] Reyes's use of the phrase postmodern hero or postmodern text to describe ZsaZsa Zaturnnah the superheroine and graphic novel was further explained by Emilou Lindsay Mata Mendoza and Irene Villarin Gonzaga in their Visual Literacy and Popular Culture in the Philippine Literature Classroom: Teaching Filipino Literature through the Graphic Novel, as a comparison between Darna, the female superhero, and ZsaZsa Zaturnnah, the effeminate superhero. Darna was the traditional mold of a Filipino superheroine (gender-wise, a true female superhero) while ZsaZsa Zaturnnah was an [...] "outright subversion" [...] of the conventional form of that superheroine. Because ZsaZsa Zaturnnah is, in reality, a homosexual male or [...] "gay man" [...] named Ada (from Adrian) {{who works as a}} beautician (i.e. cosmetologist, hair stylist, manicurist, and <b>pedicurist),</b> but is able to transform himself into [...] "a voluptuous, red-haired Darna-like real woman who possesses super powers" [...] whenever he swallows a magical stone and shouts the word [...] "Zaturnnah". In short, ZsaZsa Zaturnnah is in reality a man who literally experiences a sex/gender change whenever he becomes the superheroine.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{occupational}} skin and respiratory diseases {{have been more}} and more frequently diagnosed in small production and service enterprises. The awareness of occupational exposure and its possible health effects among their workers and employers is not sufficient. Beauty salons, in addition to hairdressers and beauticians, frequently employ manicurists and pedicurists. The workers often happen to perform various activities interchangeably. The health status of beauty salons workers has rarely been assessed. The most numerous reports concern hairdressers. In this occupational group, the occurrence of skin lesions induced by wet work and frequent allergy to metals, hair dyes and bleaches and perm solutions has been emphasized, while information about health hazards for being a manicurist or <b>pedicurist</b> in beauty salons is seldom reported. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present professional activities (manicure and pedicure, methods of nail stylization), occupational exposure and literature data on work-related adverse health effects in manicurists and pedicurists. Wet work and exposure to solvents, fragrances, resins, metals, gum, detergents may cause skin disorders (contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, photodermatoses), conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, respiratory tract diseases, including asthma. The discussed occupations are also associated with the increased incidence of bacterial (particularly purulent), viral and fungal infections and cancer. Med Pr 2013; 64 (4) : 579 â€“ 59...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY â€“ {{patients}} with diabetes mellitus often suffer from diabetic foot syndrome, a con-dition leading to foot ulceration or even amputation of lower extremity. peripheral neuropathy com-bined with repetitive {{trauma to the}} foot and peripheral vascular disease are the main etiological factors {{in the development of}} foot ulcers. Other major contributive factors include the effects of callus, increased plantar pressures, and local infections. patient education concerning their disease has {{a central role in the}} prevention of foot ulcers. Ordinary preventive measures taken by the pati-ent include regular self-inspections, appropriate daily hygiene of the feet, appropriate footwear to reduce plantar pressures, and medical pedicure performed by a <b>pedicurist</b> experienced in diabetic foot patients. The importance of callus in diabetic patients has been shown in several studies by high predictability of subsequent ulcer development in {{patients with}} plantar calluses. For removing callus, urea based preparations are considered to be the treatment of choice. In case of local bacterial and fungal diabetic foot infections, systemic antibiotic and systemic antimycotic therapy is indicated, respectively. wound dressings of various types are the mainstay in the treatment of chronic foot ulcers with avoidance of occlusive dressings in infected ulcers. Since the vast majority of ulcers and amputations can be prevented in diabetic patients, proper diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach are essential...|$|E
40|$|Bleeding due to {{the habit}} of {{removing}} the cuticles of the finger and toes nails, without appropriate sterilization of instruments {{can be an important}} factor of contamination by hepatitis B and C viruses. The objectives of this study were to verify the use of standards on biosafety in the routine work of manicurists and/or pedicurists located in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; know the level of information they have about ways of transmission and prevention of hepatitis B and C; evaluate the degree of risk perception for accidental exposure to infectious agents; and to estimate the prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B and C among them. This was descriptive, cross-sectional study that included a random sample of 100 manicurists and/or pedicurists working in beauty salons. We administered a questionnaire to obtain personal information about the characteristics of the participants, collected blood for hepatitis B and C serology and assessed the working environment. Adherence to the professional standards on biosafety has been inadequate, and we noted that only 5 % used disposable gloves, none washed their hands, 93 % did not previously cleaned their working material and only 7 % used disposable materials. A low level of knowledge about the routes of transmission, prevention, standards of biosafety, and risk perception of the infectious agents in their professional activity was observed. One out of ten interviewed manicurist and/or <b>pedicurist</b> had serological markers of hepatitis B or C, with 8 % of hepatitis B and 2 % of hepatitis...|$|E
