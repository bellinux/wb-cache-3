40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{breadth of}} {{literature}} exists that explores {{the utilization of}} research evidence in <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> processes. From this work, {{a number of studies}} suggest research evidence is applied to <b>change</b> processes by <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> stakeholders primarily through instrumental, conceptual, and/or symbolic applications, or is not used at all. Despite the expansiveness of research on <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> processes, a deficit exists in understanding the role of research evidence during change processes related to the implementation of structural interventions for HIV prevention among injection drug users (IDU). This study examined the role of research evidence in <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> processes for the implementation of publicly funded syringe exchange services in three US cities: Baltimore, MD, Philadelphia, PA, and Washington, DC. MethodsIn-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with key stakeholders (n= 29) from each of the study cities. Stakeholders were asked about the historical, social, political, and scientific contexts in their city during the <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> process. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for common themes pertaining to applications of research evidence. ResultsIn Baltimore and Philadelphia, the typological approaches (instrumental and symbolic/conceptual, respectively) to the applications of research evidence used by harm reduction proponents contributed to the momentum for securing <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> for the implementation of syringe exchange services. Applications of research evidence were less successful in DC because policymakers had differing ideas about the implications of syringe exchange program implementation and because opponents of <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> used evidence incorrectly or not at all in <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> discussions. ConclusionTypological applications of research evidence are useful for understanding <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> processes, but their efficacy falls short when sociopolitical factors complicate legislative processes. Advocates for harm reduction may benefit from understanding how to effectively integrate research evidence into <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> processes in ways that confront the myriad of factors that influence <b>policy</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R

Using empirical evidence from Dutch and Hungarian water <b>policy</b> <b>change,</b> we discuss whether individuals pursued these strategies to support or oppose major <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> Our analysis showed the significance of recognition of a new policy concept at an abstract level by responsible government actors, {{as well as their}} engagement with a credible regional coalition that can contextualise and advocate the concept regionally.

An interpretive synthesis was undertaken. Setting: International, national, state and local government jurisdictions within high-income, democratic countries. - Results Sixty-three studies were selected for inclusion. Numerous themes were identified explaining the barriers and enablers to <b>policy</b> <b>change,</b> all of which fell under the overarching category, ‘political will’, underpinned by a second major category, ‘public will’. Sub-themes, including pressure from industry; neoliberal ideology; use of emotions and values, and being visible were prevalent in describing links between public will, political will and <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> - Conclusions The frustration around lack of public <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> in nutrition frequently stems from a belief that policymaking is a rational process in which evidence is used to assess the relative costs and benefits of options. The findings from this review confirm that evidence is only one component of influencing <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> For <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> to occur there needs to be the political will, and often the public will, for the proposed policy problem and solution.

5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived <b>policy</b> <b>changes</b> following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

Teachers indeed are the key role-players in this implementation phase and are unfortunately, more often than not, the silent voices in this process, ignored and discounted in this stage of educational change. How they experience and understand the <b>policy</b> <b>change,</b> or how the human side of <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> is contextualized, remains a mystery to be explored and explained. Furthermore, despite the growing literature on educational <b>change</b> and <b>policy</b> <b>change,</b> relatively little has been done on the experiences of primary school teachers and <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> in the context of developing countries such as South Africa. Available international literature on teachers’ experiences of <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> relates mostly to educational practices that are well-resourced, where teachers are highly qualified, and teacher-student ratios are low. It appears reasonable to assume that teachers’ experiences of education <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> in developing South African circumstances would be influenced and constructed by the contexts in which they work. The broad purpose of this inquiry is to describe and explain primary school teachers’ experiences of education <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> in South Africa. The immediate objective is to obtain new, deeper and more complex understandings of the less obvious issues that influence teachers’ roles as implementers of education <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> This study was conducted in an interpretive or qualitative mode. The following key question guided this investigation. How do primary school teachers experience education <b>policy</b> <b>change?</b> Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and open-ended questionnaires were utilized in this study. This data was transcribed, and analysed using computer-aided qualitative data software, Atlas. ti. The data was analysed inductively, using open coding and a grounded theory approach. This approach facilitated the coding process of the data. The data was interpreted {{on the basis of the}} literature, and presented in the last two chapters of this report. The findings from this inquiry revealed four significant and interdependent themes, with a variety of sub-themes, which appear meaningful in understanding education <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> from the perspectives of teachers. These include the affective domain, emotional responses and contestations, issues relating to discipline and control, outcomes-based education, and lastly matters of values, teacher roles and their view of professionalism. While the contributions of this inquiry are not original in the sense of a prototype, the findings could add to the knowledge base of the complexities of education <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> Some further questions are raised, which emerged during the inquiry and which might contribute to additional investigations on a wider spectrum and launch some critical debates on education <b>policy</b> <b>change.</b> The inquiry yields some concluding thoughts, which may inform <b>policy</b> <b>change</b> and its implementation.

5|$|The protests {{were part}} of the Buddhist crisis, during which the Buddhist {{majority}} in South Vietnam campaigned for religious equality after nine people were killed by government forces while defying a ban that prevented them from flying the Buddhist flag on Vesak. The incident prompted the United States to privately threaten to withdraw support for Diệm's government and when the Americans finally reduced aid a few months later, the army took it as a green light for a coup. An inquiry determined that the chemical used in the attack was a liquid component from old French tear gas grenades that had never functioned properly. The findings exonerated the ARVN soldiers from charges that they had used poison or mustard gas. The outcry over the attack had already forced Diệm to appoint a panel of three cabinet ministers to meet with Buddhist leaders for negotiations regarding religious equality.

With the opposition-controlled Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives, albeit a slightly reduced one, and picked up three Senate seats.The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only 1974 joint sitting enabled under s. 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession, continued to obstruct the government's program in the Senate. In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House in order to call a half-Senate election. Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide.|$|E
