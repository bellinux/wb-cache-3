40|$|Natural populations often show {{variation}} in traits {{that can affect}} the strength of interspecific interactions. Interaction strengths in turn influence the fate of pairwise interacting populations and the stability of food webs. Understanding the mechanisms relating individual phenotypic variation to interaction strengths is thus central to assess how trait variation affects population and community dynamics. We incorporated nonheritable {{variation in}} attack rates and handling times into a classical consumer–resource model to investigate how variation may alter interaction strengths, population dynamics, species <b>persistence,</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> We found that individual variation influences species persistence through its effect on interaction strengths. In many scenarios, interaction strengths decrease with variation, which in turn affects species coexistence and stability.

30|$|<b>Persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> {{are crucial}} for risk {{assessment}} as performed by EFSA [79]. However, clear regulatory criteria are missing {{on how to}} deal with genetically engineered organisms, which are likely to be impossible to retrieve from the environment [78]. The EFSA Guidance for environmental risk assessment [79] does not foresee the rejection of applications for genetically engineered plants, just because they are persistent and/or invasive. In fact, EFSA does not consider these biological characteristics to be a risk per se. The application is only likely to be rejected if it is already known at the time of the application that that the genetically engineered plant will lead to a reduction in biodiversity or impair ecological functions: The risk assessment should conclude on (1) the impact of the GM plant and/or hybridising relatives in the production system, particularly through increased weediness and more intense weed control; (2) the impact of the GM plant and/or hybridising relatives in semi-natural and natural habitats, through change in invasiveness or reduction of biodiversity or ecological function; (3) why any anticipated harm may be considered acceptable; and (iv) what risk management measures may be required to mitigate any harm.

RNAi-mediated knockdown of fascin in ESCC cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> whereas forced expression of fascin in immortalized esophageal epithelial cells accelerated cell proliferation <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> To explore the underlying mechanism, cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differential gene expression profiles between a fascin-depleted cell line by RNAi and the corresponding control ESCC cells. Results showed that 296 genes were differentially expressed on fascin depletion. In this study, we focused on two down-regulated genes: CYR 61 and CTGF.

30|$|In many cases, {{a higher}} degree of {{domestication}} will lead to a lower potential to survive under natural conditions [54]. However, some domesticated grasses (Poaceae) still have a high potential for <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> The history of rice provides some useful examples in this context: Rice was domesticated twice after a period of de-domestication [55]. Creeping bentgrass in the USA is a further example [5 – 9]. This issue is highly relevant in the context of agrofuels, where grass species {{with a high degree of}} invasiveness such as Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) are cultivated. In the case of sorghum (Sorghum sp.) which has wild weedy relatives within the group of Poaceae, this is an issue that needs to be considered [56, 57]. Finally, genetically engineered rice such as the so-called Golden Rice [58] grown in regions where weedy rice populations exist is likely to show a substantial potential for gene flow and persistence as well as invasion of other rice fields. One important reason for this is permanent gene flow between the cultivated and the weedy rice [59, 60].|$|E
30|$|About 20  years {{after the}} market {{introduction}} of the first GM plants, we review whether or not uncontrolled spread occurred. We summarise cases documented in the scientific literature and derive conclusions for the regulation of the authorisation of new events. Several cases documented in North and Central America and Japan show that transgenes have spread beyond cultivation areas. Important examples are bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifer a), oilseed rape (Brassica napu s) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Several factors can be identified as relevant for transgene dispersal in the environment. Grasses (Poaceae), in particular, show a high potential for <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> and wild relatives that can cross with the crop plants are {{a major factor in}} the unintended spread of the transgenes. There are significant uncertainties in predicting which transgenes will escape and how they will interact with the environment. For example, climate change is likely to have a major impact on the invasive potential of some plant species. The uncontrolled spread of transgenes is therefore a remaining challenge for regulators. We discuss some of these issues in the context of EU regulations since these regulations explicitly refer to the precautionary principle in the assessment of uncertainties. We found the that the precautionary principle as established in EU Directive 2001 / 18 can only be applied where efficient measures are available to remove genetically engineered organisms from the environment should this become necessary. If a removal from the environment would not be practically feasible, undesirable developments could not be mitigated.|$|E

The EFSA GMO Panel assessed whether the submitted documentation comprised new scientific information that would change or invalidate the conclusions of its previous risk assessments on oilseed rape GT 73. The EFSA GMO Panel also considered the relevance of the concerns raised by Austria {{in the light of the}} most recent data published in the scientific literature. The authorised uses of oilseed rape GT 73 exclude cultivation, but data on gene flow, <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> derived from cultivation were considered as a worst case, representing conditions where exposure and potential impact are expected to be the highest, to assess possible environmental impacts resulting from seed import spills. In the documentation provided by Austria and in the scientific literature, the EFSA GMO Panel could not identify new scientific evidence that indicates that the import and processing of oilseed rape GT 73 for feed uses in the EU pose a significant and imminent risk to the environment. In conclusion, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that, based on the documentation supplied by Austria and a review of recent scientific literature, there is no specific scientific evidence in terms of risk to the environment that would support the notification of a safeguard clause measure under Article 23 of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC nor its prolongation, and that would invalidate its previous risk assessments of oilseed rape GT 73...|$|E

40|$|In {{this talk}} I will {{highlight}} various experiments and modelling efforts for testing {{the possibilities for}} escape, <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of transgenes. I do not pretend to give a definitive answer on the question which methods {{should be used for}} conducting Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for abiotic stress transgenes. Though as an awareness session, I would like to overview several fitness interactions between environment and plants causing potential invasiveness that have been experimentally studied and modelled over the last 10 years. Various overview studies have been published providing wider results and questions, which can provide further guidance (Ellstrand 2003; Andow & Zwahlen 2006; Chapman & Burke 2006; Chandler & Dunwell 2008). A compilation of such studies will provide a checklist of identified potential hazards which could be falsified using experimental data and model based explorations in time and space. It is such approach which is promoted in the proposed new EFSA guidance document on ERA of genetically modified plants (EFSA 2010). The framework I am using here is based on this guidance, leading through a hierarchical set of questions which I group into the following: (i) indications within biological information of the species itself and it wild relatives for invasiveness (ii) potential persistence of the transgene in plants under agricultural conditions; (iii) potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in ferals and (iv) potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in closely related species. Using biological information: asking whether a GM plant can grow and reproduce under current conditions and whether it can hybridize with sympatric plants (relatives or native ferals). This asks for basic but full life-cycle information about the species, reproduction and survival ability, both above and below ground (Hails & Morley 2005). Certainly the outcrossing pathway has been well described for many species (Ellstrand 2003; Armstrong et al. 2005). Hence the ability crops and wild relatives to hybridize is now generally accepted for most major crops and has been found even over long distances up to 21 km (Watrud et al. 2004; Reichman et al. 2006). However, this still could mean that de ERA for invasiveness could not potentially stop here: in the EU, corn has no wild relatives, which could make a difference in ERA in comparison to e. g., Northern America. Testing for persistence of the transgene in plants under agricultural conditions, i. e., volunteers and gene flow to other crops. Studies such as Warwick et al. (2008) and D’Hertefeldt et al. (2008) found transgenic plants to persist for several generations in agricultural fields. Simulation models as Genesys (Colbach et al. 2001) show that in systems including various crops, planted in rotations, such volunteers could persist and potentially spread through a whole area within 10 s of years (see also Claessen et al. 2005; Hooftman 2006). Even when volunteer populations do not become weedy, they could act as a genetic bridge between different cultivars and towards wild relatives (Hall et al. 2000; Reagon & Snow 2006). Transgenes have been found to persist for several years in and around agricultural fields through storage in volunteers and feral crop plants (Pessel et al. 2001; Pivard et al. 2008), potentially presenting such a hazard on a larger temporal scale. Appropriate estimation of the risks involved will vary much dependent {{on the quality of the}} life-cycle data available, in which it is important to gather all life-cycle data from repeated single experiments under non-optimal conditions (Hails & Morley 2005). Next to these simulation approaches, a wide range of population models has been developed over the last years, both matrix and integral models, which can be very useful for modelling population persistence: some examples are Bullock (1999); Thompson et al. (2003); Hall et al. (2006); Allainguillaume et al. (2006); Hooftman et al. (2007) and Damgaard & Kjaer (2009). The main question for volunteers to answer seems whether and how much populations decrease in the other crops in the years between growing the GM crop of interest. Persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment. For feral populations, second generation transgenes, like biotic stress tolerance, could differ fundamentally from first generation transgenes. The stress situation likely exists outside the field as well, whereas e. g., an herbicide tolerance is less likely to provide an advantage unless the herbicide is present. However, the non-agricultural environments are likely much more diverse than within agricultural fields, making controlled-environment studies (greenhouse and lab) less applicable. Field-based studies seem necessary here to a range of conditions to test for environment x genotype interactions (Mercer et al. 2006; Ridley & Ellstrand 2009). Garnier & Lecomte (2006 a; 2006 b) developed a further set of matrix approaches that can be used, next to the ones mentioned above. Potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in closely related species. Few studies have shown a direct relationship of transgenes with fitness in early hybrid generations (e. g., Snow et al. 2003). More likely, the initial persistence of the transgene depends strongly on processes surrounding plant fitness, which are transgene related. However, certainly with transgenes for tolerance for abiotic stress, the transgene is likely to be part of a, limited, package of genes which could provide a fitness advantage over time. So any test for differences between transgenic and non-transgenic races likely has to follow the same methods as most studies done on non-GM crops. Fitness analyses and the long-term persistence of such hybrids has been studied to a large extent in species such as Lactuca (Hooftman et al., 2005; 2007), Brassica (Allainguillaume et al. 2006; Jorgensen et al. 2009), Helianthus (Reagon & Snow 2006; Rieseberg et al. 2003; 2007) and Raphanus (Snow et al. 2001; 2010; Campbell et al. 2006; 2009; Ridley & Ellstrand 2009). A wide variety of population models as mentioned above is available for analyses. However, fitness analyses are far from straightforward in hybrids in terms of experiments. Recent studies by Campbell et al. (2009) and Hooftman et al. (2010) have shown that experiments should take multiple generations under selective conditions, since sorting among genotypes could lead to better performance than assumed on early generation hybrids only. This can have clear effects on the population structure and the total presence of the transgene in populations, certainly under a relative invariable selection pressure as an adverse abiotic stress will provide (Hooftman et al. 2008). Also the competive ability of hybrids compared to the parental species might be altered (Hauser et al. 2003; Vacher et al. 2004) or even differ under varying levels of stress (Mercer et al. 2007). Recently genetic hitchhiking and position of transgenes on the genome have gained increasing attention (see Uwimana et al. in this session). Furthermore, recent evidence in Brassica points to large scale difference in introgression rate and fitness of hybrids between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA fragments (Allainguillaume et al. 2009). In conclusion, all the experimental evidence on both transgenic and non-transgenic crop systems indicates that an integrative approach asking a hierarchical range of ecological questions is needed. Assuming the phenotypic change, caused by the transgene in the crop, will be similar in plants after escape is often proved plainly wrong. Many methods exist to get a better understanding. Abiotic stress presents certainly new challenges in environments and interactions to deal with, since it could provide substantial niche shifts of plant species. Regulators, industry and other stakeholders will have to decide how to acknowledge those interactions between environments, the transgene and plant biology in general. In this we will have to realize that GM plants might present other risks than their conventional counterparts or present new hazards not provided by such counterparts.

40|$|Abstract Background Neuroblastoma is {{a severe}} {{pediatric}} tumor, histologically characterised {{by a variety}} of cellular phenotypes. One of the pharmacological approaches to neuroblastoma is the treatment with retinoic acid. The mechanism of action of retinoic acid is still unclear, and the development of resistance to this differentiating agent is a great therapy problem. Doublecortin, a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration, has recently been proposed as a molecular marker for the detection of minimal residual disease in human neuroblastoma. Nevertheless, no information is available on the expression of doublecortin in the different cell-types composing human neuroblastoma, its correlation with neuroblastoma cell motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> <b>and</b> the possible modulations exerted by retinoic acid treatment. Methods We analysed by immunofluorescence and by Western blot analysis the presence of doublecortin, lissencephaly- 1 (another protein involved in neuronal migration) and of two intermediate filaments proteins, vimentin and neurofilament- 68, in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line both in control conditions and under retinoic acid treatment. Migration <b>and</b> cell <b>invasiveness</b> studies were performed by wound scratch test and a modified microchemotaxis assay, respectively. Results Doublecortin is expressed in two cell subtypes considered to be the more aggressive and that show high migration capability <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> Vimentin expression is excluded by these cells, while lissencephaly- 1 and neurofilaments- 68 are immunodetected in all the cell subtypes of the SK-N-SH cell line.

Methods Cells from a cutaneous squamous carcinoma cell line, A 431, were treated with baicalein at 0 - 60 μM to establish the non-cytotoxic concentration (NCC) range for baicalein. Following treatment with baicalein within this range, total Ezrin protein (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms) and phosphorylated-Ezrin (phos-Ezrin) were detected by western blotting, and Ezrin RNA was detected in A 431 cells using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thereafter, the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of A 431 cells following baicalein treatment were determined using wound-healing and Boyden chamber invasion assays. Short-interfering RNA (si-RNA) specifically targeting Ezrin was transfected into A 431 cells, and a si-RNA Ezrin-A 431 cell line was established by G 418 selection. This stable cell line was transiently transfected with Ezrin and mutant Ezrin plasmids, <b>and</b> its motilityand <b>invasiveness</b> was subsequently determined to clarify whether bacailein inhibits these processes through Ezrin. Results We determined the range of NCCs for baicalein to be 2. 5 - 40 μM in A 431 cells. Baicalein displayed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of expressions of total Ezrin and phos-Ezrin within this range NCCs. In addition, it exerted this inhibitory effect through the reduction of Ezrin RNA transcript. Baicalein also inhibited the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of A 431 skin carcinoma cells within the range of NCCs, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A 431 cell motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> were inhibited by 73 % and 80 % respectively when cells were treated with 20 μM baicalein. However, the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of A 431 cells containing the Ezrin mutant were not effectively inhibited by baicalein. Conclusions Baicalein reduces the migration <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of A 431 cells through the inhibition of Ezrin expression, which leads to the suppression of tumor metastasis. </p...|$|R

40|$|The epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{is a crucial}} process, occurring both during development and tumor progression, by which an epithelial cell undergoes a conversion to a mesenchymal phenotype, dissociates from initial contacts and migrates to secondary sites. We recently reported that in hepatocytes the multifunctional cytokine TGFbeta induces a full EMT characterized by (i) Snail induction, (ii) E-cadherin delocalization and down-regulation, (iii) down-regulation of the hepatocyte transcriptional factor HNF 4 alpha and (iv) up-regulation of mesenchymal <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> markers. In particular, we showed that Snail directly causes the transcriptional down-regulation of E-cadherin and HNF 4, {{while it is not}} sufficient for the up-regulation of mesenchymal <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> EMT markers. In this paper, we show that in hepatocytes TGFbeta induces a Src-dependent activation of the focal adhesion protein FAK. More relevantly, we gathered results indicating that FAK signaling is required for (i) transcriptional up-regulation of mesenchymal <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> markers <b>and</b> (ii) delocalization of membrane-bound E-cadherin. Our results provide the first evidence of FAK functional role in TGFbeta-mediated EMT in hepatocytes...|$|R

40|$|The cell {{adhesion}} molecule E-cadherin has been implicated in maintaining the polarized phenotype of epithelial cells <b>and</b> suppression of <b>invasiveness</b> <b>and</b> motility of carcinoma cells. Na,K-ATPase, consisting of an �- and �-subunit, maintains the sodium gradient across the plasma membrane. A functional relationship between E-cadherin and Na,K-ATPase has not previously been described. We present evidence that the Na,K-ATPase {{plays a crucial role}} in E-cadherin– mediated development of epithelial polarity, <b>and</b> suppression of <b>invasiveness</b> <b>and</b> motility of carcinoma cells. Moloney sarcoma virus-transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MSV-MDCK) have highly reduced levels of E-cadherin and � 1 -subunit of Na,K-ATPase. Forced expression of E-cadherin in MSV-MDCK cells did not reestablish epithelial polarity or inhibit the <b>invasiveness</b> <b>and</b> motility of these cells. In contrast, expression of E-cadherin and Na,K-ATPase � 1 -subunit induced epithelial polarization, including the formation of tight junctions <b>and</b> desmosomes, abolished <b>invasiveness,</b> <b>and</b> reduced cell motility in MSV-MDCK cells. Our results suggest that E-cadherin–mediated cell-{{cell adhesion}} requires the Na,K-ATPase �-subunit’s function to induce epithelial polarization <b>and</b> suppress <b>invasiveness</b> <b>and</b> motility of carcinoma cells.

40|$|Objective　To survey whether miR- 200 b {{suppresses}} proliferation <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of glioma cells by targeted {{regulation of}} protein kinase Cα (PKCα) expression, and {{to investigate the}} molecular mechanism of antitumor effect of miR- 200 b. Methods　PKCα 3 '-UTR-luciferase vector was constructed and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay {{was employed to examine}} the effect of miR- 200 b on PKCα 3 '-UTR-luciferase activity. U 87 cells were transfected with miR- 200 b mimics, and the expression of PKCα protein was determined by Western blotting. U 87 cells were transfected with PKCα siRNA, and then the changes in cellular proliferation <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> were observed by MTS method and Transwell assay, respectively. Results　Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR- 200 b could bind to 3 '-UTR of PKCα mRNA specifically and inhibited the luciferase activity. Expression of PKCα mRNA and protein decreased significantly in U 87 cells overexpressing miR- 200 b. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of PKCα could suppress the potentials of proliferation <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of U 87 cells. Conclusion　miR- 200 b could inhibit the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells via targeted regulation of PKCα expression. DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2013. 10. 01...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic cancers are {{aggressive}} {{because they}} are highly invasive and highly metastatic; moreover, effective treatments for aggressive pancreatic cancers are lacking. Here, we report that the motor kinesin protein KIF 20 A promoted the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of pancreatic cancer cells through transporting the RNA-binding protein IGF 2 BP 3 and IGF 2 BP 3 -bound transcripts toward cell protrusions along microtubules. We previously reported that IGF 2 BP 3 and its target transcripts are assembled into cytoplasmic stress granules of pancreatic cancer cells, and that IGF 2 BP 3 promotes the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of pancreatic cancer cells through regulation of localized translation of IGF 2 BP 3 -bound transcripts in cell protrusions. We show that knockdown of KIF 20 A inhibited accumulation of IGF 2 BP 3 -containing stress granules in cell protrusions and suppressed local protein expression from specific IGF 2 BP 3 -bound transcripts, ARF 6 and ARHGEF 4, in the protrusions. Our results {{provide insight into the}} link between regulation of KIF 20 A-mediated trafficking of IGF 2 BP 3 -containing stress granules and modulation of the motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> in pancreatic cancers...|$|R
40|$|The apoptosis-inducing death {{receptor}} CD 95 (APO- 1 /Fas) {{controls the}} homeostasis of many tissues. Despite its apoptotic potential, most human tumors are refractory to the cytotoxic effects of CD 95 ligand. We now show that CD 95 stimulation of multiple apoptosis-resistant tumor cells by CD 95 ligand induces increased motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> a response much less efficiently triggered by TNFα or TRAIL. Three signaling pathways resulting in activation of NF-κB, Erk 1 / 2 and caspase- 8 {{were found to}} be important to this novel activity of CD 95. Gene chip analyses of a CD 95 -stimulated tumor cell line identified a number of potential survival genes and genes that are known to regulate increased motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness</b> of tumor cells to be induced. Among these genes, urokinase plasminogen activator was found to be required for the CD 95 ligand-induced motility <b>and</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> Our data suggest that CD 95 L, which is found elevated in many human cancer patients, has tumorigenic activities on human cancer cells. This could become highly relevant during chemotherapy, which can cause upregulation of CD 95 ligand by both tumor and nontumor cells...|$|R
