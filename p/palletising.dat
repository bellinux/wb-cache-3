40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} robots of today are programmed by using programing units or designated software programs on separate computers (off-line). Despite {{the fact that}} manufacturers of {{industrial robots}} offer a very capable simulation software, off-line programing is not commonly used for <b>palletising</b> with industrial robots. One of the reasons are also {{the costs associated with}} the purchase of the simulation software. The aim of our investigation tries to establish when using the simulation software in projects, involving <b>palletising</b> with industrial robots, is cost-efficient. Each of the variables significantly affecting projects are specified. Project phases in which using software has an important role are the phase of line building, to be validated from supplier’s point of view and the phase of production running, to be validated from the customer’s point of view. A threshold calculation is made in three parts. Recommendations for the robot solution providers are given with the goal of increasing the use of the simulation software in robotics applications...|$|E

40|$|A Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) {{occurs when}} {{identical}} rectangular boxes {{are to be}} stacked and packed on a rectangular pallet.

Much European manufacturing industry is heavily dependent on manual labour and therefore vulnerable to Far Eastern competitors, who {{have the advantage of}} lower labour costs. Automation is Europe's best hope of beating off this oriental challenge. This thesis describes a research programme to assess the benefits of automation to a particular industrial process, that of decoration of scale models of cars. The aim of the project is to replace a traditionally manual series of operations by flexible automation to provide the base for higherproductivity and a greater degree of responsiveness to product change, leading to just-in-time manufacture with reduced work-in-progress, while still retaining the high quality associated with the product. A proof-of-concept cell has been designed and commissioned using the Mechatronics approach. This means that all mechanical, electronic and computing possibilities have been taken into account and integrated from the first stage of the design process. The configuration of the proof-of-concept cell consists of five stations which provide the necessary functions for loading the modeis from the moulding machine into the cell, identifying the models and their positions, decorating and inspecting the models and finally, <b>palletising</b> them for assembly.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of ultrasonically welded wire splices. Crimping technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the wire splice manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of crimping machines and various what if scenarios were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire <b>palletising</b> system was designed to improve the productivity. This thesis concludes that ultrasonic welding could be very effectively used for wire splicing and could be safely used in the manufacture of wiring harnesses for the automobile industry...|$|E

The aim of the project described within this thesis is to investigate the replacement of a traditionally manual series of operations by flexible automation to provide the basis for higher productivity and a greater degree of responsiveness to product change, leading to Just In Time Manufacture with reduced Work In Progress, while still retaining the high quality traditionally associated with the product. This thesis presents one of the first working attempts to this end, represented by a proof-of­concept cell designed and commissioned for investigating the many problems and possibilities associated with the decoration of scale models of cars and trains. The cell was designed using the Mechatronics approach which means that the various mechanical, electrical and electronic and computing possibilities have been taken into account {{from the start of the}} design stage. The proof-of-concept cell consists of five stations which provide the necessary means of loading the models in the cell, identifying the models and their orientation, decorating the models, inspecting the decorated models and finally <b>palletising</b> them for assembly. The industrial partners for the project were Hornby Hobbies Limited, J-L Automation and Staubli Unimation. Because this project centres around the present decoration operations at Hornby Hobbies Limited, which is heavily dependant on pad printing, an overview of pad printing is included. This will give the reader a background to the problems faced during the project. Before describing the proof-of-concept cell and its hardware and software components, the present factory based method and the constraints put on the project by Hornby Hobbies Limited are explained so that the reasons for choices within the cell will be more readily understood.

40|$|Robotics have {{developed}} {{at a very}} high rate in the last few years. Industries are becoming capable of automating repetitive procedures without pause, and the production speed and quality are improving everyday. The main drawback of robotics in industry is the inability to deal with slight changes in an environment or in certain object parameters. This problem is very much present at Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) Cargo, therefore they want to automate parts of their product handling cycle. KLM Cargo handles 540 000 tons of cargo every year and their processing hub is located at Schiphol airport. A number of automation opportunities exist at this location, {{such as the use of}} Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV), smart planning algorithms and palletising/depalletising robots. This last point is addressed in this thesis. The automation of the palletising/depalletising procedure is highly complex for a number of reasons: large variety of packages to be handled, restrictions for orientation of packages, hazardous materials, and more. The planning of a <b>palletising</b> order can handle the orientation problem and the placement of hazardous cargo, but the variety in size, weight and shape of packages makes fully automated palletising/depalletising difficult. The process of handling the packages is performed by manual labour and with the help of forklift trucks. An ideal solution to compensate the arduous labour is to use physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). This concept allows a robot and human to handle cargo together to place it at a location. The current academic developments in human-robot collaborative object manipulation require known object dynamics and dimensions. This information is not known at KLM cargo, and therefore, the framework of human-robot collaborative object manipulation must be extended to allow for unknown object dynamics. One approach is currently being developed by using the Slotine and Li method of adaptive control. Unfortunately, this approach has a big drawback with regards to persistence of excitation. A new method utilizes fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (TS) system with the sector nonlinearity approach where payload information is included in the systems state vector. This approach allows an observer to estimate the payload parameters without the persistence of excitation limitation. This thesis shows the motivation for using the fuzzy approach and develop it for a two-link manipulator and compare its performance to the classical approach. While the classical approach works under persistence of excitation, a one link manipulator is shown to work without this condition. Two fuzzy observers were tested, the fuzzy Luenberger observer and a sliding mode observer. Unfortunately, for the two link manipulator a feasible observer gain is not found. The approach was tested again, but this time only to estimate the mass of the payload. Unfortunately, this did not yield a feasible observer either. In order to find out the reason for this infeasibility and create an approach that will obtain a feasible solution requires more analysis of the observability of the fuzzy system.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the study was two-fold, firstly to {{determine}} the effect of age on the capacity of manual materials handling workers and secondly to determine the effect of increasing task mechanisation on the workers’ responses to task demands. The first component of this study, namely Part I, 101 male and 12 female ‘unskilled’ manual workers – of various ages – from a brick manufacturing industry were assessed. Anthropometric, health and strength factors were measured to improve the understanding of the South African manual worker capacity and more specifically, the effect of age on this capacity. Data collection was done between 7. 30 am and 9. 30 am in a laboratory-type setting on-site. Anthropometric characteristics (including body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference and body fat percentage) provided information on the state of obesity and the impact of age in the South African context. Linked to this, the health factors (including blood pressure, resting heart rate and a self-reported questionnaire) provide an extra snapshot of the disease profile in South Africa, and could potentially influence other capacity factors. Isometric strength capacities (of eight different areas, namely: back, leg, bicep, shoulder, pinch, pinch and pull) demonstrated whether South African manual workers show the same decline in strength with aging as seen in industrially advanced countries. The second component of the study, Part II, was performed in situ and measured the workers’ responses to task demands of three brick <b>palletising</b> tasks, one manual (n= 21) and two with increasing mechanisation (n= 12 each). Spinal kinematics, joint forces and working heart rate were assessed on normal work days during a 30 -lift duration and body discomfort measures were taken at the start, middle and end of the work-shift. Spinal kinematics were measured dynamically using a lumbar motion monitor, whereas the spinal forces were estimated using the three dimensional static strength prediction program. The worker capacity results showed that waist to hip ratio, waist circumference and body fat percentage increased significantly with aging, whereas body mass index was not affected by age. All body morphology values were within ‘normal’ ranges. Although diastolic blood pressure increased significantly with age, systolic was not affected significantly by age. Both groups, however, showed an increasing prevalence of hypertension with aging. There were no significant changes in resting heart rate with aging, with a range of 66 bt. min⁻¹ to 74. 86 bt. min⁻¹, therefore within normal ranges. Of the strength factors, age only affected shoulder and push strength significantly: Showing a decrease in shoulder strength from 49. 89 kgF to 39. 91 kgF in the men aged 20 - 29 to the 50 - 59 respectively and an increase in push strength from men aged 30 - 39 and 40 - 49 to those aged 50 - 59. Part II results revealed highly frequent lift rates and large degrees of sagittal flexion and lateral bending in all three tasks. These postures adopted for long durations are likely to lead to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Heart rates of workers from the three tasks were significantly different and heart rates for two tasks were above the recommended 110 bt. min⁻¹. Similarly the body discomfort ratings of the three tasks differed, although a common trend was seen in that lower back pain was the most commonly reported area of discomfort in all tasks. South African manual materials handling males did not show the same responses to aging as men from industrially advanced countries, calling for further research into these differences. Due to the high risks of the three tasks assessed, future research and interventions are required {{to reduce the risk of}} injury in the assessed tasks...|$|E
