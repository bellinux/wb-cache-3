40|$|Background: Post-earthquake {{studies from}} around the world have {{reported}} that survivors relying on emergency food for prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time experienced several dietary related health problems. The present study aimed to quantify the potential nutrient production of urban agricultural vegetables and the resulting nutritional self-sufficiency throughout the year for mitigating post-disaster situations. Methods: We estimated the vegetable production of urban agriculture throughout the year. Two methods were developed to capture the production from professional and hobby farms: Method I utilized secondary governmental data on agricultural production from professional farms, and Method II was based on a supplementary spatial analysis to estimate the production from hobby farms. Next, the weight of produced vegetables [t] was converted into nutrients [kg]. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency by nutrient and time of year was estimated by incorporating the reference consumption of vegetables [kg], recommended dietary allowance of nutrients per capita [mg], and population statistics. The research was conducted in Nerima, the second most populous ward of Tokyo’s 23 special wards. Self-sufficiency rates were calculated with the registered residents. Results: The estimated total vegetable production of 5660 tons was equivalent to a weight-based <b>self-sufficiency</b> rate <b>of</b> 6. 18 %. The average nutritional <b>self-sufficiencies</b> <b>of</b> Methods I and II were 2. 48 % and 0. 38 %, respectively, resulting in an aggregated average of 2. 86 %. Fluctuations throughout the year were observed according to the harvest seasons of the available crops. Vitamin K (6. 15 %) had the highest <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> selected nutrients, while calcium had the lowest (0. 96 %). Conclusions: This study suggests that depending on the time of year, urban agriculture has the potential to contribute nutrients to diets during post-disaster situations as disaster preparedness food. Emergency responses should be targeted according to the time of year the disaster takes place to meet nutrient requirements in <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> low <b>self-sufficiency</b> and prevent gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular diseases among survivors...|$|R

40|$|Poultry meat is an {{important}} protein source in the human consumption. The main factors that {{have a positive effect}} on the development of the poultry industry are short production cycle, relatively low cost and the lack of religious restrictions on consumption. Chicken meat has the biggest share in the structure of poultry meat. The paper objective was to calculate the level <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> degree in poultry meat in Croatia in the period from 2000 to 2012 and the degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in 2016 based on the results obtained. The method of balancing was used for calculation <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> degree. The degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in the production of poultry meat in Croatia is higher than in other types of meat being between 80 and 90 %.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} residential solar-powered electrical energy storage systems. For this purpose, a simulation model based on MATLAB/Simulink is developed. Investigating both short-time and seasonal hydrogen-based storage systems, simulations {{on the basis of}} real weather data are processed on a timescale of 15 min for a consideration <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 3 years. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to identify the most important system parameters concerning the proportion of consumption and the degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency.</b> Therefore, the influences of storage capacity and of storage efficiencies are discussed. A short-time storage system can increase the proportion of consumption by up to 35 percentage points compared to a self-consumption system without storage. However, the seasonal storing system uses almost the entire energy produced by the photovoltaic (PV) system (nearly 100 % self-consumption). Thereby, the energy drawn from the grid can be reduced and a degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> about 90 % is achieved. Based on these findings, some scenarios to reach self-sufficiency are analyzed. The results show that full self-sufficiency will be possible with a seasonal hydrogen-based storage system if PV area and initial storage level are appropriate...|$|R

The first part contains a theoretical treatment of the subject. There is discussed the issue of hydrocephalus and the issue <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in self-care. In hydrocephalus, the author first examines in detail the anatomy of the cerebral ventricles and the creation, composition and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. The following is a detailed discussion {{about the nature of the}} disease itself, its types, causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Finally, there is analyzed the quality of life of patients with this disease. In the area of self- sufficiency, the author focuses on the very concept <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency,</b> starting with a general description of this term and continuously moving towards a description of its different aspects with regard to movement and physical activity the patient, his clothing and hygiene, emptying the urine and stool and nutrition. The second part is conceived as an empirical. There are evaluated, what was found by using a questionnaire survey. The author examines whether the patients were improved after surgery in specific areas <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency,</b> and if so, to what extent. Areas examined are self-sufficiency in food, hygiene, emptying, walking and dressing [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{compares the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> {{selected}} types of meat (beef, pork, and poultry) in the Visegrad countries. The data are obtained from Eurostat and from {{national statistical offices}} of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The rate <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is evaluated for the time period 2003 - 2013 and its results are compared to trade coverage ratio that indicates competitiveness of country in given commodity. Degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is an important indicator of country's ability to meet demand of domestic supply. From the obtained results, it can be concluded, that {{the situation in the}} Czech Republic with regard to self-sufficiency significantly deteriorated after EU accession, especially in the area of pork and poultry. The self-sufficiency for pork meat decreased to 57 % and to 73 % in the case of poultry. The situation is quite stable for beef. However beef creates {{only a small portion of}} the Czech consumption. A similar situation can be observed in Slovakia, its degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> pork and poultry declined down to 53 % and 78 % respectively. To cover production of poultry and pork from national resources in both countries, production would need to increase by millions of swine and chicken, which may be complicated with respect to existing infrastructure. The production of beef, poultry and pork is sufficient in Poland, production covers consumption. Self-sufficiency in beef increased above 400 % mainly due to decline in beef consumption. Since 2009, self-sufficiency in pork has slightly risen and in 2013 it reached 117 %. Consumption and production of poultry is on the rise, poultry become a substitute to beef; processing industry doubled its output between 2003 and 2013. Also Hungary, similarly to Poland, is able to cover domestic consumption by domestic production. The self-sufficiency in the case of poultry meat reach 170 %, which is positively reflected in the trade balance. Between 2003 and 2013, the rate <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in pork meat fluctuates between 105 and 120 %. The trade balance in beef is balanced and correlated with the degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> moving slightly above 100 %...|$|R
