5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, <b>Piper</b> {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. <b>Piper</b> started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on <b>Piper.</b> He attacked <b>Piper</b> with a foreign object, which knocked <b>Piper</b> to the mat. Then, while trying to pin <b>Piper,</b> Jerry Lawler placed {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed <b>Piper</b> to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|In Altranstädt, Marlborough {{reportedly}} approached Carl <b>Piper,</b> {{the most}} favored of the King's advisers of the time. Allegedly, he offered <b>Piper</b> a pension {{in exchange for}} advising Charles XII to invade Russia, as this would distract Charles from interfering in the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl <b>Piper</b> was openly accused of having accepted Marlborough's bribe, persuaded Charles to the Swedish invasion of Russia, which consequently lead to the disastrous Battle of Poltava. Carl <b>Piper</b> denied having accepted Marlborough's offer, but he did admit that he had accepted that Marlborough provided his wife Christina <b>Piper</b> {{with a pair of}} valuable earrings, which she admitted, and as it was the habit of Carl <b>Piper</b> to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and then follow her recommendation, the accusation of Marlborough's bribe is not unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In a new storyline after WrestleMania, Roddy <b>Piper</b> began {{training}} Bob Orton as a boxer.

After Mr. T won the match, Orton and <b>Piper</b> attacked him, {{leading to a}} boxing match at WrestleMania 2 between <b>Piper</b> and Mr. T.

5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both <b>Piper</b> and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted {{her down to}} earth qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative {{of the first two}} series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. <b>Piper</b> won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, <b>Piper</b> experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E

50|$|It {{is known}} that <b>pipers</b> served in regiments from the {{earliest}} times; the Royal Scots have records referring to <b>pipers</b> {{dating back to the}} early seventeenth century.Where <b>pipers</b> were employed as <b>pipers</b> (rather than just happening to be a soldier who also was able to play), they were employed by the officers of the regiments as private pipers.This situation continued until the 1840s, when Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for all things Highland was instrumental in the War Office's decision that each battalion of the Highland Regiments be allowed five <b>pipers</b> and a Pipe Major, which continues to be all that the British Army provides funds for to this day. Any additional <b>pipers</b> in the battalion pipe band were and are equipped today by funds from the Officers' Mess Fund of the battalion.|$|R

5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the <b>Piper</b> Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} <b>Piper</b> Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of <b>Piper</b> Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.|$|E
