40|$|Our current {{knowledge}} on the antiviral efficacy, dosing, and toxicity of available {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} regimens is mostly derived from <b>plasma</b> or <b>blood</b> <b>kinetics</b> of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) drugs. However, the blood comprises only 2 % {{of the total}} target cells in the body. Tissue drug levels may differ substantially from corresponding plasma levels, and drug distribution processes may be characterized by high intertissue variability, leading to suboptimal target site concentrations and the potential risk for therapeutic failures. Positron emission tomography has greatly expanded the scope of the pharmacokinetic measurements that can be performed noninvasively in animal models or humans. We have prepared [18 F]FPMPA, a fluorine- 18 -radiolabeled analogue of tenofovir, to study antiretroviral tissue kinetics in vivo noninvasively and tested the imaging probe in rats. The biodistribution of the fluorine- 18 analogue closely follows that of nonfluorinated tenofovir. Compared to that in the blood, the levels of penetration of the antiretroviral drug were found to be significantly reduced in the spleen and submandibular lymph nodes (∼ 2 -fold), in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the testes (∼ 4 -fold), and in the brain compartment (∼ 25 -fold). Intersubject variability of the trough drug concentration (measured at 120 min) in certain tissues, like the colon (coefficient of variation, > 100 %), is not reflected by the intersubject variability in the blood compartment (coefficient of variation, 24 %). Positron emission tomography imaging of the fluorine- 18 analogue revealed the accumulation of the antiretroviral drug in the cortex of the kidneys, a potential correlate of tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity observed in HIV- 1 -infected treated patients. Thus, [18 F]FPMPA is a promising radiotracer for evaluation of tenofovir biodistribution under carefully controlled drug administration protocols...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} a solid tumor and {{a leading cause of}} mortality. Diagnostic tools for the {{detection}} of early stage (stage I) ovarian cancer are urgently needed. For this purpose, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) coupled with variable selection methods, successive projection algorithm or genetic algorithm (GA) combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were employed to identify spectral biomarkers in <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> or serum samples for accurate diagnosis of different stages of ovarian cancer, histological type and segregation based on age. Three spectral datasets (stage I vs. stage II?IV; serous vs. non-serous carcinoma; and, ≤ 60 years vs. > 60 years) were processed: sensitivity and specificity required for real-world diagnosis of ovarian cancer was achieved. Toward segregating stage I vs. stage II?IV, sensitivity and specificity (<b>plasma</b> <b>blood)</b> of 100 % was achieved using a GA-LDA model with 33 wavenumbers. For serous vs. non-serous category (<b>plasma</b> <b>blood),</b> the sensitivity and specificity levels, using 29 wavenumbers by GA-LDA, were remarkable (up to 94 %). For ≤ 60 years and > 60 years categories (<b>plasma</b> <b>blood),</b> the sensitivity and specificity, using 42 wavenumbers by GA-LDA, gave complete accuracy (100 %). For serum samples, sensitivity and specificity results gave relatively high accuracy (up to 91. 6 % stage I vs. stage II?IV; up to 93. 0 % serous vs. non-serous; and, up to 96. 0 % ≤ 60 years vs. > 60 years) using several wavenumbers.

The <b>blood</b> <b>kinetics</b> of the contrast agent represent an important factor that needs to be considered depending on the objective of the medical examination. For particulate contrast agents, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), the key parameters are particle size and characteristics of the coating material. In this study we analyzed the effect of these two properties independently and systematically on the magnetic behavior and blood half-life of SPIOs. Methods: Eleven different SPIOs were synthesized for this study. In the first set (a), seven carboxydextran (CDX) -coated SPIOs of different sizes (19 &ndash; 86 nm) were obtained by fractionating a broadly size-distributed CDX&ndash;SPIO. The second set (b) contained three SPIOs of identical size (50 nm) that were stabilized with different coating materials, polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene glycol, and starch. Furthermore, small PAA&ndash;SPIOs (20 nm) were synthesized to gain a global insight into the effects of particle size vs coating characteristics. Saturation magnetization and proton relaxivity were determined to represent the magnetic and imaging properties. The blood half-life was analyzed in rats using MRI, time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Results: By changing the particle size without modifying any other parameters, the relaxivity r 2 increased with increasing mean particle diameter. However, the blood half-life was shorter for larger particles. The effect of the coating material on magnetic properties was less pronounced, but it had a strong influence on <b>blood</b> <b>kinetics</b> depending on the ionic character of the coating material. Conclusion: In this report we systematically demonstrated that both particle size and coating material influence <b>blood</b> <b>kinetics</b> and magnetic properties of SPIO independently.
