40|$|A {{radioactive}} organophosphorus compound, 32 P-diphenylphosphinothioic chloride (D 32 PT chloride) was synthesized from {{commercially available}} radioactive <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulphide</b> of high specific activity and conjugated to an immunoglobulin. Goat anti-human-globulin was {{used and the}} conjugation had no material effect on its antibody titre. The conjugate was highly radioactive and contained on average twenty-eight phosphorus atoms per globulin molecule. The chemical combination was stable and permitted specific immunodiffusion and immunohistological localization of the antibody as judged by autoradiography. About half of the radioactivity was covalently linked and the rest was probably attached by ionic and/or hydrogen bonds...|$|E
40|$|Dinonyldithiophosphoric acid (HDDTP) was {{synthesised}} {{from the}} reaction of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulphide</b> and nonyl alcohol. Dinonyldithiophosphate complex of cadmium [Cd(DDTP) 2] was prepared by mixing solutions of Cd(II) with HDDTP in ethanol at room temperature. The acid and its complex were characterised by elemental analysis and spectroscopy. The thermal behaviour of Cd(DNDTP) 2 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Removal of Cd(II) from aqueous media by HDDTP solution was also studied. The optimum conditions for removal of Cd(II) were investigated for effects of solvent, pH, contact time, concentration, and inorganic anions. Cd(II) was quantitatively removed from aqueous solutions at the pH range of 0. 5 <pH< 6, under the conditions that the stoichiometric ratio of HDDTP/Cd(II) â‰¥ 2 / 1. It can be stated that contact of the Cd(II) with HDDTP was sufficient for quantitative removing of cadmium from acidic aqueous solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{condensation}} of 4 -(p-methoxybenzyl) - 6 -[5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthyl]-pyridazin- 3 (2 H) -one (3), {{prepared by}} the reaction of 6 -[5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthyl]- 4, 5 -dihydropyridazin- 3 (2 H) -one (1) and anisaldehyde, with dimethyl sulphate, formaldehyde and acrylonitrile, and also {{the formation of the}} Mannich base, proceeded smoothly at the 2 -position to give compounds 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively. 4 -p-Methoxybenzyl- 3 -chloro- 6 -[5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthyl]-pyridazine (9) was prepared in law yield by the action of phosphorus oxychloride on 3. The reaction of 9 with benzylamine, aniline and piperidine gave 10 a,b,c, respectively. 4 -p-Methoxybenzyl- 6 -[5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 2 -napthyl]pyridazine- 3 (2 H) -thione (12) was prepared either by the action of thiourea on 9, or by the reaction of 3 with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulphide.</b> The reaction of these thiones with acrylonitrile, morpholine and piperidine to give 13 and 14 a,b, respectively, were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis consists of synthesis. structure and bioactivity of some new heterocyclic compounds. The compounds included in this thesis are seven membered ring compounds, which contain heteroatoms nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. Few six membered ring compounds were also synthesized which contain nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The seven membered compounds include different 3 -substituted phenyl- 5, 6 -dihydro- 7 H- 1, 4, 2 - oxathiazepin- 7 -one (78 - 97), 4,I, 3 -benzoxathiazepin- 5 -one (123 - 137), pyrido[2, 3 e][I, 4, 2]oxathiazepin- 5 -one (161 - 173), 5, 6 -dihydro- 7 H- 1,, 4, 2 -oxathiazepin- 7 -one(188 - 192), 6 -[(acetyloxy) amino]- 3 -(4 -substitutedphenyl) - 5, 5 -dimethyl- 5, 6 -dihydro- 7 H- 1, 4, 2 oxathiazepin- 7 -one (197 - 198). These compounds were prepared by treating hydroximinoyl chlorides with different mercapto acids. These acids included 3 -mercaptopropanoic acid, 2 mercaptosalicylic acid. 2 -mercaptonicotinic acid. cysteine and penicilamine. The {{first step in the}} synthesis of these compounds was the formation of oximes by treating aldehydes with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The variety of aldehydes was selected for this work with aromatic and heteroaromatic nuclei. The second step was the conversion of these oximes to the hydroximinoyl chlorides. This step was carried out by treating oximes with different chlorinating agents, NCS and BTMAICI 4. These hydroximinoyl chlorides in the next step were treated with different mercapto acids to give oxime acids. The reaction was carried out in the presence of base, triethyl amine. The last step was cyclization and carried out by adding DCC as cyclizing agent to the reaction mixture. The chemical reactivity of these compounds was investigated by carrying out different reactions. Thus oxathiazepines were treated with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulphide,</b> primary and secondary amines, LiAlH 4 and alcohol to get thiones. amides, alcohols and esters respectively. It was found that the same ring cleaved product was obtained under both acidic and basic conditions. Ring also cleaved in case of reaction with amine, alcohol and LiAlH 4. The synthesis of another class of six membered ring compounds i. e. 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazin- 5 -one and 6, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazin- 5 -one (217 - 221) was also carried out by treating amidoximes with chloroacetyl chloride and 2 -bromo- 2 -methylpropanoyl bromide. The amidoximes were prepared by treating hydroximinoyl chloride with different primary and secondary amines which include benzylamine, 2 -aminopyridine, 2 -chloroaminobenzene, 1 -naphthylamine, 4 -aminopyridine, cyclopropylamine, dibenzylamine and diisopropylamine. 7, 7 -dimethyl- 3, 5 -disubstituteddihydro- 1 H-[1, 3]thiazolo[3, 4 -c][1, 3]oxazol-l-one(199 - 201) were also synthesized by the reaction of aldehydes with Penicillamine. The compounds thus formed were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques like UV, IR, 1 H, 13 C NMR, COSY, HMQC, DNMR and mass spectral analysis. NOE experiments were performed to confirm the stereochemistry of the hydroximinoyl chlorides, oxime acids and amidoximes. These compounds were found to have Z- configuration. Elemental analysis and X-ray crystal analysis was also carried out in many cases. The synthesized compounds after characterization were subjected to biological activity testing; antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Some of the compounds were found to exhibit excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity. The oxime acids proved to be good antioxidants while a few oxathiazepines have also shown good antidiabetic activity...|$|E
