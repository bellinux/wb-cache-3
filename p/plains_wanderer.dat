50|$|The seedsnipes {{are a small}} family, Thinocoridae, {{of small}} gregarious waders which have adapted to a herbivorous diet. The family {{is divided into two}} genera, Attagis and Thinocorus, each {{containing}} two species. The family has a South American distribution, in the Andean and Patagonian regions. The relationships with other families within the order Charadriiformes are uncertain, {{it has been suggested that}} the <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer</b> of Australia, the jacanas and the painted snipes are their closest relatives. The <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer</b> in particular has a similar feeding ecology, although differs markedly in breeding biology. The family's common name is misleading, as they do not resemble true snipe, having short bills on small heads, and seeds do not form a major part of the diet.|$|E
50|$|Pullen Pullen Reserve is a 56,000 hectare {{property}} in western Queensland, Australia, designated {{specifically for the}} purpose of protecting the endangered night parrot. The exact location has not been released. While the sanctuary was meant only to aid the night parrot, other endangered species residing in the area include the <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer,</b> painted honeyeater, grey falcon, and kowari.|$|E
50|$|The family Rostratulidae {{encompasses}} two genera {{and four}} species (one extinct). Painted-snipes superficially resemble true snipes {{but the two}} taxa are not closely related. Instead the similarity {{can be attributed to}} convergent evolution where both groups have been subjected to similar selection pressures, thus promoting the evolution of analogous features such as a long slender bill and legs, mottled crypsis plumage and particular body proportions. While less similar in morphology, the species that are considered most closely related to painted-snipes are other members of the suborder Thinocori; jacanas, seedsnipes and the <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Pualco Range Conservation Park is a {{protected}} area located in South Australia about 30 km {{south of the}} town of Yunta in the stateâ€™s Far North region. [...] The conservation park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 in 2010 as the land [...] "supports high value habitat for the endangered <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer,</b> a distinctive, quail-like bird, as well as other species of state conservation significance including the Major Mitchell's cockatoo, blue-winged parrot and peregrine falcon". [...] The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.|$|E
5000|$|In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, waders {{and many}} other groups are subsumed into a greatly {{enlarged}} Ciconiiformes order. However, the classification of the Charadriiformes {{is one of the}} weakest points of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, as DNA-DNA hybridization {{has turned out to be}} incapable of properly resolving the interrelationships of the group. Formerly, the waders were united in a single suborder Charadrii, but this has turned out to be a [...] "wastebasket taxon", uniting no less than four charadriiform lineages in a paraphyletic assemblage. However, it indicated that the <b>plains</b> <b>wanderer</b> actually belonged into one of them. Following recent studies (Ericson et al., 2003; Paton et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2004a, b; van Tuinen et al., 2004; Paton & Baker, 2006), the waders may be more accurately subdivided as follows: ...|$|E
