50|$|Bees in four {{tribes of}} the family Apidae, {{subfamily}} Apinae: the honey bees, bumblebees, stingless bees, and orchid bees have corbiculae. The corbicula is a polished cavity surrounded by a fringe of hairs, into which the bee collects the pollen; most other bees possess a structure called the scopa, which is similar in function, but is a dense mass of branched hairs into which pollen is pressed, with pollen grains held {{in place in the}} narrow spaces between the hairs. A honey bee moistens the forelegs with its protruding tongue and brushes the pollen that has collected on its head, body and forward appendages to the hind legs. The pollen is transferred to the <b>pollen</b> <b>comb</b> on the hind legs and then combed, pressed, compacted, and transferred to the corbicula on the outside surface of the tibia of the hind legs.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} {{various aspects of}} Ficus irisana Elm. and it''s fig wasps, such as phenology, biology, {{and the relationship between}} fig trees and fig wasps and that among fig wasps. The main flowering season of F. irisana was from June to December during which both male and female figs had two to four crops. The amount of figs would increase as the temperature rose and decreased as the precipitation increased. The number of figs and the duration of fig wasps were strongly affected by the coexistence of female phase and male phase figs. Seven species of fig wasps in three families were found, namely Kradibia commuta, Philotrypesis sp., Sycoscapter sp., Herodotia sp., Sycophila sp. 1, Sycophila sp. 2 and a species of Braconidae. K. commuta was the pollinator which had sternal corbiculae and coxa <b>pollen</b> <b>comb</b> at fore legs. Since the amount of male flowers were relatively lower and concentrated around ostile, the pollinators were assumed to conduct active pollination for it''s host plant. Furthermore, the study showed the non-pollinators, Philotrypesis sp. and Sycoscapter sp., alwasys appered along with the pollinators. They penetrated their ovipositors through the interflorence phase figs and laid eggs. The relationship among these three fig wasps were as follow: Philotropesis sp. was an inquiline which lived in galls forms by pollinators, whereas Sycoscapter sp. was a parasitoid in Philotrypesis sp [...] The non-pollinators would greatly reduced the number of pollinators and therefore had a negative impact on the mutualism between F. irisana and it''s pollinators. 本論文針對雌雄異株的澀葉榕（Ficus irisana Elm. ）之開花週期、榕果發育、榕小蜂相、榕小蜂生物學；榕樹和榕小蜂與授粉蜂和其它非授粉蜂之間的關係進行研究。其開花高峰期集中在每年的 6 月底至 12 月，期間雌雄樣株各有二到四個花期，但其它時間仍有少量的榕果存在。榕果數量和溫度及雨量有顯著的相關性，與溫度成正相關；而與降水量成負相關。雌花期雌雄榕果需與雄花期雄榕果配合得當，否則榕果數量以及授粉蜂出現的時間長短都會受到影響。澀葉榕上總共收集到 7 種蜂類，分別是榕小蜂科（Agaonidae）的Kradibia commuta、Philotrypesis sp. 、Sycoscapter sp. 及Herodotia sp. ；廣肩小蜂科（Eurytomidae）的Sycophila sp. 1 、Sycophila sp. 2 和小繭蜂科（Braconidae）的一種小蜂。其中Kradibia commuta為其授粉蜂，具有中胸腹節花粉籃及前足基節花粉刷；且澀葉榕之雄花數目比例低於 10 %，而集中在榕果小孔四週，所以推測授粉蜂會為澀葉榕主動授粉。隨授粉蜂出現的兩種非授粉蜂Philotrypesis sp. 及Sycoscapter sp. 在榕果C期依序由榕果外產卵。基於套袋實驗及相關性分析，這三種蜂之間的關係推測為：Philotrypesis sp. 為寄居在授粉蜂所形成的蟲癭上的寄居者；而Sycoscapter sp. 則為寄生在Philotrypesis sp. 上之類寄生者。非授粉蜂的出現使授粉蜂的子代數大量減少，確實會對榕樹與授粉蜂之間的互利共生關係產生負面的影響。誌謝 中文摘要 壹、前言 [...] - 1 貳、前人研究 [...] - 2 參、材料及方法 [...] - 10 一、澀葉榕的生物學研究 [...] - 10 1. 澀葉榕開花週期調查 [...] - 10 2. 榕果形態之觀察及測計 [...] 10 二、授粉蜂與非授粉蜂之生物學研究 [...] 11 1. 榕小蜂種類的鑑定 [...] 11 2. 榕小蜂的生殖生物學資料 [...] - 11 三、澀葉榕與授粉蜂之間的關係 [...] 12 1. 無榕小蜂進入的榕果能否繼續發育？ [...] 12 2. 澀葉榕小蜂與澀葉榕開花週期之配合 [...] 12 四、榕小蜂間相互關係的探討 [...] - 12 1.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in the spring rubber in the rubber plantation area in Loncatan Village Leap District Mangaran Ajung Jember district for 2 (two) months. The research objective is to observe the <b>pollen</b> <b>combs</b> area in rubber plantation area, know the protein content of <b>combs</b> <b>pollen</b> and assess the type and composition of amino acids of <b>combs</b> <b>pollen.</b> The materials used in research is the honey bee Apis mellifera colony of 7 colonies, each containing 9 units active frames. Adapted colonies in the study site for a week to eliminate the influence of feed from the previous place. During the study, colonies of bees do not get extra food so that all food comes from nature. Observations were carried out {{after a period of}} adaptation with a collection <b>combs</b> <b>pollen.</b> Measurement of <b>pollen</b> <b>combs</b> area done every week during the study period. Analysis of proteins made from <b>combs</b> <b>pollen</b> is collected each week, using the Kjeldahl method. Analysis of a type and composition of amino acids using amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, 1984) and then compare with the results of research de Groot (1953). Data obtained from these observations were analyzed descriptively to get an overview of research results. The results showed that during the study period in the area of rubber plantations there are variations in the <b>comb</b> area <b>pollen</b> honey bees collected at each week during the study with an average of 60. 80 ± 2. 857 cm 2, the protein content is 3. 77 ± 0. 629 %, there are 10 species amino acids in very low levels between 0, 212 - 1, 251 %.

40|$|Sections of brood from {{colonies of}} the Cape {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera capensis), the African honeybee (A. m. scutellata), and hybrid bees {{of the two}} races were exchanged between colonies to study the effect of different brood-origin/nurse-bee combinations on development of caste characters. When Cape larvae were raised by African workers {{the amount of food}} provided almost doubled in comparison with Cape larvae reared by their own workers. In contrast, African larvae raised by Cape workers were provided with only half the amount they received from their own workers. After the bees emerged, we found a large degree of plasticity in characters related to caste differentiation, which corresponded closely to the amount of food provided. Super-fed Cape bees had enlarged spermathecae, were heavier than normal workers and developed more rapidly, and had reduced <b>pollen</b> <b>combs,</b> all typical for a more queen-like condition. Ovariole numbers {{did not appear to be}} enhanced by additional feeding. Cape bees that behave as social parasites in African bee colonies were most queen-like in the characters studied, albeit within the range that was found for Cape bees from normal colonies, suggesting within-colony selection for characters that enhance reproduction...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFemales of the European {{leaf-cutter bee}} Megachile (Megachile) pilicrus Morawitz possess a {{conspicuous}} brush of stiff, yellowish-red bristles on the ventral {{side of the}} trochanter and femur of their hind legs. Observation of pollen-harvesting females {{in the field and}} microscope analysis of scopal pollen contents revealed that the hind leg brush is a specialized device for <b>combing</b> <b>pollen</b> from the inflorescences of thistles and knapweeds (Cardueae, Asteraceae), the exclusive pollen plants of M. pilicrus. Hind leg brushes serving the same purpose were found to be also present in several Megachile species belonging to the subgenus Neoeutricharaea, indicating convergent evolution in these two different Megachile lineages. Compared to all other species, the hind leg brush of M. (Neoeutricharaea) apicalis is distinctly less developed which is assumed to be associated with its polylectic habit...|$|R
40|$|The Small Hive Beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is an {{invasive}} pest {{of honey}} bee colonies that causes significant {{damage to the}} beekeeping sector. SHB was detected in southern Italy (EU) in 2014 and despite adopted eradication measures, is still present there. After three years of observations of SHB in Calabria (2014 - 2016), we provide here some practical tips for improving control measures. A new time-saving colony examination method, {{including the use of}} an internal divider reduced the time needed for hive inspections by 31. 86 % on average. Prioritizating the inspection of <b>pollen</b> and honey <b>combs</b> rather than brood combs is advised. Sentinel apiaries with no more than five colonies without supers are suggested for each beekeeping location in order to attract and to monitor the early appearance of SHB. The use of these methods will enable early detection and prompt control measures application before this destructive pest can spread in the region...|$|R
40|$|Populations {{of honey}} bees and other pollinators have {{declined}} worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which {{are widely used}} and highly toxic to honey bees, {{have been found in}} previous analyses of honey bee <b>pollen</b> and <b>comb</b> material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees i...|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} two genomic regions {{that affect the}} amount of pollen stored in honey bee colonies and influence whether foragers will collect pollen or nectar. We selected {{for the amount of}} <b>pollen</b> stored in <b>combs</b> of honey bee colonies, a colony-level trait, and then used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and interval mapping procedures with data from backcross colonies to identify two quantitative trait loci (pln 1 and pln 2, LOD 3. 1 and 2. 3, respectively). Quantitative trait loci effects were confirmed in a separate cross by demonstrating the cosegregation of marker alleles with the foraging behavior of individual workers. Both pln 1 and pln 2 had an effect on the amount of pollen carried by foragers returning to the colony, as inferred by the association between linked RAPD marker alleles, D 8 -. 3 f and 301 -. 55, and the individual pollen load weights of returning foragers. The alleles of the two marker loci were nonrandomly distributed with respect to foraging task. The two loci appeared to have different effects on foraging behavior. Individuals with alternative alleles for the marker linked to pln 2 (but not pln 1) differed with respect to the nectar sugar concentration of their nectar loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{proportion}} of honey-bees infected with Nosema apis (Zander) declines in summer {{as the old}} infected bees die, for they cease to transmit their infection to the newly emerged individuals during the flying season. N. apis spores survive the summer on combs contaminated with infected faeces during the preceding winter. Although bees clean the combs during the summer, all infected material is not removed, and even well-used brood comb, which has been repeatedly cleaned by bees, can carry infection. Only a few bees may contract infection in the autumn from these faeces, but they join the winter cluster and initiate the next outbreak of the disease. Transferring a colony on to clean comb early in the spring or summer removes {{the source of the}} disease, and it then disappears when all the old infected bees die. Old broodless comb can be sterilized quite simply by fumigation for a few days with the vapours of formalin or glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is preferable, because it does not poison any honey or <b>pollen</b> in the <b>combs.</b> Formaldehyde can safely be used only with empty combs. The autumn is the best time for treating colonies chemotherapeutically, because the combs are then cleanest and the few bees which are infected can be cured during the winter. The drug can be incorporated in the syrup normally fed to colonies in autumn, and there is no risk of seriously contaminating subsequent honey crops. However, such treatment cannot eliminate the disease because sufficient spores remain on the combs for the disease to start again when the drug supplied in the winter stores is exhausted...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{histories}} are multi-dimensional {{accounts of}} human {{interaction with the}} environment over time. They observe how and when the environment changes (material environmental histories), {{and the effects of}} human activities upon the environment (political environmental histories). Environmental histories also consider the thoughts and feelings that humans have had towards the environment (cultural/ intellectual environmental histories). Using the methodological framework of environmental history this research, located in sub-tropical northern Belize, brings together palaeoecological records (pollen and charcoal) with archival documentary sources. This has created an interdisciplinary account which considers how the vegetation of northern Belize has changed over the last 3, 500 years and, in particular, how forest resources have been used during the British Colonial period (c. AD 1800 – 1950). The palaeoecological records are derived from lake sediment cores extracted from the New River Lagoon, adjacent to the archaeological site of Lamanai. For over 3, 000 years Lamanai was a Maya settlement, and then, more recently, the site of two 16 th century Spanish churches and a 19 th century British sugar mill. The British archival records emanate {{from a wide variety of}} sources including: 19 th century import and export records, 19 th century missionary letters and 19 th and 20 th century meteorological records and newspaper articles. The integration of these two types of record has established a temporal range of 1500 BC to the present. The palaeoecological proxies provide a low resolution record over a period of 3, 500 years (c. 1500 BC – AD 2010) whereas the archival record provides annual resolution over a period of approximately 150 years (c. AD 1800 – 1950). This research also uses documentary sources to reconstruct temperature and precipitation for Belize City during the period 1865 – 2010, which is the first of its kind from Belize, and the oldest continuous record from Central America. It also provides the meteorological context for further exploration into British colonial interaction with ‘tropical’ climates. Perhaps because of its status as Britain’s only Central American colonial outpost, Belize has remained on the periphery of research concerning European interactions with tropical climates. This environmental history draws together a new account of health, place and space in the 19 th century colonial tropics, drawing out how different understandings of the aetiologies and transmission of disease developed, in particular yellow fever. These different research strands are brought together to create an account that considers material, political and cultural aspects of environmental history. This has enabled the identification of eight phases of human interaction with the landscape at Lamanai, which are broadly indicative of general trends across northern Belize. These include the establishment of Maya field-based agriculture c. 1600 BC and a later phase of substantial Maya construction and site development c. 170 BC – AD 150. A period of active Maya management of forest, field, savanna and palm resources is also observed c. AD 500 – 1000. Polarised imaginings of the Maya as both destroyers and protectors of the tropical forest are challenged. Spanish interaction with the landscape is evident during c. AD 1500 – 1700 and this is followed by a period of substantial British colonial exploitation of timber resources, with logwood extracted c. AD 1660 – 1910 and mahogany extracted c. AD 1750 – 1945. These periods of extraction were only identifiable in the <b>pollen</b> record by <b>combing</b> the chronology from the documentary record with observed changes in the vegetation record and this demonstrates how these two contrasting methodologies can be usefully integrated. This environmental history rejects the binary opposition of benign, passive Maya landscapes and the violent, devastated European colonial landscape (Denevan, 1992). Analysis of the pollen and documentary records reveal that biodiversity is at the highest levels post AD 1950, which suggests that the forest can regrow even after multiple, diverse and prolonged periods of anthropogenic use in a matter of decades...|$|R
