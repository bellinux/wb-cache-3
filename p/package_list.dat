5000|$|MidnightBSD {{began as}} a fork from FreeBSD in 2005. The founder of the project, Lucas Holt, wished to create a BSD derived desktop {{operating}} system. He was familiar with several live CD projects, but not the work on PC-BSD or DesktopBSD. At the same time, he also {{had an interest in}} GNUstep. The two ideas were folded into a plan to create a user friendly desktop environment.MidnightBSD 0.1 was released based on the efforts of Lucas Holt, Caryn Holt, D. Adam Karim, Phil Pereira of bsdnexus, and Christian Reinhardt. This release features {{a modified version of the}} FreeBSD ports system. The ports system evolved into [...] "mports" [...] which includes fake support, generation of packages before installation, license tagging, and strict rules about <b>package</b> <b>list</b> generation and modification of files outside the destination. Many of these features were introduced in MidnightBSD 0.1.1.|$|E

To date, however, most existing buyer coalition schemes {{over the}} Internet have no focused on forming a buyer coalition with bundles of items. This paper presents {{the approach to}} form buyer coalition with bundles of items by using the genetic algorithm (GA), called GAGroupBuyer scheme. Buyers post their orders with some reservation prices to any items in the <b>package</b> <b>list.</b> The GAGroupBuyer scheme finds best formation of sub groups (coalitions) which can give the best of group’s utility. The simulation results are compared with the GroupBuyPackage scheme [8]. The {{results indicate that the}} algorithm can improve the total discount of any coalitions.

The next sub-objective is to establish cooperation with new potential partners for competition in rhythmic gymnastics with a tailor-made offer. Methods: In the work are used the methods of quantitative and qualitative research. The method of written polling is applied to former and current sponsors and the method of direct mail and individual semi-structured interview is applied to the selected potential sponsors. Results: During the data collection {{it was found that the}} former and current sponsors would prefer a more diverse list of options.

40|$|Libraries are {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} efficiently use collection dollars in creative ways. Content needs are ever increasing, and, with the growing range of format and delivery options, finding means to identify resources that provide unique, or added, value is essential. Libraries regularly receive offers of sale pricing, or reduced pricing, for the subscription or purchase of multititle collections. Most often, these packages are for online content that the library may, or may not, have already acquired {{in one of the}} multiple formats available. In an environment of multiple formats, ISBNs and/or ISSNs per title, variable titles, and alternate imprint or copublishing, identifying the unique or duplicated holdings of library collections becomes a major challenge. The knowledge bases supporting booksellers, serials agents, and discovery tool providers strive {{to do a good job}} of linking content available in different formats and on different platforms. Although these vendors robustly provide alternate format, title, provider, and imprint data on a title-by-title basis, none of their administrative tools provide the library customer with the ability to easily compare aggregate data held in the knowledge base with data extracted from a title <b>package</b> <b>list.</b> This paper presents a description of library data needs and bookseller data provision goals, followed by a review of the power and functional limitations of current marketplace tools. Practical examples are provided of how these tools may be used to guide collection development and make wise acquisitions decisions...|$|E

30|$|When a query for {{the state}} of one or more virtual {{machines}} is issued, the Update Checker first checks to see if the result of that query is already available in the Result Cache and returns the cached result if it is not obsolete. Cached results are considered obsolete after a configurable amount of time, depending on factors such as the frequency of updates or the need for security. Otherwise, it checks if the <b>package</b> <b>lists</b> of all repositories assigned to the virtual machine are available in the Repository Cache and not obsolete, i.e., the configured validity period has not yet expired. If this is not the case, the <b>package</b> <b>lists</b> are downloaded from the software vendor’s repository, parsed and stored in the Repository Cache for future use. When using the Repository Cache instead of the real repositories, there is the chance that the Update Checker fails to identify an outdated package. Nevertheless, the Repository Cache is very useful for checking many virtual machines and by using a small validity period, the risk can be minimized. Finally, the actual check of the virtual machine is started, comparing the version of each installed package with the version available at the repository. Information about outdated packages is then stored in the Result Cache, so that subsequent queries regarding the same virtual machine can be answered faster.|$|R
