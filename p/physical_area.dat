The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005, through both population growth and land annexation (the latter has considerably enlarged the <b>physical</b> <b>area</b> of the city). In 1990, the United States Census Bureau reported San Antonio's population as 55.6% Hispanic, 7% black, and 36.2% non-Hispanic white.|$|E
25|$|The Bellini–Tosi system {{feeds the}} output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna {{into a small}} coil of wire, the field coil. The varying voltage induced by the {{received}} signal causes the wire to re-radiate the same signal. Although as the coil is typically very {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in the coil improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by the coil is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller <b>physical</b> <b>area,</b> so the flux may be much higher than the original signal.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} for Final Fantasy XIII {{were divided}} into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters. Each <b>physical</b> <b>area</b> of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas. Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director Motomu Toriyama had worked on Final Fantasy X and X-2; producer Yoshinori Kitase had worked on V through VIII and as the producer for X and X-2; main-character designer Tetsuya Nomura had performed the same role for VII, VIII, X, and X-2, and battle-system director Toshiro Tsuchida reprised that role from Final Fantasy X. As XIII was the first Final Fantasy game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game {{to have the same}} [...] "gameplay and craftmanship" [...] impact that Final Fantasy VII and X had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell fivemillion copies of the game. Toriyama wanted the game to be [...] "the ultimate single player RPG".|$|E

2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic <b>physical</b> <b>area</b> {{of the port}} and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

2500|$|In {{color mode}} (when lit {{primarily}} from the rear), the display does not use the common RGB pixel geometry for liquid crystal computer displays, in which each pixel contains three tall thin rectangles of the primary colors. Instead, the XO-1 display provides one color for each pixel. The colors align along diagonals that run from upper-right to lower left (see diagram on the right). To reduce the color artifacts caused by this pixel geometry, the color component of the image is blurred by the display controller as the image {{is sent to the}} screen. Despite the color blurring, the display still has high resolution for its physical size; normal displays [...] put about 588(H)×441(V) to 882(H)×662(V) pixels in this amount of <b>physical</b> <b>area</b> and support subpixel rendering for slightly higher perceived resolution. A Philips Research study measured the XO-1 display's perceived color resolution as effectively 984(H)×738(V). A conventional liquid crystal display with the same number of green pixels (green carries most brightness or luminance information for human eyes) as the OLPC XO-1 would be 693×520. Unlike a standard RGB LCD, resolution of the XO-1 display varies with angle. Resolution is greatest from upper-right to lower left, and lowest from upper-left to lower-right. Images which approach or exceed this resolution will lose detail and gain color artifacts. The display gains resolution when in bright light; this comes at the expense of color (as the backlight is overpowered) and color resolution can never reach the full 200 dpi sharpness of grayscale mode because of the blur which is applied to images in color mode.|$|E

From this analysis, the relevance of journals in the <b>Physical</b> Education <b>area</b> was also evaluated. For the accounting of publications, the scriptLattes v 8. 07 software was used. The 88 researchers in <b>Physical</b> Education <b>area</b> published 2600 papers in 530 different journals in the 2010 - 2012 triennium. It was found that among the 30 journals with the highest number of publication, 19 are published in Brazil; from “Top 10 ”, eight journals are published in Brazil. Concerning journals that have publications of researchers who have received grants of all categories/levels, of the 11 journals that meet this requirement, seven are published in Brazil.
