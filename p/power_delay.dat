40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have been}} developed for a variety of appli- cations such as battle?eld surveillance, environment monitoring, health care and so on. For such applications, the design of WSN has been limited by two main resource constraints, <b>power</b> and <b>delay.</b> Therefore, since wireless sensors with a small battery are subject to strict power constraints, the e?cient usage of power is one of the im- portant challenges. As delay-sensitive applications are emerging, they have been in demand for making a quick decision with the enhanced detection accuracy. Under above constraints, we propose a sequential detection scheme and compare it with a Fixed-sample-size (FSS) detection scheme in terms of <b>power</b> and <b>delay.</b> Our main contribution is to analyze the overall system performance of the proposed scheme in the statistical signal processing framework under of <b>power</b> and <b>delay</b> constraints. In this thesis, we evaluate the overall system performance of sequential detection scheme in a serial multi-hop WSN topology. For sequential detection, the sensor nodes continue to relay the observations to the next node until the sequential detector makes a ?nal decision based on the observations. On the other hand, the FSS detector waits until all the observations come to the fusion center, and then gives a ?nal decision. For a fair comparison of the two schemes with respect to <b>power</b> and <b>delay,</b> the initial step is to ?nd the same detection performance region between the two schemes. Detection performance is evaluated with performance measures such as false alarm, miss and prior probability. Simulation results show that each scheme has an advantage and a disadvantage concerning <b>power</b> and <b>delay</b> respectively. That is, sequential detection performs more e?ciently in delay since the number of samples in sequential detection is less on average than in FSS detection to obtain the same detection performance. However, FSS detection with a small number of packet paths consumes less power than sequential detection. Through the analysis of a cost function, which is a linear combination of <b>power</b> and <b>delay,</b> we compare the cost value between the two schemes and ?nd less region of the cost value in both schemes. This analysis will provide a good starting point and foundation for designing an e?cient multi-hop WSN with small <b>power</b> and <b>delay</b> constraints...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) systems use a predetermined cyclic prefix (CP) that is conservatively {{designed for the}} longest anticipated delay spread to overcome the multipath propagation delays. The most important parameter for determining the CP is <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile which is widely accepted to be following a negative exponentially decaying pattern. In this paper, the key parameter root mean square (r. m. s) delay spread of the <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile is mathematically derived based on the exponentially decaying <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile. The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profiles are fitted into the exponentially decaying <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile (EDPDP). The performance measure bit error rate (BER) is {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the EDPDP and its r. m. s delay spread. The findings show that EDPDP can be used to characterize the most of the <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profiles. Subsequently, a mathematical formula to calculate CP estimation is derived. As a result, it is found that the CP is the natural logarithm of the ration of maximum power to minimum power of a particular <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile multiplied by its r. m. s delay spread. This finding gives the relationship between the maximum access delay and r. m. s delay spread as far as CP is concerned...|$|E

Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal solution of our non-linear optimization problem, we convert it into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem.

Re-cent {{studies show that the}} <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile may be derived from the CSI traces collected from commodity WiFi devices, but the performance is limited by two dominating factors. The resolution of the derived <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profile is determined by the channel bandwidth, which is however limited on commodity WiFi. The collected CSI reflects the signal distortions due to both the chan-nel attenuation and the hardware imperfection. A direct deriva-tion of <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profiles using raw CSI measures, as has been done in the literature, results in significant inaccuracy. In this pa-per, we present Splicer, a software-based system that derives high-resolution <b>power</b> <b>delay</b> profiles by splicing the CSI measurements from multiple WiFi frequency bands. We propose a set of key tech-niques to separate the mixed hardware errors from the collected CSI measurements. Splicer adapts its computations within strin-gent channel coherence time and thus can perform well in presence of mobility. Our experiments with commodity WiFi NICs show that Splicer substantially improves the accuracy in profiling multi-path characteristics, reducing the errors of multipath distance esti-mation to be less than 2 m.
