5|$|James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, {{university}} professor, {{research scientist}} and inventor. Cade, {{a native of}} Texas, earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the University of Texas, and became a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> nephrology at the University of Florida. Although Cade engaged {{in many areas of}} medical research, he is most widely remembered {{as the leader of the}} research team that created the sports drink Gatorade. Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} the Inquisition became less {{concerned}} about heretics and Protestants, and more concerned to suppress the revolutionary political and other ideas of the French revolutionaries. On August 9, 1795 an auto-de-fe was held. One of the condemned was Esteban Morel, a French man of science, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> collaborator in the Gaceta de México. He was formally accused of heresy, deism and materialism. The same tribunal of the Inquisition brought proceedings against Juan Lauset and other Frenchmen, accusing them of having expressed feelings against the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|In 1576 George Baker {{published}} {{a translation of}} the Evonymus of Conrad Gessner under the title of The Newe Jewell of Health, wherein is contained the most excellent Secretes of Physicke and Philosophie divided into fower bookes. Amongst his students was Felix Plater, who became a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine,</b> <b>and</b> accumulated many plant specimens, but also illustrations of animals used in Historiae animalium. A year after his death, his friend Josias Simler {{published a}} biography of Gessner. Gessner and others founded the Physikalische Gesellschaft in Zurich, which later became the Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Zürich (NGZH) in 1746, to promote the study of natural sciences. Today {{it is one of}} the oldest Swiss scientific societies. The society's annual publication, the Neujahrsblatt der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Zürich was devoted to a bioography of Gessner in 1966, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his death.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the silicon}} ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was {{developed}} by Dr. Noam Gavriely, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon {{that are used to}} roll the device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being rolled on, and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its narrow profile that results in a larger surgical field. It {{has been found to be}} a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. Recently, Feldman et. al. reported 2 cases of pulmonary embolism after silicon ring tourniquet application in patients with traumatic injuries. The serious and potentially fatal complication was reported involving procedures performed on the lower limb when silicone ring tourniquet was used for exsanguination on the affected limb.|$|E

He then returned to Sweden, where he became <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes.

2500|$|Euthanasia in {{its modern}} sense {{has always been}} {{strongly}} opposed in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Thomas Aquinas opposed both and argued {{that the practice of}} euthanasia contradicted our natural human instincts of survival, as did Francois Ranchin (1565–1641), a French physician and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine,</b> <b>and</b> Michael Boudewijns (1601–1681), a physician and teacher. Other voices argued for euthanasia, such as John Donne in 1624, and euthanasia continued to be practised. In 1678, the publication of Caspar Questel's De pulvinari morientibus non-subtrahend, ("On the pillow of which the dying should not be deprived"), initiated debate on the topic. Questel described various customs which were employed at the time to hasten the death of the dying, (including the sudden removal of a pillow, which was believed to accelerate death), and argued against their use, as doing so was [...] "against the laws of God and Nature". This view was shared by others who followed, including Philipp Jakob Spener, Veit Riedlin and Johann Georg Krünitz. Despite opposition, euthanasia continued to be practised, involving techniques such as bleeding, suffocation, and removing people from their beds to be placed on the cold ground.|$|E

2500|$|In 1703 Georg Ernst Stahl, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> {{chemistry}} at Halle, {{proposed a}} variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher's terra pinguis to phlogiston, and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence. The term phlogiston itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and {{in a way that was}} very similar to what Stahl was using it for. The term was derived from a Greek word meaning to inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl's view of phlogiston well:To Stahl, metals were compounds containing phlogiston in combination with metallic oxides (calces); on ignition the phlogiston was freed from the metal leaving the oxide behind. When the oxide was heated with a substance rich in phlogiston, such as charcoal, the calx again took up phlogiston and regenerated the metal. Phlogiston was a definite substance, the same in all its combinations.Stahl's first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his [...] "Zymotechnia fundamentalis", published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled [...] "Fundamenta chymiae" [...] in 1723. According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle, but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal calx and adding phlogiston. Soot was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulphur were identical by converting sulphates to liver of sulphur using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in weight on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.|$|E

But there is nothing of that sort about him at all; he is just as high-spirited and is as bright and cheerful as other young men of about the same age, and it was only when he was with the General that his gentleness of manner recalled {{the fact that he was}} a doctor. As I say, it was {{a difficult}} position, with only an old woman like myself and two girls, who looked to him for comfort and hope, who treated him as if he had been an old friend, and were constantly appealing to him for his opinion on all sorts of subjects.|$|E
