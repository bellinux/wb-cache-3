5000|$|Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (often {{abbreviated}} to QWpsr or simply [...] "quality wines") is a quality indicator used within European Union wine regulations. The QWpsr category identifies wines with <b>protected</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications.</b> The European Union regulates and defines {{the status of}} [...] "quality wines" [...] according to production method, management and geographical location. Its original, fundamental role is in differentiating quality wines from table wines, broadly {{in line with the}} system traditionally employed by the French government, amended to account for the preferences and methodology of Italian and German growers, among others in the EU.|$|E
5000|$|In the European Union, {{the cases}} {{have led to}} several court rulings {{about the nature and}} scope of <b>protected</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> (also known as [...] "{{appellation}}s of origin"). In Italy, courts found that an appellation could be valid even if the place to which the case referred no longer exists (in this case, the city of Budweis, now Budějovice), which gave Budvar's brand protection in Italy. In a case originating in Austria, the European Court of Justice ruled that simple indications (in this case [...] "Bud") could not be prohibited if a more specific appellation was protected, therefore allowing AB-Inbev to sell [...] "Bud" [...] in Austria, but not [...] "Budweiser".|$|E
50|$|When {{products}} with GIs acquire {{a reputation of}} international magnitude, some other products may try to pass themselves off as the authentic GI products. This kind of competition is often seen as unfair, as it may discourage traditional producers as well as mislead consumers. Thus the European Union has pursued {{efforts to improve the}} protection of GI internationally. Inter alia, the European Union has established distinct legislation to protect geographical names in the fields of wines, spirits, agricultural products including beer. A register for <b>protected</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> and denominations of origin relating to products in the field of agriculture including beer, but excluding mineral water, was established (DOOR). Another register was set up for wine region names, namely the E-Bacchus register. A register of the geographical indications for spirits and for any other products is still missing in the European Union and most other countries in the world. Aprivate database project (GEOPRODUCT directory) intends to close this gap. Accusations of 'unfair' competition should although be levelled with caution since the use of GIs sometimes comes from European immigrants who brought their traditional methods and skills with them.|$|E
