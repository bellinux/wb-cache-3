This had been the original draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife {{on the back of a}} finger just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. The note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with these words: [...] "I have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying close." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the nature of the}} nascent pitch, by applying the narrative paradigm to better understand how nascent entrepreneurs seek to acquire resources via a pitch. Fourteen videos of supported and non-supported pitches from Startup Weekend Sunshine Coast 2015 were analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. The findings that emerged show that audience engagement, speaker credibility, and effective use of symbols are the pillars of an effective pitch. These three themes, when used well enabled an overarching communication framework of personalisation. Personalisation occurs when the pitch becomes personally relevant to the audience, rather than an abstract concept. This allows them to visualise and relate to the venture concept and participate in what is being <b>pitched.</b> This <b>paper</b> contributes to the entrepreneurship discipline by crystallising the crucial elements of the nascent pitch for human resources. This study provides guidance for nascent entrepreneurs on significant elements to consider for a nascent 60 second pitch. Furthermore, it provides a framework for entrepreneurship mentors to guide and support nascent entrepreneurs. While some researchers have studied the venture capital <b>pitch,</b> this <b>paper</b> addresses the overlooked nascent pitch, often used to gain human resources and social support...|$|R
