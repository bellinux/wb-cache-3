25|$|Using visual photometry, Lambert {{presented}} {{the results of}} many experimental determinations of specular and diffuse reflectance, {{as well as the}} transmittance of panes of glass and lenses. Among the most ingenious experiments he conducted was that to determine the reflectance of the interior surface of a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Winston {{describes}} {{something as}} simple as the repair of a broken <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include telescreens that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} {{was not the}} end of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Namajague as they {{continued}} to clash in the weeks after the Dos Leyendas show, including one match where Namajague attacked Rey Cometa with a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> breaking it over Cometa's head. Stuka Jr. and Okumura only played a very smal part in the storyline as the two agreed to a one-on-one Lucha de Apuestas at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show where both men would put their hair on the line.|$|E
25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|On Riddell's {{death at}} the age of only 39, the Hermitage was allowed to quietly decay; by 1803 it was being used by stray stock and in 1810 it was {{reported}} by Cromek as being derelict and he expressed his shock that the site was not being maintained under Captain Smith's ownership of the estate, for the floor was covered in straw, cattle had broken down the trees and the <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> had gone. It measured 10.5 feet by eight and had a single window and fireplace. In around 1870 William Douglas recorded that {{the only part of the}} building still standing was part of the east gable. Over the lintel was cut the name 'BURNS' in bold letters.|$|E

25|$|Paxton set the {{dimensions}} of this prism by using the length of single <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces {{at either end of}} the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.|$|E
25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and other times {{it is used to}} create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in the phone booth, revealing the tattoo, visual effects were added to the tattoo illuminating it. But in order to add the effects, the middle <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> was removed from the phone booth so that the special effects team had a clear line to Welling’s chest; they re-added the middle pane digitally, adding reflections so that it looked natural.|$|E
25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E

25|$|The {{next few}} years saw {{development}} in the recreational landscape of Torquay, with the town's first sporting arena, the Recreation Ground being opened in 1888 with a rugby match between Torquay Athletic and local rivals Newton Abbot. Then in 1889 the Winter Gardens were built to provide entertainment for winter holidaymakers. Its cast-iron and glass structure could seat up to 1,000 people for the concerts held by an Italian band, and also featured three tennis courts and a bowling alley. However, the Winter Gardens were not very successful and in 1903 the building was sold to Great Yarmouth. The structure was shipped by barge from Torquay without {{the loss of a}} single <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and is still in use today (including a brief period during the 1990s as a night club, under the management of comedian Jim Davidson). The Victorian walls of the base are still in their original position in Torquay, and are now the walls of the bar (griffin Bar) open to the public under the Yardley Manor Hotel, Now owned by the Thorogood Family on Museum Road.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new ways to use his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an air pocket around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he was touching the same surface that they were standing on.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{character}} in Limbo is a nameless boy, who awakens {{in the middle}} of a forest on the [...] "edge of hell" [...] (the game's title is taken from the Latin , meaning [...] "edge"). While seeking his missing sister, he encounters only a few human characters who either attack him, run away, or are dead. At one point during his journey, he encounters a female character, but is prevented from reaching her. The forest eventually gives way to a crumbling city environment. On completion of the final puzzle, the boy is thrown through a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and back into the forest. He walks a short distance until he again encounters a girl, who, upon his approach, stands up, startled. At this point, the game abruptly ends.|$|E
50|$|A multi-lite {{window is}} a window glazed with small <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> {{separated}} by wooden or lead glazing bars, or muntins, arranged in a decorative glazing pattern often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability <b>of</b> large <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> the multi-lit (or lattice window) {{was the most common}} window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver {{attempts}} to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light {{one of the}} toxic cigarettes. As Weaver {{attempts to}} leave the building, Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette {{to the floor and}} Skinner dramatically snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder’s life. She is correct in her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. [...] Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.|$|E
500|$|The stagecoach {{made its}} way through the crowded square at about 10:30am. Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the {{carriage}} with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square. Bombs were thrown from all directions. The Georgian newspaper Isari reported: [...] "No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs... The sound caused panic everywhere... almost across the whole city, people started running. Carriages and carts were galloping away". [...] The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> for a mile around. Ekaterina Svanidze, Stalin's wife, was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child. When they heard the explosions, they rushed back into the house terrified.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{described}} [...] "the {{most remarkable}} of all Orchids", Catasetum, and showed how in these flowers, [...] "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [...] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism {{in which the}} pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist {{at the back of}} the flower. When an insect touched an [...] "antenna" [...] projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: [...] "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from the window, and the pollinium hit the <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc." ...|$|E
5000|$|A muntin in U.S. {{use is a}} {{strip of}} wood or metal {{separating}} and holding <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> in a window. Muntins are also called [...] "muntin bars", [...] "glazing bars", or [...] "sash bars". Muntins {{can be found in}} doors, windows and furniture, typically in western styles of architecture. Muntins divide a single window sash or casement into a grid system <b>of</b> small <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> called [...] "lights" [...] or [...] "lites".|$|R
