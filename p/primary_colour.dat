25|$|Before {{becoming}} the Cowboys, the team names Marlins, Stingrays {{and the very}} popular Crocodiles were tossed up as potential team logos for the side, before public consultation resulted in the name 'Cowboys' (the Crocodiles name would eventually go to Townsville's National Basketball League team, who changed their name to the Townsville Crocodiles in 1998 after a dispute with the NBA's Phoenix Suns over their original name, the Townsville Suns).

25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours were to be red and white, but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white. Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow, these colours were also used on his gravel and sand business' trucks. The colour scheme also followed a longstanding tradition of top-level, Toronto-based teams using blue as their <b>primary</b> <b>colour,</b> starting with the Toronto Argonauts in 1873, the University of Toronto Varsity Blues in 1877, the Maple Leafs baseball team, as well as the NHA's Toronto Blueshirts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{painting}} and traditional colour theory, blue {{is one of}} the three <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.

25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours would be changed to red and white, but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white, which they have worn ever since. While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, {{it is also true that}} top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their <b>primary</b> <b>colour</b> in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.|$|E
25|$|All Blue Jays {{games are}} carried nationally on Sportsnet (which, like the Blue Jays, {{is owned by}} Rogers Communications), with Buck Martinez as the play-by-play {{announcer}}, and Pat Tabler as the <b>primary</b> <b>colour</b> analyst. On select games, play-by-play is handled by Dan Shulman, with Martinez and Tabler on commentary. Toronto Raptors play-by-play announcer Matt Devlin has also filled in for Martinez in a select number of games. In previous years, the colour analyst role rotated between Pat Tabler, Rance Mulliniks, Darrin Fletcher, and since the 2011 season, Gregg Zaun. Sportsnet became the team's primary carrier soon after it launched in the late 1990s, and became the team's exclusive broadcaster in 2010. As of August 2010, Sportsnet One also broadcasts Blue Jays games (often in case of scheduling conflicts with the main Sportsnet channels). Rogers was, however, criticized by fans and critics due to Sportsnet One only being carried by Rogers Cable systems on launch.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{employed}} {{as one of}} the Superintendents of Works for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton's gigantic cast iron and glass palace, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within, and this was the architectural project which first brought Jones to the wider public's attention. Based on his observations of <b>primary</b> <b>colour</b> polychromy within the architecture of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and at the Alhambra, he chose a simple palette of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork. Colour theories were relatively new, and his controversial paint scheme created much debate and negative publicity in the newspapers and journals of the day. Crucially, after early viewings, Prince Albert maintained his support, and Jones ploughed on regardless. The public and professional criticism gradually dissipated until the building was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim – some commenting that Jones's colouring was similar in effect to the paintings of Turner. Jones had been offered a rare chance to put some of his theories on polychromy into practice on a grand scale: six million people witnessed his vision at the Great Exhibition during its short existence – roughly three times the population of London at that time.|$|E

Only one minor revision was made after the original version was unveiled: while the G and O used to touch each other, a gap now exists with a bolder white T to enhance them. The primary corporate colour was known as [...] "GO Green", matched the green on Ontario Highway signs, and was used on all vehicles, signage, and printed material. In 2013, GO introduced a two-tone colour scheme that changed the <b>primary</b> <b>colour</b> to a darker green, and added a second lighter apple green.
