50|$|A <b>phosphoroscope</b> is {{piece of}} {{experimental}} equipment devised in 1857 by physicist A. E. Becquerel {{to measure how}} long it takes a phosphorescent material to stop glowing after it has been excited.|$|E
50|$|Becquerel paid special {{attention}} to the study of light, investigating the photochemical effects and spectroscopic characters of solar radiation and the electric arc light, and the phenomena of phosphorescence, particularly as displayed by the sulfides and by compounds of uranium. It was in connection with these latter inquiries that he devised his <b>phosphoroscope,</b> an apparatus which enabled the interval between exposure to the source of light and observation of the resulting effects to be varied at will and accurately measured.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Traditionally fluorescence and phosphorescence measurements are made on fluorescence spectrometers using a DC source such as a 150 Watt xenon lamp. Differentiation between the fast decaying fluorescence signal and the relatively long lived phosphorescence is temporally obtained using a mechanical <b>phosphoroscope.</b> By periodically interrupting the exciting light measurements are made at the instant of excitation (fluorescence) or during the periods of darkness (phosphorescence).

40|$|An {{improved}} apparatus {{for obtaining}} luminescence (delayed light emission) images of plants is described. It {{consists of a}} <b>phosphoroscope</b> equipped with an imaging lens and an electronic image intensifier. It is also equipped with light-sources for obtaining images with reflected light and fluorescence light. Damage to the photosynthetic system caused by virus, insects, high or low temperature, UV radiation, or herbicide, and also chloroplast senescence {{as part of a}} normal developmental process, can be followed by this non-destructive method. In many cases changes which are not visible in fluorescence images are clearly seen in luminescence images. (Leaves of Hibiscus sp., Oxalis tetraphylla, Nicotiana glutinosa with a tobacco mosaic virus infection, Fagus sylvatica with midge gall and Polypodium vulgare were used.) ...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{induction}} {{processes of}} delayed fluorescence (DF) of chlorophyll (induction signals) occur when an intact leaf segment of maize inbreds and hybrids {{is kept in}} the <b>phosphoroscope</b> darkroom for more than 15 minutes (t > 15 min), {{and at the same}} time the leaf is illuminated with the intermittent white light. Resolved induction processes of DF chlorophyll into transients: A, B, C, D and E occur when the intact leaf segment of maize inbreds and hybrids is kept in the <b>phosphoroscope</b> darkroom for a significantly shorter period (500 s > t > 30 s), with the time rate t of 30 s, prior to its illumination with the intermittent white light. Induction transients: A, B, C, D and E are characterized with the time of their generation: tA = 31 ± 6 ms (A), tB = 5 ± 0, 5 s (B), tC = 15 ± 5 s (C), tD = 360 ± 20 s (D) and tE = 670 ± 35 s (E), dynamics of changes in transients intensities (IA, IB, IC, ID and IE) and mechanisms of their generation. The induction processes of chlorophyll DF of the intact leaf of maize inbreds and hybrids resolved into transients: A, B, C, D and E are accompanied by the occurrence and different levels of activation energy (Ea, kJ mol- 1) that correspond to critical temperatures ranging from 28 to 33 °C. The generation mechanisms of induction transients A, B, C, D and E classify them into two groups. Transients A and B are of a physical character, while the transients: C, D, and E are of a chemical character. It is shown that the generation of the induction transients: B, C, D and E simultaneously follows establishing of the oscillations of induction processes of the DF chlorophyll. Oscillating of induction processes of DF chlorophyll is explained by the ion (K+, Na+, H+, Cl-) transport mechanism across the thylakoid membrane of the intact leaf of maize inbreds and hybrids grown under conditions of air drought, increased temperatures and water deficiency in the medium...|$|E
