5000|$|Pigs {{that are}} {{infected}} with A. suum, sometimes carry numerous adult worms in their intestine. Yet, these pigs do not show any disease specific symptoms and are indistinguishable from uninfected pigs. Clinical signs such as breathing difficulties and wheezing, and indirect signs like decreased growth rate and overall lower food conversion efficiency are not specific and therefore seldom associated with ascariosis by the farmer. Although the presence of adult parasites in the small intestine might affect the pig’s <b>productivity,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not appear to affect the pig’s health significantly. The larval stages of this parasite on the other hand, do cause significant damage to the internal organs of its host {{in their attempt to}} successfully complete their hepatopulmonary migration.In the liver, the inflammatory reaction to this damage is manifested as the so-called ‘white spots’ that are visible {{on the surface of the}} liver. Hepatic white spots are the most characteristic lesions caused by migrating A. suum larvae in pigs. After larvae migrated through the liver, the destroyed liver cells are replaced by interlobular depositions of fibrous tissue and cellular infiltrates, producing the typical white spots. Three types of white spots have been described: compact and mesh-worked white spots both produced by eosinophilic interstitial hepatitis and the lymphonodular type spots caused by lymphofollicular hyperplasia. White spots appear as early as 3 days post infection and start to resolve after about 2-3 weeks post infection. As a result of this, livers can appear normal about 35 days after primary inoculation with Ascaris eggs. In order to complete their hepatopulmonary migration, larvae need to pass through the lungs as well. As these larvae move into the alveolar and bronchial air spaces they cause direct physical damage to the lungs. This can subsequently promote the development of pneumonia or pleurisy. The damage to the respiratory system can be recorded at the slaughterhouse and has been associated with the presence of Ascaris infection. It is obvious that the severity of the damage will depend on the amount of larvae that migrate through the lung [...] and that increased infection levels can easily cause respiratory distress and coughing. However, even after ingestion of high amounts of eggs, the A. suum infection itself very seldom causes lethal damage to the lung. It is rather the secondary, opportunistic, bacterial or viral infections that increase the chances of severe health problems.|$|E

Finally, as progressivity increases, income inequality is reduced and wealth inequality rises. Many of these results are qualitatively different than those found in models with idiosyncratic risk, and therefore suggest closer attention should be paid to modeling the insurance opportunities of households.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{alternative methods}} {{which have been}} used to measure aggregate energy consumption over time. It is found that many of the measures which have been widely used in empirical studies are not appropriate for economic analysis. The concept of 'useful energy', popular in engineering applications, is found to be based on too narrow a notion of efficiency for economic analysis. Econometric measures of energy consumption based on production function models are found to be biased due to specification error and may lead to researchers generating econometric results which are statistical artifacts. It is concluded that prices are the most appropriate means of weighting fuel consumption to obtain an aggregate energy consumption index. Such a weighting procedure was originally recommended by Turvey and Nobay in a seminal article in 1965 and their 'Net Energy Expenditure' index is extended in this paper to provide a time series for the United Kingdom running from 1954 to 1980. The value of such an index lies in its use for economic analysis: e. g. assessing trends in energy <b>productivity.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not appear to have any special advantage over other measures for forecasting applications.

40|$|The view toward {{agricultural}} and rural {{development in the}} modern world has changed dramatically in the past several decades. Traditionally, agriculture was thought of an inferior partner in development. Since the size of the sector falls during development, it was logically considered that it could be ignored. Why is that leaders would ever want to invest in a sector that shrinking? Some academics urged policy makers to treat agriculture like a black box from which resources could be costlessly extracted (Lewis, 1954). All investment was supposed to be targeted at the industry and the cities. As a low <b>productivity</b> sector, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not deserve investment. Unfortunately, countries that took this path seriously soon found out that while such a strategy may work in the initial years of development, in the longer run it slowed development and often ended up in failure (Timmer, 1998).

We conclude that the incidence of zero shadow prices justifies the introduction of constraints in the estimation of the Malmquist index. The article also presents detailed results of TFP growth in developing countries using constrained shadow shares for their estimation.
