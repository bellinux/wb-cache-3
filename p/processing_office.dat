Different researchers have implicitly utilised various approaches based on this concept {{over the years in}} a wide spectrum of application domains, but a comprehensive, coherent and generalised presentation of this approach from both theoretical and implementation viewpoints has not been attempted. While presenting here a unified framework for serial multiple expert decision combination, it is shown that many multi-expert approaches reported in the literature can be easily represented within the proposed framework. Detailed theoretical and practical discussions of the various performance results with these combinations, analysis of the internal processing of this approach, a case study for testing the theoretical framework, issues relating to processing overheads associated with the implementation of this approach, general comments on its applicability to various task domains and the generality of the approach in terms of reevaluating previous research have also been incorporated...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{anisotropic}} diffusion algorithms {{provide a}} significant improvement in image enhancement for segmentation, when compared to more traditional linear isotropic filters. However, the excessive computational cost of solving nonlinear PDE's (or applying large iterative filters) on images effectively precludes {{the use of these}} methods in real-time vision applications. In previous work, we showed {{that it is possible to}} adaptively estimate a "Greens Function Approximator", yielding an image enhancement technique which is about an order of magnitude faster, on a serial machine, than comparable nonlinear diffusion methods. Furthermore, the method is fully parallelizable, unlike the intrinsically serial diffusion methods. In the present paper, we show that an additional order of magnitude improvement is provided by a new image filtering paradigm, which we term nonlocal filtering. The basic idea is to adaptively determine a vector field (a form of skeletonization) of an image which specifies nonlocal application points for an image filter. We show one possible algorithm for determining this offset vector field which works well, and gives results which are comparable to, but two orders of magnitude faster than, nonlinear diffusion methods. Moreover, we show that applying an image filter guided by a vector field can be reduced to conventional local filtering acting on a pixel permutation of the original image. This allows the use of special purpose image filtering hardware and algorithms with no modification. The practical import of achieving high quality image enhancement for segmentation at real time rates, with no modification at all of conventional hardware and software filtering, is highly significant. From a theoretical point of view, the introduction of a geometry driven vector field, separate from the details of filter implementation, seems to provide a novel approach to image <b>processing.</b> <b>Office</b> of Naval Research (N 00014 - 95 -I- 0409...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} contains material related to art collector and attorney Ismar Litmann; {{much of the}} material comes from the years {{just prior to the}} permanent confiscation 				of his collection by National Socialists. The earliest document is a photocopy of Littmann's 53 page handwritten manuscript about Jewish composers (entitled "Die 				Juden in der Musik;"), which is undated but possibly written circa 1920. Later material includes copies of newspaper articles published in 1930 regarding an exhibition of 				Ismar Littmann's art collection in the Breslau house of Albert Neisser; a page with photocopied articles in Dutch and German (circa 1930 - 1935) regarding the exhibition of his 				art at the Neisser house, an auction of Littmann's art, and the confiscation and supposed future return of art from the Max Perl gallery by National Socialists; a photocopy of 				article published on Littmann's 50 th birthday with highlights of professional accomplishments; and typewritten 2002 speech made by Rosemarie Littmann at the Leo Baeck 				Institute on occasion of the public showing of two recovered paintings. The Littmann family came from Breslau. Ismar Littmann (1879 - 1934) was a lawyer, who collected modern art. His entire collection was confiscated by the National 				Socialists. Ismar Littmann committed suicide in 1934. His widow, Kate Littmann and 4 children (Ruth, Franz, Eva, and Ed) escaped. Two paintings, which were completed in 1915 by Lovis 				Corinth (1858 - 1925) : "Portrait of Charlotte Corinth" and Karl Hofer (1878 - 1955) in 1927 : "Seated Nude on Blue Cushion," were recovered as part of a 				Holocaust-era art settlement arranged by the Holocaust Claims <b>Processing</b> <b>Office</b> (HCPO) of the New York State Banking Department and returned in 2002.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{illustrate}} a methodology aimed at planning a monitoring network in urban areas affected by hydrogeological instability phenomena. The monitoring network will provide a continuous collection of data and their transmission through a Global Position System (GPS) to a central collecting and <b>processing</b> <b>office.</b> The monitoring of an area prone to high landslide risk, as could be any urban area (the town of Poggioreale in our study case), should {{take into consideration the}} collection of data relevant both for the knowledge of the landslide features {{as well as for the}} planning of reclamation action. At the same time it would also seem opportune to collect data relating to deep movements, to neutral pressures and to atmospheric parameters. All these data will be detected, collected and transmitted using a GPS technology in order to create a database to be consulted in real time, easily added to in time and useful for defining the pre-alert and/or alert thresholds. Of course, a careful evaluation of the geological and geomorphological elements is needed to optimize the amount and the distribution of the monitoring points in the planning of such a monitoring network. The characterization of the geological, hydrological and morphological aspects is necessary to identify the parameters to be used for monitoring purposes. In the Poggioreale area, the lithological and hydrological features and the amount of rainfall constitute the main factors responsible for gravitational processes (MONTELEONE et alii, 2000). The morphology of the area as a whole is in particular or especially characterized by complex landslides which indicate the precarious state of the slopes. The monitoring of the Poggioreale area, should therefore provide for: deep displacement, surface displacement, neutral pressures and rainfall conditions (BAMBINA et alii, 2003). Those sites selected as monitoring points of the network, lie in the downtown urban area and in its immediate neighbourhood. The choice of such points has been made according to two basic criteria: the presence of areas particularly subject to reactivation slope processes and the presence of public infrastructure, dwellings and technological systems representing areas of greatest economic value. The different types of landslide impose also a random planning of sections relating to surface and deep movements, whose positions correspond to those significant areas, aimed at controlling the evolution of the slope instability. The piezometric control network has been planned taking into consideration the variability of the water table which is a function of the different degree of permeability showed by different elements of the Sandy-Marly Formation of the Belice Valley...|$|E
