5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E

40|$|Graphite-epoxy <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> S glass {{buffer strips}} {{were tested in}} tension and shear to measure their {{residual}} strengths with crack-like damage. The buffer strips were regularly spaced narrow strips of continuous S glass. <b>Panels</b> were made <b>with</b> a uniweave graphite cloth where the S glass buffer material was woven directly into the cloth. <b>Panels</b> were made <b>with</b> different width and thickness buffer strips. The panels were loaded to failure while remote strain, strain {{at the end of}} the slit, and crack opening displacement were monitoring. The notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack growth and damage. Except for <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> short slits, the buffer strips arrested the propagating crack. The strength (or failing strain) of the panels was significantly higher than the strength of all-graphite <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> the same length slit. <b>Panels</b> <b>with</b> wide, thick buffer strips were stronger than <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> thin, narrow buffer strips. A shear-lag model predicted the failing strength of tension <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> wide buffer strips accurately, but over-estimated the strength of the shear panels and the tension <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> narrow buffer strips...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental data}} generated for calibrating {{finite element models}} to predict the performance of reinforced concrete <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> {{a wide range of}} construction details under blast loading. The specimens were 1. 2 m square panels constructed using Normal Weight Concrete (NWC) or Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC). FRC consisted of macro-synthetic fibers dispersed in NWC. Five types of panels were tested: NWC <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> steel bars; FRC panels without additional reinforcement; FRC <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> steel bars; NWC <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars; and NWC <b>panels</b> reinforced <b>with</b> steel bars and external GFRP laminates on both faces. Each panel type was constructed with three thicknesses: 152 mm, 254 mm, and 356 mm. FRC <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> steel bars had the best performance for new construction. NWC <b>panels</b> reinforced <b>with</b> steel bars and external GFRP laminates on both faces had the best performance for strengthening or rehabilitation of existing structures. The performance of NWC <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> GFRP bars was strongly influenced by the bar spacing. The behavior of the panels is classified in terms of damage using immediate occupancy, life safety, and near collapse performance levels. Preliminary dynamic simulations are compared to the experimental results...|$|R
5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|With 142 Queen's Scouts as Guard of Honour, {{and live}} {{broadcast}} by the BBC (commentator Richard Dimbleby), Baden-Powell House was opened on 12 July 1961 by Queen Elizabeth II. Afterwards, she toured {{the house with}} the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, her uncle Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. A black marble <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> gold lettering was put on the balcony in the hall to commemorate the event.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise international atomic inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council, {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, Thomas was part of a group that persuaded Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to establish DARPA.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
5|$|The Jungle Book was {{released}} in the United States on VHS in 1991 {{as part of the}} Walt Disney Classics product line and in the United Kingdom in 1993. Home video sales outside North America totaled 14.8 million units by January 1994. It was reissued on video in 1997 as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection for the film's 30th anniversary. A Limited Issue DVD {{was released}} by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1999. The film was released once again as a 2-disc Platinum Edition DVD on October 2, 2007 to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Its release was accompanied by a limited 18-day run at Disney's own El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, with the opening night featuring a <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> composer Richard Sherman and voice actors Bruce Reitherman, Darlene Carr and Chad Stuart. The Platinum DVD was put on moratorium in 2010. The film {{was released in}} a Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo pack on February 11, 2014 as part of Disney's Diamond Edition line. The Diamond Edition release went back into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> his back to the viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone dressings and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a single storey, and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms a porch. The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, ashlar dressings and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting canted bay to the road face. The driveway face has an ashlar <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Two Stars of David {{were added}} {{to the center of the}} facade. One is seen in the old {{photograph}} (above left), over a palmette ornament at the top of the window arch. The other, mounted above the top of the gable, remains visible in the modern photograph (top). The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above the gable in the old photograph, now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older photograph. The decorations to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.|$|E
40|$|An {{account is}} given {{of the results}} {{obtained}} by NASA-sponsored studies which exploit the processing advantages of superplastic forming (SPF) and joining by weld-brazing (WB) for the fabrication of Ti-alloy skin-stiffened structural components. The buckling strengths of <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> stiffeners having the geometry of a conventional hat shape are compared <b>with</b> those of <b>panels</b> having advanced-geometry stiffereners. Both single- and multiple-stiffened panels have been evaluated at room temperature; the SPF/WB <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> advanced-geometry stiffeners developed up to 60 -percent higher buckling strength than <b>panels</b> <b>with</b> conventional-geometry stiffeners. Selective stiffener reinforcement with a boron-reinforced Al-matrix MMC was also evaluated...|$|R

5|$|After {{damaging}} the instrument <b>panel</b> <b>with</b> a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to}} be an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
