5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the front-page {{news of the}} Courier mail daily newspaper {{over the last four}} decades of the twentieth century.

The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> stories about or mentioning women was also substantially less than the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> active in the public sphere. The study attributes the under-representation to the nature of newsroom cultures.
