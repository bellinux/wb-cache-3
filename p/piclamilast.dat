5000|$|<b>Piclamilast</b> (RP 73401), is a {{selective}} PDE4 inhibitor. It {{is comparable to}} other PDE4 inhibitors for its anti-inflammatory effects. It has been investigated for its applications {{to the treatment of}} conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma. It is a second generation compound that exhibits structural functionalities of the PDE4 inhibitors cilomilast and roflumilast. The structure for <b>piclamilast</b> was first elucidated in a 1995 European patent application. The earliest mention of the name [...] "piclamilast" [...] was used in a 1997 publication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piclamilast</b> {{functions}} {{through the}} selective inhibition {{of the four}} PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A-D). It shows no inhibition of the other PDEs. The PDE4 isoforms are especially important to inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells. They {{are the most common}} PDE in inflammatory cells such as mast cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and structural cells such as sensory nerves and epithelial cells. PDE4 hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to inactive adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Inhibition of PDE4 blocks hydrolysis of cAMP thereby increasing levels of cAMP within cells. cAMP suppresses the activity of immune and inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition in an induced chronic lung disease murine model was shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, attenuate pulmonary fibrin deposition and vascular alveolar leakage, and prolong survival in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. A study of PDE4 inhibition in a murine model of allergic asthma showed that <b>piclamilast</b> significantly improves the pulmonary function, airway inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia.|$|E
40|$|Some {{anti-inflammatory}} medications reduce {{alcohol consumption}} in rodent models. Inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) increases cAMP and reduces inflammatory signaling. Rolipram, an inhibitor of PDE 4, markedly reduced ethanol intake and preference in mice and reduced ethanol seeking and consumption in alcohol-preferring fawn-hooded rats (Hu et al., 2011;Wen et al., 2012). To determine if these effects were specific for PDE 4, we compared nine PDE inhibitors with different subtype selectivity: propentofylline (nonspecific), vinpocetine (PDE 1), olprinone, milrinone (PDE 3), zaprinast (PDE 5), rolipram, mesopram, <b>piclamilast,</b> and CDP 840 (PDE 4). Alcohol intake {{was measured in}} C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice using 24 -hour two-bottle choice and two-bottle choice with limited (three-hour) access to alcohol. Only the selective PDE 4 inhibitors reduced ethanol intake and preference in the 24 -hour two-bottle choice test. For rolipram, <b>piclamilast,</b> and CDP 840, this effect was observed after the first 6 hours but not after the next 18 hours. Mesopram, however, produced a long-lasting reduction of ethanol intake and preference. In the limited access test, rolipram, <b>piclamilast,</b> and mesopram reduced ethanol consumption and total fluid intake and did not change preference for ethanol, whereas CDP 840 reduced both consumption and preference without altering total fluid intake. Our results provide novel evidence for a selective role of PDE 4 in regulating ethanol drinking in mice. We suggest that inhibition of PDE 4 may be an unexplored target for medication development to reduce excessive alcohol consumption...|$|E
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a widespread}} disease, with no curative therapies available. Recent findings suggest a key role of NO and sGC-cGMP signaling for the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous data suggest a downregulation/inactivation of the cGMP producing soluble guanylate cyclase, and sGC stimulation prevented cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice. We thus aimed to investigate if the inhibition of the cGMP degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 has similar effects. Results were compared {{to the effects of}} a PDE 4 inhibitor (cAMP elevating) and a combination of both. C 57 BL 6 /J mice were chronically exposed to cigarette smoke and in parallel either treated with Tadalafil (PDE 5 inhibitor), <b>Piclamilast</b> (PDE 4 inhibitor) or both. Functional measurements (lung compliance, hemodynamics) and structural investigations (alveolar and vascular morphometry) as well as the heart ratio were determined after 6 months of tobacco smoke exposure. In addition, the number of alveolar macrophages in the respective lungs was counted. Preventive treatment with Tadalafil, <b>Piclamilast</b> or a combination of both almost completely prevented the development of emphysema, the increase in lung compliance, tidal volume, structural remodeling of the lung vasculature, right ventricular systolic pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy induced by cigarette smoke exposure. Single, but not combination treatment prevented or reduced smoke-induced increase in alveolar macrophages. Cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and PH could be prevented by inhibition of the phosphodiesterases 4 and 5 in mice...|$|E
40|$|PDE 4 inhibitors {{have been}} in {{development}} as a novel anti-inflammatory therapy since the 1980 s with asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) being primary indications. Despite initial optimism, none have yet reached the market. In most cases, the development of PDE 4 inhibitors of various structural classes, including cilomilast, filaminast, lirimilast, <b>piclamilast,</b> tofimilast, AWD- 12 - 281 (aka GSK 842470), CDP 840, CI- 1018, D- 4418, IC 485, L- 826, 141, SCH 351391 and V 11294 A has been discontinued due to lack of efficacy. A primary problem is the low therapeutic ratio of these compounds, which severely limits the dose that can be given. Indeed, for many of these compounds {{it is likely that the}} maximum tolerated dose is either sub-therapeutic or at the very bottom of the efficacy dose-response curve. Therefore, the challenge is to overcome this limitation. It is, therefore, encouraging that many ‘new(er) ' PDE 4 inhibitors in development are reported to have an improved therapeutic window including tetomilast, oglemilast, apremilast, ONO 6126, IPL- 512602 and IPL- 455903 (aka HT- 0712), although the basis for their superior tolerability has not been disclosed. In addition, other approaches are possible that may allow the anti-inflammatory activity of PDE inhibitors to be realized. Accordingly, this Commentary endorses the view of Spina (2008), published in the current issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, that the therapeutic utility of PDE 4 inhibitors to suppress inflammation still remains a viable concept...|$|E
40|$|We studied whether {{selective}} inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysing phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes influence IL- 1 β-induced {{nitric oxide}} (NO) release from human articular chondrocytes. In addition, {{the pattern of}} PDE isoenzymes contributing to cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in human chondrocytes was characterized. Chondrocytes were isolated from human osteoarthritic cartilage and cultured in alginate beads. IL- 1 β-induced chondrocyte products (nitric oxide and prostaglandin E 2) were measured in culture supernatants after 48 [*]h incubation time. PDE activities were assessed in chondrocyte lysates. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and PDE 4 A-D proteins were detected by immunoblotting. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors <b>Piclamilast</b> and Roflumilast partially attenuated IL- 1 β-induced NO production whereas selective inhibitors of PDE 2 (EHNA), PDE 3 (Motapizone) or PDE 5 (Sildenafil) were inactive. Indomethacin reversed the reduction of IL- 1 β-induced NO by PDE 4 inhibitors. It was shown that autocrine prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) enabled PDE 4 inhibitors to reduce IL- 1 β-induced NO in this experimental setting. Major PDE 4 and PDE 1 activities were identified in chondrocyte lysates whereas only minor activities of PDE 2, 3 and 5 were found. IL- 1 β and cyclic AMP-mimetics upregulated PDE 4 activity and this was associated with an augmentation of PDE 4 B 2 protein. Based on the view that nitric oxide contributes to cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis our study suggests that PDE 4 inhibitors may have chondroprotective effects...|$|E
40|$|Discovery of Novel Molecular and Biochemical Predictors of Response and Outcome in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) is the commonest form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and {{responds to}} treatment with a 5 -year overall survival (OS) of 40 - 50 %. Predicting outcome using {{the best available}} method, the International Prognostic Index (IPI), is inaccurate and unsatisfactory. This thesis describes research undertaken to discover, explore and validate new molecular and biochemical predictors of response and long-term outcome with the aims of improving on the inaccurate IPI and of suggesting novel therapeutic approaches. Two strategies were adopted: a rational and an empirical approach. The rational strategy used gene expression profiling to identify transcriptional signatures that correlated with outcome to treatment and from which a model of 13 -genes accurately predict long-term OS. Two components of the 13 -gene model, PKC and PDE 4 B, were studied using inhibitors in lymphoma cell-lines and primary cell cultures. PKC inhibition using SC- 236 proved to be cytostatic and cytotoxic in the cell-lines examined {{and to a lesser}} extent in primary tumours. PDE 4 inhibition using <b>piclamilast</b> and rolipram had no effect either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The empirical approach investigated the trace element selenium in presentation serum and found that it was a biochemical predictor of response and outcome to treatment. In an attempt to provide evidence of a causal relationship as an explanation for the associations between presentation serum selenium, response and outcome, two selenium compounds, methylseleninic acid (MSA) and selenodiglutathione (SDG) were studied in vitro in the same lymphoma cell-lines and primary cell cultures. Both MSA and SDG exhibited cytostatic and cytotoxic activity and caspase- 8 and caspase- 9 driven apoptosis. For SDG reactive oxygen species generation was important for its activity in three of the four cell-lines. In conclusion, molecular and biochemical predictors of response and survival were discovered in DLBCL that led to viable targets for drug intervention being validated in vitro.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the suppressive effects of rolipram, RP 73401 (<b>piclamilast)</b> and other structurally diverse inhibitors of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) on interleukin (IL) - 2 generation from Balb/c mouse splenocytes exposed to the superantigen, Staphylococcocal enterotoxin-A (Staph. A). The purpose {{was to determine whether}} their potencies are more closely correlated with inhibition of PDE 4 from CTLL cells, against which rolipram displays weak potency (low-affinity PDE 4), or displacement of [3 H]-(±) -rolipram from its high-affinity binding site (HARBS) in mouse brain cytosol. RP 73401 (IC 50 0. 46 ± 0. 07 [*]nM, n= 4) was a very potent inhibitor of Staph. A-induced IL- 2 release from Balb/c mouse splenocytes, being > 1100 fold more potent than (±) -rolipram (IC 50 540 ± 67 [*]nM, n= 3). A close correlation (r= 0. 95) was observed between suppression of IL- 2 release by PDE inhibitors and inhibition of PDE 4. In contrast, little correlation (r= 0. 39) was observed between suppression of IL- 2 release and their affinities for the high-affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS). RP 73401 only inhibited partially (30 – 40 %) Staph. A-induced incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine into splenocyte DNA. The PDE 3 inhibitor, siguazodan (10 [*]μM), had little or no effect on IL- 2 release or DNA synthesis. This concentration of siguazodan did not enhance the inhibitory action of RP 73401 on IL- 2 release but potentiated its effect on DNA synthesis, increasing potency and efficacy. Staph. A-induced DNA synthesis was only partially inhibited by anti-IL- 2 neutralizing antibody, whereas dexamethazone (100 [*]nM) and cyclosporine A (100 [*]nM) completely blocked the response. RP 73401 (IC 50 6. 3 ± 1. 9 [*]nM, n= 4) was 140 fold more potent than rolipram (IC 50 900 ± 300 [*]nM, n= 3) in inhibiting Staph. A-induced [3 H]-thymidine incorporation into splenocyte DNA. The results implicate a low-affinity form of PDE 4 in the suppression of Staph. A-induced IL- 2 release from murine splenocytes by PDE inhibitors. The data also indicate that mitogenic factors other than IL- 2, whose elaboration or responses to which are regulated by PDE 3 as well as PDE 4, contribute to the superantigen-induced DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Abolishing the {{inhibitory}} signal of intracellular cAMP {{is a prerequisite}} for effector T (Teff) cell function. The regulation of cAMP within leukocytes critically depends on its degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). We have previously shown that PDE 8 A, a PDE isoform with 40 - 100 -fold greater affinity for cAMP than PDE 4, is selectively expressed in Teff versus regulatory T (Treg) cells and controls CD 4 + Teff cell adhesion and chemotaxis. Here, we determined PDE 8 A expression and function in CD 4 + Teff cell populations in vivo. Using magnetic bead separation to purify leukocyte populations from the lung draining hilar lymph node (HLN) in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease (AAD), we found by Western immunoblot and quantitative (q) RT-PCR that PDE 8 A protein and gene expression are enhanced in the CD 4 + T cell fraction {{over the course of the}} acute inflammatory disease and recede at the late tolerant non-inflammatory stage. To evaluate PDE 8 A as a potential drug target, we compared the selective and combined effects of the recently characterized highly potent PDE 8 -selective inhibitor PF- 04957325 with the PDE 4 -selective inhibitor <b>piclamilast</b> (PICL). As previously shown, PF- 04957325 suppresses T cell adhesion to endothelial cells. In contrast, we found that PICL alone increased firm T cell adhesion to endothelial cells by approximately 20 % and significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of PF- 04957325 on T cell adhesion by over 50 % when cells were co-exposed to PICL and PF- 04957325. Despite its robust effect on T cell adhesion, PF- 04957325 was over two orders of magnitude less efficient than PICL in suppressing polyclonal Teff cell proliferation, and showed no effect on cytokine gene expression in these cells. More importantly, PDE 8 inhibition did not suppress proliferation and cytokine production of myelin-antigen reactive proinflammatory Teff cells in vivo and in vitro. Thus, targeting PDE 8 through PF- 04957325 selectively regulates Teff cell interactions with endothelial cells without marked immunosuppression of proliferation, while PDE 4 inhibition has partially opposing effects. Collectively, our data identify PF- 04957325 as a novel function-specific tool for the suppression of Teff cell adhesion and indicate that PDE 4 and PDE 8 play unique and non-redundant roles in the control of Teff cell functions...|$|E
40|$|CD 19 + B {{lymphocytes}} were purified {{from the}} peripheral blood of normal and atopic subjects to analyse {{and compare the}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity profile, PDE mRNA expression {{and the importance of}} PDE activity for the regulation of B cell function. The majority of cyclic AMP hydrolyzing activity of human B cells was cytosolic PDE 4, followed by cytosolic PDE 7 -like activity; marginal PDE 3 activity was found only in the particulate B cell fraction. PDE 1, PDE 2 and PDE 5 activities were not detected. By cDNA-PCR analysis mRNA of the PDE 4 subtypes A, B (splice variant PDE 4 B 2) and D were detected. In addition, a weak signal for PDE 3 A was found. No differences in PDE activities or mRNA expression of PDE subtypes were found in B cells from either normal or atopic subjects. Stimulation of B lymphocytes with the polyclonal stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a proliferative response in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which was increased in the presence of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4). PDE 4 inhibitors (rolipram, <b>piclamilast)</b> led to an increase in the cellular cyclic AMP concentration and to an augmentation of proliferation, whereas a PDE 3 inhibitor (motapizone) was ineffective, which is in accordance with the PDE profile found. The proliferation enhancing effect of the PDE 4 inhibitors was partly mimicked by the cyclic AMP analogues dibutyryl (db) cyclic AMP and 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp-isomer (dcl-cBIMPS), respectively. However, at concentrations exceeding 100 [*]μM db-cyclic AMP suppressed B lymphocyte proliferation, probably as a result of cytotoxicity. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2, 1 [*]μM) and forskolin (10 [*]μM) did not affect B cell proliferation, even when given in combination with rolipram. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) by differentially acting selective inhibitors (KT 5720, Rp- 8 -Br-cyclic AMPS) decreased the proliferative response of control cells and reversed the proliferation enhancing effects of rolipram. Importantly, PDE 4 activity in LPS/IL- 4 -activated B lymphocytes decreased by about 50 % compared to unstimulated control values. We conclude that an increase in cyclic AMP, mediated by down-regulation of PDE 4 activity, is involved in the stimulation of B cell proliferation in response to LPS/IL- 4. B cell proliferation in response to a mitogenic stimulus can be further enhanced by pharmacological elevation of cyclic AMP...|$|E
