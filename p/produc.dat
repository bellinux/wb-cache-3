The influence of seventeen fungal species isolated from barley produced in Saudi Arabia, to produce patulin was tested in vitro using three different media i. e., barley (BM), potato dextrose agar (PDA) and yeast-extract sucrose (YES) broth. Patulin was produced by 70. 6 % of the tested isolates. The best medium for production of patulin by the fungi is PDA followed by BM, {{but none of the}} tested fungi grown on YES has yielded patulin. In BM, the quantities of patulin produced varied from 948 Ilg!kg barley <b>producd</b> by Eurotium herbariorum to 2448 ug/kg barley produced by Aspergillus parasiticus.

40|$|Abstract: All known {{pyrimidine}} and pyrimidine-derived secondary <b>producs</b> {{originate from}} uracil or its precursor, uracil- 6 -carboxylic acid. The biosynthesis {{of these products}} has been suggested to be uracil detoxication mechanisms. The possible toxic effects of uracil on the germination and growh of Pisum sativum L. cultivar Meteor, Lathyrus tingitanus L. in which pyrimidine-derived secondary products occur naturally, and of Phaseolus aureus Roxb. and Glycine max (L.) Merr., in which these compouns do not occur, were examined. The {{results show that the}} germination and growth of the P. aureus and G. max seeds under investigation were considerably inhibited by exogenous uracil. The effect of uracil was obvious on the non-producer group of experimental plants, especially on G. max. However, there was not any noticeable effect of uracil either on P. sativum, or on L. tingitanus in the experimental periods of germination and growth. These results show that uracil accumulation is most probably toxic to plants and that the production of these pyrimidine-derived secondary compounds from uracil is therefore a detoxication mechanism...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} ongoing {{liberalization}} {{process in the}} market for ad-dressed letter mail in Switzerland.

We propose a simple calibrated model of the Swiss letter market offering theoretical insights into the mechanics of market opening along with quantitative conclusions bearing direct policy relevance. The extent of the entrants’ market coverage and the equilibrium in the resulting price competition are endogenously determined. Our simulations suggest caution in introducing full market opening. For the scenarios considered, the model shows that either the burden of the uso must be reduced (e. g. with respect to the frequency and the coverage of delivery and / or through price differenti-ation).

As the result, hydrophobic silicon-containing blocks are formed {{not only on the}} lignin surface but also in the matrix bulk structure (XPS and TMA data). Novel OIHs were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (29 Si and 13 C solid state CP/MAS NMR, EPR, FT-IR, XPS), nitrogen gas, normal hydrocarbons and water vapour adsorption/desorption isotherms, sorption tests with potential inorganic (heavy metals) and organic (chlorophenols) pollutants. The data of 29 Si CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy show that the silica structures in lignin/silica hybrids are highly, but not completely condensed and Si-OH groups still remain (as it also was shown by FT-IR) opening an opportunity for further adsorption interactions, about 40 - 60 % of silica was incorporated into the lignin materials...|$|R

Streptozotocin administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) <b>producd</b> a dose-related reduction in islet NAD which was proportional {{to the degree of}} diabetogenicity. A diabetogenic dose, 200 mg/kg, attained a peak plasma N-nitroso intact streptozotocin concentration of 0. 224 μmol/ml and reduced the mean islet NAD from a control of 0. 78 to 0. 15 pmol. At borderline, 150 mg/kg, and nondiabetogenic, 100 mg/kg, doses, plasma concentrations reached 0. 161 and 0. 136 μmol/ml, and NAD was 0. 36 and 0. 86 pmol/islet, respectively. 1 -Methyl- 1 -nitrosourea, 100 mg/kg, attained a maximum N-nitroso intact 1 -methyl- 1 -nitrosourea concentration of 0. 162 μmol/ml and reduced the mean NAD to 0. 58 pmol/islet, and was nondiabetogenic; 200 mg/kg attained a peak plasma concentration of 0. 344 μmol/ml and depressed NAD to 0. 38 pmol/islet, and was inconsistently diabetogenic. Islet NAD of 0. 4 pmol/islet or greater is required for integrity of the beta cell.

40|$|Background Design fictions (DFs) are {{emerging}} as a tool aimed at engaging people in debating and questioning the direction of future technologies, services and possible societies. Following the challenges placed on healthcare provision by an ageing population, governments are introducing policies related to ageing that will shape future healthcare services. The exploratory ProtoPolicy project, investigated how co-created DFs {{might be used to}} help older citizens imagine the future implications of policy initiatives through the lens of technology in an ageing society. Methods A co-design research approach was employed. In collaboration with older citizens (n= 21, 65 - 94 years old) the project team co-created two DFs based on citizen responses to government policy, which explored the issues of assisted living/smart-homes and assisted dying/ euthanasia in the UK. Feedback on the DFs was sought from citizens at a co-design workshop. Results Five themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the workshop engagements with citizens: increasing the plausibility and acceptance of future healthcare technologies and services, raising ethical concerns and questions, conceptualising new healthcare <b>producs</b> and services, helping with understanding and decision-making, and service/technology requirements capture. Conclusions Understanding and engaging with more complex social healthcare technologies through a co-design design fiction approach might provide added value for citizens in priming new technology introduction in healthcare services.
