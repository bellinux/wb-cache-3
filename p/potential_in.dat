Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short story In a Grove, which recounts {{the murder of a}} samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E

40|$|Among recent {{proposals}} for next-generation, non-charge-based logic {{is the notion}} that a single electron can be trapped and its spin can be manipulated through the application of gate <b>potentials.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we present numerical simulations of such spins in single electron devices for realistic (asymmetric) confining <b>potentials</b> <b>in</b> two-dimensional electrostatically confined quantum dots. Using analytical and numerical techniques we show that breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry of the confining potential leads to a significant effect on the tunability of the g-factor with applied gate <b>potentials.</b> <b>In</b> particular, anisotropy extends the range of tunability to larger quantum dots.

5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never {{given a chance to}} show their <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> the bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the}} time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> Russia for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E

Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency.

Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense <b>potential</b> <b>in</b> suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression.|$|E
