The test section consists of a 2. 75 cm ID galvanized steel <b>pipe.</b> <b>Tap</b> water and a heavy oil (17. 6 Pa. s; 963 kg/m³) were used. Pressure drop in a vertical upward test section was accurately measured for oil flow rates in the range 0. 297 - 1. 045 l/s and water flow rates ranging from 0. 063 to 0. 315 l/s. The oil-water input ratio was in the range 1 - 14. The measured pressure drop comprises gravitational and frictional parts. The gravitational pressure drop was expressed in terms of the volumetric fraction of the core, which was determined from a correlation developed by Bannwart (1998 b). The existence of an optimum water-oil input ratio for each oil flow rate was observed in the range 0. 07 - 0. 5.

30|$|We {{measured}} the household environmental deprivation {{of all the}} three domains—sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel. A household {{is said to be}} poor in household environment if it does not have access to any two of the three household environmental conditions: sanitation, improved cooking fuel and improved drinking water. Access to toilet facility is considered improved sanitation, especially if the household uses the pit latrine, semi-flush (septic tank) latrine or flush toilet. Improved drinking water is defined as access to drinking water from <b>piped</b> <b>tap,</b> tube well, hand pump, covered well, rainwater and bottled water. Similarly, the household was considered not deprived of clean cooking fuel if it used improved chulla with chimney or fuel other than biomass (kerosene, LPG, etc.) for cooking. If the household does not use an improved source, it is referred to as unimproved. The inter-dimensional responsiveness of the three variables is shown in Appendix 1. In India, 29.7 % households had access to improved drinking water, sanitation and cooking fuel, 16.2 % had access to improved drinking water and sanitation only, 8.8 % had access to improved drinking water and cooking fuel only and 2.4 % had access to improved sanitation and cooking fuel only.|$|R

Thus, responsibility for water network maintenance and removal of illegal connections or stopcocks, if any, was determined pursuant to Article 17 of Al-Bassah Local Council Regulation. It explicitly provided that ‘a resident in any real property provided with water shall not waste water through a defected connection or neglectfully leaving a connection or a tap open.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} in South Africa the state is {{understood}} and narrated in multiple ways, notably differentiated by interactions with service provision infrastructure and the ongoing housing formalisation process. We trace various contested narratives {{of the state and}} of citizenship that emerge from interactions with urban water service infrastructures. In effect, the housing formalisation process rolls out through specific physical infrastructures, including, but not limited to, water services (<b>pipes,</b> <b>taps,</b> water meters). These infrastructures bring with them particular logics and expectations that contribute to a sense of enfranchisement and associated benefits to some residents, while others continue to experience inadequate services, and linked exclusions. More specifically, we learn that residents who have received newly built homes replacing shack dwellings in the process of formalisation more often narrate the state as legitimate, stemming from the government role as service provider. Somewhat surprisingly, these residents at times also suggest compliance with obligations and expectations for payment for water and responsible water consumption. In contrast, shack dwellers more often characterise the state as uncooperative and neglectful, accenting state failure to incorporate alternative views of what constitutes appropriate services. With an interest in political ecologies of the state and water services infrastructures, this paper traces the dynamic processes through which states and citizenship are mutually and relationally understood, and dynamically evolving. As such, the analysis offers insights for ongoing state-society negotiations in relation to changing infrastructure access in a transitioning democracy...|$|R

Such aspects as history taking, monitoring the clinical course of disease, confocal microscopy that enables to reveal acanthamoebas in vivo help to determine a diagnosis. Disease {{is characterized by a}} long chronic course with the development descemetocele and cornea perforation. The sequence of remissions and exacerbations of inflammation, apparently, occurs due to peculiarities of Acanthamoeba life cycle. Acanthamoeba keratitis is difficult to treat, it’s resistant to antibiotics. Untimely diagnosed disease and delayed initiation of treatment in patients with AK promote corneal perforation and inflammatory process in deep eye structures what often leads to eye enucleation. Severe pain is typical for AK in onset of disease. It is caused by emergence of subepithelial infiltrates and defects along the nerve fibers located in the most sensitive surface layer of the cornea.

40|$|Background. In March 2010, Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders {{detected}} {{an outbreak}} of acute lead poisoning in Zamfara State, northwestern Nigeria, linked to low-technology gold ore processing. The outbreak killed more than 400 children ≤ 5 years {{of age in the}} first half of 2010 and has left more than 2, 000 children with permanent disabilities. Objectives. The aims of this study were to estimate the statewide prevalence of children ≤ 5 years old with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in gold ore processing and non-ore-processing communities, and to identify factors associated with elevated blood lead levels in children. Methods. A representative, population-based study of ore processing and non-ore-processing villages was conducted throughout Zamfara in 2012. Blood samples from children, outdoor soil samples, indoor dust samples, and survey data on ore processing activities and other lead sources were collected from 383 children ≤ 5 years old in 383 family compounds across 56 villages. Results. 17. 2 % of compounds reported that at least one member had processed ore in the preceding 12 months (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 9. 7, 24. 7). The prevalence of BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL in children ≤ 5 years old was 38. 2 % (95 % CI: 26. 5, 51. 4) in compounds with members who processed ore and 22. 3 % (95 % CI: 17. 8, 27. 7) in compounds where no one processed ore. Ore processing activities were associated with higher lead concentrations in soil, dust, and blood samples. Other factors associated with elevated BLL were a child's age and sex, breastfeeding, drinking water from a <b>piped</b> <b>tap,</b> and exposure to eye cosmetics. Conclusions. Childhood lead poisoning is widespread in Zamfara State in both ore processing and non-ore-processing settings, although it is more prevalent in ore processing areas. Although most children's BLLs were below the recommended level for chelation therapy, environmental remediation and use of safer ore processing practices are needed to prevent further exposures.

It was found that the surface free energy varied after being immersed in tap water with polar component and Cu ions release. The results showed 304 CuSS could effectively kill most of the planktonic bacteria (max 95. 9 % antibacterial rate), and consequently inhibit bacterial biofilms formation on the surface, contributing to the reduction of pathogenic risk to the surrounding environments...|$|R
40|$|The use of parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) {{equations}} {{to model}} internal flow problems {{has been gaining}} momentum. The main advantage of using PNS equations to simulate incompressible viscous flows is the suppression of elliptical behavior in the streamwise direction of the flow wherein the governing equations become parabolic in this direction. Thus, these equations are solvable by space-marching techniques, saving considerable storage and computational time. Patankar and Spalding (1972), Briley (1974), Garg (1985), Pouagare and Lakshminarayana (1986) and Govindan and Lakshminarayana (1988) have developed their own scheme to solve the PNS equations for developing flow in straight ducts.
