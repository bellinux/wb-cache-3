40|$|The {{deployment}} of encrypted transport protocols imposes new challenges for network operations. Key in-network {{functions such as}} those implemented by firewalls and passive measurement devices currently rely on information exposed by the transport layer. Encryption, in addition to improving privacy, helps to address ossification of network protocols caused by middleboxes that assume certain information {{to be present in}} the clear. However, “encrypting it all” risks diminishing the utility of these middleboxes for the traffic management tasks for which they were designed. A middlebox cannot use what it cannot see. We propose an architectural solution to this issue, by introducing a new “path layer” for transport-independent, in-band signaling between Internet endpoints and network elements on the paths between them, and using this layer to reinforce the boundary between the hop-by-hop network layer and the end-to- end transport layer. We define a <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> header on top of UDP to provide a common wire image for new, encrypted transports. This <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> header provides information to a transport- independent on-path state machine that replaces stateful handling currently based on exposed header flags and fields in TCP; it enables explicit measurability of transport layer performance; and offers extensibility by sender-to-path and path-to-receiver communications for diagnostics and management. This provides not only a replacement for signals that are not available with encrypted traffic, but also allows integrity-protected, enhanced signaling under endpoint control. We present an implementation of this wire image integrated with the QUIC protocol, as well as a basic stateful middlebox built on Vector Packet Processing (VPP) provided by FD. io...|$|E

We can trade- off between costs associated with the number of wavelength converters required and the total spare capacity needed for protection.

40|$|Relying {{solely on}} IP {{convergence}} {{is not the}} best approach in creating future bandwidth-abundant video-centric networks. Extending optical <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> technologies will be critical in cost-effectively creating networks. Summary The amount of energy consumed by ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) is expected to become a pressing issue in the near future [1 - 3]. Of particular note, the power consumption and throughput limitations of IP in electrical routers will become more and more significant [4, 5]. Video oriented traffic is expected to be dominant in future networks [6, 7]. Progress in high-definition and ultra-high-definition TV (more than 33 M pixels) is advancing [8], and the expected source video bit rate will reach 72 Gb/s per channel. The inefficiencies of the present TCP/IP protocol will become more tangible given the advances in video oriented services. These inefficiencies will limit the scale of Internet expansion in terms of bandwidth and the number of users [9, 10], and the approach of relying on only IP convergence will not be the best approach in creating future bandwidth abundant networks [11]. When we consider the routing granularity and power efficiencies of different node systems, switching using a lower layer than layer three IP routing can be significantly power efficient and the throughput can be enhanced. LSRs (Label Switch Routers) and flow routers that utilize layer two switching, and ODU (Optical-channel Data Unit) cross-connects and optical path cross-connects will be utilized more and more as the underlying transport mechanism to deliver IP packets when the traffic volume sky-rockets. Optical path routing has been widely introduced, and the enhancement of layer two routing replacing IP routing has recently been accelerated [12]. In terms of power efficiency and throughput, lower layer switching is more efficient; however, a fixed bandwidth path capability is not always efficient compared to a flexible bandwidth path capability in an LSP. Therefore, TDM paths such a...|$|E
40|$|Micro- and {{nanowires}} {{with high}} aspect ratios, arranged as slim and tall standing metal pillars offer promising features for microsystems [1 – 7]. The goals are: - 1 st fabrication of high aspect ratio {{out of plane}} metal wires next to low aspect ratio blocks, - 2 nd multilayer material link of these metal structures (one wire + two metal blocks), - 3 rd realization and characterization of an acceleration sensor applying these structures. The KNMF services refer to the fabrication of templates made by aligned X-ray lithography. The high aspect ratio templates provide vertical cylindrical holes with aspect ratios from 16 to 33 next to template openings with low aspect ratios (Fig. 1 d). The remaining process steps are to be processed at Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD). Results from KNMF 2010 - 004 - 000365 proposal are shown in Tab. 1. Two main issues still remain before the MEMS can prove to work as an inertial sensor: a) The structures (columns) on the X-ray exposure mask are approximately 1 µm smaller than designed. Therefore, the vertical wire is less robust and buckles (Tab. 1 b, c). Hence, the mass load has to be reduced and the process steps in Fig. 1 g have to be designed for a better wire protection. The mass load reduction {{can be achieved by}} a reduced electroforming height in Fig. 1 f. The process steps can more efficiently protect the wire, if the seed layer is designed differently. The connection from the bottom circuit path {{to the top of the}} sacrificial SU- 8 3005 layer currently runs at the outer edges of the mass block (Fig. 2 a). There, it has to be wet etched for an efficient removal of the sacrificial layer. This step can be omitted, if the connection from the circuit path to the seed layer runs at the inner edges of the mass block (Fig. 2 a). The inner connection offers enough flexibility for the movement of the metal blocks when measuring acceleration. b) The electrodeposition shows to be inhomogeneous due to the design of the circuit <b>path</b> <b>layer.</b> The circuit <b>path</b> <b>layer</b> shows substantial resistances and it delivers the electrodeposition current. A layer redesign including local thickening can solve this problem (Fig. 2 b). Both improvements shown in Fig. 2 have been successfully implemented in a similar UV lithography approach at TUD [2 – 4], [7] and are scheduled in the KNMF proposal 2012 - 008 - 000970.

Design/methodology/approach: Experimental investigations of laser surface transformation hardening, laser remelting and laser shock processing were performed. Trials of laser hardening were carried out under different conditions, with different modes of laser guidance over the specimen surfaces, and with different degrees of path overlapping. Different kinds of absorbents, were tested, the depths of hardened <b>paths</b> or <b>layers</b> were measured, profiles of hardness and residual stresses were measured, the microstructures formed were analysed, and a micro-chemical analysis was made. Findings: The investigations showed that under different laser-hardening conditions quite different surface-layer properties are obtained. A very strong connection of the chosen energy input, the type of absorbent used, the degree of overlapping, and the mode of laser-beam guidance with {{the depth of the}} hardened <b>path</b> or <b>layer,</b> and the through-depth profiles of microhardness and residual stresses of the hardened <b>path</b> or <b>layer</b> was found. Research limitations/implications: He industrial requirements for the achievement of appropriate properties of surface layers, with special regard to the hardened-layer depth, and appropriate variations of microhardness and residual stresses are more and more frequent. The residual-stress profiles should have high compressive stresses at the surface and a small gradient of the residual stresses in the subsurface of the hardened layer. In this way high fatigue resistance of a material can be ensured and occurrence and propagation of cracks prevented. These findings offer engineers new concepts in the improvement of surfaces of machine and tool parts. Practical implications: With the present findings constructors and experts in laser technology can essentially improve the quality and operating life of machine parts or tools.

40|$|The Internet has scaled massively {{over the}} past 15 years to extend to billions of users. These users {{increasingly}} require extensive applications and capabilities from the Internet, such as Quality of Service (QoS) optimized paths between end hosts. When default Internet paths may not meet their requirements adequately, {{there is a need}} to facilitate the discovery of such QoS optimized paths. Fortunately, even though the route offered by the Internet may not work (to the required level of performance), often there exist alternate routes that do work. When the direct Internet path between two Internet hosts for instance is sub-optimal (according to specific user defined criterion), there is a possibility that the direct paths of both to a third host may not be suffering from the same problem owing to path disjointness. Overlay Networks facilitate the discovery of such composite alternate paths through third party hosts. To discover such alternate paths, overlay hosts regularly monitor both Internet path quality and choose better alternate paths via other hosts. Such measurements are costly and pose scalability problems for large overlay networks. This thesis asserts and shows that these overheads could be lowered substantially if the network <b>layer</b> <b>path</b> information between overlay hosts could be obtained, which facilitates selection of disjoint paths. This thesis further demonstrates that obtaining such network <b>layer</b> <b>path</b> information is very challenging. As opposed to the path monitoring which only requires cooperation of overlay hosts, disjoint path selection depends on the accuracy of information about the underlay, which is out of the domain of control of the overlay and so may contain inaccuracies. This thesis investigates how such information could be gleaned at different granularities for optimal tradeoffs between spatial and/or temporal methods for selection of alternate paths.
