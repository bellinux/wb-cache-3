40|$|In {{the event}} of a wide area release and {{contamination}} of a biological agent in an outdoor environment and to building exteriors, decontamination is likely to consume the Nation’s remediation capacity, requiring years to cleanup, and leading to incalculable economic losses. This is in part due to scant body of efficacy data on surface areas larger than those studied in a typical laboratory (5610 -cm), resulting in low confidence for operational considerations in sampling and quantitative measurements of prospective technologies recruited in effective cleanup and restoration response. In addition to well-documented fumigation-based cleanup efforts, agencies responsible for mitigation of contaminated sites are exploring alternative methods for decontamination including combinations of disposal of contaminated items, source reduction by vacuuming, mechanical scrubbing, and low-technology alternatives such as pH-adjusted bleach <b>pressure</b> <b>wash.</b> If proven effective, a pressure wash-based removal of Bacillus anthracis spores from building surfaces with readily available equipment will significantly increase the readiness of Federal agencies to meet the daunting challenge of restoration and cleanup effort following a wide-area biological release.

The study was conducted {{as part of a}} contract which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and Eco Logic by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) in Morgantown, West Virginia to conduct treatability studies on complex hazardous wastes, energetic and low level mixed wastes. The U. S.

In addition to explosives commonly used by the Army such as TNT and Composition B, ARDEC personnel also were interested in the decontamination of shell casings with a residual of the propellant Yellow D which is a common energetic in artillery shell casings used by the Navy.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{determine}} how and what debris clogs well-aged pervious concrete, a fourteen-year-old pervious concrete parking lot was cored and the samples investigated. First, a falling head test was performed to determine the infiltration rates on the samples, and the distribution was such that the infiltration rates were inversely proportional with the areas of greatest flow during a rainfall. The samples were then swept and the falling head test was performed again; and then the samples were <b>pressure</b> <b>washed</b> and the tests were performed one final time. Sweeping removed little debris from the surface, but did significantly increase the infiltration. <b>Pressure</b> <b>washing</b> removed a relatively significant amount of debris from the samples, and also significantly increased the infiltration rates. The samples were then broken to determine if any remaining debris was in the samples. <b>Pressure</b> <b>washing</b> did not completely remove the debris from the samples. 	A separate set of samples was broken and the aggregate was separated from the debris. The debris removed was compared to the surrounding soil via a sieve analysis, cohesion tests, and organics analysis. When the samples were broken open, several of the samples happened to split in half to reveal a cross-section of the clogging layer. When measured, {{it was revealed that}} the depth of clogging on these pervious concrete samples was one inch or more in some areas, which contradicts previous research of laboratory clogged samples, that says the maximum depth of clogging on a pervious concrete can only get to one-quarter of an inch. The sieve analysis revealed that the debris was of a similar gradation to the surrounding soils; however, there were some larger particles than the surrounding soils, which looked like the aggregate from the nearby asphalt road. A cohesion test revealed that while there was clay in the surrounding soils, there was not enough cohesion in the debris removed from the pervious concrete samples to suggest that much clay was retained inside the pervious concrete. An organics analysis suggested that little organic matter, typically less than five percent, was in the pervious concrete, which is less organic matter than was in the surrounding soils. 	One of the largest setbacks to pervious concrete’s more widespread use in the construction industry is that it clogs. By understanding what debris clogs a pervious concrete sample, it gives {{a better understanding of the}} clogging process. This can help in two main ways: by modifying the design of pervious concrete so that it does not clog as easily, expanding its lifetime or by determining a better method for removing debris from a pervious concrete sample through routine maintenance...|$|R
5000|$|Spiral heat {{exchangers}} {{are often used}} in the heating of fluids that contain solids and thus tend to foul {{the inside of the}} heat exchanger. The low pressure drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily.

40|$|Permeable {{concrete}} (or “pervious concrete” in North America) is used {{to reduce}} local flooding in urban areas and is an important sustainable urban drainage system. However, permeable concrete exhibits reduction in permeability due to clogging by particulates, which severely limits service life.

The pore structure of permeable concrete and characteristics of flowing particulates influence clogging, which occurs when particles build-up and block connected porosity. Permeable concrete requires regular maintenance by vacuum sweeping and <b>pressure</b> <b>washing,</b> but the effectiveness and viability of these methods is questionable.
