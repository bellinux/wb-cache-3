40|$|Wastewater lift {{stations}} are facilities designed to move wastewater from lower to higher elevation through pipes. Key elements of lift stations include a wastewater receiving well (wet-well), often {{equipped with a}} screen or grinding to remove coarse materials; pumps and piping with associated valves; motors; a power supply system; an equipment control and alarm system; and an odor control system and ventilation system. Lift station equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. They can be constructed on-site (custom-designed) or <b>prefabricated.</b> <b>Lift</b> station capacities range from 76 liters per minute (20 gallons per minute) to more than 378, 500 liters per minute (100, 000 gallons per minute). Pre-fabricated lift stations generally have capacities of up to 38, 000 liters per minute (10, 000 gallons per minute). Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in lift stations. A trapped air column, or bubbler system, that senses pressure and level is commonly used for pump station control. Other control alternatives include electrodes placed at cut-off levels, floats, mechanical clutches, and floating mercury switches. A more sophisticated control operation {{involves the use of}} variable speed drives. Lift {{stations are}} typically provided with equipment for easy pump removal. Floor access hatches or openings above the pump room and an overhead monorail beam, bridge crane, or portable hoist are commonly used. The two most common types of lift stations are the dry-pit or dry-well and submersible lift stations. In dry-well lift stations, pumps and valves are housed in a pump room (dry pit or dry-well), that is easily accessible. The wet-well is a separate chamber attached or located adjacent to the dry-well (pump room) structure. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the two types of pumps...|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Dutch firm West 8 beginning in 2005, with structural engineering consultation from another firm, ABT. It was <b>prefabricated</b> and then <b>lifted</b> into place in early 2009, and officially opened in April 2009. It {{was one of three}} finalists in the [...] "best public space" [...] category for the Dutch Design Awards in 2009.|$|R
50|$|In American usage, a {{sparkplug}} lighthouse, sometimes {{known as}} a bug light, {{is a type of}} caisson lighthouse so named because of its shape. Generally speaking, a sparkplug lighthouse consists of a three-story living area, with the lantern on top; the whole is then placed upon a concrete or metal caisson. The superstructure was usually <b>prefabricated</b> and then <b>lifted</b> onto the caisson by crane. The classic sparkplug light sits in open water, with only the caisson below it and no dry land, but the term is also applied to lights on land or pierheads that are constructed in the same fashion.|$|R
50|$|The theory {{behind the}} method is that time and cost is saved if similar {{construction}} tasks can be grouped, and assembly line techniques can be employed in prefabrication at a location where skilled labour is available, while congestion at the assembly site, which wastes time, can be reduced. The method finds application particularly where the structure is composed of repeating units or forms, or where multiple copies of the same basic structure are being constructed. Prefabrication avoids the need to transport so many skilled workers to the construction site, and other restricting conditions such {{as a lack of}} power, lack of water, exposure to harsh weather or a hazardous environment are avoided. Against these advantages must be weighed the cost of transporting <b>prefabricated</b> sections and <b>lifting</b> them into position as they will usually be larger, more fragile and more difficult to handle than the materials and components of which they are made.|$|R
2500|$|Special lifting hoists {{attached}} to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to <b>lift</b> <b>prefabricated</b> sections of bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means. [...] Otherwise, a traveling cantilever derrick {{may be used to}} extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force {{in the center of the}} span. Upon completion of the deck the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a parabola, while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended â€“ usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.|$|R
