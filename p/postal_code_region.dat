40|$|Regional HLA {{frequency}} {{differences are}} of potential relevance for the optimization {{of stem cell}} donor recruitment. We analyzed a very large sample (n = 123, 749) of registered Polish stem cell donors. Donor figures by 1 -digit <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> <b>regions</b> ranged from n = 5, 243 (region 9) to n = 19, 661 (region 8). Simulations based on region-specific haplotype frequencies showed that donor recruitment in regions 0, 2, 3 and 4 (mainly located in the south-eastern part of Poland) resulted in an above-average increase of matching probabilities for Polish patients. Regions 1, 7, 8, 9 (mainly located {{in the northern part}} of Poland) showed an opposite behavior. However, HLA frequency differences between regions were generally small. A strong indication for regionally focused donor recruitment efforts can, therefore, not be derived from our analyses. Results of haplotype frequency estimations showed sample size effects even for sizes between n< 5, 000 and n< 20, 000. This observation deserves further attention as most published haplotype frequency estimations are based on much smaller samples...|$|R

40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{knowledge of}} flood risk, vulnerability and exposure in different spatial locations {{is essential for}} developing an effective flood mitigation strategy for a watershed. In the present study, a flood risk-vulnerability analysis is performed. All four components of flood vulnerability: (a) physical; (b) economic; (c) infrastructure and (d) social, are evaluated individually using a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The proposed methodology estimates the impact on infrastructure vulnerability due to inundation of critical facilities, emergency service stations, and road bridges. The components of vulnerability are combined to determine the overall vulnerability. The patterns of land use and soil type are considered as two major components of flood exposure. Flood hazard maps, overall vulnerability and exposure are used to finally compute the flood risk at different locations in the watershed. The proposed methodology is implemented to six major damage centers in the Upper Thames River watershed, located in south-western Ontario of Canada to assess the flood risk. A web-based information system is developed for systematic presentation of the flood risk, vulnerability and exposures by <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> <b>regions</b> or Forward Sortation Areas (FSAs). The system {{is designed to provide}} support for different users, i. e., general public, decision-makers and water management professionals.

40|$|The web {{has become}} a major source of {{information}} for many water resources management tasks. With the growing popularity of the Internet, it provides a convenient, accessible way to provide the public with flood-related information. The present study focuses on web dissemination of information on flood risk and vulnerability to different types of users; general public, decision makers, and professionals. By gearing the display and representation of risk to each user, the information can be better understood and facilitate the flood management process. A user-friendly web-based flood information system is developed to provide flood risk, different components of flood vulnerability, exposures and hazards by <b>postal</b> <b>codes.</b> Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to facilitate the data processing, calculations and data management. It also provides spatial distribution of data, and the opportunity to ‘map’ vulnerability. Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of an area to damage. Vulnerability, as considered in this study includes physical, economic, infrastructural, and social components. By identifying the areas of high risk and vulnerability, it is possible to make more informed flood management decisions. The present study has introduced an infrastructural component of risk which addresses the vulnerability of roads, railways, road bridges and critical structures (hospitals, schools, fire stations, etc.). All components of vulnerability are standardized and represented using a value between zero and one. The overall vulnerability for different <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> <b>regions</b> is determined by ‘averaging’ all components of vulnerability. The developed methodology for determining different components of vulnerability and risk is demonstrated for six major damage centers (i. e., London, St. Marys, Ingersoll, Mitchell, Stratford and Woodstock) in the Upper Thames River basin, Ontario, Canada. The relevant data are collected from Statistics Canada, Upper Thames River Conservation Authority, Canadian Homebuyers Guide, and the GIS databases at The University of Western Ontario. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Decline in {{cognitive}} function begins by the 40 s, {{and may be}} related to future dementia risk. We used data from a community-representative study to determine whether there are age-related differences in simple cogni-tive and gait tests by the 40 s, and whether these differences were associated with covert cerebrovascular disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Between 2010 and 2012, 803 participants aged 40 to 75 years in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemio-logical (PURE) study, recruited from prespecified <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> <b>regions</b> centered on 4 Canadian cities, underwent brain MRI and simple tests of cognition and gait as part of a substudy (PURE-MIND). Results: Mean age was 586 8 years. Linear decreases in performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Timed Up and Go test of gait were seen with each age decade from the 40 s to the 70 s. Silent brain infarcts were observed in 3 % of 40 - to 49 -year-olds, with increasing prevalence up to 18. 9 % in 70 -year-olds. Silent brain infarcts were associated with slower timed gait and lower volume of supratento-rial white matter. Higher volume of supratentorial MRI white matter hyperintensity was associated with slower timed gait and worse performance on DSST, and lower volumes of the supratentorial cortex and white matter, and cerebellum. Interpretation: Covert cerebrovascular disease and its consequences on cognitive and gait performance and brai...|$|R

In the present study, a riskvulnerability analysis to flood is performed. Four components of vulnerability to flood: 1) physical, 2) economic, 3) infrastructure and 4) social; are evaluated individually using a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The proposed methodology estimates the impact on infrastructure vulnerability due to inundation of critical facilities, emer gency service stations and bridges. The components of vulnerability are combined to determine an overall vulnerability to flood. The exposures of land use/land cover and soil type (permeability) to flood are also considered to include their effects on severity of flood. The values of probability of occurrence of flood, vulnerability to flood, and exposures of land use and soil type to flood are used to finally compute flood risk at different locations in a watershed.
