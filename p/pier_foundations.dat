50|$|According to the Italian scholar Galliazzo, though, the {{characteristic}} pattern of alternating brick and stone layers in the arch rip (see picture showing {{the arch of}} eastern abutment) rather points at an early Byzantine reconstruction from {{the second half of}} the 5th or the first of the 6th century AD, during the reign of Justinian. In his view, only the <b>pier</b> <b>foundations</b> and the abutments with their minor arches are unequivocally of Roman origin.|$|E

50|$|The {{surface level}} is almost horizontal: the roadway lies at {{a height of}} 20.05 - 20.55 m above sea level between arches 1 to 20, and falls {{slightly}} in its eastern section, between arches 21 and 26 {{to a level of}} 19.94 to 19.66 m. Since there is no indication of a later sinking of the structure, this nearly uniform height indicates careful levelling and the existence of solid <b>pier</b> <b>foundations.</b> In contrast, the lengthwise axis of the bridge displays often significant deviations from arch to arch.|$|E
