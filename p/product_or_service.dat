5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service),</b> resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
25|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|E
5000|$|Refer to a {{particular}} company, not necessarily known to the consumer, that offers the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> on the market. Trademarks therefore distinguish <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> from a given source from identical <b>or</b> similar <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> from other sources. This function is important in defining the scope of trademark protection.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> If a significant market for the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> cannot be established, then there is no project.|$|R
25|$|A {{trademark}} is {{a recognizable}} sign, design or expression which distinguishes <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> {{of a particular}} trader from the similar <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> of other traders.|$|R
25|$|Software {{testing is}} an {{investigation}} conducted to provide stakeholders {{with information about}} the quality of the software <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> under test.|$|E
25|$|Break down {{barriers}} between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must {{work as a}} team, in order to foresee problems of production and usage that may be encountered with the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
25|$|Impulse buying {{consists}} of purchasing a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> without any previous intent {{to make that}} purchase. It has been speculated to account {{for as much as}} eighty percent of all purchases in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Business {{marketing}} is a marketing practice of individuals or organizations (including commercial businesses, governments and institutions). It {{allows them to}} sell <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> to other companies or organizations that resell them, use them in their <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> <b>or</b> use them to support their works.|$|R
50|$|Where the {{respective}} marks <b>or</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> are not identical, similarity will generally be assessed {{by reference to}} {{whether there is a}} likelihood of confusion that consumers will believe the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> originated from the trademark owner.|$|R
25|$|For {{trademarks}} {{which are}} considered to be well known, infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> which {{are not the same as}} or similar to the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> in relation to which the owner's mark is registered.|$|R
25|$|Social media {{marketing}} {{is the use}} of social media platforms and websites to promote a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> While often associated with companies, as of 2016, a range of not-for-profit organizations and government organizations are engaging in social media marketing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the failure}} rate of startup {{companies}} is very high. A 2014 article in Fortune estimated that 90% of startups ultimately fail. In {{a sample of}} 101 unsuccessful start-ups, the top five factors in failure were lack of consumer interest in the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (42% of failures); funding or cash problems (29%); personnel or staffing problems (23%); competition from rival companies (19%); and problems with pricing of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (18%). In cases of funding problems it can leave employees without paychecks. Sometimes these companies are purchased by other companies, if they are deemed to be viable, but oftentimes they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time.|$|E
25|$|A generic {{trademark}}, {{also known}} as a genericized trademark or proprietary eponym, is a trademark or brand name that, due to its popularity and/or significance, has become the generic name for, or synonymous with, a general class of <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service,</b> usually against the intentions of the trademark's holder.|$|E

25|$|Trademark law is {{designed}} to fulfill the public policy objective of consumer protection, by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> By identifying the commercial source of products and services, trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} {{important}} {{characteristics of a}} project. (i) It should always have a specific start and end dates. (ii) They are performed and completed {{by a group of}} people. (iii) The output is delivery on unique <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> (iv) They are temporary in nature. (v) It is progressively elaborated. example: Designing a new car, writing a book.|$|E
25|$|Distribution (or place) {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{elements}} of the marketing mix. Distribution is the process of making a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> available for the consumer or business user that needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider, or using indirect channels with distributors or intermediaries. The other three elements of the marketing mix are product, pricing, and promotion.|$|E
50|$|A {{trademark}} {{or trade}} mark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, business organization, or other legal entity to identify that the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> to consumers {{with which the}} trademark appears originate from a unique source, and to distinguish its <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> from those of other entities.|$|R

25|$|Aggregated blogs: Individuals or {{organization}} may aggregate selected feeds on specific topic, <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> and provide combined view for its readers. This allows readers {{to concentrate on}} reading instead of searching for quality on-topic content and managing subscriptions. Many such aggregation called planets from name of Planet (software) that perform such aggregation, hosting sites usually have planet. subdomain in domain name (like http://planet.gnome.org/).|$|E
25|$|The product gap—also {{called the}} segment or {{positioning}} gap—is {{that part of}} the market a particular organization is excluded from because of <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers.|$|E
25|$|A {{trademark}} {{identifies the}} brand {{owner of a}} particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> Trademarks can be licensed to others; for example, Bullyland obtained a license to produce Smurf figurines; the Lego Group purchased a license from Lucasfilm {{in order to be}} allowed to launch Lego Star Wars; TT Toys Toys is a manufacturer of licensed ride-on replica cars for children. The unauthorized usage of trademarks by producing and trading counterfeit consumer goods is known as brand piracy.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} the topic of various {{research}} studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> it produces, and customer demands. Thus, {{the first step in}} evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where and how people purchase {{in the way that they}} do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of our being, our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E
25|$|Corporations {{manage their}} supply chain to take {{advantage}} of cheaper costs of production. A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{registered}} trademark confers {{a bundle of}} exclusive rights upon the registered owner, {{including the right to}} exclusive use of the mark in relation to the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a {{registered trademark}} to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> which are identical or [...] "colourfully" [...] similar to the [...] "registered" [...] <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> The test is always whether a consumer of the goods <b>or</b> <b>services</b> will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as [...] "Sony" [...] where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in.|$|R
