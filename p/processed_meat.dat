5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} <b>processed</b> <b>meat,</b> {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th century {{many forms of}} shoe polish became available, yet were rarely {{referred}} to as shoe polish or boot polish. Instead, they were often called blacking (especially when mixed with lampblack), or simply continued {{to be referred to}} as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, Illinois, where 82% of the <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.|$|E

5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or <b>processed</b> <b>meat.</b> A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E

25|$|While some dietary {{factors have}} been {{associated}} with prostate cancer the evidence is still tentative.

25|$|Bacon is {{considered}} by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Zurich found a connection between eating <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> and the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into nitrosamine, a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study by researchers at Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.|$|E

25|$|Most {{colorectal}} cancers {{are due to}} old age {{and lifestyle}} factors with {{only a small number}} of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the food {{producer}} or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and grain mill products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a tenderizer.|$|E

25|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States, it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in <b>processed</b> <b>meat,</b> red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{innovations}} in <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> focus on healthier reformulations through reducing negative constituents and/or adding health beneficial ingredients. This study explored {{the influence of}} base meat product (ham, sausages, beef burger), salt and/or fat content (reduced or not), healthy ingredients (omega 3, vitamin E, none), and price (average or higher than average) on consumers' purchase intention and quality judgement of <b>processed</b> <b>meats.</b> A survey (n = 481) using conjoint methodology and cluster analysis was conducted. Price and base meat product were most important for consumers' purchase intention, followed by healthy ingredient and salt and/or fat content. In reformulation, consumers had a preference for ham and sausages over beef burgers, and for reduced salt and/or fat over non reduction. In relation to healthy ingredients, omega 3 was preferred over none, and vitamin E was least preferred. Healthier reformulations improved the perceived healthiness of <b>processed</b> <b>meats.</b> Cluster analyses identified three consumer segments with different product preferences. peer-reviewedThe study was funded by Food Institutional Research Measure of the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (project no. 11 /F/ 035).
