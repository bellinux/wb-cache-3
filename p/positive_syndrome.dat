40|$|Background: The {{magnitude}} of the startle eyeblink response is reduced if the startle eliciting stimulus is shortly preceded by another stimulus. There is evidence that schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in this socalled prepulse inhibition. Our study investigated whether prepulse inhibition is affected by neuroleptic drug treatment as is suggested by animal research. Methods: Prepulse inhibition was tested in five unmedicated and 20 medicated inpatients with schizophrenia, and 12 normal controls. Results: The unmedicated schizophrenia patients showed a strong impairment of sensorimotor gating as indexed {{by the absence of}} prepulse inhibition. By contrast, the medicated patients showed a pronounced prepulse inhibition that did not differ from that of the normal controls. There was a substantial covariation between the rated severity of the <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the amount of prepulse inhibition—i. e., the patients whose positive symptoms were rated as more severe showed less prepulse inhibition. Conclusions: These data suggest that the impaired sensorimotor gating of schizophrenia patients is not a stable vulnerability indicator, but may rather be related to the <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> and may be improved by treatments with neuroleptic medication.

40|$|If, as {{is widely}} believed, {{schizophrenia}} {{is characterized by}} abnormalities of brain functional connectivity, then {{it seems reasonable to}} expect that different subtypes of schizophrenia could be discriminated in the same way. However, evidence for differences in functional connectivity between the subtypes of schizophrenia is largely lacking and, where it exists, it could be accounted for by clinical differences between the patients (e. g. medication) or by the limitations of the measures used. In this study, we measured EEG functional connectivity in unmedicated male patients diagnosed with either positive or negative syndrome schizophrenia and compared them with age and sex matched healthy controls. Using new methodology (Medkour et al., 2009) based on partial coherence, brain connectivity plots were constructed for positive and negative syndrome patients and controls. Reliable differences in the pattern of functional connectivity were found with both syndromes showing not only an absence of some of the connections that were seen in controls but also the presence of connections that the controls did not show. Comparing connectivity graphs using the Hamming distance, the negative-syndrome patients were found to be more distant from the controls than were the <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients. Bootstrap distributions of these distances were created which showed {{a significant difference in the}} mean distances that was consistent with the observation that negative-syndrome diagnosis is associated with a more severe form of schizophrenia. We conclude that schizophrenia is characterized by widespread changes in functional connectivity with negative syndrome patients showing a more extreme pattern of abnormality than <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{hypothesis}} that haloperidol would lead to an amelioration of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -induced 'psychotomimetic' effects was investigated. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial three-way crossover ascending dose {{study the effects of}} THC, haloperidol and their combination were investigated in 35 healthy, male mild cannabis users, measuring <b>Positive</b> and Negative <b>Syndrome</b> Scale, Visual Analogue Scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye measurements, electroencephalography, Body Sway, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. Compared with placebo, THC significantly decreased smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales alertness, Stroop test performance, immediate and delayed word recall and prolactin concentrations, and significantly increased positive and general <b>Positive</b> and Negative <b>Syndrome</b> Scale score, Visual Analogue Scales feeling high, Body Sway and electroencephalography alpha. Haloperidol reversed the THC-induced positive <b>Positive</b> and Negative <b>Syndrome</b> Scale increase to levels observed with haloperidol alone, but not THC-induced 'high' feelings. Compared with placebo, haloperidol significantly decreased saccadic peak velocity, smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales mood and immediate and delayed word recall and significantly increased Body Sway, electroencephalography theta and prolactin levels. THC-induced increases in positive <b>Positive</b> and Negative <b>Syndrome</b> Scale but not in Visual Analogue Scales feeling high were reversed by haloperidol. This indicates that psychotic-like effects induced by THC are mediated by dopaminergic systems, but that other systems are involved in 'feeling high'. Additionally, the clear reductions of psychotic-like symptoms by a clinically relevant dose of haloperidol suggest that THC administration may be a useful pharmacological cannabinoid model for psychotic effects in healthy volunteers...|$|R

40|$|Disorganized {{behavior}} {{is a key}} symptom of schizophre-nia. The objective assessment of disorganized {{behavior is}} particularly challenging. Actigraphy has enabled the objective assessment of motor behavior in various settings. Reduced motor activity was associated with negative syn-drome scores, but simple motor activity analyses were not informative on other symptom dimensions. The analysis of movement patterns, however, could be more informative for assessing schizophrenia symptom dimensions. Here, we use time series analyses on actigraphic data of 100 schizophre-nia spectrum disorder patients. Actigraphy recording inter-vals were set at 2 s.  Data from 2 defined 60 -min periods were analyzed, and partial autocorrelations of the actigraphy time series indicated predictability of movements in each individual. Increased <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> scores were associ-ated with reduced predictability of movements {{but not with the}} overall amount of movement. Negative syndrome scores were associated with low activity levels but unrelated with predictability of movement. The factors disorganization and excitement were related to movement predictability but emotional distress was not. Thus, the predictability of objectively assessed motor behavior may be a marker of positive symptoms and disorganized behavior. This behavior could become relevant for translational research.

40|$|Aims: A {{case-control study}} is done aiming(i) {{to explore the}} {{prevalence}} of OCSs and OCD among patients with Schizophrenia treated with Clozapine(Target group) in comparison with those treated with Haloperidol(Control group), (ii) to identify the associative factors in relationship with OCSs and OCD in Schizophrenia patients treated with Clozapine in comparison with Haloperidol, (iii) to find out predictors for the increase of OCSs and OCD among patients treated with Clozapine in comparison with Haloperidol. All these information {{may contribute to the}} understanding of the underlying etiology of OCSs and OCD. Method: Sample is comprised with patients aged 18 - 65 who meet the diagnostic criteria of Schizophrenia-spectrum disorder based on ICD 10 and retrieval of medical records. A total of 120 patients, comprising 30 males and 30 females patients currently prescribed with Clozapine(Target group) whereas 30 male and 30 female patients are currently prescribed with Haloperidol (Control group) were identified from the Schizophrenia outpatient clinic in the same hospital. Both groups will be matched with gender. Obsessive compulsive symptoms were measured with the Chinese version of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale to rate the severity of the symptoms. The severity of Schizophrenia symptoms was rated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression was used to measure severity symptoms in general. The social functioning of patient was rated by The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale(SOFAS). A clinical interview questionnaire was developed to determine the social and demographic characteristics, as well as other clinical features of the disorder. It included patient’s age, frequency of hospitalisation, age of onset and duration of Schizophrenia, age of onset and duration of OCSs and OCD and age of first hospitalisation, Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) and current antipsychotic medication dosage(Chlorpromazine equivalent dose). Results: From the 120 patients identified and approached, 96 (80 %) patients (48 male and 48 female patients) were consented for the study. The current study found that among those prescribed with Clozapine (Target group), there were 26. 5 % comorbid with OCSs and OCD, whereas none patients reported OCSs and OCD among the Haloperidol Control group. Patients with OCSs and OCD were significantly correlated with PANSS <b>Positive</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Score and PANSS Total Syndrome Score factors analysis by the N Par test of Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon W and Z score for Asymp.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Invasive {{candidiasis}} is {{a severe}} infectious complication occurring mostly in onco-hematologic and surgical patients. Its conventional diagnosis is insensitive and often late, {{leading to a}} delayed treatment and a high mortality. The {{purpose of this article}} is to review recent contributions in the nonconventional diagnostic approaches of invasive candidiasis, both for the detection of the epidose and the characterization of the etiologic agent. RECENT FINDINGS: Antigen-based tests to detect invasive candidiasis comprise a specific test, mannan, as well as a nonspecific test, beta-D-glucan. Both have a moderate sensitivity and a high specificity, and cannot be recommended alone as a negative screening tool or a <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> driven diagnostic tool. Molecular-based tests still have not reached the stage of rapid, easy to use, standardized tests ideally complementing blood culture at the time of blood sampling. New tests (fluorescence in-situ hybridization or mass spectrometry) significantly reduce the delay of identification of Candida at the species level in positive blood cultures, and should have a positive impact on earlier appropriate antifungal therapy and possibly on outcome. SUMMARY: Both antigen-based and molecular tests appear as promising new tools to complement and accelerate the conventional diagnosis of invasive candidiasis with an expected significant impact on earlier and more focused treatment and on prognosis...|$|E

In this study, we compared the characteristics of oxygenated hemoglobin changes involved in both phonological and categorical verbal fluency between 35 outpatients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy subjects during a Japanese “shiritori” task using single-event-related near-infrared spectroscopy. During this task, the schizophrenic patients showed significantly smaller activation in the prefrontal cortex area than the controls. In addition, a significant positive correlation was obtained between oxygenated hemoglobin changes (prefrontal cortex area, inferior parietal area) and the severity of positive psychiatric symptoms. It is possible that hypofrontality of patients may be a diagnostic assistance tool for schizophrenia, and that the relationship between activation and <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> scores may be of help in predicting functional outcome in patients.

40|$|Background: Schizotypy is one {{phenotypic}} {{expression of}} the familial-genetic liability to schizophrenia, but its precise relationship to frank psychotic symptoms remains unclear. We, therefore, set out to examine the relationships between (a) premorbid personality in schizophrenic patients, (b) the psychopathology they showed, and (c) schizotypal traits in their relatives. Method: Ninety consecutively admitted schizophrenic patients were interviewed with the Present State Examination (PSE). Their mothers were interviewed concerning their childhood personality and social adjustment, and 121 of their well relatives were evaluated with three different schizotypal scales. Factor analyses were carried out on (a) the nine main psychotic symptoms from the patients PSE interview, and on (b) the schizotypal features derived from the scales completed by the first-degree relatives. Correlation coefficients were calculated between premorbid personality traits, and factor scores in probands and in relatives. Results: No relationship was found between childhood schizoid-schizotypal personality traits and any particular dimension of psychopathology in patients. The <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients was correlated with higher scores for relatives on the three schizotypy scales, but did not predict any specific pattern of schizotypy in the relatives. Premorbid schizoid-schizotypal traits were also correlated with schizotypy in the relatives. Conclusions: Schizotypy in relatives has a familial relationship with schizoid-schizotypal traits in the childhood, and with positive symptoms during the illness, of schizophrenic patients. 2000 Elsevier Science B.

Previous studies have suggested the important role of anatomical distance in developing a connectome with optimized performance regarding both the cost and efficiency of information processing. Distance-related disturbances during development have not been investigated in schizophrenia. To test the distance-related miswiring profiles of connectomes in schizophrenia, we acquired resting-state images from 20 adulthood-onset (AOS) and 26 early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients, as well as age-matched healthy controls. All patients were drug naive and had experienced their first psychotic episode. A novel threshold-free surface-based analytic framework was developed to examine local-to-remote functional connectivity profiles in both AOS and EOS patients. We observed consistent increases of local connectivity across both EOS and AOS patients in the right superior frontal gyrus, where the connectivity strength was correlated with a <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> score in AOS patients. In contrast, EOS but not AOS patients exhibited reduced local connectivity within the right postcentral gyrus and the left middle occipital cortex.

Males presented an earlier onset of the disease and were less likely to have ever married. With respect to social disabilities, males fared worse than females on three items of DAS: self-care, under-activity and work performance. the adjusted scores of Section 1 (Overall Behavior) and Section 2 (Social Role Performance) were submitted to multiple regression analysis using the variables of sex, age of onset, age at examination, educational level, number of psychiatric admissions and the total scores of the positive and negative syndromes. Three variables explained a substantial part (45 %) of the variance of overall behavior. These three were sex, age at examination, and negative syndrome total score. the higher the negative syndrome total score, the greater the disabilities for both sexes. Three variables explained 38 % of the variance of social role performance. These were sex, negative symptoms and an interaction between sex and positive symptoms. the higher the negative syndrome total score, the greater the role impairment, regardless of sex. in women, but not in men, we found that the higher the <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> total score, the greater the impairment in social role performance. These findings are discussed in light of the possible impact of positive symptomatology on female social role.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{exploring}} the prevalence and factor structure of methamphetamine (MA) psychotic symptoms. The data were obtained from a cross-country evaluation of substance use, health, and treatment in MA psychotic in-patients. The prevalence rates of lifetime and current psychotic symptoms were determined by using Mini-International Neurospychiatric Interview-Plus, Module M. The Manchester scale {{was used to assess}} the severity of psychotic symptoms during the week prior to assessment. All eight items of the Manchester scale were subjected to principal-component analysis, eigenvalue one test, and varimax rotation. The data of 168 patients (127 male and 41 female) included in the analyses were obtained from Australia, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand. Persecutory delusion was the most common lifetime psychotic symptom found in 130 participants (77. 4 %), followed by auditory hallucinations, strange or unusual beliefs, and thought reading. Auditory hallucinations were the most common current symptom found in 75 participants (44. 6 %), followed by strange or unusual beliefs and visual hallucinations. Current negative symptoms were also found in 36 patients (21. 4 %). Apart from a factor of anxiety and depression, the results yielded a two-factor model of MA psychotic symptoms, which were negative and positive/disorganized syndromes. The negative syndrome comprised poverty of speech, psychomotor retardation, and flattened/incongruous affects. The <b>positive</b> <b>syndrome</b> consisted of delusions, hallucinations, and incoherent speech. Both positive/disorganized and negative syndromes should be taken into account in assessing MA psychotic symptoms. The clinical findings do not support the shortcomings of amphetamine-induced psychosis in modelling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

40|$|Background & objectives: Chronic {{psychiatric}} patients {{not only}} become inactive members of community {{but also the}} heavy costs of their maintenance and rehabilitation burden on society and their family. According to importance of subject, this study aimed to investigate the role of percieved social support in predicting <b>positive</b> and negative <b>syndrome</b> in patients with schizophrenia.   Methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 124 patients have been selected among patients with schizophrenia hospitalized in Issar Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Centers in first 3 mounths of 2014 in Ardabil, Iran and completed <b>Positive</b> and Negative <b>Syndrome</b> Scale (PANSS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and a researcher made demographic checklist. Data were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate regression analysis on SPSS- 16 software and P values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant.   Results: The mean age of participants was 36. 34 ± 9. 09 and their education level was mostly (58 %) primary or illiterate. Results showed {{that there is a}} negative relationship between patients positive symptoms index and their family, some others and total social support (p< 0. 01) and also between negative symptoms index and patients friends, some others and total social support (p< 0. 05). Results of multivariate regression analysis showed that 11 % of positive and negative symptom syndrome are explained by percieved social support in patients with schizophrenia (p< 0. 01).   Conclusion: Percieved social support has relationship with <b>positive</b> and negative <b>syndrome</b> of patients with schizophrenia and measures to increase resources of social support and promotion of patients percieved social support can be used as an effective intervention by clinicians, patients and their family...|$|R
