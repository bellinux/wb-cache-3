Possibility for companies to obtain an official ruling (prise de position officielle) regarding their situation, which guarantees that the tax system applied to them will not be changed in the future. Existence of extensive jurisprudence rendered {{over a period of}} several decades by the French justice system, and which is nearly always transferable locally since local tax rules are, for the most part, based on concepts and definitions that are identical to those prescribed by tax laws in France.Company income tax: The tax base that is limited to profits made in Saint-Martin. Almost total exemption for dividends and capital gains on the sale of shareholdings. Rates of taxation: 10% or 20%. Carry-forward of losses that is unlimited in time and amount. A 10% tax rate for revenue from industrial property rights (patents, trademarks) and copyrights, as well as rights for the production of objects using 3D printing technology. A 10% tax rate for revenue from securities giving access to capital (convertible bonds, bonds with warrants).Tax-Free repatriation of profits: Absence of any withholding tax for <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> resident outside Saint-Martin, on dividends, interest, or royalties.Tax concessions for investment: “Tax exemption” scheme equivalent to a “tax holiday” system (exemption from corporate tax so long asthe aggregate amount of taxable income is less than the amount of productive investments made). Exemption from property tax for five years for new commercial premises. Reduced transfer tax on the acquisition of land for the purposes of priority activities.No tax on imports: Apart from a specific tax on petrol products, there is no duty charged on the introduction of goods into Collectivité territory. Similarly, the TGCA tax (an indirect tax similar in some ways to VAT) is not levied on the imports of goods.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been withholding Medicare premiums from beneficiaries' Social Security payments since the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) program was first enacted in 1965. Beginning in 2006, premium withholding became a payment option for the Medicare Advantage program (Part C) and the new program for Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D). These changes were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Two federal agencies play critical roles in the premium withholding process: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and SSA. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) also {{plays an important role}} by disbursing the adjusted Social Security <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Premium withholding can make paying premiums easier for both beneficiaries and the insurance plans. However, following implementation of the premium withholding provisions under MMA in 2006, there were numerous reports of beneficiaries not having the correct Parts C and D premiums withheld. Also, about 231, 000 beneficiaries had their premiums refunded erroneously because they were mistakenly identified as having paid excess premiums. As a result, you requested that we review efforts to ensure that the correct Medicare premiums are being withheld from beneficiaries' Social Security payments. Specifically, we sought answers to the following key questions: 1. How do the processes for withholding premiums from Social Security payments compare for the various parts of Medicare? 2. What problems, if any, have been identified with the premium withholding process? 3. What steps have SSA and CMS taken to address these problems?...|$|E
40|$|Social Security is in trouble. A {{recent report}} by the U. S. General Accounting Office (1997) {{indicates}} that absent any changes to the current system, <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> will exceed revenues from payroll taxes in 2012, and by 2029 the Social Security Trust Fund will be depleted. That Social Security is in trouble is not really news. The system {{has a long history of}} being underfinanced, and the current difficulties are not historically large. Recently, the 1994 – 1996 Advisory Council on Social Security issued its report with various recommendations for putting the system on firm financial footing. From an economic perspective, making the Social Security System sound is not a difficult task. There exist a multitude of ways for doing so, but most involve either increases in taxes, reductions in benefits, or both. Thus, any plan inherently involves difficult political decisions. However, one part of the solution that is included in each of the three separate plans that were presented to the Commissioner of Social Security was the recommendation that some portion of the current trust fund be invested in the stock market. By taking advantage of the higher returns earned by equities, this recommendation seemingly would reduce the increases in taxes or the reduction in benefits that would be needed to return the Social Security System to financial viability. In this article I address the economic merits of this recommendation. My analysis suggests that the ownership of the capital stock has very few consequences for the government’s budget. The economic opportunities available to society are not increased by a transfer of capital from the private sector to the government. In short, there is no free lunch...|$|E

40|$|The Social Security {{earnings}} test, {{a version}} of which still applies to those ages 62 - 64, reduces immediate <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> whose labor income exceeds a given threshold. Although benefits are subsequently increased to compensate for any such reduction, the earnings test is typically perceived as a tax on working. As a result, it {{is considered by many}} to be an important disincentive to paid work for older Americans. Yet there is little evidence to suggest an economically significant effect of the earnings test on hours of work, and almost no research on the effect of the test on the decision to work at all. We investigate these issues using the significant changes in the structure of the earnings test over the past 25 years, using data over the past 25 years, using data over the 1973 - 1998 period from the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provide large samples of observations on the elderly. Our analysis suggests two major conclusions. First, the earnings test exerts no robust influence on the labor supply decisions of men. Neither graphical analyses of breaks in labor supply trends, nor regression estimates that control for underlying trends in labor supply by age group, reveal any significant impact of changes in earnings test parameters on aggregate employment, hours of work, or earnings for men. For women, there is more suggestive evidence that the earnings test is affecting labor supply decisions. Second, loosening the earnings test appears to accelerate benefits receipt among the eligible population, lowering benefits levels, and heightening concerns about the standard of living of these elderly at very advanced ages. Our findings suggest some cause for caution before rushing to remove the earnings test at younger ages. ...|$|E
50|$|Trains on Japanese railroads cause a {{large number}} of suicides every year. Suicide by train is seen as {{something}} of a social problem, especially in the larger cities such as Tokyo or Nagoya, because it disrupts train schedules and if one occurs during the morning rush-hour, causes numerous commuters to arrive late for work. However, suicide by train persists despite a common policy among life insurance companies <b>to</b> deny <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> the <b>beneficiary</b> in the event of suicide by train (payment is usually made in the event of most other forms of suicide). Suicides involving the high-speed bullet-train, or Shinkansen are extremely rare, as the tracks are usually inaccessible to the public (i.e. elevated and/or protected by tall fences with barbed wire) and legislation mandates additional fines against the suicide victim's family and next-of-kin.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} suggest that the early impacts of delaying Ticket mailing on service enrollment did not translate into impacts on TWP completion and NSTW months. There are several possible explanations of this apparent disconnect. One is that TTW just increased observed service receipt without increasing actual service receipt; because we only observe service enrollment with TTW-qualified providers (SVRA and EN), it might be that the expansion in providers resulted in an increase in receipt of services from TTW-qualified providers, but with no impact on total service receipt. Another possible explanation is that new services were provided <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> who were about to give up their benefits for work anyway. Findings from other research show that a large majority of beneficiaries forgo benefits for work without enrolling for services within SSA’s system (Schimmel et al. 2013). For such beneficiaries, the expansion of service availability under TTW represented an opportunity to obtain more services without changing their NSTW months. The nature of this opportunity is most apparent in the case of ENs offering “consumer-directed services”; these ENs pass through a large share of any <b>payments</b> received <b>to</b> the <b>beneficiary.</b> Services provided under TTW by other types of providers presumably also have substantial value <b>to</b> the <b>beneficiary,</b> even if they do not result in more NSTW months.|$|R

However, paucity remains on research that investigates the motivations behind the transition from cash to digital G 2 P payments and its effects on institutional practices. Hence, this paper examined the case of a government social cash programme in Pakistan that implemented digital payments for disbursing G 2 P <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> poor women <b>beneficiaries.</b> It explored how the interplay of political forces with external and institutional forces influenced the construction of digital payments and its implications on programme managers.

40|$|Social {{protection}} up {{the development}} agenda {{has been consistently}} characterised by social transfer programmes mostly {{in the form of}} conditional cash transfers (CCT) especially in developing countries. However implementation of such programmes has not been quite impressive. Ghana started the implementation of LEAP in 2008 as a pilot programme. The LEAP aims at transferring conditional and unconditional cash transfers to the extremely poorest households in the country. The rationale is to empower the poor and vulnerable categories in the country so as to boost economic development. The study assessed the implementation of the LEAP in two {{different parts of the country}} (Ghana), North (Savelugu District) and South (Ga South Municipality). The main aim was to know the factors that contributed to any differences or similarities that existed as far as the extent of effective implementation of LEAP in these two parts of the country is concerned. Therefore indicators such as effective targeting of beneficiaries, regular and consistent <b>payment</b> of grants <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> effectively linking <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>to</b> complementary services like NHIS etc were assessed. Based on these assessment criteria, factors such as politics, resource capacity (financial & Human), administrative structure and target group behaviours were used in analysing the differences and similarities that contributed to the level of effectiveness in the implementation of LEAP. Using a qualitative research method, data (Interviews, Focus Group Discussions, observations and documents) were compiled and analysed and with Winters Integrating Model, Meter and Horn Model of Implementation and Bo Rothstein Implementation Model as theoretical frameworks, the study concluded that, even though other factors may had affected the differences that existed in the extent of effective implementation of the LEAP, level political interferences, human resource and the target group behaviour are the three most important factors that had contributed to the variations that existed between Savelugu District (North) and Ga South Municipality (South. ...|$|R

Unique definitions are developed for the terms and concepts related to this topic and a framework for understanding the strategic model for INGO accountability <b>to</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> is outlined: Accountable to whom?

40|$|Means testing, or {{reducing}} Social Security <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> affluent <b>beneficiaries,</b> {{has been}} touted {{as an effective}} way to reduce the cost of the program. This report examines the feasibility of several different means testing scenarios and finds the potential savings to be rather limited. The report, "The Potential Savings to Social Security from Means Testing," first describes the distribution of Social Security benefits by income level. The authors then look at the effects of phasing out benefits at rates of 10 and 20 percent of every dollar of non-Social Security income above $ 40, 000 or $ 100, 000 and find {{little in the way of}} potential savings to Social Security. The savings are even less when behavioral responses in the form of tax avoidance or tax evasion are factored in, since a means test would effectively be an increase in the marginal tax rate for wealthier seniors. The data show that over 75 percent of social security benefits go to individuals with non-Social Security income of less than $ 20, 000 and 90 percent goes to those with non-Social Security income of less than $ 40, 000 a year as of 2009. If means testing that phased out benefits at 10 percent were applied to those who make $ 100, 000 a year and assuming no change in behavior, it would only save Social Security 0. 74 percent of its outlays. At a 20 percent rate, this would only yield savings equal to 1. 33 percent of costs. If the phase out were dropped down to $ 40, 000, hardly wealthy by any standard, the overall savings would just be 2. 77 percent of costs at the 10 percent rate and only 4. 65 percent of costs at the 20 percent rate. Accounting for behavioral responses would lead to even smaller savings, could cut these potential savings by half or more. Mean testing would also raise the cost of the program. The retirement program currently has very low costs. If the administrative expenses rose to the level of the disability portion of the Social Security program, the higher costs would likely exceed any savings from a means test. On net, a means test would appear to be a dubious way to reduce the cost of Social Security...|$|R
