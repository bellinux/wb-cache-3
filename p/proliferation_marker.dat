The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of the <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> Ki- 67 /MIB- 1, phosphorylated histone H 3 (PHH 3), and survivin in epithelial ovarian tumors. Ninety women with a pelvic mass who underwent surgery at the Department of Gynecological Oncology were included: 68 ovarian carcinomas, 11 borderline tumors, and 11 ovarian cystadenomas. We performed mitotic count and immunohistochemical analyses of Ki- 67 /MIB- 1, PHH 3, and survivin, related to clinicopathological parameters. Uni- and multivariate analyses of five-year overall survival were performed. We found statistically significant correlations between mitotic count, Ki- 67 /MIB- 1, PHH 3, and survivin. The expression of all <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> was significantly higher in the carcinomas than in the borderline and benign tumors (p< 0. 05). There was, however an overlap of indices between the different malignancy groups. Women with advanced stage cancers (FIGO stage III and IV) had significantly higher tumor expression of all markers compared to patients with early stage cancers (FIGO stage I and II). Women with advanced disease and complete chemotherapy response had higher Ki 67 /MIB- 1 expression than women without complete chemotherapy response. All markers had an impact on survival in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analysis, however, only age and stage of disease reached statistical significance as prognostic factors. In conclusion, the <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> Ki- 67 /MIB- 1, PHH 3, and survivin are positively correlated with each other and with tumor grade, and may contribute in the {{identification of}} aggressive ovarian carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cutaneous {{mast cell}} tumours {{are one of}} the most common {{neoplasms}} in dogs and show a highly variable biologic behaviour. Several prognosis tools have been proposed for canine mast cell tumours, including histological grading and cell <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers.</b> CD 117 is a receptor tyrosine kinase thought to play a key role in human and canine mast cell neoplasms. Normal (membrane-associated) and aberrant (cytoplasmic, focal or diffuse) CD 117 immunoexpression patterns have been identified in canine mast cell tumours. Cytoplasmic CD 117 expression has been found to correlate with higher histological grade and with a worsened post-surgical prognosis. This study addresses the role of CD 117 in canine mast cell tumours by studying the correlations between CD 117 immunoexpression patterns, two <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> (Ki 67 and AgNORs) histological grade, and several other pathological variables. Results: Highly significant (p < 0, 001) correlations were found between CD 117 immunostaining patterns and histological grade, cell <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> (Ki 67, AgNORs) and tumoral necrosis. Highly significant (p < 0, 001) correlations were also established between the two cellular <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> and histological grade, tumour necrosis and epidermal ulceration. A significant correlation (p = 0. 035) was observed between CD 117 expression patterns and epidermal ulceration. No differences were observed between focal and diffuse cytoplasmic CD 117 staining patterns concerning any of the variables studied. Conclusion: These findings highlight the key role of CD 117 in the biopathology of canine MCTs and confirm the relationship between aberrant CD 117 expression and increased cell proliferation and higher histological grade. Further studies are needed to unravel the cellular mechanisms underlying focal and diffuse cytoplasmic CD 117 staining patterns, and their respective biopathologic relevance. © 2007 Gil da Costa et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The {{immunohistochemical}} phenotype of focal neuroendocrine differentiation in {{prostate cancer}} has been intensively studied. Chromogranin A, {{which is the}} most abundant product of prostatic neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine tumor cells, is widely recognized as a reliable marker for neuroendocrine differentiation. Synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase are also reliable markers. The most frequently encountered products in neuroendocrine tumor cells across prostate cancer samples appear to be calcitonin (in more than one third of cases), neurotensin, serotonin, human chorionic gonadotropin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide. Neuroendocrine tumor cells express cytokeratins that are typically expressed by luminal secretory type cells, but lack basal cell markers such as high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63. They are negative for androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and are positive for prostate acid phosphatase. Neuroendocrine tumor cells are also negative for the <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker</b> Ki-67; however, adjacent non-neuroendocrine tumor cells appear to display an increased expression of Ki-67. As opposed to their normal neuroendocrine counterparts, tumor neuroendocrine cells express the beta-oxidative enzyme alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which is a recently described marker for prostate cancer.|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the clinical importance of estrogen receptor (ER) β in breast cancer, 29 archival primary breast cancer specimens, six locally recurrent cancers, and five benign mammary tumors were examined histochemically for ERα, ERβ and the <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> Ki 67 and cyclin A. In benign tumors, most epithelial cells contained ERβ, but ERα was rare. In primary cancers, both ERα and ERβ occurred in epithelial cells, {{the presence of}} ERβ being associated with elevated expression of Ki 67 and cyclin A, and ERα with decreased levels. Thus, the highest content of <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> was seen in primary cancers that were ERα− ERβ+. Most Ki 67 -containing cells coexpressed ERβ, but few showed ERα. In locally recurring cancers, ERα, ERβ, and Ki 67 were more highly expressed than in the corresponding primary tumors, and many cells containing ERβ, but few with ERα, expressed Ki 67. Surprisingly, ERβ, but not ERα, {{was seen in the}} stromal cells of both primary and recurrent cancers. Because the response of breast cancers to tamoxifen therapy is correlated with the presence of ERα, cancer cells that lack ERα but contain ERβ and <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> represent a novel population of apparently proliferating cells that probably are not targeted by the current antiestrogens. Thus, appropriate ERβ-specific ligands, perhaps in combination with tamoxifen, may be useful in improving the treatment of breast cancers...|$|R

The value of securin as a <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker</b> was verified immunohistochemically (n= 44) in invasive ductal breast cancer. In follow-up analyses of the sample of patients, the prognostic value of securin was compared with the established markers of breast cancer proliferation, Ki- 67 and mitotic activity index (MAI). Our results of a small sample of patients suggest that low securin expression identifies a distinct subgroup of more favourable outcome among patients with high Ki- 67 immunoexpression or high MAI. In univariate analysis of Cox's regression, 10 -unit increment of securin immunopositivity was associated with a 2. 3 -fold overall risk of death due to breast cancer and a 7. 1 -fold risk of death due to breast cancer in the sample of patients stratified according to the cutoff points of 10 and 20 % of securin immunopositivity.

Here, we investigate the interest of CAF- 1 as a <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker</b> in a wide spectrum of solid tumors, and assess its potential value in predicting clinical outcome. Methods and Results: Using immunocytochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, we compare CAF- 1 labeling index with known proliferation markers Ki- 67 and MCMs, and we analyze its association with clinicopathological data and patients' outcome. CAF- 1 expression shows a strong positive correlation with Ki- 67, routinely used to detect proliferating cells, while it generally displays weaker correlations with MCM markers, known to label cells with replicative potential. CAF- 1 expression is significantly associated with histological grade in breast, cervical, endometrial and renal cell carcinomas, and with disease stage in endometrial and renal carcinomas. Furthermore, high expression of CAF- 1 is an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcome in renal, endometrial and cervical carcinomas.

40|$|Background: The aim was {{to confirm}} a {{previously}} defined prognostic index, combining a <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker,</b> histological grade, and estrogen receptor (ER) in different subsets of primary N 0 /N 1 chemo-naive breast cancer patients. Methods/design: In the present study, including 1, 854 patients, Ki 67 {{was used in the}} index (KiGE), since it is the generally accepted <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker</b> in clinical routine. The low KiGE-group was defined as histological grade 1 patients and grade 2 patients which were ER-positive and had low Ki 67 expression. All other patients made up the high KiGE-group.

METHODS: After the cytologic diagnosis, reflex immunocytochemistry was carried out on 76 unstained SurePath cell samples (20 routine samples that were negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy and 56 positive samples that were selected with matching histology). Both a morphometric analysis with a software imaging analysis system and a quantitative analysis of atypical squamous clusters were performed. RESULTS: The quantitative evaluation revealed an excellent, direct correlation between the 2 markers, although ProEx C was more selective and more informative for the progression of low- and moderate-grade lesions, because it only revealed cells in aberrant S-phase cell cycle. The quantitative morphometric analysis revealed the increased presence of atypical, positive clusters {{and the percentage of}} positive cells within, both paralleling the severity of the lesions. The threshold of a 3 % ProEx C-positive nuclear area was useful for splitting lesions into groups with a low risk or high risk of progression. CONCLUSIONS: Both ProEx C and MIB- 1 were valid <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> in cytologic preparations, and nuclear positivity was quantified successfully by using computer-assisted analysis.

To estimate the biology of this common disease the operative specimens of 50 patients who underwent surgery for polyps of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses were examined; of these, 10 patients had recurrent disease and 23 patients had an allergy. The investigations included routine histology and quantitative DNA measurements, along with immunohistochemical identification of <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> (i. e., MIB- 1; proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA). Histologically, most polyps revealed an infiltration with lymphocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes, and plasma cells. Twenty-five percent had a squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium. Quantitative DNA analysis demonstrated diploid stemlines and lack of aneuploid cells with a DNA content exceeding 5 c in most cases. Immunohistochemical detection of <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> showed low <b>proliferation</b> rates in all cases. In 27 polyps no MIB- 1 expression was detected, and in 7 polyps no PCNA expression was detected.

Determination of <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> has been suggested as a method to predict lymph node metastases in several tumor types. If this were true in vulvar carcinomas, reduced surgical therapy for patients with low-risk vulvar carcinoma could be considered. The authors analyzed whether the proliferation-associated markers silver nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR) and Ki- 67 are predictors for inguinofemoral lymph node metastases in women with vulvar carcinoma. The authors also analyzed whether these <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> are interrelated. Data were obtained from samples of 145 patients with T 1 /T 2 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva who were treated with vulvectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy. None of these patients received preoperative therapy, and the invasion depth of the tumors was more than 1 mm. The median age was 71 years. The group consisted of 67 patients with differentiation grade 1, 64 with grade 2, and 18 with grade 3; 22 % (15 of 67) of the patients with grade 1, 45 % (29 of 64) with grade 2, and 43 % (six of 14) with grade 3 had lymph node metastases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained for <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> Ag-NOR and MIB- 1 (an equivalent of Ki- 67 for fixed material).

A cohort of node positive breast cancer (n = 168) was studied {{as a part of}} the prospective Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (1996 - 2009). The percentage of Ki- 67 positivity was counted per 500 tumor cells in hot-spot areas (x 630).

High level of р 53 expression and stably high level of bcl- 2 expression in the cells of follicle thyroid cancer specifies deep violations of apoptotic processes in development of follicular thyroid neoplasia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Because cells {{progressing}} {{to cancer}} must proliferate, marker proteins specific to proliferating cells may permit detection of premalignant lesions. Here {{we compared the}} sensitivities of a classic <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker,</b> Ki- 67, with a new <b>proliferation</b> <b>marker,</b> MCM 2, in 41 bronchial biopsy specimens representing normal mucosa, metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. Methods Parallel sections were stained with antibodies against MCM 2 and Ki- 67, and the frequencies of staining were independently measured by two investigators. Differences were evaluated statistically using the two-sided correlated samples t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results For each of the 41 specimens, the average frequency of staining by anti-MCM 2 (39 %) was significantly (p Conclusions We conclude that MCM 2 is detectable in 2 - 3 times more proliferating premalignant lung cells than is Ki- 67. The promise of MCM 2 as a sensitive marker for premalignant lung cells is enhanced {{by the fact that}} it is present in cells at the surface of metaplastic lung lesions, which are more likely to be exfoliated into sputum. Future studies will determine if use of anti-MCM 2 makes possible sufficiently early detection to significantly enhance lung cancer survival rates. </p...|$|E
30|$|In general, it is {{not known}} that ER-negative tumors have a more solid way of growing. Although ER-negative tumors are more {{frequently}} low differentiated tumors and histological grade 3 indicating a worse prognosis. ER-negative tumors are more frequently proliferating, with a higher Ki 67 [18]. Hence, tumors with low differentiation, high histological grade and high <b>proliferations</b> <b>markers</b> may have a tendency of growing more solidly. This is in line with our findings with a tendency of larger cancer cell fields as the pattern of growing in the ER-negative tumors.|$|R

Сellular composition, islets’ death and regeneration were analyzed using histological and immunohistochemical methods depending on the fibrous transformation {{in the development of}} chronic pancreatitis. Given study provides {{a detailed description of the}} histological changes that occur in the pancreas during the development of fibrosis, along with expression patterns of pro-apoptotic nucleases Endonuclease G and DNase, and the <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> PCNA and Neurogenin- 3 at different stages of chronic pancreatitis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe inverse {{correlation}} between dietary calcium intake {{and the risk}} of colorectal cancer (CRC) is well known, but poorly understood. Expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a calcium-binding G protein-coupled receptor is downregulated in CRC leading us to hypothesize that the CaSR has tumor suppressive roles in the colon. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand whether restoration of CaSR expression could reduce the malignant phenotype in CRC. In human colorectal tumors, expression of the CaSR negatively correlated with <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> whereas loss of CaSR correlated with poor tumor differentiation and reduced apoptotic potential. In vivo, dearth of CaSR significantly increased expression of <b>proliferation</b> <b>markers</b> and decreased levels of differentiation and apoptotic markers in the colons of CaSR/PTH double knock-out mice confirming the tumor suppressive functions of CaSR. In vitro CRC cells stably overexpressing wild-type CaSR showed significant reduction in proliferation, as well as increased differentiation and apoptotic potential. The positive allosteric modulator of CaSR, NPS R- 568 further enhanced these effects, whereas treatment with the negative allosteric modulator, NPS 2143 inhibited these functions. Interestingly, the dominant-negative mutant (R 185 Q) was able to abrogate these effects. Our results demonstrate a critical tumor suppressive role of CaSR in the colon. Restoration of CaSR expression and function is linked to regulation of the balance between proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and provides a rationale for novel strategies in CRC therapy...|$|R
