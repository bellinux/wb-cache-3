5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed. The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Special Prosecution Book Poland)—lists of people to be killed—had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939. The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed these murders {{with the support of}} the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, <b>People,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts.

Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} the stops on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork {{were included in the}} construction of the stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E
