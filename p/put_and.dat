5|$|Track {{and field}} events were also {{present at the}} Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began {{developing}} in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone <b>put</b> <b>and</b> weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot <b>put</b> <b>and</b> hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.|$|E

In 1997, he played for the Oakville-Burlington Invictas of the Great Lakes Football League, a junior football league. Aidoo {{played a major role}} on the Invictas, including rushing for 165 yards and two touchdowns on only 11 carries against the Essex Ravens.

The singer also performed in Prilep at the Pivo Fest festival on 15 July 2016, where she sang numerous songs from the album. In 2015, Gočeva explained {{in an interview that}} performing at the concerts where she sang songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 was a challenge for her due to the great vocal effort she had to <b>put</b> <b>and</b> the lack of background vocals during the live performances.

The ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was the FORMAT procedure, which allowed developers to customize the appearance of data. In 1979, SAS 79 added support for the CMS operating system and introduced the DATASETS procedure. Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.|$|E

5|$|The French team, {{representing}} the Racing Club de France, included 3 {{players who were}} later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, {{but this was a}} case of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría taking part in the tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes from each of Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the pole vault and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot <b>put</b> <b>and</b> the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the pole vault, triple jump, standing triple jump and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish pullers took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot <b>put</b> <b>and</b> discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.|$|E

India devolved from the top position in the previous Games to the ninth position with total of nine medals (equally distributed in all medal categories).|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay <b>put</b> <b>and</b> wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E
