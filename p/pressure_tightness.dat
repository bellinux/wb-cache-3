40|$|Objective: The {{impact of}} <b>pressure</b> glove <b>tightness</b> on maximum grip force, muscle activity, and psychophysical {{responses}} is investigated {{to facilitate the}} prescription of a suitable reduction factor (RF) for pressure treatment. Background: The wearing of pressure therapy gloves is often considered to hinder hand performance and cause discomfort, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment adherence during burn rehabilitation. Method: A wear trial was carried out with 10 participants for three custom-made pressure gloves that consist of different RFs— 10 %, 15 % and 20 %—as {{well as for the}} bare hand. The surface electromyography of three forearm muscles was measured during tasks that involve moving marbles, buttoning a shirt, and typing. The psychophysical responses were also recorded. Results: The use of pressure gloves results in a reduction in the maximum gripping force. Gloves with tighter pressure contribute to lower perceived comfort and ease of hand motion. Increased glove tightness (with RFs of 15 % and 20 %) decreases muscle activity as compared to the bare-hand condition when buttoning a shirt. In terms of typing, the forearm muscle activity increases with high glove pressure (RF of 20 %). Conclusion: The forearm muscles are significantly affected by glove tightness in performing different daily tasks that required gripping, pinching, and typing. The increase of RF of pressure gloves causes negative impact on psychophysical response and handgrip strength. Glove tightness in relation to hand performance and comfort is important in prescribing an optimal pressure therapy glove for hypertrophic scar treatment. Application: The findings give insight into the impacts of <b>pressure</b> glove <b>tightness</b> on muscle activity, thus providing a reference for glove development.

50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test {{is a way}} in which pressure vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks. The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure. <b>Pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss. The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant. Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container. Hydrostatic testing is the most common method employed for testing pipes and pressure vessels. Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time. Newly manufactured pieces are initially qualified using the {{hydrostatic test}}. They are then re-qualified at regular intervals using the proof pressure test which is also called the modified hydrostatic test. Testing of pressure vessels for transport and storage of gases is very important because such containers can explode if they fail under pressure.|$|E

25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a <b>pressure,</b> heaviness, <b>tightness,</b> squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|R

40|$|AbstractStorage of {{hydrocarbons}} in underground salt caverns {{created by}} solution mining has been commonly and successfully used {{for several years}} in developed country. Sealing performance is an important technique and safety index for salt rock gas storage. Considering the unique stratigraphic characteristics of the bedded salt rocks in China, interlayer has great influence on the tightness of salt carven. It is likely that stored natural gas will escape along the interface of interlayer. It is the key problem to establish the permeability model and to provide corresponding numerical simulation which is suitable for bedded salt rock. In the paper, based on seepage theory in porous media, evolvement equation of gas permeability is established. The salt cavern in Jintan salt mines is taken as engineering background; during the operating period, the pressure distribution and gas leak distance at interface and layers with different operating pressures are studied. It is demonstrated that the gas infiltration velocity along the damaged interface is much faster than the salt rock and mudstone interlayer, and damaged interface is the main gas leakage path. Moreover, with the bigger operation pressure, natural gas spreads much faster at the beginning years. The simulation results prove scientific basis for the design and reasonable control of operating <b>pressure</b> and <b>tightness</b> evaluation of bedded salt rock storage cavern...|$|R

Refinement is also known to improve casting characteristics such as fluidity and hot tearing. Grain refinement of copper-base alloys is not widely used, especially in sand casting process. However, in permanent mold casting of copper alloys it is now common to use grain refinement to counteract the problem of severe hot tearing which also improves the <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> of plumbing components.

40|$|A {{layer of}} {{distinctive}} microstructure {{known as the}} surface layer or the skin is often observed near the casting surface of high-pressure die cast (HPDC) parts. With its different microstructure, the surface layer could influence mechanical performance, corrosion properties and also <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> of the whole cast component. This research aims to develop {{a better understanding of}} surface layer formation, which is essential to control the microstructure and therefore properties of HPDC components. In this study, microstructural characterization has been performed on HPDC specimens cast from an HPDC-specific Al alloy for structural applications, AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn. Most regions in the samples investigated contain ∼ 10 - 30 μm globular-rosette primary α-Al grains and [Al + MgSi] eutectic, while very dendritic primary α-Al grains are also present in the surface layer. The surface layer was observed in the region where the alloy did not directly impinge on the die surface during die filling (the so-called indirect impingement zone). In the region between the surface layer and inner regions (the so-called surface-layer edge), the only primary grain population is the very dendritic grains also observed in the surface layer. The surface layer formation is related to shearing at the interface between two parts of material containing different solid fractions (f) which can occur either during the die-filling or during the intensification stage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the long-time {{operation}} of salt rock storage cavern, between its formations, damaged interfaces induced by discontinuous creep deformations between adjacent layers will possibly lead to serious gas leakage. In this paper, damaged interfaces are considered as main potential leakage path: firstly in meso-level, gas flow rule along the interface is analyzed and {{the calculation of}} equivalent permeability is discussed. Then based on porous media seepage theory, gas leakage simulation model including salt rock, cavity interlayers and interface is built. With this strategy, {{it is possible to}} overcome the disadvantage of simulation burden with porous-fractured double medium. It also can provide the details of gas flowing along the damaged zones. Finally this proposal is applied to the salt cavern in Qianjian mines (East China). Under different operation pressures, gas distributions around two adjacent cavities are simulated; the evolvement of gas in the interlayers and salt rock is compared. From the results it is demonstrated that the domain of creep damage area has great influence on leakage range. And also the leakage in the interface will accelerate the development of leakage in salt rock. It is concluded that compared with observations, this new strategy provides closer answers. The simulation result proves its validity for the design and reasonable control of operating <b>pressure</b> and <b>tightness</b> evaluation of group bedded salt rock storage caverns...|$|R

50|$|Chest pain is {{the most}} common symptom of acute {{myocardial}} infarction and is often described as a sensation of <b>tightness,</b> <b>pressure,</b> or squeezing. Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen. The pain most suggestive of an acute MI, with the highest likelihood ratio, is pain radiating to the right arm and shoulder. Similarly, chest pain similar to a previous heart attack is also suggestive. The pain associated with MI is usually diffuse, does not change with position, and lasts for more than 20 minutes. Levine's sign, in which a person localizes the chest pain by clenching one or both fists over their sternum, has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value.

40|$|Ceramic foams {{are high}} porosity, low-density {{materials}} which possess unique three-dimensional skeleton structure. Cellular ceramics are comprised of various arrangement of space-filling polygons (cells) {{and can be}} classified into two broad groups: honeycombs and foams [1]. Ceramic foams {{can be characterized as}} linked networks of irregularly shaped open or closed cell polyhedrons, with a low fractional density ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 5 [2]. These materials have a wide range of applications due to their properties. They can be used as catalyst supports, filters for hot gases and molten metals [3]. Filtration is the process of seperating solid particles from the melt, with the solid particles being captured on the filter and the liquid phase passing through the filter [4]. Filtration improves the surface finish and <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> of castings and improves mechanical properties of the castings. It reduces the rework on castings, increases machinability and improves casting yield. There are several established filter technologies presently on the market. These include strainer cores, woven cloth or mesh, and ceramic tile filters. Ceramic tile filters are generally considered to be the most effective [5].

40|$|The latest legal {{requirements}} call to an increasing degree of purification for plastics, for both virgin and recycled material. Abidance {{by the law}} demands new processing technologies for purifying plastics. The extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide could be an approach. Supercritical carbon dioxide {{is characterized by a}} high diffusion coefficient, a low viscosity and a high density. These properties are determining the outstanding solubility in scCO 2 even for higher molecular substances. Furthermore CO 2 is non flammable, ecologically safe, inexpensive and non toxic. One disadvantage of CO 2 is its low polarity and thus its low solubility for polar substances. The polarity of the extracting agent can be influenced specifically by dosing additional cosolvents like methanol in scCO 2. Carbon dioxide also is a gas which causes the greenhouse effect and should therefore be recycled. The usage of scCO 2 as an extracting agent in a twin screw extruder offers high potential for decreasing the amount of contaminations in the polymer melt. The extraction process is examined in the present paper for cleaning polymer melts. Main objective of the extraction is to remove foreign substances as monomers, solvent residues, processing aids and contaminations, which are diffusing into the interior material by using the plastics. These contaminations are dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. The applicability of a twin screw extruder for purifying polymer melt is analysed for both virgin material (two types of polyamide 12) to remove monomers and specifically contaminated high density polyethylene. To implement the extraction process on a twin screw extruder the compounding process has to be modified regarding this process technology, {{in order to keep the}} CO 2 in its overcritical state at high pressures > 75 bar. This is an additional requirement for common twin screw extruders. <b>Pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> was achieved by using a copper sealing in combination with a sealing paste. For dimensioning the extruder for extraction purposes, the processing unit should feature few linkage points. Besides the <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> of the extruder the screw configuration has to be determined and optimised. A reflow zone following the zone for the CO 2 -outlet is proved to provide the possibility for the carbon dioxide, which is swept away with the polymer, to flow against the polymer flow back to the CO 2 outlet. After elaborating a sufficient process for taking samples, dependences of different processing parameters the extraction effect were researched. In general the highest extraction effect can be realised by increasing pressure, screw speed, processing temperature and the CO 2 -flow. Contrary to this an increased temperature level results in charred melt and a high CO 2 flow has a negative effect on the economy of the extraction process. The integration of a degassing unit and a counter flow process were also investigated. To do so an extruder cascade is inevitable due to safety reasons. Furthermore the extruder cascade facilitates stable processing conditions and simplified process control. Regarding the counter flow processing, the used screw configuration is inappropriate. Due to this improvement of the screw design is inevitable. Industry is reluctant using supercritical fluids despite of the considerable advantages. Reasons for the scepticism can be found in the high investment cost al well as using hegh pressure processing technology. However the increasing relevance of {{legal requirements}} and the progressive development will promote this technology...|$|E

The ball plugs were inserted at the CEP. Leaking was observed through the ball plugs during the CEP engine quality control operation. An investigation was launched to determine and eliminate {{the cause of the}} leaks. In order to isolate the main leak culprits, tests were subdivided into sections, which included: the heat treatment parameters applied to the 319 Al cylinder heads; metallurgical and geometrical characterization of the ball plug including: ball and casting microstructural analysis, hardness and homogeneity analysis, casting scratch and compression tests, characterization of the ball/casting hole wall interface, ball plug insertion and <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness</b> tests, effect of the insertion speed, ball lubrication and casting microhardness on the insertion force; geometrical investigation of the cylinder head boss design; leak mechanisms SEM/EDS investigation, as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the stress distribution in the ball and cylinder plug systems.

In this thesis the development of the RPT to a truly quantitative level is discussed. This includes redesigning of the steel mold and the application of a riser. The mold was redesigned to improve the test sensitivity while a CO$ sb 2 $-bonded sand riser was applied in order to eliminate volumetric shrinkage and ensure a constant volume sample. As the sample has a constant volume, either the sample weight or density can be used to quantify the hydrogen content. The simplest technique is to use the sample weight. Several parameters that affect the test sensitivity and reproducibility were studied, such as chamber pressure, amount of inclusions, pouring temperature, and mold temperature. It was found that there are two important parameters that strongly affect the test; chamber pressure and amount of inclusions. The lower the chamber pressure the better the test sensitivity but the poorer the test reproducibility. Increasing the amount of inclusions improves the test sensitivity. The constant volume sample can be used to predict the amount of hydrogen in the melt for various types of alloys including 319, 356, 357 and 413 within a reasonable margin of error. The error as measured by this technique was found to be in the range of $ pm$ 0. 025 - 0. 049 ml. / 100 g. Al. if the sample weight is used, and in the range of $ pm$ 0. 025 - 0. 047 ml. / 100 g,Al. if the sample density is used. A simple mathematical model based on a mass balance approach was developed to calculate pore size and sample density. The model predicts the density accurately for various types of alloys and different melt treatments...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting {{is one of the}} most cost-effective methods for mass producing aluminium components. Thus, for example, die casting is used to currently manufacture a large volume of all aluminium engines. However, besides the undisputed advantages, the restricted freedom in mould design largely limits the applications of high {{pressure die}} casting. Although in the past it was possible to significantly improve this situation by means of sliding core technologies, it is however still not possible to represent complex internal geometries. This can only be achieved by using lost cores. Conventional core systems made of sand, i. e. for low {{pressure die casting}}, only partially endure the high mechanical loading. However, continuously increasing component and material requirements necessitate constructions having internal contours. An example are crankcases which can currently be high pressure die cast using mass production technology only in an open-deck construction. By using an operational coring system, the motors could also be cast as a single piece in a closed-deck. In relation to this, there are commercial endeavours to implement suitable sand and salt coring systems. Another application which is considered in this work is a combination of lost cores for die casting partially liquid metal suspensions. Rheocast processes are a particularly cost-effective alternative to conventional high pressure die casting and provide, moreover, advantages intrinsic to the process such as, for example, lower shrinkage, <b>pressure</b> <b>tightness,</b> near-net shapes as well as the possibility of carrying out heat treatments or welding thick-walled components. A decisive advantage for implementing lost cores is a significantly slower and, in the ideal case, a non-turbulent flow. By using the cooling channel process, which was developed at the Foundry Institute of RWTH Aachen, different coring systems based on sand, salt, zinc and plastic are well proven in tests with respect to their suitability for rheocasting. Furthermore, the parameters influencing the material and the process are determined and thoroughly investigated for the cooling channel process. Here, the aim is both to provide a reproducible input material, which is as homogeneous as possible, for subsequently high pressure die casting using lost cores as well as to assess the suitability of the cores and the cooling channel process for possible industrial applications. Moreover, the knowledge gained about both rheocasting as well as highly reactive alloys, which can be employed due to the lower processing temperatures, is firstly verified by means of the alloy AlLi 2. 1 Mg 5. 5. Secondly, the influences of processing the partial-liquid in the Rheo-Container-Process on the morphology and phase formation are analysed in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a deep water composite production riser from a system perspective is presented, and its advantages are articulated through comparisons with a typical steel riser under identical service conditions. The composite riser joints {{in this study were}} considered {{to be a part of}} a single Tension Leg Platform (TLP) riser string to be installed at a depth of 6000 ft in Gulf of Mexico. A series of numerical analyses ??????burst, collapse, fatigue, global and local ?????? have been performed, and the capacities of the composite riser have been determined utilizing long-term strength properties. The capacities associated with the hoop direction, i. e., burst and collapse, are limited by the presence of a steel internal liner whose function is to ensure <b>pressure</b> and fluid <b>tightness.</b> The collapse capacity of the riser can be drastically impaired by the presence of a debond between the liner and composite. Due to the high strength to weight ratio of the carbon/epoxy composite, its response under combined axial tension and bending moment showed great safety margins, favoring pursuits of greater water depths. The study also constructed damage envelopes associated with axial tension and bending moment, which facilitate feasibility checks for expanding the use of the composite joints to other locations or systems. The fatigue life of the composite body is expected to greatly exceed its design life, and the most critical element is the welds between the liner and metal end pieces. Since there is wide dispersion of S-N relationships for carbon/epoxy composites depending on the combinations of constituent materials, a parametric study was carried out in this study to suggest the range of acceptable S-N relationships. The composite riser is estimated to offer only moderate damping, due primarily to its specially orthotropic lay-up. The study also demonstrates that the use of Rayleigh stiffness proportional damping may not be suitable for deep water risers. A series of forced excitation analyses show that the system in sea water does not show notable resonance due to fluid drag. When compared with the steel riser, vibration amplitudes at low elevations are much lower...|$|R
40|$|Management review In 2014, all Finnish {{nuclear power}} plants {{operated}} safely and caused no danger to their surrounding environment or employees. The collective radiation doses of employees were yet again historically low and the radioactive releases into the environment very small. The low employee radiation doses {{were the result of}} short annual outages and improvements implemented by the NPPs. Radioactive waste generated in the operational processes of the NPPs accumulated as anticipated. Its processing and final disposal in underground facilities took place in a controlled manner. An emergency preparedness drill was arranged at the Loviisa NPP in November to practice, {{for the first time in}} Finland, a simultaneous emergency at two plant units. In 2014, six events warranting a special report were reported by Loviisa NPP. These events did not influence the safety of the employees or the area surrounding the plant. Fortum Power and Heat Oy (hereinafter referred to as “Fortum”) has several pending long-term nuclear safety development projects that involve development of the management system, processing of operational events, as well as maintenance of the operational limits and conditions. STUK will monitor their progress and assess effectiveness of the measures. As part of the oversight of the organisation, STUK ordered a study to assess the nuclear safety culture of Fortum and the functionality of related procedures. The report states that safety is appreciated at Loviisa NPP and the safety culture in general is at an acceptable level. However, the NPP must continue active development of the safety culture. In 2014, three events warranting a special report were reported by the operating units at Olkiluoto. These events did not influence the safety of the employees or the area surrounding the plant. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the inspection programme during the annual outage. Good operations and examples of continuous improvement were observed during the inspection. During inservice inspections carried out during the annual outage, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (hereinafter “TVO”) detected cracks in the feedwater lines of both plant units. The cracked mixing points will be replaced during the next annual outage. In 2014, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on the plant’s management, modification and procurement processes. A reformed modification work process was introduced in 2014. At both Olkiluoto and Loviisa, modifications required for improving safety continued regarding plant systems, structures and components as well as operating procedures. An expansion project of the interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel at Olkiluoto proceeded as planned in 2014. System modifications have been completed. A decision on an application to increase the capacity of the interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel is being processed by STUK. An upgrade project regarding the reactor coolant pumps, their control and the frequency converters needed to supply power to the pumps has been started at Olkiluoto. STUK approved the project’s conceptual design plans in 2014. As a result of the Fukushima accident, Olkiluoto will improve, for example, systems used to cool the reactor and add whole new systems for pumping water into the reactor in case of a complete loss of AC power. In 2014, a modification of an auxiliary feedwater system recirculation line was implemented at Olkiluoto 1. It reduces the system’s dependence on seawater cooling. The purpose of an I&C renewal project launched at Loviisa NPP in 2005 was to digitalise almost the entire I&C system of the plant. In 2014, Fortum announced that the supplier of the modernisation had been changed and the scope of the renewal project had been significantly cut back, which is why the project would not be completed until by the end of 2018. Modifications implemented in 2014 included improving reliability of the reactor coolant system’s pressure control system at Loviisa 2 and installing qualified safety valves for the secondary side water and water/steam flow. As a result of the Fukushima accident, four air-cooled heat exchangers have been installed that will ensure cooling of the fuel in the reactor and the fuel pools in case heat transfer to the sea is lost. Furthermore, separate flood protection components have been installed in some systems important to safety. The protection elements take into account exceptionally high seawater levels during a storm. Most of the detailed design of the Olkiluoto 3 plant unit has been approved by STUK, and the volumes of construction work and component manufacture have decreased. Installation activity at the Olkiluoto 3 construction site has also slowed down starting in early 2014. Manufacture and installation of the emergency diesel generator auxiliary system pipelines were almost the only works still ongoing in 2014. <b>Pressure</b> and leak <b>tightness</b> tests of the containment took place at the nuclear island in February. STUK inspected the plant site before testing and oversaw the testing. Results of the tests clearly met the acceptance criteria. The most important open issue regarding plant design at Olkiluoto 3 is the I&C systems. In 2014, the licensing of I&C proceeded well as STUK approved the overall I&C plan, i. e. architecture, and found that the analysis of I&C active failures were acceptable. Next, STUK started reviewing the technical I&C materials. In 2014, STUK ordered a preliminary report on the safety culture during commissioning of Olkiluoto 3. Challenges highlighted in the report included the highly complex stage during the lifecycle of the plant and the fact that open items and deviations from the construction stage tend to cumulate. Issues that were deemed especially challenging included potential slow processing of unexpected events and people focusing only on their own work in a very narrow sector. The results will assist STUK in targeting its regulatory oversight to the key issues and challenges during the commissioning stage. In 2014, STUK drafted preliminary safety assessments on supplementary applications for the decisions-in-principle on Fennovoima’s Hanhikivi 1 and TVO’s Olkiluoto 4. In its preliminary safety assessment on Fennovoima’s Hanhikivi 1 plant unit, STUK stated that an AES- 2006 nuclear power plant of Rosatom can be constructed in a manner that meets the Finnish safety requirements. However, STUK raised some issues where meeting of the Finnish safety requirements would require changing of the NPP design, such as provisions for an airplane crash, internal floods, fires and severe accidents. STUK also stated that Fennovoima must improve its expertise and develop its management system in order to be capable to assess and ensure the safety of a new NPP, as well as to draft the construction license materials to be submitted to STUK. In its supplementary application, TVO applied for an extension of five years to the deadline for submitting a construction license application for the new nuclear power plant unit at Olkiluoto in compliance with the 2010 decision-in-principle. STUK stated that there are no nuclear safety issues that would prevent the extending of the deadline. The Government approved Fennovoima’s supplementary application for the decision-in-principle and the Parliament ratified it. The Government refused TVO’s application on an extension to the deadline for the construction license application. In 2014, STUK continued its preparations for the processing of the construction license applications. The processing and storage of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel, as well as the nuclear fuel repository project, proceeded safely, and no problems were detected at Loviisa or Olkiluoto. Due to the successful planning of operations, the plants accumulated clearly less nuclear waste than NPPs on average. At Loviisa NPP, STUK supervised the commissioning of a liquid waste solidification facility. Damage was observed in concrete containers used in solidification at the end of 2013. Trial runs were discontinued to study their cause. STUK deemed the conclusions made based on reports correct. Loviisa NPP continued its activities and studies pertaining to the commissioning of the solidification facility, and the trial runs should be completed by the end of 2015. STUK reviewed and approved a periodic safety assessment of the Loviisa low- and intermediate-level operational waste repository and stated that the safety level of the repository is good and its operation can be safely continued. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is preparing the decommissioning of a research reactor at Otaniemi. STUK issued statements on the environmental impact assessment program for the decommissioning and a related report. The project by Posiva Oy (hereinafter referred to as “Posiva”) on final disposal of spent nuclear fuel has proceeded: Posiva submitted a construction license application for the encapsulation plant and disposal facility to the Government in late 2012. Posiva submitted to STUK the safety documentation required by the Nuclear Energy Decree and STUK started reviewing the materials in early 2013. The fact that some of the application materials were submitted to STUK late and the need for additional information to some documents was postponed the review process, which was completed in late 2014. A statement by the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Safety on the Posiva construction license application and the preliminary safety assessment by STUK, as well as STUK’s statement, could not be submitted to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy until in early 2015. The process was very demanding because it was the first preliminary safety assessment for a repository of this type in the world. STUK used a team of Finnish and international experts from a variety of technical sectors as an aid in its review. In addition to reviewing the documents, STUK conducted inspections of Posiva’s management system and organisation. STUK was able to determine that the encapsulation plant and disposal facility can be constructed in such a manner that it will be safe. In separate decisions on documents by virtue of section 35 of the Nuclear Energy Act, STUK presented specific requirements regarding the construction stage. The requirements included supplementing the system design of the encapsulation plant in compliance with the construction stages, further studies on the performance of the barriers of the repository and development of the long-term safety case for the operating license application. The construction of the underground research facility (Onkalo) was completed for the most part by the end of 2012. In 2014, Posiva excavated facilities to be used to test the final disposal method, as well as the last of the shafts and tunnels, and completed structural engineering works. STUK supervised the construction of the underground research facility, the operations of Posiva’s organisation and the research carried out at Onkalo. The safeguards of nuclear materials in Finland was implemented in compliance with the international agreements. Annual verifications of design information were implemented for the nuclear power plant units under construction and the physical inventories of nuclear materials of the operating NPPs were verified. STUK verified the correctness of stored fuel data by means of spent fuel measurements. Furthermore, STUK inspected the operations of other nuclear material holders and physical inventory results. As a summary of the inspections and oversight in 2014, STUK could state that nuclear energy was used in compliance with the reports and no unannounced activities took place. Inspection results submitted by the IAEA and the European Commission as well as conclusions made based on the inspection activities also support STUK’s observations. In 2014, the IAEA and the Commission started electronic transfer of surveillance data from Loviisa NPP directly to the Commission and further to the IAEA. Enabling the electronic transfer of monitoring data is an obligation laid down in the Additional Protocol of the Safeguards Agreement between Finland and the IAEA. STUK’s duty was to support the NPPs and international organisations when they ensure that the electronic data transfer complies with all requirements pertaining to nuclear security and information security. In 2014, STUK participated in a laser scanning campaign of the Onkalo facility carried out by the Commission and the IAEA where it was verified that Onkalo has been constructed as reported. The results of the campaign can be used as reference data in future inspections of Onkalo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of {{environmental impacts of}} carbon dioxide geological storage requires {{the investigation of the}} potential CO 2 leakages into fresh groundwater reserves. The Albian aquifer of the Paris Basin was chosen as a case of study because i) the Paris Basin contains deep saline Jurassic and Triassic aquifers identified as targets by the French national program of CO 2 geological storage and ii) the Albian aquifer is a deep freshwater resource of strategic national importance, above the Jurassic and Triassic formations. An experimental and a geochemical modelling approach were carried out in order to better understand the rock-water-CO 2 interactions with two main objectives: to assess the evolution of the chemistry of the formation water and of the mineralogy of the solid phase during the interaction and to design a monitoring program for freshwater resources. The main focus is to select and develop suitable indirect indicators of the presence of CO 2 in the aquifer. We present here the experimental results, which combines both major and trace elements and isotopic tools, some of them new in the CCS field. Batch reactors with a liquid/solid ratio of 10 made of appropriate materials (PTFE, stainless steel) were equipped with simultaneous controls on several parameters (pH measurement, gas phase composition, <b>pressure,</b> <b>tightness...)</b> after CO 2 injection (PCO 2 = 2 bar; room temperature). Ten reactors were run simultaneously, over pre-determined durations of CO 2 -water-rock interaction (1, 7, 15 and 30 days). During the batch experiment, we observed major changes in several chemical parameters due to the CO 2 injection. A sharp drop in pH from 6. 6 to 4. 9 was noticeable, immediately after the injection, due to CO 2 dissolution in the water phase. Alkalinity varies from 1. 3 mmol. L- 1 in the initial water to 2. 0 mmol. L- 1 {{at the end of the}} 1 -month experiment. Four types of ion behaviors are observed: (1) calcium, silicon and magnesium concentrations increase during the 1 -month experiment; (2) dissolved iron strongly decreases immediately after CO 2 injection; (3) potassium, sodium and fluorine concentrations increase at the start of CO 2 injection and then stabilize to levels higher than the pre-injection concentrations, (4) chlorides and sulfates are stable. These variations indicate dissolution/precipitation and surface reactions involving mineral phases such as glauconite, siderite/iron hydroxide. The experimental results were interpreted and the geochemical mechanisms involved were included in geochemical modeling using PHREEQC, an essential step to quantify the overall effect of the combined individual reactions and processes. These mechanisms were corroborated with isotopic ratio variations. E. g. the variations of δ 13 CDIC (from - 15. 7 ﰐ to - 21 ﰐ vs. PDB) cannot be explained solely by the CO 2 dissolution, and indicate additional chemical processes. Likewise, shifts of δ 11 B towards more negative values stress the implication of the glauconitic minerals, mainly B-bearing phase in the system. These experimental results, and their numerical simulation, are promising for the development of our indirect geochemical and isotopic monitoring technique...|$|E
