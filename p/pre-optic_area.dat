40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} five models that were formulated for describing the neural control of the lower urinary tract in humans. A parsimonious formulation {{of the effect of}} the sympathetic system, the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area,</b> and urethral afferents on the simulated behavior are included. In spite of the relative simplicity of the five models studied, behavior that resembles normal lower urinary tract behavior as seen during an urodynamic investigation could be simulated. The models were tested by studying their response to disturbances of the afferent signal from the bladder. It was found that the inhibiting reflex that results from including the sympathetic system or the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> (PrOA) only counteracts the disturbance in the storage phase. Once micturition has started, these inhibiting reflexes are suppressed. A detrusor contraction that does not result in complete micturition similar to an unstable detrusor contraction could be simulated in a model including urethral afferents. Owing to the number of uncertainties in these models, so far no unambiguous explanation of normal and pathological lower urinary tract behavior can be given. However, these models can be used as an additional tool in studies of the mechanisms of the involved neural contro...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH 1) {{causes the}} release of gonadotropins from the {{pituitary}} to control reproduction. Here we report that two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP-A/B and hnRNP-G) bind to the GnRH-I upstream promoter region in a cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We identified these binding proteins using a newly developed homology based method of mass spectrometric peptide mapping. We show that both hnRNP-A/B and hnRNP-G colocalize with GnRH 1 in the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> of the hypothalamus in the brain. We also demonstrated that these ribonucleoproteins exhibit similar binding capacity in vivo, using immortalized mouse GT 1 – 7 cells where overexpression of either hnRNP-A/B or hnRNP-G significantly down-regulates GnRH 1 mRNA levels in GT 1 – 7 cells, suggesting that both act as repressors in GnRH 1 transcriptional regulation...|$|E
40|$|Kisspeptin neuropeptides are encoded by the Kiss 1 {{gene and}} play a {{critical}} role in the regulation of the mammalian reproductive axis. Kiss 1 neurones are found in two locations in the rodent hypothalamus: one in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and another in the RP 3 V region, which includes the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). Detailed mapping of the fibre distribution of Kiss 1 neurones will help with our understanding of the action of these neurones in other regions of the brain. We have generated a transgenic mouse in which the Kiss 1 coding region is disrupted by a CRE-GFP transgene so that expression of the CRE recombinase protein is driven from the Kiss 1 promoter. As expected, mutant mice of both sexes are sterile with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and do not show the normal rise in luteinising hormone after gonadectomy. Mutant female mice do not develop mature Graafian follicles or form corpora lutea consistent with ovulatory failure. Mutant male mice have low blood testosterone levels and impaired spermatogenesis beyond the meiosis stage. Breeding Kiss-CRE heterozygous mice with CRE-activated tdTomato reporter mice allows fluorescence visualisation of Kiss 1 neurones in brain slices. Approximately 80 - 90 % of tdTomato positive neurones in the ARC were co-labelled with kisspeptin and expression of tdTomato in the AVPV region was sexually dimorphic, with higher expression in females than males. A small number of tdTomato-labelled neurones was also found in other locations, including the lateral septum, the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus, the amygdala, the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, the periaquaductal grey, and the mammillary nucleus. Three dimensional visualisation of Kiss 1 neurones and fibres by CLARITY processing of whole brains showed an increase in ARC expression during puberty and higher numbers of Kiss 1 neurones in the caudal region of the ARC compared to the rostral region. ARC Kiss 1 neurones sent fibre projections to several hypothalamic regions, including rostrally to the periventricular and <b>pre-optic</b> <b>areas</b> and to the lateral hypothalamus...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the growing demand of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) by the market has {{increased}} fishery pressure on this species. Thus, a more in-depth knowledge of the biology of reproduction is strictly necessary to achieve the reproduction of this species in captivity {{in order to avoid the}} overexploitation of wild stock. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide released from the hypothalamus, is central to reproduction in vertebrates because is the major neuroendocrine regulator of pituitary-gonadal axis. A clear correlation between brain GnRH contents and gonadal maturity has been observed in some species of teleosts. In recent years, it has been shown that in the Teleostes different GnRH forms are expressed within the brain of a single species. The objective of the present study was to characterize and immunolocalize the GnRH-producing neurons within the brain of the bluefin tuna. Due to the bad weather condition of the last year, only the brains from eight Mediterranean Sea bluefin tunas were collected and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (7 µm thick) were stained either with Cresil-violet metod or incubated with suitable dilutions of antisera generated against (1) salmon GnRH, (2) chicken GnRH, and (3) mammalian GnRH. Immunoreactivity visualisation was performed using avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) -DAB procedure. The immunostaining was found in the pericarya of some neurons as well as in some nerve fibers of the <b>pre-optic</b> and periventricular <b>areas.</b> These nuclei showed two different ellipsoidal multipolar neuron populations characterized by the following size ranges: 1) the largest with major diameter of 26. 4 - 56. 5 µm and minor diameter of 16. 7 - 25. 2 µm, 2) the smallest with major diameter of 7. 8 - 26. 4 µm and minor diameter of 5. 0 - 8. 8 µm.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{concerning the}} central control of micturition in cats are compared to findings obtained from dynamic imaging studies in humans. In the cat, three {{areas in the}} brainstem and diencephalon are specifically implicated in the control of micturition: (1) Barrington’s nucleus or the pontine micturition center in the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum directly excites bladder motoneurons and indirectly inhibits, via inhibitory interneurons in the medial sacral cord, urethral sphincter motoneurons; (2) the periaqueductal grey receiving bladder filling information; and (3) the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> of the hypothalamus possibly involved in determining the beginning of micturition. According to PET-scan studies, in humans the same supraspinal regions are active during micturition. In the cat another area, located in the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum and is called the L-region, which controls the motoneurons of the pelvic floor, including the external urethral sphincter. This region might be considered as the pontine storage center. In humans the L-region is especially active in volunteers who tried but did not succeed to micturate. The results suggest that in cats and humans at the brainstem and diencephalic levels micturition is organized in the same way. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} galanin {{has been}} implicated in the steroidogenic regulation of reproduction based on work mainly conducted in rodents. This study investigated the temporal changes in the expression of galanin and its 3 receptor isoforms and GnRH and GnRHR mRNA in specific hypothalamic nuclei known {{to be involved in}} the regulation of reproductive cyclicity, namely the medial <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> (mPOA), the rostral mPOA/ OVLT, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) using an ovine model. Following synchronisation of their oestrous cycles, tissues were collected from ewes at 5 time points, the early, mid and late follicular phase and the early and mid luteal phase. The results indicated significant differences in regional expression of most of the genes studied with galanin mRNA expression being highest during the mid follicular phase at the start of the GnRH/LH surge and the expression of the three galanin receptor isoforms and GnRH and its receptor highest during the luteal phase. These findings are consistent with a role for galanin in the positive feedback effects of oestradiol on GnRH secretion and a role for progesterone induced changes in the pattern of expression of galanin receptors in the regulation of the timing of oestradiol positive feedback through increased sensitivity of galanin sensitive systems to secreted galanin...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{effects of}} {{carbamazepine}} (CBZ) and haloperidol (HAL) on the neuroendocrine pre-optico-pituitary feedback system were studied by local {{application of the}} drugs, in single and in combination mode, through a push-pull cannula into the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> and measurement of their local effects on &gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their distant effects on a subsequent biological response: the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. The perfusion flow rate was 20 &mu;l cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) /min; the fraction period was 15 min. Perfusion with 8 &mu;g CBZ/ml CSF caused a reduction in pre-optic pre-synaptic GABA release and, concomitantly, a suppression of plasma LH levels. Application of 100 ng HAL/ml CSF also caused a reduction in GABA release, but no significant change in plasma LH levels. During the combined perfusion, the effects of CBZ and HAL did not add up {{with regard to the}} pre-optic GABA release. These results suggest that both drugs interact with the GABA system, but they may involve two different mechanisms of action. Due to the known inhibitory role of pre-optic GABA in pituitary LH secretion, it can be inferred that, in contrast to HAL, CBZ increases post-synaptic GABAergic transmission.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{found that}} female aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice showed less investigation of socially relevant odours {{as well as}} reduced sexual behaviour. We now ask whether these behavioural deficits {{might be due to}} an inadequate processing of odours in female ArKO mice. Therefore, we exposed female ArKO mice to same- and opposite-sex urinary odours and determined the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos along the main and accessory olfactory projection pathways. We included ArKO males in the present study as we previously observed that they show female-typical detection thresholds of urinary odours, suggesting a role for perinatal oestrogens in these behavioural responses. No sex or genotype differences were observed in the olfactory bulb after urine exposure. By contrast, sex differences in c-Fos responses were observed in wild-type (WT) mice following exposure to male urine in the more central regions of the olfactory pathway; only WT females showed a significant Fos induction in the amygdala, central medial <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> and ventromedial hypothalamus. However, ArKO females did not show a c-Fos response to male odours in the ventromedial hypothalamus, suggesting that the processing of male odours is affected in ArKO females and thus that oestrogens may be necessary for the development of neural responses to sexually relevant odours in female mice. By contrast, c-Fos responses to either male or oestrous female urine were very similar between ArKO and WT males, pointing to a central role of androgen vs. oestrogen signalling in the male circuits that control olfactory investigation and preferences.

40|$|Aims Administration of {{estradiol}} or compounds with estrogenic {{activity to}} newborn female rats results in irreversible masculinization {{as well as}} defeminization {{in the brain and}} the animals exhibit altered reproductive behavior as adults. The cellular and molecular mechanism involved in inducing the irreversible changes is largely unknown. In the present study, we have monitored the changes in the expression of selected synaptogenesis related genes in the sexually dimorphic brain regions such as POA, hypothalamus and pituitary following 17 Î²-estradiol administration to neonatal female rats. Main methods Female Wistar rats which were administered 17 Î²-estradiol on day 2 and 3 after birth were sacrificed 120 days later and the expression levels of genes implicated in synaptogenesis were monitored by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Since estradiol induced up-regulation of COX- 2 in POA is a marker for estradiol induced masculinization as well as defeminization, in the present study only animals in which the increase in expression of COX- 2 gene was observed in POA were included in the study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Inactivation of the maternally imprinted, paternally {{expressed}} gene 3 (Peg 3) induces {{deficits in}} olfactory function, sexual and maternal behaviors, oxytocin neuron number, metabolic homeostasis and growth. Peg 3 {{is expressed in}} a number of developing hypothalamic and basal forebrain structures and is a component of the P 53 apoptosis pathway. Peg 3 inactivation in neuronal cell culture lines inhibits P 53 mediated apoptosis, which is important in the early postnatal development and sexual differentiation of the brain. In this study, we investigated the effect of inactivating the Peg 3 gene on the incidence of caspase 3 positive cells (a marker of apoptosis) in 4 - and 6 -day postpartum mouse brain. Inactivating the Peg 3 gene resulted in an increase in the incidence of total forebrain caspase 3 positive cells at 4 and 6 days postpartum. Increases in specific neuroanatomical regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, medial <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area,</b> arcuate nucleus, medial amygdala, anterior cortical and posteriodorsal amygdaloid nuclei, were also observed. In wild-type mice, sex differences in the incidence of caspase 3 positive cells in the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, arcuate nucleus and the M 2 motor cortex, were also observed. This neural sex difference was amelioratedinthePeg- 3 mutant. These findings suggest that the neuronal and behavioral deficits seen in mice lacking a functional Peg 3 gene are mediated by increases in the incidence of early neonatal apoptosis in neuroanatomical regions important for reproductive behavior, olfactory and pheromonal processing, thermoregulatio...|$|E
40|$|The sexually dimorphic {{organization}} in perinatal rat brain {{is influenced by}} steroid hormones. Exposure {{to high levels of}} estrogen or endocrine-disrupting compounds during perinatal period may perturb this process, resulting in compromised reproductive physiology and behavior as observed in adult In our recent observation neonatal exposure of the female rats to estradiol- 17 β resulted in down-regulation of TNF-α, up-regulation of COX- 2 and increase in SDN-POA size in <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> in the adulthood. It is known that the control of reproductive performance in female involves a complex interplay of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary. The present study was undertaken to understand the possible molecular mechanism involved in changes observed in the ovarian morphology and expression of selected genes in the ovary. Administration of estradiol- 17 β (100 μg) on day 2 and 3 after birth revealed up-regulation of ER-α, ER-β, COX- 2 and down-regulation of TNF-α expression. Also the decrease in the ovarian weight, altered ovarian morphology and changes in the 2 D protein profiles were also seen. This is apparently the first report documenting that neonatal estradiol exposure modulates TNF-α and COX- 2 expression in the ovary as seen during adult stage. Our results permit us to suggest that cues originating from the modified brain structure due to neonatal exposure of estradiol- 17 β remodel the ovary at the molecular level {{in such a way that}} there is a disharmony in the reproductive function during adulthood and these changes are perennial and can lead to infertility and changes of reproductive behavior...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is an {{eicosanoid}} {{derived from}} cyclooxygenase, an enzyme {{responsible for the}} cyclisation and oxygenation of arachidonic acid. In response to bacterial infection, PGE 2 binds to EP 3 receptors on a population of GABAergic neurons in the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area.</b> Activation of the EP 3 receptor decreases the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations of these neurons, and the resulting dis-inhibition activates spinal motor outputs responsible for shivering thermogenesis, tachycardia, and brown adipose tissue activation. These involuntary responses increase core body temperature to varying degrees depending on the magnitude of infection; an immune response which is crucial {{for the survival of}} the host. However, evidence in animal and human models, primarily through the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (which block the production of PGE 2), suggests that PGE 2 may also be an important molecule for the defence of core temperature against body cooling and cold stress (in the absence of fever). In this paper, evidence within human and animal models is discussed which supports the hypothesis that the eicosanoid PGE 2 has a role in maintaining human core temperature during environmental cooling. Given that over-the-counter PGE 2 inhibiting drugs [i. e. Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) ] are frequently used worldwide, {{it is possible that the}} use of such medication during environmental cooling could impair one's ability to thermoregulate. Support for such findings could have major implications in the pathology of hypothermia, thus, we suggest that future researchers investigate this specific hypothesis in vivo, using healthy human models. Suggestions for the implementation of such experiments are provided in the present work...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Feather pecking and {{cannibalism}} {{are major}} concerns in poultry farming, {{both in terms}} of animal welfare and farm economics. Genetic selection and introduction of (aspects of) maternal care have been suggested as potential interventions to reduce feather pecking in laying hens. Altered brain development has been proposed to reflect welfare states in animals, and can provide more insight into the underlying processes involved in feather pecking. Both vasotocin (the avian homologue of vasopressin) and dopaminergic neural circuitry have roles in control of social behaviors {{as well as in the}} stress response, and may be linked to feather pecking. Thus, the hypothalamus of adult laying hens selected for low early mortality (LML), which show low feather pecking, was examined and compared with a control line of adult laying hens selected for production characteristics only (CL). The effect of foster hen rearing on the two genetic lines and their hypothalamic morphology was also investigated. RESULTS: We demonstrated an increase in the number of neurons positive for the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase, in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus in the LML hens compared to CL hens. Hen-reared chicks showed more vasotocin -positive neurons in the medial <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> compared to the hens raised without a hen. No correlations were found between behavior in an open field at 5 - 6 weeks of age, and the histology of the same hens at adulthood. CONCLUSION: The hypothalamic dopaminergic and vasotinergic systems are altered in hens following genetic selection or maternal care, indicating a potential role for these systems in feather pecking.

40|$|We {{describe}} a chronobiological {{study of the}} effects of the oral administration of the essential amino acid L-methionine to common quail (Coturnix coturnix). This amino acid is a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is responsible for controlling and maintaining wakefulness through the ventrolateral <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> of the hypothalamus and controlling the REM sleep in the nucleus reticularis pontinus oralis (NRPO). The quail model was chosen as these birds are monophasic and active by day, as are humans. The animals were kept under a constant 12 h: 12 h light/dark cycle, fed ad libitum and housed in separate cages equipped for activity recording. Methionine was administered daily (1 h before lights off) for 1 week (chronic treatment), with the birds divided into 4 groups: a capsule with 15 mg of L-methionine (Met 15 treatment group); a capsule with 30 mg of L-methionine (Met 30 treatment group); a capsule with methylcellulose as excipient (control group); no capsule (basal group). In addition, we compared the first day of treatment (acute experiment) with the basal and control results. Actimetry (DAS 24 ©) was used to quantify the activity data, and the sleep/wake rhythm was analyzed using the Ritme© software package. The statistical analysis of the activity data was descriptive (± SD) and inferential (Tukey test). The data showed increased (p< 0. 05) mean diurnal activity pulses in the Met 30 group versus the other groups in both the acute and the chronic experiments. No changes were found in nocturnal activity. The chronobiological analysis showed a significant increase in the MESOR parameter of the Met 30 group in both chronic and acute experiments versus the other groups. The acrophase showed no significant changes, in all groups being at around 13 : 45 h. In conclusion, the oral administration of L-methionine increased diurnal activity; probably due to the stimulating neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine...|$|E
40|$|Oestrogens are {{produced}} by aromatisation of androgens by the aromatase enzyme. In the vertebrate brain this synthesis has vital functions in nerve protection, cell proliferation and nerve development during injury respectively brain development. Brain oestrogens are also crucial in activating certain reproductive and aggressive behaviours in mammals and birds. Teleosts have remarkably high activity of brain aromatase (bAA) compared to mammals and birds; 100 - 1000 times higher in brain regions like the hypothalamus, <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> and optic tectum. The role of brain oestrogens in teleost behaviour is, however, less clear than in e. g. songbirds and rodents. This thesis studies the potential role of brain aromatase and brain oestrogens in the reproductive behaviour of the guppy male (Poecilia reticulata), how guppy brain aromatase responds to steroids and is distributed in the adult brain. The thesis shows that male behaviour can be affected by brain aromatase. Reduction of bAA by aromatase inhibitor treatment reduced the sexual behaviours sigmoid display and gonopodium swinging (I) and oestrogen receptor blocking with an oestrogen antagonist {{reduced the number of}} successful mating attempts (II). The anatomical study (IV) showed that brain aromatase is distributed in areas of the adult guppy brain that are connected to reproductive control and behaviour in vertebrates. Guppy bAA is stimulated by both androgens and oestrogens (III) but is more sensitive to oestrogens, especially in males, and could thus be used as an indicator of endocrine disruption at low concentrations found in the environment. The thesis can also conclude that females possess more brain aromatase than males, and that although it is expressed in the same pattern throughout the brain in both genders the enzymatic activity is differently distributed between the sexes.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{studies have}} shown that chemokines are {{pyrogenic}} when injected into the brain, there are no data indicating which cell types and receptors in the CNS are employed by chemokines such as CCL 3 (synonym: MIP- 1 α) to induce fever in rats. We aimed to study, whether CCL 3 induces fever when injected directly into the thermoregulatory center within the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area</b> (POA). Moreover, we investigated whether CCL 3 activates cells from POA microcultures resulting in intracellular Ca++ mobilization and synthesis/release of TNF-α and IL- 6. Microinjections of CCL 3 into the POA induced a dose-dependent fever, which was accompanied by a decrease in tail skin temperature. The primary microcultures of the POA (from topographically excised rat pup brain tissue) were stimulated by bolus administrations of 100 μl CCL 3 (0. 1 or 0. 01 μg) or sterile PBS as control. We evaluated the responses of 261 (30. 89 %) neurons, 346 (40. 94 %) astrocytes and 238 microglia cells (29. 17 %). Stimulation of rat POA microcultures with CCL 3 was capable of inducing Ca++ signaling in 15. 31 % of all astrocytes and 5. 75 % of all neurons investigated. No cellular Ca++-signals were observed after overnight incubation of the cultures with antiCCR 1 or antiCCR 5 antibodies. CCL 3 did not alter the release of the pyrogenic cytokines IL- 6 or TNF-α into the supernatant of the cultures. In conclusion the present study shows {{for the first time that}} CCL- 3 injected directly into the rat POA, evoked an integrated febrile response. In parallel this chemokine induces Ca++ signaling in astrocytes and neurons via both CCR 1 and CCR 5 receptors when administered to POA microcultures without stimulating the synthesis of TNF-α and IL- 6. It is a possibility that CCL 3 -induced fever may occur via CCR 1 and CCR 5 receptors stimulation of astrocytes and neurons from POA...|$|E

Recordings of action potentials were made simultaneously in hippocampus, pre-optic region, and the reticular formation of the midbrain. The doses of chlordiazepoxide were 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg; 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital; 80, 100 and 120 mg/kg of meprobamate, and finally 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of diazepam. In the hippocampus, chlordiazepoxide depressed spontaneous activity at every dose used. The reduction ranged from 30 to 50 %, but in no case was there inhibition of all discharges. Diazepam also had substantial depressing effects on the activity in this region of the brain. In contrast, sodium pentobarbital had relatively minor effects in the lower dose range, but significant depressing effects at the higher doses. Meprobamate also had comparatively small effects in the hippocampus. In the <b>pre-optic</b> <b>area,</b> chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate depressed spontaneous activity at the higher dose range. There were small effects in the lower dose range. Sodium pentobarbital also had minor depressing effects at all doses. Diazepam caused less depression even at the higher doses than either chlordiazepoxide or meprobamate, and these effects were transient. In the midbrain reticular formation, meprobamate caused substantial depression of spontaneous activity even at the lower doses. Sodium pentobarbital similarly depressed activity, but the onset of effect was less delayed than with meprobamate. Chlordiazepoxide at low doses caused less depression of reticular midbrain neurons than of hippocampal or pre-optic region ones. At high doses, the effect {{was similar to that}} of meprobamate. The data suggest the possibility of a mode of action of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam which implicates the hippocampus, whereas in the case of sodium pentobarbital and meprobamate, the mode of action appears to implicate the midbrain reticular area.
