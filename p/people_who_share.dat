Opinions and practice vary widely across the world. In some cultures and communities, cousin {{marriage is}} considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it {{is subject to}} social stigma.

In others, {{it is seen as}} incestuous and is legally prohibited: it is banned in China and Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, and 24 of the 50 United States. Supporters of cousin marriage where it is banned may view the prohibition as discrimination, while opponents may appeal to moral or other arguments. Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout and}} {{function}} of the house compound of Bali Aga people is very different with the low Balinese house compound. The first differences is that each building in a house compound are not functionally differentiated. In lowland Balinese, each house (a pavilion or bale) has a specific function, e.g. bale meten is a pavilion for sleeping and paon is a pavilion for cooking. In Bali Aga house compound, each house is a self-contained entity where the sleeping area, kitchen, and all the functions of a house is situated. Unlike the lowland Balinese, where only certain people can use a certain pavilion (e.g. House Meten is only for {{the head of the}} household), each Bali Aga house is home to a married couple, their children, and sometimes a dependent elderly parent. A family unit in Bali Aga is known as kuren; kuren is a Bali Aga term for both a hearth and for a group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>share</b> the food cooked upon it.|$|E
25|$|Level I is {{typically}} used by non-age-mates and non-intimates and is unmarked {{in terms of}} prefixation or suffixation of the listener and verbs. Level II is marked by the prefix on- on the verb and is used between intimates. Some Nahuatl speakers have been observed to alternate between Level I and Level II for one listener. The use of both levels is believed to show some respect or to not subordinate the listener. Level III is marked by the prefix on-, the reflexive prefix mo-, and an appropriate transitivizing suffix based on the verb stem. Verbs in Level III may additionally be marked with the reverential suffix –tzinōa. Finally, Level IV {{is typically}} used between <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>share</b> a ritual kinship relationship (e.g. parent with godparent, godparent with godparent of the same child). Level IV {{is marked by a}} proclitic (i.e. word that depends on the following word and works similarly to an affix, such as the word “a” or “an” in English) ma. Another important aspect of Level IV is that it addresses the listener in 3rd person whereas Level I through III all use 2nd person forms. By using this 3rd person form, maximal social distance is achieved.|$|E

500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants in the control condition, participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>share</b> their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E
