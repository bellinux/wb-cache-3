50|$|The pistons {{are made}} from an {{aluminum}} alloy designed to withstand high temperatures. An indentation is incorporated into the pistons to prevent the pistons from hitting the valves if the timing belt breaks. <b>Piston</b> <b>pins</b> holding the <b>pistons</b> in place are locked by snap rings.|$|R

50|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a precision}} forged unit running in seven three-layer bearings, with counterweights bolted onto the crank webs, much {{like any other}} diesel motor of its vintage. The middle bearing is also the thrust bearing. The connecting rods are of a split design, with bronze bushings for the <b>piston</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Option One - Shorter Piston:The stock Chrysler LA {{engine in}} the example above has a main to rod bearing {{centerline}} distance of 1.79 in (4.55 cm), a rod that is 6.123 in (15.55 cm) long, and a piston that is 1.67 in from <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> centerline to top, depending on the application. As the engine stroke is increased {{in the example}} above, the 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) configuration would place the piston 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher in the cylinder at top dead center, and with a distance of 9.585 in (24.36 cm) from crankshaft main centerline to deck, the piston would protrude about 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher than the top deck, or would collide with the cylinder head combustion chamber. To offset this, aftermarket pistons relocate the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> higher within the piston itself. This change in compression height leaves the piston with 1.462 in (3.714 cm) of material in the top portion of the piston, instead of 1.672 in (4.247 cm) as is stock.|$|E
50|$|The {{displacement}} differs between 1990 and 1995 and 1996-2006 4.0L engines by 2 cubic inches.

25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the <b>piston</b> <b>pins,</b> cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of this class of steel is the ability to be case hardened by carburization of the surface. The core of the material retains its bulk properties, while the outer surface is significantly hardened to reduce wear and tear. This makes this grade of steel an excellent material for uses such as gears, <b>piston</b> <b>pins,</b> and crankshafts.|$|R
5000|$|Known as the [...] "Sirius Diesel", the 4D68 version {{displaced}} 1998cc. It {{was fitted}} with a 93mm stroke crankshaft and the cylinder bore diameter was 82.7mm. This engine used pistons with a static compression ratio of 22.4:1 and <b>piston</b> <b>pins</b> were 25mm OD. It was available either naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and replaced the 4D65 as Mitsubishi's [...] "go-to" [...] diesel.|$|R

50|$|Working {{from the}} crankcases out, the 'phase 2' engine sees the crank thrust bearing {{relocated}} {{to the rear}} of the shaft - this reduces transfer of natural frequencies to the transmission, resulting in improved NVH. Pistons are all-new in the B4. Despite being made from forged aluminium, the pistons are heavier (162 up from 152 grams) and incorporate solid skirts, reduced <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> offset, a molybdenum coating, reduced top-land to cylinder clearance and flat-top combustion surfaces. Improved off-boost torque comes from a raised static compression ratio - 9.0:1 compared to the Impreza WRX's 8.0:1.|$|E
5000|$|Thursday May 24: With {{only two}} days before {{elimination}} trials were set to begin, there was a potential that less than a full field of 33 cars would make the starting grid. Kelly Petillo crashed his Eglin <b>Piston</b> <b>Pin</b> Special in turn one. Petillo was uninjured, but the car was too damaged to repair. Also experiencing trouble was Herman Schurch in the Sievers Special, which threw a rod. Of the original 36 entries, the cars of Prince Ghica and Shorty Cantlon were no shows, and with two cars already out, only 32 cars were left. A check around the garage area indicated that at least 23 cars were planning to qualify on Saturday, led by Leon Duray, Cliff Bergere, and Peter DePaolo. Ray Keech broke an exhaust pipe on Thursday, and the crew {{would have to make}} quick repairs in order that {{he would be able to}} qualify on Saturday.|$|E
50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The <b>piston</b> <b>pins</b> floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the <b>piston</b> <b>pins</b> being retained with snap rings.|$|R
25|$|Through-feed : This type of {{superfinishing}} is {{used for}} cylindrical workpieces. The workpiece is rotated between two drive rollers, which also move the machine as well. Four to eight progressively finer abrasive stones are used to superfinish the workpiece. The stones contact the workpiece at a 90° angle and are oscillated axially. Examples of parts that would be produced by process include tapered rolls, <b>piston</b> <b>pins,</b> shock absorber rods, shafts, and needles.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{connecting rod}} beam (forging ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> and cylinder bore and rectangular-head rod bolts mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W connecting rod (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively. The cap featured a longer boss for balancing than the original design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small end}} {{attaches}} to the <b>piston</b> <b>pin,</b> gudgeon pin or wrist pin, which is currently most often press fit into the connecting rod but can swivel in the piston, a [...] "floating wrist pin" [...] design. The big end connects to the bearing journal on the crank throw, in most engines running on replaceable bearing shells accessible via the connecting rod bolts which hold the bearing [...] "cap" [...] onto the big end. Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing and the big end of the connecting rod so that pressurized lubricating motor oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings. Most small two-stroke engines and some single cylinder four-stroke engines avoid {{the need for a}} pumped lubrication system by using a rolling-element bearing instead, however this requires the crankshaft to be pressed apart and then back together in order to replace a connecting rod.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank pin bearing journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank pin bearing journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> {{contact in}} a typical {{automotive}} engine {{is an example of}} a highly loaded. Therefore, for <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> design several aspects are important. Among them are function, cost, NVH, fuel economy, durability, and impact on other design aspects of the engine. Continuously contacting with <b>piston</b> <b>pin,</b> the face of connecting rod, brings about abnormal wear such as unfairwear or earlywear. because the engine get more powered and one requirement for a good fuel economy is to achieve a low level of mechanical friction. In this study, modern low friction coatings and treatment at the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> interface aimed to investigate the potential. The profile of coated specimens were observed by non-contact type optical surface measuring system and the friction-wear behaviors of coated specimens were investigated by using <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> wear tester. <b>Piston</b> <b>pin</b> wear test was performed to analyze the friction and wear behavior.
