40|$|<b>Pectus</b> excavatum and <b>carinatum</b> are {{the most}} common {{morphological}} chest wall abnormalities. For both <b>pectus</b> excavatum and <b>carinatum</b> the pathogenesis is largely unknown although various hypotheses exist. Usually, exclusion of an underlying syndromal or connective tissue disorder is the reason for referral for genetic evaluation. A detailed anamnesis and family history are needed as well as a complete dysmorphological physical examination. If no features of an underlying disorder are detected, then the pectus excavatum/carinatum can be considered as an isolated abnormality and no further genetic studies seem indicated. Although cases of non-syndromal pectus excavatum/carinatum with a positive family history fitting Mendelian inheritance have been described, it is possible that these pedigrees represent multifactorial inheritance, as no genetic cause for familial isolated pectus excavatum/carinatum has been described yet. The recurrence risk for a non-familial iolated pectus excavatum/carinatum is unknown, but thought to be low. If other symptoms are found then appropriate further diagnostic studies are indicated as pectus excavatum/carinatum can be part of many syndromes. However, the most important and most frequently observed monogenic syndromes with pectus excavatum/carinatum are Marfan Syndrome and Noonan Syndrom...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionPectus {{deformities}} are {{the most}} frequently seen congenital thoracic wall anomalies. The cause of these conditions {{is thought to be}} abnormal elongation of the rib cartilages. We here report our clinical experience and the results of a sternochondroplasty procedure based on the subperichondrial resection of the elongated cartilages. HypothesisThis technique is a valuable surgical strategy to treat the wide variety of pectus deformities. Patients and methodsDuring the period from October 2001 through September 2009, 205 adult patients (171 men and 34 women) underwent <b>pectus</b> excavatum (181), <b>carinatum</b> (19) or arcuatum (5) repair. The patients’ pre and postoperative data were collected using a computerized database, and the results were assessed with a minimum 2 -year follow-up. ResultsThe postoperative morbidity rate was minimal and the mortality was nil. The surgeon graded cosmetic results as excellent (72. 5 %), good (25 %) or fair (2. 5 %), while patients reported better results. Patients with pectus excavatum were found to have much more patent foramen ovale (PFO) than the normal adult population, which occluded after the procedure in 61 % of patients, and significant improvement was found in exercise cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance at the 1 -year follow-up. DiscussionOur sternochondroplasty technique based on the subperichondrial resection of the elongated cartilages allows satisfactory repair of both pectus excavatum and sternal prominence. It is a safe procedure that might improve the effectiveness of surgical therapy in patients with pectus deformities. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Retrospective study...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> is an {{overgrowth}} of costal cartilage {{causing the}} sternum to protrude forward. It primarily occurs among four different patient groups, and males are more frequently affected than females. Most commonly, <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> develops in 11-to-14-year-old pubertal males undergoing a growth spurt. Some parents report that their child's <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> seemingly popped up overnight. Second most common {{is the presence}} of <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> at or shortly after birth. The condition may be evident in newborns as a rounded anterior chest wall. As the child reaches age 2 or 3 years of age, the outward sternal protrusion becomes more pronounced. <b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> can also be caused by vitamin D deficiency in children (Rickets) due to deposition of unmineralized osteoid. Least common is a <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> deformity following open-heart surgery or in children with poorly controlled bronchial asthma.|$|E
5000|$|Bracing is {{becoming}} more popular over surgery for <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum,</b> mostly because it eliminates the risks that accompany surgery. The prescribing of bracing {{as a treatment for}} <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> has 'trickled down' from both paediatric and thoracic surgeons to the family physician and pediatricians again due to its lower risks and well-documented very high success results. The <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> guideline of 2012 of the American Pediatric Surgical Association has stated: [...] "As reconstructive therapy for the compliant <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> deformity, nonoperative compressive orthotic bracing is usually an appropriate first line of therapy as it does not preclude the operative option. For appropriate candidates, orthotic bracing of chest wall deformities can reasonably be expected to prevent worsening of the deformity and often results in a lasting correction of the deformity. Orthotic bracing is often successful in prepubertal children whose chest wall is compliant. Expert opinion suggests that the noncompliant chest wall deformity or significant asymmetry of the <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> deformity caused by a concomitant excavatum-type deformity may not respond to orthotic bracing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nonmuscular {{diseases}} of the upper thorax such as kyphosis, <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and pectus excavatum.|$|E
50|$|Abnormalities of the {{rib cage}} include pectus excavatum ("sunken chest") and <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> ("pigeon chest").|$|E

5000|$|... in the thorax: usually <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> or exacavatum and oar-shaped ribs; also a {{protruding}} {{abdomen and}} inguinal or umbilical hernia ...|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} variant of <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> is pectus arcuatum (also called type 2 pectus excavatum, chondromanubrial {{deformity}} or Currarino-Silverman syndrome or pouter pigeon deformity), which produces a manubrial and upper sternal protrusion, particularly {{also at the}} sternal angle. Pectus arcuatum is often confused {{with a combination of}} <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and pectus excavatum, but in pectus arcuatum the visual appearance is characterized by a protrusion of the costal cartilages and there is no depression of the sternum.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{conditions}} include hypoplasia {{of nasal}} bridge, laryngomalacia, <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum,</b> congenital heart defects, ventriculomegaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, stippled epiphyses, telebrachydactyly, and growth retardation.|$|E
50|$|People with <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> usually develop normal {{hearts and}} lungs, but the {{deformity}} may prevent these from functioning optimally. In {{moderate to severe}} cases of <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum,</b> the chest wall is rigidly held in an outward position. Thus, respirations are inefficient and the individual needs to use the accessory muscles for respiration, rather than normal chest muscles, during strenuous exercise. This negatively affects gas exchange and causes a decrease in stamina. Children with pectus deformities often tire sooner than their peers, due to shortness of breath and fatigue. Commonly concurrent is mild to moderate asthma.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Martinez-Ferro {{worked with}} <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> patients, {{providing}} a nonsurgical treatment of their condition using dynamic compression braces, building on work of Brazilian orthopedist Sydney Haje and coworkers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> is rarer than pectus excavatum, another pectus disorder, {{occurring}} in only about 20% {{of people with}} pectus deformities. [...] About {{four out of five}} patients are males.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> (L carīnātus, equiv. to carīn(a) keel), {{also called}} pigeon chest, is a {{deformity}} {{of the chest}} characterized by a protrusion of the sternum and ribs. It is distinct from the related deformity pectus excavatum.|$|E
50|$|Fitzsimmons-Guilbert {{syndrome}} {{is an extremely}} rare genetic disease characterized by a slowly progressive spastic paraplegia, skeletal anomalies of the hands and feet with brachydactyly type E, cone-shaped epiphyses, abnormal metaphyseal-phalangeal pattern profile, sternal anomaly (<b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> or excavatum), dysarthria, and mild intellectual deficit.|$|E
5000|$|Sydney A. Haje (16 February 1952 [...] - [...] 26 June 2012) was a Brazilian orthopedist, known internationally for his {{pioneering}} work on chest wall deformities including {{the creation of}} a conservative treatment protocol for the <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and pectus excavatum conditions.|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} with severe <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum,</b> surgery may be necessary. However bracing could and {{may still be}} {{the first line of}} treatment. Some severe cases treated with bracing may result in just enough improvement that patient is happy with the outcome and may not want surgery afterwards.|$|E
50|$|After adolescence, {{some men}} and women use {{bodybuilding}} {{as a means to}} hide their deformity. Some women find that their breasts, if large enough, serve the same purpose. Some plastic surgeons perform breast augmentation to disguise mild to moderate cases in women. Bodybuilding is suggested for people with symmetrical <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> is {{generally}} a solitary, non-syndromic abnormality. However, the condition {{may be present}} in association with other syndromes: Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Morquio syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 21, homocystinuria, osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple lentigines syndrome (LEOPARD syndrome), Sly syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type VII), and scoliosis.|$|E
50|$|Most {{insurance}} companies no longer consider chest wall deformities like <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> to be purely cosmetic conditions. While the psychologic impact of any deformity {{is real and}} must be addressed, the physiological concerns must take precedence. The possibility of lifelong cardiopulmonary difficulties is serious enough to warrant {{a visit to a}} thoracic surgeon.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1977, Haje {{developed}} the [...] "dynamic remodeling method", a treatment of chest wall deformities <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and pectus excavatum {{based on the}} use of compression braces in association with exercise protocols, and he continued working in this medical field for the next 35 years, treating close to 5.000 patients. He highlighted that here are time points at which patients should best be treated due to the decreasing flexibility of the thorax during the course of development, - with patients with <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> being best treated in childhood, and patients with pectus excavatum best treated in the growing period. He gave the first description of a case of iatrogenic pectus deformity due to the injury of these growth plates in connection with a cardiac operation in which a sternotomy was performed on the immature skeleton.|$|E
50|$|Pectus excavatum is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} disorders {{by a series}} of elimination of signs and symptoms. <b>Pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> is excluded by the simple observation of a collapsing of the sternum rather than a protrusion. Kyphoscoliosis is excluded by diagnostic imaging of the spine, where in pectus excavatum the spine usually appears normal in structure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{children}} with <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> also have scoliosis (i.e., {{curvature of the}} spine). Some have mitral valve prolapse, {{a condition in which}} the heart mitral valve functions abnormally. Connective tissue disorders involving structural abnormalities of the major blood vessels and heart valves are also seen. Although rarely seen, some children have other connective tissue disorders, including arthritis, visual impairment and healing impairment.|$|E
50|$|After the Nuss {{procedure}} for pectus excavatum had drawn worldwide {{attention to the}} elasticity and malleability of the chest wall in children, several groups including that of Argentinian surgeon Marcelo Martinez-Ferro started working with <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> patients using compression braces. Until this time, except for the pioneer papers of Haje and coworkers, no other medical authors had supported a non-operative approach {{for the treatment of}} these patients.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{possible}} physiologic consequences, pectus deformities {{can have a}} significant psychologic impact. Some people, especially those with milder cases, live happily with <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum.</b> For others, though, {{the shape of the}} chest can damage their self-image and confidence, possibly disrupting social connections and causing them to feel uncomfortable throughout adolescence and adulthood. As the child grows older, bodybuilding techniques may be useful for balancing visual impact.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{orthotic}} bracing, {{pioneered by}} Sydney Haje as of 1977, is finding increasing acceptance {{as an alternative}} to surgery in select cases of <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum.</b> In children, teenagers, and young adults who have <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and are motivated to avoid surgery, the use of a customized chest-wall brace that applies direct pressure on the protruding area of the chest produces excellent outcomes. Willingness to wear the brace as required is essential for the success of this treatment approach. The brace works {{in much the same way}} as orthodontics (braces that correct the alignment of teeth). The brace consists of front and back compression plates that are anchored to aluminum bars. These bars are bound together by a tightening mechanism which varies from brace to brace. This device is easily hidden under clothing and must be worn from 14 to 24 hours a day. The wearing time varies with each brace manufacturer and the managing physicians protocol, which could be based on the severity of the carinatum deformity (mild moderate severe) and if it is symmetric or asymmetric.|$|E
5000|$|Zeisler and Becker first {{described}} a syndrome with multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> (protruding breastbone) and prognathism (protrusion of lower jaw) in 1936. [...] Sporadic descriptions were added through the years. In 1962, cardiac abnormalities and short stature were first {{associated with the}} condition. In 1966, three familial cases were added, a mother, her son and daughter. Another case of mother to two separate children, with different paternity of the two children, was added in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{two other}} {{mutations}} in Naa10 (R116W mutation in {{a boy and}} a V107F mutation in a girl) have been described in two unrelated families with sporadic cases of non-syndromic intellectual disabilities, postnatal growth failure, and skeletal anomalies. The girl was reported as having delayed closure of the fontanels, delayed bone age, broad great toes, mild <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum,</b> pulmonary artery stenosis, atrial septal defect, prolonged QT interval. The boy was reported as having small hands/feet, high arched palate, and wide interdental spaces.|$|E
50|$|People {{with this}} {{condition}} are short-statured from birth, {{with a very}} short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Curvature of the spine (scoliosis and lumbar lordosis) may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may also {{increase the risk of}} spinal cord damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (<b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum),</b> a hip joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward (coxa vara), and a foot deformity known as clubfoot.|$|E
5000|$|Haje {{taught and}} lectured in Brazil and internationally, {{including}} the United Kingdom, Argentina and Turkey. at {{the occasion of}} a lecture to be held by Haje at the Royal Society of Medicine in 2011, a spinal surgeon from the UK, David Harrison, introduced Haje's work by referring to it as [...] "truly revolutionary" [...] and [...] "much more appropriate {{to the way in}} which we would like to treat <b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum</b> and excavatum deformities, something that we have not been able to do before", emphasizing also the psychosocial relevance of these conditions.|$|E
50|$|Most of the readily visible {{signs are}} {{associated}} with the skeletal system. Many individuals with Marfan syndrome grow to above-average height, and some have disproportionately long, slender limbs with thin, weak wrists and long fingers and toes. Besides affecting height and limb proportions, people with Marfan syndrome may have abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis), thoracic lordosis, abnormal indentation (pectus excavatum) or protrusion (<b>pectus</b> <b>carinatum)</b> of the sternum, abnormal joint flexibility, a high-arched palate with crowded teeth and an overbite, flat feet, hammer toes, stooped shoulders, and unexplained stretch marks on the skin. It can also cause pain in the joints, bones and muscles. Some people with Marfan have speech disorders resulting from symptomatic high palates and small jaws. Early osteoarthritis may occur. Other signs include limited range of motion in the hips due to the femoral head protruding into abnormally deep hip sockets.|$|E
