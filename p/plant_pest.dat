[...] The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a [...] "quarantine significant plant pest." [...] The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) {{deregulated}} glyphosate-resistant sugar beets {{after it}} conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely {{to become a}} <b>plant</b> <b>pest.</b> Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada.|$|E
2500|$|On February 4, 2011, the USDA-APHIS {{announced}} glyphosate-resistant sugar beets {{had been}} partially deregulated and growers {{would be allowed}} to plant seed from spring 2011 until an EIS is completed. [...] USDA-APHIS developed requirements that growers must follow if handling glyphosate-resistant sugar beets and will monitor growers throughout the partial deregulation period. [...] The requirements are classified into categories which include planting glyphosate-resistant sugar beets for seed production, planting for sugar production, and transporting sugar beets across state lines. [...] Failure to follow the requirements set by USDA-APHIS may result in civil or criminal charges and destruction of the crop. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a <b>plant</b> <b>pest</b> risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready sugar beets.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of plant {{quarantine}} is tried to avoid or decrease the input of <b>plant</b> <b>pests</b> from outside, but following the join to WTO, these risks are increased. For example, the crop loss will reach to 12. 7 billion NT dollars if quarantine pests (such as burrowing nematode) are appeared in Taiwan. Therefore, the quarantine techniques of <b>plant</b> <b>pests</b> become very important issues right now. In general, the quarantine techniques of <b>plant</b> <b>pests</b> can divide into three parts: (1) chemical treatment; (2) physical treatment; and (3) evasion of pathogen. These techniques that usual used in Taiwan, includes fumigation, pesticides treatment, hot water or vapor treatment, {{are based on the}} standard of Green Book. But the standard of Green Book was focused on the control of <b>plant</b> <b>pests</b> and was not suitable for the requirement of plant quarantine. Therefore, the purpose of this research is try to establish the standard of quarantine techniques for <b>plant</b> <b>pests.</b> 植物檢疫(quarantine) 最主要的目的是為了避免或減少外來危禁病原的引入,進而建立族群而危及本土農作物,但是目前隨著政府經濟自由化政策及面臨加入WTO之際,進口農產品的數量亦顯著增加,農作物疫病蟲害入侵國內之機會也相對增大,檢疫單位經常截獲檢疫害蟲有薊馬、介殼蟲及蟎類,其中唐昌蒲薊馬及蘇鐵白輪盾介殼蟲的侵入蔓延傳播,造成嚴重之危害;而檢疫線蟲穿孔線蟲而言,台灣一旦淪為疫區時,據農委會估計每年將損失 127 億,因此植物檢疫處理技術也就格外重要且必需. 植物檢疫線蟲及害蟲的檢疫處理技術包括三大項 (1) 物理處理-包括高溫蒸氣消毒、低溫冷凍及溫湯消毒等; (2) 化學處理-薰蒸、二氧化碳及化學藥劑處理; (3) 避病-採產地認證制度. 以植物檢疫線蟲為例,由於植物病原線蟲細小(0. 1 - 0. 5 公分),傳播迅速及防治不易;早在 1909 年由日本輸往美國華盛頓兩千棵櫻花樹,經Cobb氏鑑定有 72 %感染根瘤線蟲並予以銷燬. 在線蟲檢疫處理方面,對植物球根、種子、苗木或其他繁殖體於植前將線蟲除滅通常有熱水浸泡、殺線蟲劑浸泡或粉衣及燻蒸劑處理等方式,而以後兩者為主. Hague及Kondrollochis兩人曾以有機磷劑thionazin浸泡鬱金香及水仙球莖以防治Ditylenchus dipsaci,在 2500 ppm劑量下處理 2. 5 至 3 小時可獲致良好效果,但用作檢疫上之完全撲滅仍嫌不足. 於熱水中添加福馬林之處理雖可殺死大部份內寄生潛移性線蟲,但常導致某些球莖花卉不開花. 以oxamyl浸泡馬鈴薯種薯確可獲致降低Pratylenchus penetrans及Globodera rostochiensis之族群密度,但須配合土壤消毒,否則成效不大. 球根、球莖、根莖類植物感染內寄生性線蟲種類時,因受限於球根表皮、線蟲寄生於植物組織之位置深度及藥劑之滲透性等因素,截至目前尚未有以浸泡方式能除滅 80 %以上線蟲之報導. 目前台灣所採用的植物線蟲檢疫處理技術及方法是依據Green Book所制定的標準,是以防治植物線蟲為出發點,並不能保證完全合乎quarantine treatment的需求,因此建立重要植物檢疫線蟲及害蟲的處理基準是目前極為殷切的實務. 本年度首要的工作為針對具有潛在高風險性之植物檢疫線蟲及害蟲作研究,篩選經常作燻蒸處理的農產品,檢討並建立完善的植物檢疫線蟲及害蟲的處理基準...|$|R
