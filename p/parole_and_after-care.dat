These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty {{patients}} presenting for admission to a state psychiatric hospital were randomly allocated into two groups. Control patients received standard hospital care <b>and</b> <b>after-care.</b> Experimental patients were not admitted if this could be avoided; instead they and their relatives were provided with comprehensive community treatment and a 24 -hour crisis service. Patients with a primary diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependence, organic brain disorder or mental retardation were excluded. Most patients were suffering from psychotic disorders [...] more than half specifically from schizophrenia. During the 12 months study period 96 % of the control patients were admitted [...] 51 % more than once. Of the experimental patients 60 % were not admitted at all and only 8 % were admitted more than once. Control patients spent an average of 53. 5 days in psychiatric hospital, experimental patients spent an average of 8. 4 days. Community treatment did not increase the burden upon the community, {{was considered to be}} significantly more satisfactory and helpful by patients and their relatives, achieved a clinically superior outcome, and cost less than standard care <b>and</b> <b>after-care.</b> The ingredients differentiating comprehensive community-based care from prevailing methods of psychiatric care are discussed. ...|$|R
