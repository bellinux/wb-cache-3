40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to model stress and coping {{processes}} among 463 survivors of the 1993 Midwest floods. Separate models were built for those who reported experiencing a natural disaster at some time in their lives prior to the flooding, and those for whom the flood was their first natural disaster exposure. Overall, results supported the theoretical stress and coping model, and the theory of posttraumatic growth. Greater degree of flood exposure and higher pre-flood depression scores were related to higher post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Pre-flood depression magnified the effect of flood exposure on post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Higher scores on general social support were related to lower post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and general social support protected against the effect of flood exposure on post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Interestingly, higher scores on flood-related social support provision were related to higher post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> This is possibly due to exposure to the traumatic experiences of others through providing flood-related social support. ^ Consistent with posttraumatic growth theory, higher levels of both flood exposure and post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> were related to greater positive changes in social relationships. Providing flood-specific social support was the strongest predictor of positive social changes. ^ Between-group comparisons indicated that greater sense of control was related to lower post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> only for those who had experienced a previous natural disaster. Sense of control protected against the effect of flood exposure on post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> for this group. ^ Gender differences were also found between groups. Among those without natural disaster exposure before the flood, women experienced greater post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and greater positive social changes than did men. This is consistent with previous research on natural disasters. However, among those who had experienced a natural disaster at some time prior to the flood, men experienced greater post-flood <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and greater positive social changes than did women. Results of between-group comparisons should be explored further in future research. ...|$|R

50|$|Many {{experiences}} can cause structural {{changes in the}} HPA system. The effects of repeated increases in cortisol levels have been researched in many animal studies, but these outcomes are also representative of humans, including young children. It has been determined that when glucocorticoids, including cortisol, are placed into {{various parts of the}} brain for many days, CRH is produced in increased quantities. In turn, this causes fear behaviors, increased caution, and activation of the SAM system. Eventually, these effects may cause PTSD or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, in young children. A more serious <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> seen in children, PTSD manifests symptoms such as, heightened fear and anxiety, loss of interests, flashbacks, lacking some emotions, paranoia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mid- to late-stage {{dementia}} {{is often}} characterized by behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including, {{but not limited}} to physical and verbal aggression. INTRODUCTION: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, aetiology, and management of behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such symptoms in long-term aged care facilities. AIM: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences of caring for people with behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia in long-term aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses from three long-term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Organizational efforts to enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of dementia in long-term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff education to heed nurses 2 ̆ 7 concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal care...|$|R

40|$|The {{associations}} between physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of the menstrual cycle {{have not been}} carefully studied in past research, but {{may lead to a}} better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these symptoms. The present study examines the day-to-day covariations among physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms were evaluated on a daily basis across one entire menstrual cycle, with a non-clinical sample of 92 university students. Results showed that headaches, gastrointestinal problems, lower abdominal bloating, skin changes, and breast changes, were all significantly associated with higher levels of psychological symptoms; whereas back and joint pain, lower abdominal cramps, cervical mucous, and menstrual flow, were not associated with <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> However, significant differences in these associations were observed across individuals for back and joint pain, headaches, lower abdominal cramps, skin changes, and menstrual flow: Whereas some women demonstrated higher levels of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> associated with these physical symptoms, other women demonstrated lower levels of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Finally, correlations among the {{associations between}} physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> (slopes) demonstrated clear differences across the different physical symptoms. These results indicate that, although higher levels of some physical symptoms are associated with higher levels of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> there are significant differences in the magnitude and direction of these relations across individuals. Further consideration of physical symptoms may provide useful information for understanding individual differences in symptom profiles and response to steroid fluctuations, and for improving differential diagnosis and treatment planning and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Researchers {{have stated}} that high {{intelligence}} might bring about psycho-logical problems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate relationships be-tween general intelligence and some psychological symptoms. Method: Research participants included 73 students who were either university students in their first year or preparing for university. Their age ranged from 18 to 21 with a mean of 19, 93. Female participants constituted 42, 5 % of the total and male participants included 57, 5 % of the total. The Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) and the Psychological Symptoms Scanning Scale- 90 -R were used to collect data. The former was used to measure the participants’ general intelli-gence while the latter was used to measure their psychological symptoms. Meas-urement instruments were administered to the participants in their classrooms. Data analysis included correlational analysis between general intelligence scores and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores. Results: Findings showed that correlations between general intelligence scores and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores for the total sample ranged from - 0, 04 to - 0, 29, respectively. Anger score had the lowest correlation with general intelligence and the sensibility score had the highest correlation with general intelligence. Total <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores had a correlation of - 0, 23 with general intelligence scores. Other <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores also had negative correlations with general intelligence scores. General intelligence scores had a correlation of -, 27 with obsessive compulsive disorder, -, 24 with somatization, -, 18 with depression, -, 23 with anxiety, -, 24 with phobia, -, 09 with paranoid tendency, and -, 16 with psikotism. Conclusions: Research findings show that in general, as general intelligence level increases, the level of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> decreases and as general intelli-gence level decreases, the level of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> increases. However, when data was analyzed by participants’ parents’ gender, the pattern of relation-ship becomes positive. That is, correlations between general intelligence scores and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores among participants with mothers (n = 15) who had university or higher education become positive. Similar findings were ob-tained when data was analyzed by fathers’ educational levels. Correlations range from. 10 to. 78. In conclusion, as parents’ educational level increases, correlations between general intelligence and psychological symptoms of their children be-come negative. However, it should be noted that the number of sample is rather small in parents’ gender analysis. We strongly recommend that findings by the total sample should be paid more attention than parents’ gender groups...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{findings}} {{on the relationship between}} self-esteem and psychological outcomes are inconsistent. Therefore it appears that self-esteem, while related to crucial variables, does not provide a clear, direct, and comprehensive prediction of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Thus, it was hypothesized that the relationship between self-esteem and symptomatology would be moderated by broader measures of how one interacts with emotional and cognitive stimuli. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of self-esteem, psychological flexibility, and cognitive flexibility on psychological symptomatology. A sample of 82 undergraduate students at the University of North Texas completed self-report questionnaires measuring low self-esteem, psychological flexibility, measured inversely as inflexibility, cognitive flexibility, and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Results of the study suggest that self-esteem (?= - 0. 59, p < 0. 001) and flexibility (both psychological (?= 0. 36, p = 0. 001) and cognitive (?= 0. 21, p < 0. 05) are significant predictors of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In other words, self-esteem is positively correlated with <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> while <b>psychological</b> and cognitive flexibility are negatively correlated with <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Neither form of flexibility moderated the relationship between self-esteem and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> in this sample.

40|$|The {{expectation}} that Chinese people present distress somatically {{is a central}} prediction of cultural psychopathology and {{has been the subject}} of considerable theoretical speculation. At the same time, empirical studies have been infrequent and have yielded mixed results. The authors examined symptom presentation in Chinese (n � 175) and Euro-Canadian (n � 107) outpatients, using spontaneous problem report, structured clinical interview, and symptom questionnaire methods. All 3 methods yielded cross-culturally equivalent somatic and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> subscales. Chinese outpatients reported more somatic symptoms on spontaneous problem report and structured clinical interview compared with Euro-Canadians, who in turn reported more psychological symptoms on all 3 methods. The relation between culture and somatic symptom presentation was mediated by a tendency toward externally oriented thinking. Difficulties with identifying emotions or describing them to others did not differ significantly across cultures, supporting a nonpathological interpretation of observed differences. <b>Psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> effects were larger and more consistent than somatic symptom effects; because other studies have confirmed the ubiquity of somatic presentations worldwide, these results suggest that Western psychologization may be more culturally specific than is Chinese somatization...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Despite {{evidence}} {{indicating a}} heightened incidence of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> in coeliac disease (CD), the {{direct link between}} psychological factors {{and quality of life}} (QOL) has received little attention. The purpose of this paper was to compare the relative impacts of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and coping to the known negative impacts of gastrointestinal symptoms and adherence to the gluten free diet (GFD) on QOL. Methods: In study 1 (N = 390), participants completed measures of QOL, <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> coping, several indices of symptom severity, and adherence. Correlations and regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between QOL and the measured variables. Study 2 (N = 189) replicated the findings using a validated measure of current gastrointestinal symptom severity and a more comprehensive measure of coping. Results: Across both studies, poorer QOL was correlated with a higher incidence of <b>psychological</b> and gastrointestinal <b>symptoms,</b> greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies, and poorer GFD adherence. The relationship between <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> (particularly depression) and QOL persisted when controlling for past (study 1) and current (study 2) gastrointestinal <b>symptom</b> severity. <b>Psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and GFD adherence were more strongly related to reduced QOL than gastrointestinal symptoms.

One way that mindfulness approaches create positive outcomes is through enhancement of emotion regulation skills. Maladaptive emotion regulation is a key psychological feature of all eating disorders. The aim {{of the current study}} was to identify facets of emotion regulation involved in the relationship between mindfulness and maladaptive eating behaviours. In three cross-sectional studies, clinical (n= 39) and non-clinical (n= 137 and 119) female participants completed: 1) the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) eating specific scales (drive-for-thinness and bulimia) and the EDI <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scales (emotion dysregulation and interoceptive deficits); and 2) mindfulness, impulsivity, and emotion regulation questionnaires. In all samples mindfulness was significantly and inversely associated with EDI eating and <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scales, and impulsivity.

Subjects and methods: This study was conducted in a representative sample of 1, 002 randomly selected Slovenian citizens, stratified according to sex and age. We used a method of computer assisted telephone interview (CATI). The questionnaire consisted of demographic questions, questions about the prevalence and duration of preselected symptoms in the past month (irritability, nervousness), questions about the presence of chronic diseases, EQ- 5 D questionnaire and the questions on health seeking behaviour (self-treatment, lay advice seeking and medical advice seeking). Results: The self-reported prevalence of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the past month was 38. 0 % (381 / 1, 002).

The aims of this study were to assess changes in <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> in military women over time, to compare them with men, and assess the effect of deployment. Methods Two cross-sectional studies based on random samples of the Armed Forces were used to assess the effects of deployment to the Gulf and Iraq Wars. We selected for the analyses all the women and a 20 % random sample of men who completed a questionnaire stratified by rank. We assessed psychological distress, number of symptoms, post-traumatic stress reaction (PTSR), chronic fatigue and alcohol misuse. Results There has been an increase in <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including alcohol misuse, in those not deployed to the Gulf or Iraq Wars, especially in women. The odds ratios for PTSR [5. 82 (95 % CI: 1. 27 – 26. 71) ], multiple symptoms [8. 49 (1. 97 – 36. 65) ] and alcohol misuse [6. 20 (2. 09 – 18. 37) ] were higher in women than in men in the non-deployed samples.

In addition the experiences of returning home after a period in exile were studied, based on quantitative and qualitative data. Methods: The study is a follow-up study of 21 Bosnian refugees returning to Bosnia compared with 175 refugees remaining in exile in Norway. Quantitative results are supplemented with qualitative information. Results: Both groups demonstrated persistence of psychological symptoms, indicating severity and chronicity of the problems. The main findings were that refugees with a former history of traumatic experiences of a physical character were less willing to return. A decrease over time in all symptom parameters was found in the repatriated group with a statistically significant decline for the PTSS- 16 and HTQ scores (pv 0. 05). Conclusions: Chronicity of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> load was found in both groups. The decision to return home seems to be closely connected to pre-flight traumatic experiences. An early decision to return home seems to be persistent over time...|$|E
40|$|Gallbladder {{diseases}} {{can give}} rise to dyspeptic or colonic symptoms in addition to biliary pain. Although most biliary pain shows improvement after cholecystectomy, the fates of dyspeptic or colonic symptoms still remain controversial. This study as-sessed whether nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms improved after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and identified the char-acteristics of patients who experienced continuing or exacerbated symptoms following surgery. Methods Sixty-five patients who underwent LC for uncomplicated gallbladder stones or gallbladder polyps were enrolled. The patients were surveyed on their dyspeptic or colonic symptoms before surgery and again at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Patients' mental sanity was also assessed using a <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> score with the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised questionnaire. Results Forty-four (67. 7 %) patients showed one or more dyspeptic or colonic symptoms before surgery. Among these, 31 (47. 7 %) and 36 (55. 4 %) patients showed improvement at 3 and 6 months after surgery, respectively. However, 18. 5 % of patients showed continuing or exacerbated symptoms at 6 months after surgery. These patients did not differ with respect to gallstone or gall-bladder polyps, but differed in frequency of gastritis. These patients reported lower postoperative satisfaction. Patients with ab-dominal symptoms showed higher <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> scores than others. However, poor mental sanity {{was not related to}} the symptom exacerbation...|$|E
40|$|Locus of Control (LOC) is operationalized as a dispositional trait {{remaining}} stable throughout life, but {{may also}} be conceptualized as a domain specific state. Widowed persons' support groups, consisting of recently conjugally bereaved older adults (N= 22) and one high functioning, long-term widowed peer group leader, were utilized to test LOC malleability. A significant increase in one State measure subscale, Desire for Control, was noted. Trait LOC remained stable. The change in State and Trait LOC change did not significantly relate to <b>psychological</b> <b>symptom</b> reduction. However, Trait LOC Internality related to fewer symptoms whereas State LOC Internality related to more symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Subjects {{with asthma}} are more {{susceptible}} to <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> but it is uncertain whether <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> are linked to future risk of asthma outcomes. Objective: To investigate the relationship between current <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and future risk of asthma outcomes. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study with a 12 -month follow-up period of 297 patients with asthma. <b>Psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> lung function, asthma control test, and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire at baseline were assessed. Asthma outcomes including exacerbations, unplanned visits, emergency visits, hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, and length of hospital stays were monitored monthly. The time to the first asthma outcomes was analyzed. Furthermore, the association between <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> and future risk of asthma outcomes was calculated as adjusted relative risk (RR) using logistic regression models. Results: The asthma patients were assigned to one of three groups: neither anxiety nor depression symptoms (NAD, n = 102), either anxiety or depression symptoms (A/D, n = 68), or anxiety and depression symptoms (AD, n = 120). Logistic regression models indicated that asthma patients in the AD group, but not the A/D group, had an increased adjusted RR for unplanned visits and emergency visits (RR = 2. 33, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = [1. 50, 3. 61]; and RR = 3. 13, 95 % CI = [1. 90, 5. 17], respectively). The time to the first asthma outcomes including exacerbations, unplanned visits, and emergency visits was shorter in patients with <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> than those without (all p <. 001). Conclusion: Current <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> especially anxiety combined with depression, independently predict the future risk of asthma outcomes...|$|R
30|$|<b>Psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{in women}} without a mood {{disorder}} are frequent during the MT and most often include irritability, tearfulness, anxiety, depression, emotional lability, low energy and motivation, poor concentration, and interrupted sleep (Avis et al. 1994). While {{the role of}} reproductive hormones {{in the risk of}} mood <b>symptoms</b> is unclear, <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> are postulated to be linked to the fluctuation, not absolute levels, of estradiol (Rubinow et al. 1998). These <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> overlap with those of functionally impairing mood disorders leading one to speculate that the perimenopause may contribute to depression or mood elevation in vulnerable women.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} whether psychache (i. e., mental pain) mediates {{the association}} between general distress, assessed as the frequency {{and the intensity of}} <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the previous week, and suicide ideation in community adults. For a sample of 202 adults, psychache fully mediated the relationship between suicide ideation and the frequency of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and partially mediated the relationship between suicide ideation and the intensity of <b>psychological</b> <b>symptoms.</b> As such, mental pain fully or partially explains the process linking the frequency and the intensity of general distress to suicide ideation and, thus, mental pain is a target for potential intervention...|$|R
