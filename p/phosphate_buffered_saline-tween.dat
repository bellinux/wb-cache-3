From the previous studies, it was seen that the reduction peak observed at − 0.6 /− 0.7  V vs. RHE in bicarbonate <b>buffer</b> and in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> at pH 11.6 was due to the production of formate via direct bicarbonate reduction.

Addition of a chemoattractant, D-xylose, to cells in either potassium or sodium <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> resulted in a transient membrane depolarization. In the presence of valinomycin, the membrane potential of cells in potassium <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> was reduced, and the transient membrane depolarization that resulted from the addition of D-xylose was eliminated. Although there was no detectable effect of valinomycin on motility, D-xylose taxis of cells in potassium <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> was completely inhibited by valinomycin. In sodium <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer,</b> valinomycin had little effect on membrane potential or D-xylose taxis.
