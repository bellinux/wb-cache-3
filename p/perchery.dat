40|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide MAFF with an {{assessment}} of the potential for organic poultry production in England and Wales and, in particular, to identify likely constraints on the development of organic poultry production enterprises, including physical, financial and market factors. The study will e composed of 3 specific objectives outlines as follows, together with ways in which they might be achieved: 1. Definition of the physical production parameters for alternative poultry production to organic standards, with particular emphasis on free range and <b>perchery</b> systems and their respective input requirements and output potential. A detailed literature review will be conducted and consultations will be made with existing organic poultry producers. Direct experience with conventional free range and <b>perchery</b> production systems at the National Institute of Poultry Husbandry and other published information will be utilised to identify potential areas for improvement and/or future research; 2. Investigation of market opportunities for organic poulry meat and egg production in England and Wales, through an examination of the existing market structure and an appraisal of existing and potential marketing strategies. The market for organic poultry meat and eggs will be analysed for shape, size and future potential. Alternative marketing approaches for this sector will be considered and a desk study will be conducted involving a review of trade journals and poultry sector business reports, together with consultation with key players in the sector; and 3. Formulation of an appropriate farm business plan to illustrate the relative profitability of alternative systems of organic poultry production, including the projection of cash flows under given assumptions and the application of sensitivity analyses to key variables influencing profitability. The business plan will cover a wide range of areas, including: industry and market size; producer strategy; capital requirements,; marketing strategy; projected funds; and building, labour and statutory requirements...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{behavioural}} requirements of laying hens. It primarily concentrates on evidence from consumer demand studies and relates {{this to the}} behavioural and physical consequences of denying hens opportunities to express certain activities. Hens clearly place {{a high value on}} food and this provides a useful yardstick for assessing the value of other resources. Hens have been found to work for access to a range of additional resources including pecking, scratching and dust bathing substrates, perches (particularly prior to nightfall), additional space and nestboxes. So far, only nestboxes (prior to oviposition) have been found to have a value comparable to food (in food-deprived hens). To date, however, no study has systematically compared the value of a range of resources. Furthermore, {{only a limited number of}} studies have related deprivation of specific resources to behavioural or physiological measures of distress. Egg production is clearly very efficient economically when hens are housed in conventional wire cages and provided with adequate food and water, but the hens show signs of frustrated nesting and pecking/scratching behaviour in these conditions. Modified or enriched cages allow for these activities, as well as perching, and, potentially dust bathing, but do not allow full expression of exploratory or comfort behaviours, Free-range systems, <b>percheries</b> and other types of colony housing provide opportunities for all of the above, although at high stocking densities social competition and limited space may restrict performance of these behaviours for certain birds...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of airborne endotoxins and microorganisms in livestock buildings (cattle, pig, poultry) was surveyed in four European countries (England, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany). Measurements were {{made during the}} day and night. The endotoxin concentrations were determined from dust samples separated into inhalable and respirable fractions. Airborne microorganisms were classified as total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and total fungi. The lowest endotoxin concentrations were found in cattle houses. The highest concentrations of endotoxin were measured in poultry houses, especially <b>percheries,</b> with an overall mean of 692 and 49 ng/m 3 for inhalable and respirable fractions, respectively. Endotoxin concentration was usually higher in the day than at night. These concentrations give cause for concern for the health of stockmen working in such buildings. The corresponding mean emission rates from poultry houses were 678 and 43 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively, 51 and 6 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from pig buildings and 9 and 1 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from cattle houses. A new automated bioaerosol sampler was developed, which allows remote, independent sampling of airborne microorganisms. Its principle of operation is similar to a slit sampler: airborne microbes are collected by impaction on an agar surface. Most measurements of airborne microorganisms were made in Germany. The indoor {{concentration of}} total bacteria was 6. 43 log colony-forming units (cfu) /m 3 in broiler houses, 5. 1 log cfu/m 3 in pig buildings and 4. 3 log cfu/m 3 in cattle buildings. During the day, the overall concentration of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 3 and 4 log cfu/m 3. The mean fungi concentration for cattle was 3. 8, for pigs 3. 7 and for poultry 4. 0 log cfu/m 3 during the day. Slightly lower concentrations were measured at night. No significant correlation was found between the concentrations of endotoxin and Enterobacteriaceae. The highest emission rate of total bacteria and fungi was measured for broilers, i. e. 9. 5 and 7. 7 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively. Buildings for laying hens had the highest mean emission rate of 7. 1 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight for Enter obacteriaceae...|$|R
