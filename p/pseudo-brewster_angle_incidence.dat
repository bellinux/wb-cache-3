40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPolarization of light due to metallic reflection {{is at best}} only partially explained by current models. A new model is proposed to account for this phenomenon involving "native clusters". These clusters {{are assumed to be}} an integral part of metallic bulk surfaces and to manifest their dielectric properties in the visible region. As index of refraction may be computed based on a <b>pseudo-Brewster</b> <b>angle,</b> that <b>angle</b> of <b>incidence</b> where the minimum perpendicular reflectance occurs. Next the model identifies the cluster-to-bulk surface area ratio of the material and formulates the contribution of reflection from these areas by utilizing the Fresnel equations. Reflectance from the remainder, the bulk-surface area, is computed by applying conventional metallic reflection techniques. By combining the two contributions of reflectance for <b>angles</b> of <b>incidence</b> from 0 to 90 degrees, reflectance curves are generated for gold, silver, nickel and aluminum. These calculations assume a wide-band radiating source of light. Although the magnitude of reflectance for the model showed some variance over the range of <b>angles</b> of <b>incidence</b> (within 10 %), the curves are similar in shape. The minimum perpendicular reflectance and grazing <b>angles</b> in <b>incidence</b> are consistent with experimental findings. The computer surface ratio for each metal varies indirectly with the metals' normal reflectance value, as expected from the model. Spectral information on the complex index of refraction is included to infer probable cluster size. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|A pseudo-Brewster-angle {{infrared}} radiometer {{has been proposed}} for use in noncontact measurement of the surface temperature of {{a large body of}} water (e. g., a lake or ocean). This radiometer could be situated on a waterborne, airborne, or spaceborne platform. The design of the pseudo-Brewster-angle radiometer would exploit the spectral-emissivity and polarization characteristics of water to minimize errors attributable to the emissivity of water and to the reflection of downwelling (e. g., Solar and cloud-reflected) infrared radiation. The relevant emissivity and polarization characteristics are the following:. The Brewster angle is the angle at which light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence on a purely dielectric material is not reflected. The <b>pseudo-Brewster</b> <b>angle,</b> defined for a lossy dielectric (somewhat electrically conductive) material, is the angle for which the reflectivity for parallel-polarized light is minimized. For pure water, the reflectivity for parallel-polarized light is only 2. 2 x 10 (exp - 4) at its pseudo- Brewster angle of 51 deg. The reflectivity remains near zero, several degrees off from the 51 deg optimum, allowing this <b>angle</b> of <b>incidence</b> requirement to be easily achieved.. The wavelength range of interest for measuring water temperatures is 8 to 12 microns. The emissivity of water for parallel- polarized light at the <b>pseudo-Brewster</b> <b>angle</b> is greater than 0. 999 in this wavelength range. The radiometer would be sensitive in the wavelength range of 8 to 12 microns, would be equipped with a polarizer to discriminate against infrared light polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and would be aimed toward a body of water at the pseudo- Brewster angle (see figure). Because the infrared radiation entering the radiometer would be polarized parallel to the plane of incidence and because very little downwelling parallel-polarized radiation would be reflected into the radiometer on account of the pseudo-Brewster arrangement, the radiation received by the radiometer would consist almost entirely of thermal emission {{from the surface of the}} water. Because the emissivity of the water would be very close to 1, the water could be regarded as a close approximation of a blackbody for the purpose of computing its surface temperature from the radiometer measurements by use of the Planck radiation law...|$|R
