5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist <b>personnel</b> <b>at</b> the surface.|$|E
5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord.

The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E

5|$|By 1914, Psara {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from active duty {{to serve as}} a training ship for engine room <b>personnel.</b> <b>At</b> the outbreak of World War I at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war.

5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse.

At 18:30, the military <b>personnel</b> <b>at</b> the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E
