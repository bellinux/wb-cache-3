A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and <b>pack</b> it <b>with</b> <b>grease.</b> Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.|$|R

40|$|An eight-pole radial {{magnetic}} bearing has been modified into a switched-reluctance electric motor capable of operating {{at a speed}} as high as 8, 000 rpm at a temperature as high as 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The motor (see figure) is an experimental prototype of starter-motor/generator units that have been proposed to be incorporated into advanced gas turbine engines and that could operate without need for lubrication or active cooling. The unique features of this motor are its electromagnet coils and, to some extent, its control software. Heretofore, {{there has been no}} commercial-off-the-shelf wire capable of satisfying all of the requirements for fabrication of electromagnet coils capable of operation at temperatures up to 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The issues addressed in the development of these electromagnet coils included thermal expansion, oxidation, pliability to small bend radii, micro-fretting, dielectric breakdown, tensile strength, potting compound, thermal conduction, and packing factor. For a test, the motor was supported, along with a rotor of 18 lb (. 8 -kg) mass, 3 -in. (. 7. 6 -cm) diameter, 21 -in. (. 53 -cm) length, on bearings <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> high-temperature <b>grease.</b> The motor was located at the mid span of the rotor and wrapped with heaters. The motor stator was instrumented with thermocouples. At the time of reporting the information for this article, the motor had undergone 14 thermal cycles between room temperature and 1, 000 F (. 540 C) and had accumulated operating time > 27. 5 hours at 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The motor-controller hardware includes a personal computer equipped with analog-to-digital input and digital-to-analog output cards. The controller software is a C-language code that implements a switched-reluctance motor-control principle: that is, it causes the coils to be energized in a sequence timed to generate a rotating magnetic flux that creates a torque on a scalloped rotor. The controller can operate in an open- or closed-loop mode. In addition, the software has been modified to enable the simultaneous operation of the prototype motor or another, similar apparatus as both a motor and a {{magnetic bearing}}. Combined bearing/motor operation has been demonstrated at room temperature but had not yet been demonstrated at high temperature at the time of reporting the information for this article...|$|R
