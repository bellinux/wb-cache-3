25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical <b>pre-selector</b> gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E
40|$|Institute of Occupational Medicine dual-fraction {{samplers}} {{equipped with}} porous polyurethane foam inserts {{have been introduced}} as a cheaper alternative to cyclone <b>pre-selectors</b> for measur-ing respirable dust. Initial data {{from a variety of}} industries suggested that the dual-fraction sampler yielded similar results as personal cyclones and that the respirable selection of the foam was not adversely affected by particle loading. We conducted a similar study, but specif-ically in the brick industry to assess the validity of this dual-fraction sampler as an alternative to personal cyclones in this industry. A total of 72 side-by-side samples using Higgins–Dewell cyclones and dual-fraction samplers were taken in seven UK factories manufacturing a variety of bricks. A priori measurements were assigned to any of the three groups based on the dom-inant source of the particulates in the exposure matrix (clay, sand or mixed) at the location in the factories where the measurements were taken. After log transformation, Higgins–Dewell cyclone-measured concentrations were on average 1. 9 times higher than the concentrations measured by the dual-fraction samplers, with a Pearson correlation of 0. 78 (95 % confidence interval 0. 66 – 0. 85). Stratified analysis by main source of exposure suggested that the correla-tion was best for silica dust-based exposures rp 5 0. 88 (0. 63 – 0. 96), but decreased with th...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to quantify quartz mass in coal dust deposited on the internal cassette surface of respirable size-selective samplers. Coal dust was collected with four different respirable size-selective samplers (10 mm Dorr-Oliver nylon [Sensidyne, St. Petersburg, Fla. ], SKC Aluminum [SKC Inc., Eighty Four, Pa. ], BGI 4 L [BGI USA Inc., Waltham, Mass. ], and GK 2. 69 cyclones [BGI USA Inc. ]) with two different cassette types (polystyrene and static-dissipative polypropylene cassettes). The coal dust was aerosolized in a calm air chamber by using a fluidized bed aerosol generator without neutralization under the assumption that the procedure is similar to field sampling conditions. The mass of coal dust was measured gravimetrically and quartz mass was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Manual of Analytical Methods, Method 7603. The mass fractions of the total quartz sample on the internal cassette surface are significantly different between polystyrene and static-dissipative cassettes for all cyclones (p < 0. 05). No consistent relationship between quartz mass on cassette internal surface and coal dust filter mass was observed. The BGI 4 L cyclone showed a higher (but not significantly) and the GK 2. 69 cyclone showed a significantly lower (p < 0. 05) internal surface deposit quartz mass fraction for polystyrene cassettes compared to other cyclones. This study confirms previous observations that the interior surface deposits in polystyrene cassettes attached to cyclone <b>pre-selectors</b> can be a substantial part of the sample, and therefore need to be included in any analysis for accurate exposure assessment. On the other hand, the research presented here supports the position that the internal surface deposits in static-dissipative cassettes used with size-selective cyclones are negligible and that it is only necessary to analyze the filter catch.

In this article we describe the process of involving rural poor in benefit-package design and assess the underlying reasons for choices they made {{and their ability to}} reach group consensus. Methods: The benefit-package selection process entailed four steps: narrowing down the options by community representatives, plus three Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT) rounds conducted among female members of self-help groups. We use mixed-methods and four sources of data: baseline study, CHAT exercises, in-depth interviews, and evaluation questionnaires. We define consensus as a community resolution reached by discussion, considering all opinions, and to which everyone agrees. We use the coefficient of unalikeability to express consensus quantitatively (as variability of categorical variables) rather than just categorically (as a binomial Yes/No). Findings: The coefficient of unalikeability decreased consistently over consecutive CHAT rounds, reaching zero (ie, 100 % consensus) in two locations, and confirmed gradual adoption of consensus. Evaluation interviews revealed that the wish {{to be part of a}} consensus was dominant in all locations. The in-depth interviews indicated that people enjoyed the participatory deliberations, were satisfied with the selection, and that group decisions reflected a consensus rather than majority. Moreover, evidence suggests that <b>pre-selectors</b> and communities aimed to enhance the likelihood that many households would benefit from CBHI. Conclusion: The voluntary and contributory CBHI relies on an engaging experience with others to validate perceived priorities of the target group. The strongest motive for choice was the wish to join a consensus (more than price or package-composition) and the intention that many members should benefit. The degree of consensus improved with iterative CHAT rounds. Harnessing group consensus requires catalytic intervention, as the process is not spontaneous.

2500|$|They were unpopular {{with the}} drivers {{for a variety}} of reasons, including: the {{synchromesh}} gearboxes required a lot more work to operate compared to the <b>pre-selector</b> gearboxes in the older buses; the separation of the driver's cab from the passenger compartment made visibility and fare collection difficult; and it was often necessary to exit the vehicle many times per shift using a small side door into the path of oncoming traffic to perform routine tasks. [...] However, compared to the Ford V8s, they were more powerful, had better brakes, and were more reliable.|$|E

50|$|Fluid flywheels, as {{distinct}} from torque converters, are best known for their use in Daimler cars {{in conjunction with a}} Wilson <b>pre-selector</b> gearbox.
