This procedure is followed, and class members are bound, {{regardless of whether they}} received actual notice, so long as the notice issued met the requisite due <b>process</b> <b>requirements.</b> Conversely, some types of class actions or so-called [...] "collective actions" [...] (e.g., actions to enforce the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967) are opt-in actions brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §216(b) (see, also 29 U.S.C. § 626(b)). In such [...] "216b" [...] actions, class members are not bound by the results of the collective action, and their claims are not tolled during the pendency thereof, until they opt-in by filing a Consent to join the litigation. Due to the tenuous rights of class members in collective actions prior to opt-in, certification in such actions is subject to a much lower standard.|$|E
2500|$|Application of the “amparo” (constitutionally-based appeal) {{process in}} ways that are {{inconsistent}} with commitments under the Convention is an ongoing problem. TPs sometimes allege that the procedure under the Convention violates their right to due process under the Mexican Constitution. In response to the filing of an amparo, judges issue a provisional order that immediately freezes proceedings under the Convention pending adjudication of the underlying constitutional issue. Precedent exists in Mexican law to promptly adjudicate and reject an amparo in a Convention case alleging violation of due process. For example, both the Mexican Supreme Court and the highest court in the Federal District have determined that procedures under the Convention comport with the Constitution’s due <b>process</b> <b>requirements,</b> and these decisions have been relied upon by lower courts. Despite these positive developments, adjudication of Convention-related amparos is still subject to frequent delay. [...] During the reporting period, the MCA, the Hague Permanent Bureau, and the U.S. Government collaborated in three seminars designed to enhance judicial awareness of the Convention, with special emphasis on the compatibility of the Convention with the due process guarantees of the Mexican Constitution. [...] The USCA and the U.S. Embassy repeatedly asked by email, telephone, fax, and letters for status updates on the longstanding cases detailed in the “Unresolved Return Applications” section of this report, but received no replies {{by the end of the}} reporting period in at least 19 of these cases.|$|E
