5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States.

American specimens of A.bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of A.exitialis.

40|$|Abstract: We present {{algorithms}} for computing all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two {{and three}} fingers that cage a given polygonal object with n edges in the plane. A polygon is caged when {{it is impossible to}} take the polygon to infinity without penetrating one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingers. Using a classification into squeezing and stretching cagings, we provide an algorithm that reports all caging <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two disc fingers in O(n 2 log n) time. Our result extends and improves a recent solution for point fingers. In addition, we construct a data structure requiring O(n 2) storage that can answer in O(log n) whether two fingers in a query placement cage the polygon. We also study caging with three point fingers. Given <b>the</b> <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two so-called base fingers, we report all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third finger so that the three fingers jointly cage the polygon. Using the fact that <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>placements</b> for <b>the</b> third finger consists of equilibrium grasps, we present an algorithm that reports all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third finger in O(n 6 log 2 n) deterministic time and O(n 6 log n(log log n) 3) expected time. Our results extend previous solutions that only apply to convex polygons. ...|$|R
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are {{not considered to be}} a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
