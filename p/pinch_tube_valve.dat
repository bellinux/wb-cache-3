40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to study fluid flow behavior through a pinch valve and to estimate the flow coefficient (KV) at different opening positions of the valve. The flow inside a compressed valve is more complex than in a straight pipe, and it is one of main topics of interest for engineers in process industry. In the present work, we have numerically simulated compressed valve flow at different opening positions. In order to simulate the flow through pinch valve, several models of the elastomeric <b>valve</b> <b>tube</b> (<b>pinch</b> <b>valve</b> <b>tube)</b> at different opening positions were constructed in 2 D-axisymmetric and 3 D geometries. The numerical simulations were performed with the CFD packages; ANSYS FLUENT and ANSYS CFX by using parallel computing. The distributions of static pressure, velocity and turbulent kinetic energy have been studied at different opening positions of the valve in both 2 D-axisymmetric and 3 D experiments. The flow coefficient (KV) values have been measured at different valve openings and are compared between 2 D-axisymmetric and 3 D simulation results...|$|R
