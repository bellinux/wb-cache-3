500|$|In development, reelin is {{secreted}} by Cajal-Retzius cells. [...] Reelin {{acts as an}} extracellular {{ligand binding}} to ApoER2 and VLDLR on migrating neurons. A specific lysine residue on reelin binds to the first repeat on the ligand binding domain of ApoER2. This interaction with the two receptors activates intracellular processes that begin with the phosphorylation of Dab1, a tyrosine kinase <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>protein</b> which is encoded by the DAB1 gene. This protein associates with the NPXY motifs on the intracellular tails of ApoER2 and VLDLR. Upon reelin binding, Dab1 is phosphorylated by two tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src. The phosphorylated Dab1 then causes further activation of these two kinases and others, including a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activation leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), which alters the activity of tau protein, a protein involved in stabilizing microtubules. This transduction is combined with the activation of other pathways that influence the cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for proper cortical cell migration.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the use of gallium(III) immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ga(III) IMAC) as a tool in the global internal standard technique (GIST). ^ The work in this thesis began with the establishment of Ga(III) IMAC as a viable tool that was specific in its ability to select phosphorylated peptides from a complex mixture of peptides. This technique was perfected and automated in the analysis of phosphorylated peptides from casein proteins and milk samples. The second phase of {{this research}} was to establish a labeling technique that allowed the monitoring of up and down regulation of <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>proteins.</b> Light and heavy acetate and the quaternary amine coding agent were noted as candidates for this process. Once the ability to monitor up and down regulation of <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>proteins</b> was perfected, a more complex system was addressed. Whole milk from a healthy cow and whole milk from a cow stricken with mastitis were analyzed to determine if there was a difference in the regulation of <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>proteins.</b> Numerous <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>proteins</b> were monitored and confirmed through sequencing with mass spectrometry. Finally, one of the most complex protein systems available was analyzed.

50|$|Regulation {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} partly influenced by phosphorylation of eIF2 (via the α subunit), {{which is a}} part of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (TC). When large numbers of eIF2 are <b>phosphorylated,</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is inhibited. This occurs if there is amino acid starvation or there has been a virus infection. However, naturally a small percentage of this initiation factor is phosphorylated. Another regulator is 4EBP, which binds to the initiation factor eIF4E and inhibits its interactions with eIF4G, thus preventing cap-dependent initiation. To oppose the effects of the 4EBP, growth factors phosphorylate 4EBP, reducing its affinity for eIF4E and permitting protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Phosphomimetics are {{amino acid}} substitutions that mimic a <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>protein,</b> thereby {{activating}} (or deactivating) the protein.

Phosphorylation is a common mode of activating or deactivating a protein {{as a form of}} regulation. However some non-phosphorylated amino acids appear chemically similar to phosphorylated amino acids. Therefore, by replacing an amino acid, the protein may maintain a higher level of activity. For example, aspartic acid is chemically similar to phospho-serine. Therefore, when an aspartic acid replaces a serine, it is a phosphomimetic of phospho-serine and can make the protein always in its phosphorylated form.|$|E

We detected the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, lung wet/dry weight ratios, protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the histopathologic and ultrastructure staining of the lung. The levels of IL- 1, TNF-α, and IL- 10 and the total and the <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>protein</b> level of STAT 1, JAK 1, and JAK 2 were assessed in vitro and in vivo.

The anti-phospho-tyrosine monoclonal antibody (McAb) 4 G 10 bound strongly and discretely to the EqSS of permeabilized boar, ram, and bull spermatozoa. It also bound to a small patch on the posterior acrosomal region of permeabilized mouse and rat spermatozoa, suggesting that the EqSS is not restricted to the order Artiodactyla. An anti-HSPA 1 A (formerly Hsp 70) antibody recognized the EqSS in boar spermatozoa. Immunogold labeling with McAb 4 G 10 localized the tyrosine <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>proteins</b> to the outer acrosomal membrane.
