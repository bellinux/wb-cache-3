50|$|Continuing at a weak level, {{it passed}} over the Cobb/Fulton county line at the Chattahoochee River, and very briefly did minor damage. At this <b>point,</b> the <b>funnel</b> lifted from the ground, while the still-rotating {{supercell}} traversed {{what is now the}} city of Sandy Springs. It was determined that this portion was about three miles or five kilometers long, and about 100 to 200 yards (90 to 180 meters) wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to {{the choice of the}} Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably {{to be found in the}} German attack on the Gallic fortified town of Vesontio in 58 BC.

50|$|The largest risk {{when using}} a {{separatory}} funnel is that of pressure build-up. Pressure accumulates during mixing if a gas evolving reaction or physical change occurs. This problem can be easily handled by simply opening the stopper {{at the top of}} the funnel routinely while mixing. This should be done with the top of the <b>funnel</b> <b>pointed</b> away from the body.|$|R
50|$|Bandipur was {{established}} as a <b>funnelling</b> <b>point</b> of trade by Newar traders from Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu valley after it had been conquered in 1768 by Prithvi Narayan Shah. They took advantage of its malaria free location to develop it into an important stop along the India-Tibet trade route. With them they brought their cultural heritage and architecture which basically has remained unchanged to this day.|$|R
25|$|Moncton grew rapidly {{during the}} early part of the 20th century, {{particularly}} after provincial lobbying saw the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912; this line would link Moncton with Edmundston, Quebec City, and on to Winnipeg where the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway continued to Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Prince Rupert. The First World War brought a halt to the era of railway expansion but the city would become an important trans-shipment <b>point</b> for materiel <b>funnelling</b> onwards to the port of Halifax.|$|R

The goal of the analysis is to {{provide insight into the}} overall conversion rate as well as the key weak <b>points</b> of the <b>funnel</b> (the stages in which the largest percentages of users drop out of the funnel). This may also involve analysis of a company's search engine optimization situation and changes in online traffic pathways.|$|R

50|$|After {{the tornado}} left Woodstock, it is {{suspected}} that the tornado grew to its maximum size. As it passed over the town of Oxford Centre (a hamlet of 250 at the time) the damage path width had reached 1 kilometre. Within two minutes, thirty homes were destroyed, along with the local church and community centre in Oxford Centre (Toll, 1980). The towns of New Durham and Vanessa met a similar fate shortly thereafter, at 7:19 and 7:37pm respectively. A partially filled, forty-foot silo constructed of concrete six inches thick, toppled over on a farm somewhere between Oxford Centre and New Durham. The two deaths were in the New Durham area. A 51-year-old man was killed instantly after being thrown some 200 feet from his two-ton vehicle, and a woman died after being hit with flying glass (Toll, 1980). At this <b>point,</b> the <b>funnel</b> {{had been on the}} ground for over twenty minutes and was easily over a mile wide. During this stretch of the tornado's path, two vehicles on two separate farms were tossed nearly a kilometre. In addition to the powerful tornado at hand, hail the size of tennis balls fell north of its track, destroying entire tobacco fields on dozens of farms (Newark, 1979). Eyewitnesses also reported that the tornado was preceded by intense and nearly constant lightning unlike any they had seen before (Toll, 1980).|$|R

60|$|His hell, {{considered}} as a place, is, to speak geologically, a most fantastical formation. It descends from beneath Jerusalem to {{the centre of the}} earth, and is a funnel graduated in circles, each circle being a separate place of torment for a different vice or its co-ordinates, and the <b>point</b> of the <b>funnel</b> terminating with Satan stuck into ice. Purgatory is a corresponding mountain {{on the other side of}} the globe, commencing with the antipodes of Jerusalem, and divided into exterior circles of expiation, which end in a table-land forming the terrestrial paradise. From this the hero and his mistress ascend by a flight, exquisitely conceived, to the stars; where the sun and the planets of the Ptolemaic system (for the true one was unknown in Dante's time) form a series of heavens for different virtues, the whole terminating in the empyrean, or region of pure light, and the presence of the Beatific Vision.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} {{foundation is}} formed by 127 piles supporting a 19.6 m diameter concrete foundation slab up to 3 m thick at the centre which is 3.2m below ground level. It supports a tall conical hollow shaft of reinforced concrete which rises 120 m above ground level.

2500|$|At around 10:20, the {{manoeuvring}} of the {{two ships}} brought them to within , and Glossop {{took the opportunity to}} order a torpedo firing. The torpedo failed to cover the distance, and sank without exploding. The Australian ship sped up and turned to starboard so guns that had yet to fire could engage. Emden matched Sydneys turn, but by this <b>point,</b> the second <b>funnel</b> had been blasted off, and there was a fire in the engine room. In addition, about half of the cruiser's personnel had been killed or wounded, and the abandoning of the attack party on Direction Island meant there were no reserves to replace them. By 11:00, only one of Emdens guns was still firing. As the third funnel went overboard, Emden found herself closer to North Keeling Island, and von Müller ordered the ship to beach on North Keeling Island, hoping to prevent further loss of life. Emden ran aground at around 11:20, at which point, Sydney ceased fire. After Sydney contacted the convoy to report [...] "Emden beached and done for", the soldiers aboard the troopships were granted a half-day holiday from duties and training to celebrate.|$|R
40|$|The {{coral reef}} areas of Gulf of Mannar support a rich fauna of fishes and bottom set gill net {{is one of}} the {{important}} gears employed in this area. Reef fishes landed at Pamban fish landing centre by bottom-set gillnets operated in Gulf of Mannar, for a period of three years from January, 2009 to December, 2011 were studied based on fortnightly sampling. A total of 69 species belonging to 29 families were recorded during the study and as per IUCN, two species, Himantura uarnak and Rhinoptera javanica are included under the Vulnerable category. The landings amounted to 1761 tonnes during the period with a maximum contribution of 44 % during 2011 and it was the minimum during 2010 with a share of 27 %. Species-wise landings indicated the dominance of Lethrinus nebulosus (11. 5 %) followed by Neotrygon kuhlii (10. 6 %). The richness and diversity indices showed a gradual increase from 2009 to 2011 and all the year wise <b>points</b> in the <b>funnel</b> plot for variation in taxonomic distinctness (λ+) are within the expected limit. The qualitative and quantitative abundance along with different diversity measures are presented and discussed in this paper. The results of the present investigation suggest that the bottom set gill net fishery is in a healthy condition with respect to Pamban fish landing centre...|$|R
40|$|The {{dopamine}} {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia {{has been one}} of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia—version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic <b>funnel</b> <b>point...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{protein folding}} {{phenomenon}} was largely an experimental endeavor until {{the formulation of}} an energy landscape theory of proteins by Joseph Bryngelson and Peter Wolynes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This approach introduced the principle of minimal frustration. This principle says that nature has chosen amino acid sequences so that the folded state of the protein is very stable. In addition, the undesired interactions between amino acids along the folding pathway are reduced, making the acquisition of the folded state a very fast process. Even though nature has reduced the level of frustration in proteins, some degree of it remains up to now as {{can be observed in}} the presence of local minima in the energy landscape of proteins. A consequence of these evolutionarily selected sequences is that proteins are generally thought to have globally [...] "funneled energy landscapes" [...] (coined by José Onuchic) that are largely directed toward the native state. This [...] "folding funnel" [...] landscape allows the protein to fold to the native state through any {{of a large number of}} pathways and intermediates, rather than being restricted to a single mechanism. The theory is supported by both computational simulations of model proteins and experimental studies, and it has been used to improve methods for protein structure prediction and design. The description of protein folding by the leveling free-energy landscape is also consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Physically, thinking of landscapes in terms of visualizable potential or total energy surfaces simply with maxima, saddle <b>points,</b> minima, and <b>funnels,</b> rather like geographic landscapes, is perhaps a little misleading. The relevant description is really a high-dimensional phase space in which manifolds might take a variety of more complicated topological forms.|$|R
