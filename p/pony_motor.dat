5000|$|Hydraulic {{detachable}} gooseneck (hydraulic RGN or HRGN)): fastest and {{easiest to}} detach, {{at the expense}} of weight and deck length. It is the most common and versatile of lowboy trailers; the gooseneck is detached using large hydraulic cylinders to raise and lower the trailer and a small cylinder shores the neck to the truck, removing the neck so a large piece of equipment can be driven over the front onto the deck of the trailer for transport. The hydraulics can be run from the truck auxiliary or from a <b>pony</b> <b>motor</b> mounted in the neck of the trailer.|$|E
5000|$|Although IHC's {{very first}} diesel-engine tractor was a [...] "Standard" [...] model WD-40 built from 1935-1940, {{the very first}} [...] "Farmall" [...] diesel tractor was the model MD {{released}} in 1941. Like many agricultural and construction/industrial diesel engines of the time, the early IHC diesels were not direct-start; the operator started the engine on gasoline, then manually switched it to diesel fuel after warming up the entire engine. This two-in-one engine design, {{also known as a}} [...] "gas-diesel," [...] was unique to IHC agricultural products from 1935-1958 and IHC construction/industrial products from 1935-early 1960s. Other companies used different yet elaborate means to crank & warm their diesels, such as a <b>pony</b> <b>motor,</b> compressed air, hot bulb, or black powder, among other things. The Farmall Super MD, Super M-TA Diesel, 400 Diesel, and 450 Diesel used the same IHC gasoline-start engine design as the MD, but with larger displacement (more cubic inches). The first Farmall tractor with a direct-start diesel was the model 350, which appeared in 1956. The 350 could also be ordered with a gasoline or LP-gas engine. The 350's direct-start diesel engine was built by Continental Motors. IH subsequently developed their own line of new direct-start diesel engines for the 460 and 560 tractors starting in 1958. Large competitors such as Deere and Caterpillar lagged at least two years behind IH in offering direct-start diesel products.|$|E
40|$|The reactor design {{features}} 4 independent cooling loops (3 active, 1 standby), each containing a main circulation pump (with battery powered <b>pony</b> <b>motor),</b> heat exchanger, an accumulator, and a check valve. The first transient assumes {{one of these}} pumps fails, and also that the check valve in that loop remains stuck open. This accident is considered extremely unlikely. Flow reverses in this loop, reducing core flow {{because much of the}} coolant is diverted from the intact loops back through the failed loop. The second transient examines a 102 -mm-dia instantaneous pipe break near the core inlet (worst break location). A break is assumed to occur 90 s after a total loss-of-offsite power. Core flow reversal occurs because accumulator injection overpowers the diminishing pump flow. Safety margins are evaluated against 4 thermal limits: T{sub wall} = T{sub sat}, incipient boiling, onset of significant void, and critical heat flux. For the first transient, results show that these limits are not exceeded (at 95 % non-exceedance probability level) if the <b>pony</b> <b>motor</b> battery lasts 30 minutes (present design value). For the second transient, the closest approach of the fuel surface temperature to local saturation temperature during core flow reversal is about 39 C, so the fuel remains cool during this transient. Although this work is for the ANSR geometry and operating conditions, the general conclusion may be applicable to other highly subcooled reactor systems...|$|E
5000|$|The {{expedition}} then {{swung into}} preparations for a march from Cape Evans to the as-yet-unreached South Pole. This march {{was to be}} done during the Antarctic summer in 1911-1912. Scott's strategy called for a large team of men, <b>ponies,</b> <b>motor</b> sledges and dogs to start out southward from their base, hauling food and fuel on sledges. As the team progressed southward, the leader would successively send support groups back home, leaving a small [...] "Pole party" [...] of the fittest men to make the final advance to the South Pole.|$|R
25|$|Priority at the pole: Scott {{wrote that}} Amundsen's dogs seriously {{threatened}} his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, {{would be able}} to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, <b>ponies,</b> and <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{expedition}} lacked governmental or institutional support, and {{relied on}} private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, {{was less than}} half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901–04 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian <b>ponies,</b> <b>motor</b> traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|R
40|$|The AFR- 300, Advanced Fast Reactor (300 Mwe), {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a Generation IV concept. It {{could also be used}} to dispose of surplus weapons grade plutonium or as an actinide burner for transmutation of high level radioactive waste. AFR- 300 uses metallic fuel and sodium coolant. The design of AFR- 300 takes account of the successful design and operation of EBR-II, but the AFR- 300 design includes a number of advances such as an advanced fuel cycle, inspectability and improved economics. One significant difference between AFR- 300 and EBR-II is that AFR- 300 is considerably larger. Another significant difference is that AFR- 300 has no auxiliary EM pump in the primary loop to guarantee positive core flow when the main primary pumps are shut down. Thus, one question that has come up in connection with the AFR- 300 design is whether natural circulation flow is sufficient to prevent damage to the core if the primary pumps fail. Insufficient natural circulation flow through the core could result in high cladding temperatures and cladding failure due to eutectic penetration of the cladding by the metal fuel. The rate of eutectic penetration of the cladding is strongly temperature dependent, so cladding failure depends on how hot the cladding gets and how long it is at elevated temperatures. To investigate the adequacy of natural circulation flow, a number of pump failure transients and a number of design options have been analyzed with the SASSYS- 1 systems analysis code. This code has been validated for natural circulation behavior by analysis of Shutdown Heat Removal Tests performed in EBR-II. The AFR- 300 design includes flywheels on the primary pumps to extend the pump coastdown times, {{and the size of the}} flywheels can be picked to give optimum coastdown times. One series of transients that has been run consists of protected loss-of-flow transients with various values for the combined moment of inertia of the pump, the motor and the flywheel giving coastdown times from 70 seconds to 586 seconds. In this transient series both the main pump motors and the pony motors lose power. Another series of loss-of-flow cases involved staggered failures of the pony motors. The main pump motors fail, the reactor scrams, and the pumps coast down to <b>pony</b> <b>motor</b> speed. Then at various times the pony motors are assumed to fail. If the pony motors fail at the wrong time, then the resulting transient can be more severe than if the pony motors failed at the same time as the main motors. A third series of cases involved a reactor scram followed by failure of both the main pump motors and the pony motors at various times. For all of these cases, satisfactory natural circulation behavior can be obtained if the right design options are used...|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} unpublished plan envisaged basing {{himself at}} the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, {{and there would be}} a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed <b>motor</b> vehicle. Neither <b>ponies</b> nor <b>motor</b> traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894–97. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic £30,000 (updated value £). However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.|$|R
