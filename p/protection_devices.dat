5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E

40|$|A novel early {{streamer}} emission (ESE) lightning {{air terminal}} {{system is designed}} and fabricated. By comparing the intercepted artificial lightning striking numbers of the new ESE lightning <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> and the conventional lightning rod (CLR) lightning <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in laboratory, the effectiveness of intercepting the artificial lightning strokes by the new ESE lightning <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> is superior to that by the conventional lightning rod lightning <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> A modified Tesla Coil (TC) discharging by powering AC voltage up to 650 kV with the controlled triggering function generator is used to produce simulated lightning strokes. The top tips of both devices in the same horizontal plane are placed at the same distance to the modified TC during all the test processes. Exchanging their positions makes no obvious difference between the recorded results.

30|$|Based on {{the optical}} transducer, data {{sampling}} with merging units and optic-fiber communication, {{the data collection}} part of <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> is separated. Different from conventional <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> applying the intelligent breaker makes {{it possible that the}} <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> only keeps the data processing and communication part. With the rapid development and maturity of computer and electronic technology, high reliable integration and modularization of the <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> have become a development trend. Taking advantages of the compatibility with Common Information Model (CIM) of IEC 61850, communication between devices in substation automation systems becomes flexible. This technology has been applied in the protection scheme in intelligent substations and implemented in some latest power system protection products.|$|R
25|$|Since a {{filament}} {{breaking in}} a gas-filled bulb can form an electric arc, which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> are therefore {{often used as}} fuses built into the light bulb. More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.|$|E

Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere {{to the surface}} portals at Kenmore, and along {{the entire length of}} the D–Riverside branch. There are no automatic <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> but the cars have track brakes, giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} broken rope <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> is proposed to enhance the safety performances of the overhead manned equipment. According to the operating characteristics and functional requirements of the overhead manned equipment, a three-dimensional mechanical model of the broken rope <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was redesigned. Based on the known parameters of the mechanical model, the stress and strength of the main components are readjusted using the statics characteristics of finite element analysis. To ensure {{the reliability of the}} control system of the broken rope <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> the process of people’s falling, the response performance of the tension sensor, and the signal extraction of the broken rope are analyzed under different loading and unloading speeds.

2500|$|Improvements {{were also}} made in income and work {{conditions}} for home workers, accident insurance {{was extended to}} non-working adults, and the Border Zone Assistance Act (1971) increased levels of assistance to the declining zonal peripheral area. The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts. A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90dB( [...] A) may be exceeded at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal noise <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> A matching fund program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.|$|E
2500|$|Plugs and sockets {{are usually}} {{designed}} together, with the contacts of the socket part designed {{to accept the}} specific pin diameter, pin length, and pin spacing of the mating plug part. However, there is no socket defined by EN50075; neither is there a socket specified in CEE7 to accept only [...] pins or {{the profile of a}} Europlug. (There are examples of sockets on the market which accept only such plugs, sometimes in multiples, but these meet no recognized standard.) Instead of being designed with a matching socket, the Europlug was designed to be compatible with a range of sockets in common use throughout mainland Europe. These sockets, including the CEE7/1, CEE7/3 (German/"Schuko"), CEE7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8mm but also 4.0mm and 4.5mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> To improve contact with socket parts intended to receive pins having a diameter larger than 4.0mm, the Europlug has two round, slightly flexible pins which converge slightly towards their free ends.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E
