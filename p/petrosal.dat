5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The <b>petrosal</b> bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the <b>petrosal</b> are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E

40|$|Oceanic {{dolphins}} (Odontoceti: Delphinidae) {{constitute the}} most speciose family of extant cetaceans, yet their fossil record is limited. Although several extinct species are known from Mediterranean and North Atlantic localities, {{there are few}} examples from deposits along the Pacific Rim. Despite the rich record of successive marine mammal fossil assemblages in the extensively sampled eastern North Pacific, only one fossil delphinid, Protoglobicephala (Pliocene, Baja California), has been described. We report globicephaline remains from the Mio-Pliocene Purisima Formation of Northern California, including a partial cranium and two isolated <b>petrosals.</b> The skull exhibits large ridges on the pre-maxillae, and cannot be referred to any extant globicephaline genus. Similarly, the <b>petrosals</b> cannot be referred to any described delphinid genus, although they are most {{similar to those of}} Globicephala. Linear regression analyses demon-strate that promontorium length and bony nares width scale significantly within delphinidans, and provide a new method for testing referrals of isolated fossil odontocete <b>petrosals</b> to taxa known only by crania. Applying this method to the new globicephalines from the Purisima Formation, we find the <b>petrosals</b> to be too small to represent the same taxon as the skull, thus indicating the presence of two separate species.

5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior <b>petrosal</b> sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back.

Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E

50|$|Coloniatherium {{is known}} {{from a few}} jaw fragments, a number of {{isolated}} teeth, and some <b>petrosals</b> (ear bones). It was a large mesungulatid. The animal had {{an unknown number of}} incisors (probably two or three in the lower jaw), one canine, three premolars, and three molars per jaw quadrant. It is larger than Mesungulatum, has broader molars, and the back molars are more reduced; the two also differ in numerous details of tooth morphology. The first molar has three roots, a trait shared only with Leonardus from the approximately contemporaneous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina among dryolestoids.|$|R
40|$|The {{skull of}} the polydolopimorphian marsupialiform Epidolops ameghinoi is {{described}} in detail for the first time, based on a single well-preserved cranium and associated left and right dentaries plus additional craniodental fragments, all from the early Eocene (53 - 50 million year old) Itaboraí fauna in southeastern Brazil. Notable craniodental features of E. ameghinoi include absence of a masseteric process, very small maxillopalatine fenestrae, a prominent pterygoid fossa enclosed laterally by a prominent ectopterygoid crest, an absent or tiny transverse canal foramen, a simple, planar glenoid fossa, and a postglenoid foramen that is immediately posterior to the postglenoid process. Most strikingly, {{the floor of the}} hypotympanic sinus was apparently unossified, a feature found in several stem marsupials but absent in all known crown marsupials. "Type II" marsupialiform <b>petrosals</b> previously described from Itaboraí plausibly belong to E. ameghinoi; in published phylogenetic analyses, these <b>petrosals</b> fell outside (crown-clade) Marsupialia. "IMG VII" tarsals previously referred to E. ameghinoi do not share obvious synapomorphies with any crown marsupial clade, nor do they resemble those of the only other putative polydolopimorphians represented by tarsal remains, namely the argyrolagids. Most studies have placed Polydolopimorphia within Marsupialia, related to either Paucituberculata, or to Microbiotheria and Diprotodontia. However, diprotodonty almost certainly evolved independently in polydolopimorphians, paucituberculatans and diprotodontians, and Epidolops does not share obvious synapomorphies with any marsupial order. Epidolops is dentally specialized, but several morphological features appear to be more plesiomorphic than any crown marsupial. It seems likely Epidolops that falls outside Marsupialia, as do morphologically similar forms such as Bonapartherium and polydolopids. Argyrolagids differ markedly in their known morphology from Epidolops but share some potential apomorphies with paucituberculatans. It is proposed that Polydolopimorphia as currently recognised is polyphyletic, and that argyrolagids (and possibly other taxa currently included in Argyrolagoidea, such as groeberiids and patagoniids) are members of Paucituberculata. This hypothesis is supported by Bayesian non-clock phylogenetic analyses of a total evidence matrix comprising DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes, indels, retroposon insertions and morphological characters: Epidolops falls outside Marsupialia, whereas argyrolagids form a clade with the paucituberculatans Caenolestes and Palaeothentes, regardless of whether the Type II <b>petrosals</b> and IMG VII tarsals are used to score characters for Epidolops or not. There is no clear evidence for the presence of crown marsupials at Itaboraí, and {{it is possible that the}} origin and early evolution of Marsupialia was restricted to the "Austral Kingdom" (southern South America, Antarctica, and Australia) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} mammalian distal humeri {{recovered from}} the Bissekty Formation, Dzharakuduk, Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan (90 Ma). Isolated elements were sorted into groups that likely correspond to species (or genera). These groups were allocated to taxa known mostly from the dentition, <b>petrosals,</b> and/or tarsals at this site. We identified one humerus of a multituberculate and one of a zalambdalestid. Several eutherian humeri have been tentatively assigned to Zhelestidae based on their dissimilarity to zalambdalestids and the abundance of zhelestids in the dental record. The zalambdalestids and zhelestids were probably terrestrial. At least two metatherian taxa have also been identified, and both were likely ar− boreal. Although the dental record suggests twelve eutherian species and only one metatherian, crurotarsal evidence sup− ports the presence of at least four metatherian species at Dzharakuduk. The humeri analyzed here also provide support {{for the presence of}} multiple metatherians in the fauna, further demonstrating that postcrania are critical to understanding th...|$|R
25|$|The {{supply of}} {{parasympathetic}} nerves {{to the face}} and the upper jaw (maxilla) derives from the greater superficial <b>petrosal</b> (GSP) branch of cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve. The GSP nerve joins the deep <b>petrosal</b> nerve (of the sympathetic nervous system), derived from the carotid plexus, to form the vidian nerve (in the vidian canal) that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion (an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve), wherein only the parasympathetic nerves form synapses, which serve the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nose and of the palate, via the (upper jaw) maxillary division of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} {{indicating that}} the aye-aye belongs in the superfamily Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of <b>petrosal</b> bullae encasing the ossicles of the ear. However, interestingly, the bones themselves may have some resemblance to those of rodents. The aye-ayes are also similar to lemurs in their shorter back legs.|$|E
25|$|They {{receive the}} blood from the {{superior}} <b>petrosal</b> sinuses {{at the base of}} the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and condyloid emissary veins; and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploë.|$|E
40|$|Femora referable to metatherians and eutherians {{recovered}} from the Bissekty Formation, Dzharakuduk, Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan (90 Mya), are described. Fourteen isolated specimens were sorted based on size and morphology into groups that likely correspond to the species level or higher. Groups were then tentatively assigned to taxa known from teeth, <b>petrosals,</b> and/or other postcrania at these localities. One distal femur of a small arboreal metatherian, and several eutherian distal femora that probably represent zhelestids and/or zalambdalestids were identified. With {{the exception of one}} proximal femur that is similar in some aspects to the zalambdalestid Barunlestes, and a previously described multituberculate specimen, all other proximal femora from the Bissekty Formation exhibit a metatherian−like morphol− ogy. The dental record currently suggests the presence of twelve eutherian species and only one metatherian at Dzharakuduk, whereas the humeral and crurotarsal evidence supports the presence of at least two or four metatherian spe− cies, respectively. Given the sample size of the proximal femora, the morphological diversity present, and the over− whelming presence of eutherians at these localities, {{it is highly unlikely that}} the overwhelming majority of proximal femora actually represent metatherians. Therefore, this sample may suggest that the metatherian proximal femoral condi− tion is primitive for Theria and that some eutherian taxa (probably including Zhelestidae, which are dentally most abun...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} phylogeny of marsupials {{based on a}} 20. 1 kb nuclear and mitochondrial supermatrix, with associated divergence dates calculated using a Bayesian &# 147;relaxed&# 148; molecular clock approach, is presented. Monophyly of the currently recognised orders, Australidelphia and a clade comprising Dasyuromorphia, Notoryctes, and Peramelemorphia is strongly supported; the name Agreodontia is proposed for the latter clade. The molecular divergence dates indicate that the interordinal divergences within Marsupialia occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, and that several groups within the Australian radiation radiated during periods of significant environmental change in the Miocene. The fossil record of didelphids and most Australian marsupial groups appears to be particularly incomplete. Based on information provided by isolated <b>petrosals</b> and tarsals referred to this taxon, the early Eocene Australian metatherian Djarthia murgonensis {{appears to be the}} most plesiomorphic undoubted australidelphian and the oldest known crown-group marsupial from Australia. The presence of microbiotherians in South America {{may be the result of}} a back-dispersal from Australia or elsewhere in eastern Gondwana. A qualitative functional analysis of the craniodental anatomy of the Oligo-Miocene Australian metatherian Yalkaparidon supports the hypothesis that this taxon was probably a &# 147;mammalian woodpecker&# 148;, similar to Daubentonia, Dactylopsila, and the extinct apatemyids. The craniodental anatomy of Yalkaparidon is described in detail, and isolated astragali and calcanea are tentatively referred to the genus. Yalkaparidon appears to be a member of Australidelphia but without close relationships to any other australidelphian order. The order Yalkaparidontia is maintained, and revised ordinal and species-level diagnoses are presented. A revised phylogenetic definition for Marsupialia is proposed. Numbigilga ernielundeliusi, a bunodont metatherian from the early Pliocene of northeastern Queensland, is described, and the distribution of bunodont dental characters within Metatheria is reviewed. An overview of Gondwanan metatherian biogeography is presented. It is argued that current evidence supports only limited dispersal of metatherians between South America and Australia during the Late Cretaceous or early Palaeogene, and that this was largely due to dispersal barriers (climatic and environmental) present within the Antarctic mainland. Future priorities for a better understanding of metatherian evolution and the origin of the modern Australian marsupial fauna are discussed...|$|R
25|$|When any {{of these}} tests is positive, CT {{scanning}} of the adrenal gland and MRI of the pituitary gland are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary adenomas or incidentalomas (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). Scintigraphy of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary. Occasionally, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary (<b>petrosal</b> sinus sampling) is necessary. In many cases, the tumors causing Cushing's disease are less than 2mm in size and difficult to detect using MRI or CT imaging. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing's disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery.|$|E

Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are maxillary nerves (from the trigeminal nerve).|$|E
2500|$|The lacerum segment, or C3, {{is a short}} segment {{that begins}} above the foramen lacerum and ends at the petrolingual ligament, a {{reflection}} of periosteum [...] between the lingula and petrous apex (or <b>petrosal</b> process) of the sphenoid bone. The lacerum portion is still considered 'extra-dural', as it is surrounded by periosteum and fibrocartilage along its course. The vidian artery arises from the lacerum segment, though it is often {{too small to be}} angioraphically visible. It is erroneously stated in several anatomy text books that the internal carotid artery passes through the foramen lacerum. This at best has only ever been a partial truth in that it passes through the superior part of the foramen {{on its way to the}} cavernous sinus. As such it does not traverse the skull through it. The inferior part of the foramen is actually filled with fibrocartilage. The broad consensus is that the internal carotid artery should not be described as travelling through the foramen lacerum.|$|E
