5|$|On {{his return}} from the United States, Mézières visited the offices of Pilote {{magazine}} to see René Goscinny and Jean-Michel Charlier. Goscinny <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work on L'extraordinaire et Troublante Aventure de Mr. August Faust (The Extraordinary and Troubling Adventure of Mr August Faust), written by Fred. This {{would be the first}} serialised strip that Mézières would work on. Due to the lack of artistic freedom he was given (because Fred's script came with all the strip panels already blocked out), Mézières found this a difficult assignment.|$|E

25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

In response to Liu Feng's petition, Liu Bei instructed the executioners to expel Liu Feng and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> death.

25|$|The {{original}} ending, {{preferred by}} Raimi and Campbell themselves, {{is one in}} which Ash is shown being placed in a cave and given a potion which will <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sleep for centuries. Echoing his experience in botching the recovery of the Necronomicon, Ash mishandles the specific instructions for the potion, accidentally taking an extra dose after a momentary distraction makes him lose count. Ash awakes and arises from his cave to find himself in a post-apocalyptic future, in which the city of London is in ruins.|$|E

At one point he killed two men on separate occasions due to altercation during their card games.|$|E
25|$|Lowe left Rice with {{a degree}} in {{electrical}} engineering and was assigned to the General Electric Company (GE)’s training facility at Schenectady, New York. GE had formed an Air Conditioning Department at Bloomfield, New Jersey in 1932, and Lowe was transferred there after completing training at Schenectady. The management <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work at selling and overseeing the installation of large commercial units in the region just south of the Great Lakes.

25|$|Briefly, Saxo's {{version of}} Hamlet's history is as follows: Gervendill, {{governor}} of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, {{on his return}} from a Viking expedition {{in which he had}} slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; she bore him a son, Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime {{for no other reason than}} to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be an imbecile, but the suspicion of Feng <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden (like Polonius in Shakespeare's play), in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage.|$|E
25|$|Masters is also partly {{responsible}} for the career of gay adult film director Chi Chi LaRue. LaRue had come to California in 1987 and gotten a job in Catalina's sales department. He had been promoted to the promotions department, and sought a directing job. Masters, however, refused to give him one. LaRue left Catalina in 1989, moving to InHand Productions and Vivid Video. Catalina president Mike Merrick left and new studio head Christian Mann took over. Mann rehired LaRue, and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work on his first film, Billboard (starring Joey Stefano). LaRue credits Masters with forcing him to learn more about directing, which led to his eventual directorial career.|$|E

25|$|Senator Max Baucus is {{a popular}} Democrat in Montana, {{representing}} {{a state that has}} long been fairly Republican but also is receptive to Democrats in state and local elections. President Bush won Montana by more than 20 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Montana also has a popular Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and a newly elected Democratic junior senator, Jon Tester. Baucus was not expected to face a significant challenge from the 85-year-old Republican nominee, Bob Kelleher, who surprised observers by winning the June 3 Republican primary despite supporting a number of positions that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the political left of Baucus, such as nationalization of the American oil and gas industry.|$|E
25|$|During {{his last}} years in Gaul, Caesar rightly feared the senate might <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> trial for his {{breaches}} of law {{while he was}} consul. He therefore aimed to run for consul once again without having to enter {{the city as a}} private man (privatus). To do this, the senate needed to allow him to run for the office in absence (in absentia), a matter promoted by his loyal tribune of the plebs, Gaius Scribonius Curio (the younger). Following fierce debates {{over the course of the}} year 50 BC, a minority of the senate party had symbolically handed Pompey a sword on 1 December 50, in a plea that he would raise an army to defend Rome against Caesar, should the latter attack the city when his demands were not met.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in New York, Mark goes {{straight}} to Rose's building, where he meets Carol (Alida Valli), the concierge, {{and some of}} the residents, including a nurse (Veronica Lazar) who cares for elderly Professor Arnold (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr.), a wheelchair-bound mute. Mark encounters the sickly Countess Elise De Longvalle Adler (Daria Nicolodi), who tells him that Rose has disappeared. After the two find blood on the carpet outside Rose's room, Mark follows the stains. He becomes ill and falls unconscious. Elise sees a black-robed figure dragging Mark away, but the figure suddenly stops and gives chase to Elise. The figure eventually finds her swarmed with rabid cats in a room and stabs her to death. Mark staggers to the house's foyer where Carol and the nurse <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E

60|$|That {{afternoon}} {{many of the}} Indians visited Isaac in his {{lodge and}} shook their fists at him and pointed their knives at him. They hissed and groaned at him.

25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E
25|$|After the coup, Takafusa {{invited the}} younger brother of Ōtomo Sōrin, Haruhide, as {{the new head of}} the Ōuchi clan since this was promised to the Ōtomo in order to gain their support. Ōtomo Haruhide hence became known as Ōuchi Yoshinaga, but Sue Takafusa (known as Sue Harukata after the coup) {{remained}} the one pulling the strings behind the scenes. This arrangement alienated his co-conspirators, since they only agreed that Yoshitaka be overthrown in favour of his son. Now that both were dead, Sue Harukata placed the blame on Sugi Shigenori and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> death. Apprehensive of further purges by Harutaka, Naitō Okimori went into retirement and died in 1554. Mōri Motonari bided his time until 1554, when he declared that the emperor ordered him to punish those who killed Yoshitaka, and rebelled against the nominal Ōuchi government. Sue Harukata was driven to suicide by his defeat at the hands of Motonari in the Battle of Itsukushima in 1555, and in 1557 Ōuchi Yoshinaga followed. The Mōri came to possess the Ōuchi lands in western Honshu hereafter.|$|E
25|$|In 485 Zeno sent a fresh army {{against the}} rebels, which {{was said to}} have {{consisted}} of Macedonians and Scythians (Tillemont speculates, not unreasonably, that these were Ostrogoths) under John the Hunchback, or, more probably, John the Scythian, and Theodoric the Amal, who was at this time consul. John defeated the rebels near Seleucia (which town of that name is not clear, perhaps the Isaurian Seleucia) and drove them into the fort of Papurius where he blockaded them. In this difficulty Trocondus attempted to escape and gather forces for their relief, but was taken by the besiegers and put to death. Illus and Leontius were ignorant of his fate, and, encouraged by Pamprepius who gave them assurances of Troconcus's return and of ultimate victory, held out with great tenacity for over three years. In the fourth year the death of Trocondus was discovered, and Illus, enraged at the deceit practised on him by Pamprepius, <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> death. The fort was soon after taken by the treachery of Trocondus's brother-in-law, who had been sent for the purpose from Constantinople by Zeno, and Illus and Leontius were beheaded (488) and their heads sent to the emperor.|$|E
