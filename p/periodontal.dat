5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the <b>periodontal</b> ligament, causing <b>periodontal</b> pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a <b>periodontal</b> abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve <b>periodontal</b> pockets around a tooth, and <b>periodontal</b> pockets cause {{eventual}} pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a <b>periodontal</b> abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the pulp}} and <b>periodontal</b> {{ligament}} have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex {{tends to be}} poorly localized, whereas pain from the <b>periodontal</b> ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E
5|$|For instance, the <b>periodontal</b> {{ligament}} {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and <b>periodontal</b> pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The <b>periodontal</b> {{ligament}} is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, <b>periodontal,</b> {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. <b>Periodontal</b> pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes the {{replacement}} was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had <b>periodontal</b> disease, with half of these containing caries. The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths.|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, <b>periodontal</b> disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the alveolar tooth-bearing bone is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the teeth in place and requiring a <b>periodontal</b> regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to <b>periodontal</b> problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
5|$|The diets of {{the wealthy}} were rich in sugars, which {{promoted}} <b>periodontal</b> disease. Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies {{of many of the}} upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence. Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human <b>periodontal</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and <b>periodontal</b> disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from <b>periodontal</b> ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>periodontal</b> {{ligament}} becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term <b>periodontal</b> conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where <b>periodontal</b> disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The <b>periodontal</b> ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or <b>periodontal</b> abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and <b>periodontal</b> abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and <b>periodontal</b> disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no <b>periodontal</b> ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Rigorous plaque control {{programs}} {{along with}} <b>periodontal</b> scaling and curettage also {{have proved to}} be helpful, although according to the American Dental Association, <b>periodontal</b> scaling and root planing are considered as a treatment for <b>periodontal</b> disease, not as a preventive treatment for <b>periodontal</b> disease. In a 1997 review of effectiveness data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found clear evidence showing that toothpaste containing triclosan was effective in preventing gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|In {{five percent}} of cases, {{advanced}} periodontitis or gum inflammation between {{the second and third}} molars precipitates the removal of wisdom teeth. Among patients with retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth, roughly 25% have gum infections (<b>periodontal</b> disease). Teeth with <b>periodontal</b> pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of <b>periodontal</b> disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or <b>periodontal</b> disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or <b>periodontal</b> disease. <b>Periodontal</b> probing depths increase over time to greater than 4mm in a significant proportion of young adults with retained impacted wisdom teeth which is associated with increases in serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and C-reactive protein.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{from the}} dental {{follicle}} {{give rise to}} the <b>periodontal</b> ligament (PDL). Specific events leading {{to the formation of}} the <b>periodontal</b> ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and permanent teeth and among various species of animals. Nonetheless, formation of the <b>periodontal</b> ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and cementum. This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The occlusion, which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of <b>periodontal</b> ligament. This perpetual creation of <b>periodontal</b> ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.|$|E
25|$|Food {{can also}} become stuck between the wisdom tooth and the tooth in front, termed food packing, and cause acute {{inflammation}} in a <b>periodontal</b> pocket when the bacteria become trapped. A <b>periodontal</b> abscess may even form by this mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} held current {{theory is that}} while several forces might be {{involved}} in eruption, the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments provide the main impetus for the process. Theorists hypothesize that the <b>periodontal</b> ligaments promote eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{intensive}} {{oral hygiene}} care {{has been shown}} to improve gingival health in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. <b>Periodontal</b> destruction is also slowed down due to the extensive oral care. Intensive oral hygiene care (oral health education plus supra-gingival scaling) without any <b>periodontal</b> therapy improves gingival health, and may prevent progression of gingivitis in well-controlled diabetes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the seven}} {{destructive}} <b>periodontal</b> diseases as listed in the 1999 classification.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is {{initiated by}} Gram-negative tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a host response, {{which results in}} bone and soft tissue destruction. In response to endotoxin derived from <b>periodontal</b> pathogens, several osteoclast-related mediators target the destruction of alveolar bone and supporting connective tissue such as the <b>periodontal</b> ligament. Major drivers of this aggressive tissue destruction are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other osteoclast-derived enzymes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Periodontal</b> {{disease and}} tooth loss are {{associated}} with an increased risk, in male patients, of cancer.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that <b>periodontal</b> disease {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.|$|E
25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to periodontitis – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a <b>periodontal</b> pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the <b>periodontal</b> pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E
25|$|Gingivitis is a {{category}} of <b>periodontal</b> disease {{in which there is}} no loss of bone but inflammation and bleeding are present.|$|E
