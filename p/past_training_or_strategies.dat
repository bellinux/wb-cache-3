40|$|Background. Falls {{are common}} and {{disabling}} {{in people with}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). There {{is a need to}} quantify the effects of movement rehabilitation on falls in PD. Objective. To evaluate 2 physical therapy interventions in reducing falls in PD. Methods. We randomized 210 people with PD to 3 groups: progressive resistance strength training coupled with falls prevention education, movement strategy training combined with falls prevention education, and life-skills information (control). All received 8 weeks of out-patient therapy once per week and a structured home program. The primary end point was the falls rate, recorded prospectively over a 12 month period, starting from the completion of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were walking speed, disability, and quality of life. Results. A total of 1547 falls were reported for the trial. The falls rate was higher in the control group compared with the groups that received strength <b>training</b> <b>or</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>training.</b> There were 193 falls for the progressive resistance strength training group, 441 for the movement strategy group and 913 for the control group.

5000|$|Probably {{the last}} use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat {{was made by}} the Portuguese Army in the war in Angola during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an {{experimental}} horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern Angola, in which each soldier was armed with a G3 assault rifle for combat on foot and with an automatic pistol to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to motor vehicles and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no <b>training</b> <b>or</b> <b>strategy</b> to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the [...] "Dragoons of Angola". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with airmobile forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from helicopter in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.|$|R
40|$|The study {{tried to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of experimental educational projects, supposed {{to fill the gap}} between lower vocational training (LBO) and lower secondary education (MAVO) on the one side and middle vocational <b>training</b> (MBO) <b>or</b> skilled employment on the other side.

Main criteria for evaluation were: 1. selection of pupils: do the projects attract and select the people they were set up for? 2. the fit between the education <b>or</b> <b>training</b> offered and labour market demands. A four point panel survey design was used in order to monitor school career and job career of 961 pupils, split in 2 year-groups (cohorts).

40|$|Dyspnea {{has been}} found to be an {{independent}} predictor of mortality among patients with respiratory diseases and is often regarded as a difficult symptom to control in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Previous studies have found an association of psychological and physiological factors with dyspnea among patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases. However, symptom management of hospitalized patients with ILDs has been hampered by difficulty in priority, since they are often admitted with multiple psycho-physiological needs. This study examined the prevalence of dyspnea and the psycho-physiological factors associated with it among hospitalized Chinese patients with ILDs. We studied 165 hospitalized patients with ILDs recruited consecutively over three months in a public hospital in Guangzhou, China. Dyspnea and common psycho-physiological factors, including cough symptoms, activity capacity, lung function, physical and mental health status, and anxiety and depression symptoms, were measured. By ordered logistic regression, level of dyspnea statistically significantly affected performance in a six-minute walk test and physical functioning in work or other regular daily activities in hospitalized patients with ILDs. Respiratory rehabilitation with an appropriate intensity of exercise <b>training</b> <b>or</b> other <b>strategies</b> for enhancing the physical functioning of this population with moderate and severe levels of dyspnea should be prioritized...|$|R

Thirteen rugby league players were assessed for salivary-free T and C concentrations across 5 training workouts performed 3 - 4 days before a competitive game. The game outcomes included wins and losses and game-ranked performance (1 - 5) {{based on the number}} of points scored, the points differential, and a coach rating. Data were pooled across the winning (n = 3) and losing (n = 2) outcomes. Pooled free T concentrations (absolute and relative changes) were significantly (p < 0. 01) elevated across those workouts that preceded winning games, but not the losses, and the relative (percent) T changes were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher before winning (30. 9 %) than before losing (3. 4 %). Both outcomes were associated with workout decreases in pooled free C concentrations and the relative C changes were not significantly different between wins (222. 9 %) and losses (225. 6 %). In conclusion, the free T responses to selected training workouts showed some association with subsequent winning (being elevated) and losing (no change) during a limited number of competitive games in professional rugby league. Speculatively, the free T responses to a midweek workout might provide an early sign of team readiness to compete or to recovery state, thereby providing a novel format for implementing <b>training</b> <b>or</b> management <b>strategies</b> to improve the competition outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes that}} the {{regulatory}} institutions have {{imposed on the}} Italian school system over the last decades may actually result in contradictory effects at the individual and organizational levels: resistance or indifference {{on the one hand}} and <b>training</b> <b>or</b> coping <b>strategies</b> on the other. The paper focuses on the impact of such changes on teachers, as professional workers within public schools and individual participants of change. The paper refers to psychosocial training as a coping strategy, analysing how school teachers deal with work-related stress, and what impact a training intervention might have on some individual dimensions. Subsequently, in the longitudinal study presented, we analysed whether the training intervention conducted was effective in terms of learning and change. The case under consideration is a primary school located in the South of Italy, and the participants in the training and research were 92 female teachers. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the designed and applied training programme, we measured how some important psychological dimensions have changed over time: self-efficacy, job satisfaction and interpersonal strain. According to a sociological learning approach, the results suggest the effectiveness of training programmes as enablers of change and solutions to some change paradoxes; when they respond to the identified needs, they are based on practical activities that require a collective participation, they focus on social relationships and processes and the knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. In the school context, the psychosocial training might represent a solution, if not a prevention strategy, for change management...|$|R

We tested whether the development of academic writing skills can also be effectively supported by <b>training</b> single <b>strategies</b> <b>or</b> even combined <b>strategies.</b> As metacognition is an important skill for advanced and adult learners, we focused in this study on the benefit of combined cognitive strategies with and without a metacognitive strategy. An experiment including three conditions was conducted (N = 60 German-speaking psychology undergraduates, M= 22. 8, SD= 4. 4), which lasted for three hours.

In addition, all participants wrote an abstract of an empirical article.
