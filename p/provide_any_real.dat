As the only being of his kind, he has no one to relate to and feels {{the need to be}} understood or have some connection. Grendel has a complex relationship with the humans who hate and fear him. He feels that he is somehow related to humanity and despite his desire to eat them, he can be moved by them and their works. His long life grants him the ability to act as a witness to how their lives transpire and their behavior and logic bewilders him. He is cursed to a life of solitude, also being portrayed as having eternal life, which furthers his plight and loneliness as he can only fall in battle and he is immune to all human weapons. He is only freed from his tormented life through his encounter with Beowulf.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues surrounding this peace process is whether the Palestinian Authority in fact met its obligations to promote tolerance. There is specific evidence that the Palestinian Authority actively funded and supported many terrorist activities and groups. Palestinians stated that any terrorist acts stemmed from Israel not having conceded enough land and political power to win support among ordinary Palestinians. Israelis stated that these acts of terrorism were because the Palestinian Authority openly encouraged and supported incitement against Israel, and terrorism. There was increasing disagreement and debate among Israelis {{about the amount of}} positive results and benefits produced by the Oslo process. Supporters said it was producing advances leading to a viable Palestinian society which would promote genuine acceptance of Israel. Opponents said that concessions were merely emboldening extremist elements to commit more violence in order to win further concessions, without <b>providing</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> acceptance, benefits, goodwill, or reconciliation for Israel in return.|$|R

In the new program, course selection would be done throughout the year, in order to respond better to private sector demand.|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} of this thesis is to advance the understanding of perceived value {{in the context of}} branded apps. By understanding what type of value consumers seek from branded apps helps companies decide what type of app features to include when designing branded apps. Branded apps are a highly potential channel for customer engagement but without <b>providing</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> value to users they are non-effective marketing channel. Methodology This study includes two phases. First factor analysis is run, as the purpose is to identify different types of value dimensions that are appropriate when deriving value from branded apps. The second part of the study focuses on examining whether there are any differences between product categories when evaluating the importance of each value dimension. Thus, multivariate analysis of variance is used in {{the second phase of the}} study. Findings The findings of the study suggests that the type of value sought from branded apps can be divided into five dimensions (social, utilitarian, convenience, monetary and intrinsic enjoyment) and the impact of product category on the importance of value dimensions is only moderate. Altogether functional values were considered the most important ones across different product categories, which implies that branded apps are mainly used for functional purposes...|$|R

In particular, we show that if α has degree d it is possible to take ϵ = 2 ^[d/ 2]/M(A(x)). On the other hand using asymptotic estimates for Toeplitz determinants we show that for sufficiently large m we cannot have ϵ-density if ϵ is a fixed number strictly smaller than 1 /M(A(x)). As a byproduct of the proof we obtain a result of independent interest about the structure of the -module of integral linear recurrences of fixed length determined by a non-monic polynomial.

By analyzing the quadratic phase error (QPE), this paper demonstrates that Earth¿s curvature influences the defocusing degree of multipath returns.
