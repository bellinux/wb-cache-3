5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as <b>piscicide</b> for fishing.|$|E
5|$|In the United States it was {{imported}} {{very early}} in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and <b>piscicide</b> properties. By 1818, it had begun spreading so much that Amos Eaton thought it was a native plant. In 1839 it was already reported in Michigan and in 1876, in California. It is now found commonly in all the states. In Canada, it is most common in the Maritime Provinces as well as southern Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, with scattered populations in between.|$|E
2500|$|Pesticides are {{substances}} that {{are meant to}} control pests or weeds. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, [...] insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, <b>piscicide,</b> avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer. The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use. Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European {{inhabitants}} and fish species declines probably related to logging and overgrazing, Martis Creek was an important year-round fishery for the Washoe people. Fishery resources included Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi) (LCT) and a variety of smaller species, such as sucker and chub. In June 1978 the California Department of Fish and Game stocked LCT in Martis Creek Reservoir, after reducing non-native resident trout using <b>piscicides.</b> This stocking attempt was unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview {{on the use of}} chemicals in seven countries in Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Laos PDR, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam), with an emphasis on coastal shrimp aquaculture and inland carp farming systems. The data come primarily from a recently completed survey of aquaculture farms in Asian countries conducted under the ADB/NACA Regional Study and Workshop on Aquaculture Sustainability and Environment. The issues discussed include the types and uses of chemicals in shrimp and carp culture, farm management practices and use of chemicals, hazards and adverse impacts associated with chemical use, alternative approaches to chemical use, and research recommendations. In inland carp farming, apart from lime and fertilizers, which are unlikely to give rise to any significant negative environmental impact, the overall use of chemicals is extremely low. <b>Piscicides</b> are used in some countries to control predators prior to stocking of ponds, but the use of antimicrobials and disease-control chemicals is limited to a small percentage (< 5 %) of producers. Most small-scale producers, who dominate aquaculture production in these countries, simply do not have the resources or need for such chemicals. The situation is similar in shrimp culture, with lime and fertilizers, followed by <b>piscicides,</b> being the most common chemicals used. The use of antimicrobials increases with intensification in shrimp culture, and these chemicals are mostly used in more intensive shrimp farming. In both shrimp and carp culture, promotion of â€œprimaryâ€� health management practices probably offers greatest scope for prevention of aquatic animal disease outbreaks and the need for chemical use...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the use of chemotherapeutants and other {{chemicals}} and drugs in Indian aquaculture is presented. A large number of products are used for various purposes such as soil and water treatments, disinfectants, <b>piscicides,</b> herbicides, organic and inorganic fertilizers, feed additives, therapeutants, and anesthetics. Farm management techniques for the use of chemicals are discussed, as are the hazards posed by, and impacts resulting from chemical use. Other approaches to disease prevention (crop holiday, pond preparation, regulating stocking density, effluent treatment systems) are considered, and national regulations on the use of chemicals in aquaculture and current research being conducted in India are summarized. Recommendations for the improved use of chemicals in Indian aquaculture are provided for farmers, government and aquaculture institutions, the chemical industry, regional and international agencies, and research institutions...|$|R
30|$|Post-establishment, {{the broad}} range of {{invasive}} species and the ecosystems they become established in, and the heterogeneous ways that humans value those ecosystems, means that few generalizations can be given for management and policy. That is, appropriate management and policy for harmful invasive species is highly context dependent. Options include poisoning (e.g. herbicides, pesticides, <b>piscicides),</b> manual removal (e.g. pulling plants), capturing and killing (e.g. trapping, shooting), and release of additional species that may provide biological control of the invader. As the applications of these methods are context dependent, and because different countries within Europe have different standards for the application of these methods, they are not explored further here. The general principle of prevention still applies, however, and efforts to slow or eliminate population spread will often be the most cost-effective ways to reduce total impacts.|$|R
40|$|With {{attractive}} prawn {{export prices}} {{and the availability of}} hatchery fry and commercial feeds, Philippine aquaculture has experienced a shift from milkfish to prawn Penaeus monodon and an intensification from traditional and extensive prawn culture to higher stocking densities. This paper features the results of a survey of intensive prawn farms (n = 21) in Western Visayas and Northern Mindanao conducted in 1990. Average farm size, production, feeding and water management are described. To solve the self-pollution characteristic of intensive ponds, the farms utilized some 40 chemical and biological products; at least another 35 were available in the market {{at the time of the}} study. These include therapeutants and disinfectants, soil conditioners, bacteria-enzyme preparations, algicides and <b>piscicides,</b> plankton growth promoters, and feed additives.

40|$|Michigan {{contains}} {{a number of}} medium- to large-sized warmwater rivers, some of which attract significant angler attention. Nearly all of these presently have good-to-excellent water quality and {{have the potential to}} be high quality fishery and recreational resources. Riverine fishes are very difficult to sample with conventional methods. Spot sampling with rotenone has proven to be effective tool (Seelbach et al. 1994). Rotenone samples reveal not only presence/absence of all species – both of sport and conservation interest – but also provide a true picture of relative numbers in the fish community. Periodic rotenone surveys are recommended for complete inventories of warmwater river fish communities and for monitoring the status of these communities through time. Rotenone surveys are not intended to provide annual population estimates. Rotenone and other fish toxicants are valuable fisheries tools but must be used very judiciously to avoid over-kill of fish.

40|$|Combating {{the spread}} of {{invasive}} fish is problematic, with eradication rarely possible and control options varying enormously in their effectiveness. In two small impoundments in north-eastern Australia, an electrofishing removal program was conducted to control an invasive tilapia population. We hypothesised that electrofishing would reduce the population density of Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique tilapia), to limit the risk of downstream spread into areas of high conservation value. We sampled by electrofishing monthly for 33 months. Over this period, there was an 87 % decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of mature fish, coupled with a corresponding increase of 366 % {{in the number of}} juveniles, suggesting a density-dependent response in the stock–recruitment relationship for the population. Temperature was inversely related to CPUE (r = 0. 43, lag = 10 days), implying greater electrofishing efficiency in cooler months. The reduction in breeding stock is likely {{to reduce the risk of}} spread and render the population vulnerable to other control measures such as netting and/or biological control. Importantly, the current study suggests routine electrofishing may be a useful control tool for invasive fish in small impoundments when the use of more destructive techniques, such as <b>piscicides,</b> is untenable...|$|R
40|$|Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters 1852) {{are native}} to the eastward flowing rivers of central and {{southern}} Africa but from the early 1930 s they have been widely distributed {{around the world for}} aquaculture and for biological control of weeds and insects. While O. mossambicus are now not commonly used as an aquaculture species, the biological traits that made them a popular culture species including tolerance to wide ranging ecological conditions, generalist dietary requirements and rapid reproduction with maternal care have also made them a 'model' invader. Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970 s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages. It is thought that intentional translocations are likely to be the most significant factor in their spread in Australia. The ecological and physical tolerances and preferences, reproductive behaviour, hybridization and the high degree of plasticity in the life history traits of O. mossambicus are reviewed. Impacts of O. mossambicus on natural ecosystems including competitive displacement of native species, habitat alteration, predation and as a vector in the spread of diseases are discussed. Potential methods for eradicating or controlling invasive populations of O. mossambicus including physical removal, <b>piscicides,</b> screens, environmental management and genetic technologies are outlined...|$|R
50|$|Ancient {{remains of}} spears, hooks and fishnet {{have been found}} in ruins of the Stone Age. The people of the early civilization drew {{pictures}} of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the upper bills of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and plant thorns. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or sometimes with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. Ancient fishing nets were rough in design and material but they were amazingly, as if some now use (Parker 2002). Literature on the indigenous fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the Solomon Islands. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from New Caledonia (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. Tribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212, King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant <b>piscicides,</b> and by the 15th century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974).
