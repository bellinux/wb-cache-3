A loss-of-coolant-accident is one condition where heat transport pumps {{play a major role}} in the safe shut down of the reactor. They must operate under adverse conditions of low suction pressure and two-phase flows for at least 17 minutes. Analytical methods and model testing are no longer acceptable to show this capability. The heat transport pumps for a new reactor have been qualified by full-scale testing under simulated field conditions. The test?s scope covered both vibration and pressure pulsation behavior of the pump under low suction pressures and two-phase flow conditions. Despite high vibrations, shaft runouts and high pressure pulsations during the loss-of-coolant accident tests, the <b>pump</b> <b>bearing,</b> mechanical <b>seal,</b> and motor <b>bearings</b> performed without any significant damage.

40|$|Friction, wear, and {{lubrication}} {{have direct}} influence on performance, reliability, and service life of mechanical systems with moving components. The useful life {{of these systems}} and their efficiency can be improved by improving the surface properties/ performance at sliding interfaces. Further, the usage of materials for sliding systems is limited in extreme environments, such as high temperature, and space, etc., due to their limited surface properties. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a new class of composites with superior surface properties, i. e., low friction and high wear resistance for extreme environmental conditions. Alumina, a well understood material for its tribological performance, is a merit choice for applications where high wear resistance is required, such as <b>pump</b> <b>bearings,</b> <b>seal</b> rings, valve seats, piston components, gears, cutting tool inserts and artificial joints. We propose to develop a novel alumina based ceramic composite to enhance its surface and tribological properties using a powder compaction technique. The newly developed composites will be characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope (FTIR), Optical microscope, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM), Goniometer and Surface profilometer. In-situ formation of high temperature stable phases, effect of sintering temperature, and percentage of reinforcement on phase formation will be studied. Investigation of effect of sintering temperature and percentage of reinforcement on density, porosity, and grain size will be conducted. The composites will be characterized for their tribological properties (friction and wear). The mechanisms for modified friction and wear will be proposed. The process parameters and compositions will be optimized. XRD results confirmed the formation of Al 18 B 4 O 33, and AlB 2 and FTIR confirmed the presence of B 2 O 3. Increase in sintering temperature and wt % of boron affected the porosity, grain size, and hardness of the composites. The coefficient of friction was lower for the composites compared to pure alumina ceramic. The coefficient of friction decreased with increase in sintering temperature. The wear mechanism was found to be micro-fracture using ESEM and SEM studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the shape optimization {{process for the}} automotive wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> lip using the finite {{element method and the}} response surface method. First, to predict performance of the <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> lip, we used the non-linear finite element analysis. And then, we compared the analysis results with the test results to verify the finite element model. The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the seal lip and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of seal lip, such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference. Finally, within limited design parameters, we suggeste...|$|R
