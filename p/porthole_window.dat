Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4. These were eventually used by Amtrak for the [...] "Adirondack" [...] train and then by the Mass Bay Transit Authority before being sold to Mexico.|$|E

50|$|At about 19:00 local time, {{the nearby}} Sedco 706 {{experienced}} a large rogue wave which damaged some items on deck and caused {{the loss of}} a life raft.

Ocean Ranger reported experiencing storm seas of 55 ft, with the odd wave up to 65 ft, thus leaving the unprotected portlight at 28 ft above mean sea level vulnerable to wave damage. Some time after 21:00, radio conversations originating on Ocean Ranger were heard on Sedco 706 and Zapata Ugland, noting that valves on Ocean Rangers ballast control panel appeared to be opening and closing of their own accord. The radio conversations also discussed the 100 kn winds and waves up to 65 ft high. Through the remainder of the evening, routine radio traffic passed between Ocean Ranger, its neighbouring rigs and their individual support boats. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted.|$|E
