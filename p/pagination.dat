25|$|The usual {{system for}} making unique {{references}} to {{sections of the}} text by Plato derives from a 16th-century edition of Plato's works by Henricus Stephanus. An overview of Plato's writings according to this system {{can be found in}} the Stephanus <b>pagination</b> article.|$|E
25|$|The first {{complete}} {{edition of the}} Babylonian Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg 1520–23 {{with the support of}} Pope Leo X. In addition to the Mishnah and Gemara, Bomberg's edition contained the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot. Almost all printings since Bomberg have followed the same <b>pagination.</b> Bomberg's edition was considered relatively free of censorship.|$|E

25|$|Formatting {{differences}} in Algerian manga productions derive {{in part from}} assumptions held by publishers about the expectations of their readership. The colorized, left-to-right formatting of Kaza emphasizes the historical connection between Algerian artists and Franco-Belgian graphic traditions, easing the reader from a familiar style into narrative plots and iconography inspired by Japanese shōnen manga which might otherwise seem alienating. In contrast, Z-Link's publications follow the emerging interest of Algerian readers in cultural models outside of Europe. Works in this spirit strictly follow the aesthetic formalisms of Japanese manga, including right-to-left <b>pagination,</b> stereotyped facial features such as oversized doe-eyes, caricatured facial emotions, and expressive dialogue bubbles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} life Coningsby {{suffered}} many difficulties. He was a widower, without any male heir, and subject to innumerable lawsuits. For some severe reflections on Lord Harcourt, the Lord Chancellor, in connection with these legal worries, he was, as Swift notes in his diary, committed to the Tower of London on 27 February 1720. Coningsby's troubles in law arose from his purchase of the manors of Leominster and Marden. After elaborate investigations, he convinced himself that the lord's rights had in many instances been trespassed upon by the copyhold tenants. He caused ejectments to be brought against many persons for being in possession of estates as freehold which he claimed to be copyhold, and as these claims were resisted by the persons in possession, his last days were embittered by constant strife. His collections concerning Marden were printed in 1722–7 in a bulky tome, without any title-page, and with <b>pagination</b> of great irregularity, but were never published. When his right to the Marden property was disputed, all the copies of this work but a few were destroyed. Through his sharpness of temper he was exposed to the caustic sallies of Atterbury in the House of Lords, and to the satires of Swift and Pope in their writings.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} former FT journalists {{have gone on}} to {{high-profile}} jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson, previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of The Times and is now the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Will Lewis, a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the FT, is the current editor of the Daily Telegraph. Dominic Lawson went on to become editor of the Sunday Telegraph until he was sacked in 2005. Andrew Adonis, a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the House of Lords after the 2005 election. Ed Balls became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in July 2007. Bernard Gray, a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the Times Educational Supplement. David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper's transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page <b>pagination</b> in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.|$|E

2500|$|A {{page number}} in the Vilna Talmud refers to a {{double-sided}} page, known as a daf, or folio in English; each daf has two amudim labeled [...] and , sides A and B (Recto and Verso). The convention of referencing by daf is relatively recent and dates from the early Talmud printings of the 17th century, though the actual <b>pagination</b> {{goes back to the}} Bomberg edition. Earlier rabbinic literature generally refers to the tractate or chapters within a tractate (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1, [...] ). It sometimes also refers to the specific Mishnah in that chapter, where [...] "Mishnah" [...] is replaced with [...] "Halakha", here meaning route, to [...] "direct" [...] the reader to the entry in the Gemara corresponding to that Mishna (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1 Halakha 1, [...] would refer to the first Mishnah of the first chapter in Tractate Berachot, and its corresponding entry in the Gemara). However, this form is nowadays more commonly (though not exclusively) used when referring to the Jerusalem Talmud. [...] Nowadays, reference is usually made in format [...] (e.g. Berachot 23b, [...] ). Increasingly, the symbols [...] "." [...] and [...] ":" [...] are used to indicate Recto and Verso, respectively (thus, e.g. Berachot 32:, [...] These references always refer to the <b>pagination</b> of the Vilna Talmud.

2500|$|A 204-page appendix, {{written in}} 1784, is {{found at the}} end of Vol. 10. It does not have its own title page, but merely follows with <b>pagination</b> {{continuing}} from 8996 to 9200. The appendix introduces articles on Entomology, Ichthyology, Weather, Hindus (spelled Gentoos), and others, and contains many new biographies, including one of Captain James Cook. It curiously contains 25 new pages on Air, which give very little new information about air itself, but mainly cover hot air ballooning, one of Tytler's hobbies. The first page of the supplement begins with the words [...] "Appendix containing articles omitted and others further explained or improved, together with corrections of errors and of wrong references." [...] The appendix also includes 10 plates, namely CCCXIV to CCCXXIII.|$|E
2500|$|Usually {{the paper}} is divided into {{sections}} for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with <b>pagination</b> prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing editorials written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called [...] "op-eds" [...] written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and columns that express the personal opinions of columnists, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw data of the news into information telling the reader [...] "what it all means" [...] and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no byline; these articles are written by staff writers.|$|E
2500|$|In a pre-Feist case, West's {{citation}} copyright claim {{had been}} affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit {{in a preliminary}} injunction case in 1986 brought by West against Mead Data, owner of Lexis. West v. Mead (1986); however, in a case commenced in 1994 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found Feist to have undermined the reasoning in West v. Mead. [...] West's citation claims were challenged in 1994 by legal publisher, Matthew Bender & Company and by a small CD-Rom publisher HyperLaw, Inc. HyperLaw intervened, joining Matthew Bender in the citation challenge and separately challenging West's text copyright claims. [...] West was found by the Second Circuit in 1998 {{not to have a}} protectable copyright interest in its citations; neither to the first page citations nor to its internal <b>pagination</b> citations. [...] See Matthew Bender [...] v. West, [...] Citation Appeal. [...] The Second Circuit thereby rejected the 1996 determination of a Minnesota district court in Oasis Publishing Co. v. West Publishing Co., 924 F.Supp. 918 (D. Minn. 1996), that the outcome of West is not changed by Feist.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the first edition, a more ambitious second edition was begun in 1776, with the {{addition}} of history and biography articles. Smellie declined to be editor, principally because he objected to the addition of biography. Macfarquhar took over the role himself, aided by pharmacist James Tytler, M.A., who was known as an able writer and willing to work for a very low wage. Macfarquhar and Bell rescued Tytler from the debtors' sanctuary at Holyrood Palace, and employed him for seven years at 17 shillings per week. Tytler wrote many science and history articles and almost all of the minor articles; by Robert Burns' estimate, Tytler wrote over three-quarters of the second edition. Compared to the 1st edition, the second had five times as many long articles (150), including [...] "Scotland" [...] (84 pages), [...] "Optics" [...] (132 pages), and [...] "Medicine" [...] (309 pages), which had their own indices. The second edition was published in 181 numbers from 21 June 1777 to 18 September 1784; these numbers were bound into ten volumes dated 1778–1783, having 8,595 pages and 340 plates again engraved by Andrew Bell. A <b>pagination</b> error caused page 8000 to follow page 7099. Most of the maps of this edition (eighteen of them) are found in a single 195-page article, [...] "Geography".|$|E
2500|$|He {{spent four}} years researching The District Gazetteers of British India: A Bibliography, which was tied in with a {{large-scale}} attempt by the International Documentation Company to publish on microfilm the censuses, gazetteers and reports of the British colonial period. It was that company which published his work in 1970. He noted that there were around 1300 gazetteers produced by the British in India between 1822 and 1947, when the country gained independence. Intended for administrative use {{as well as for}} the general public, they can only loosely be described as systematic and they were not all published by government bodies. The methods, styles, and formats of compilation varied even within districts. His bibliography, which included brief histories of how their compilation evolved and attempts to identify the myriad of authors and editors, is arranged by province or its administrative equivalent and, according to a review by N. Gerald Barrier, [...] "surmounts substantial organisational problems" [...] and is a [...] "painstaking study". Barrier was critical of some aspects of the work, citing as examples the omission of a substantially revised gazetteer for Amritsar and also the lack of information relating to <b>pagination</b> or publication, other than date. Barrier also notes that the completeness of the work was marred because Scholberg may not have had access to S. B. Chaudhuri's History of the Gazetteers, which had been published in 1965.|$|E
