He wished also to be out of Lord Etherington's debt, feeling galled under a sense of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation,</b> which hindered his speaking his mind to him fully upon the subject of his flirtation with Lady Binks, which he justly considered as an insult to his family, considering the footing on which the Earl seemed desirous to stand with Clara Mowbray. From these obligations a favourable evening might free him, and Mowbray was, in fact, indulging in a waking dream to this purpose, when Jekyl interrupted him. His untimely warning only excited a spirit of contradiction, and a determination to show the adviser how little he was qualified to judge of his talents; and in this humour, his ruin, which was the consequence of that afternoon, was far from seeming to be the premeditated, or even the voluntary work of the Earl of Etherington.|$|E

George carried the pompous supplies to his mother and the shattered old widower whom it was now the main business of her life to tend and comfort.

Wordsworth had, as I may truly say, forced on me a hundred pounds, in the event of my going to Madeira; and Stuart had kindly offered to befriend me. During the days and affrightful nights of my disease, when my limbs were swollen, and my stomach refused to retain the food--taken in in sorrow, then I looked with pleasure on the scheme: but as soon as dry frosty weather came, or the rains and damps passed off, and I was filled with elastic health, from crown to sole, then the thought of the weight of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation</b> from so many people reconciled me; but I have broken off my story.|$|E

The need {{would not have been}} so pressing, probably, had he not felt that Lily would be more comfortable with Mrs. Thorne than in his lodgings in Sackville Street. Lily had at first declared that she would return with him, but everybody had protested against this. Emily Dunstable had protested against it very stoutly; Mrs. Dale herself had protested against it by letter; and Mrs. Thorne's protest had been quite imperious in its nature. [...] "Indeed, my dear, you'll do nothing of the kind. I'm sure your mother wouldn't wish it. I look upon it as quite essential that you and Emily should learn to know each other." [...] "But we do know each other; don't we, Emily?" [...] said Lily. [...] "Not quite well yet," [...] said Emily. Then Lily had laughed, and so the matter was settled. And now, on this present occasion, Mr. Dale was at Mrs. Thorne's house for the last time. His conscience had been perplexed about Lily's horse, and if anything was to be said it must be said now. The subject was very disagreeable to him, and he was angry with Bernard because Bernard had declined to manage it for him after his own fashion. But he had told himself so often that anything was better than a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation,</b> that he was determined to speak his mind to Mrs. Thorne, and to beg her to allow him to have his way. So he waited till the Harold Smiths were gone, and Sir Raffle Buffle, and then, when Lily was apart with Emily,--for Bernard Dale had left them,--he found himself at last alone with Mrs. Thorne.|$|E
6000|$|When our born solitary, wearied of Paris {{and half}} {{afraid of the}} too {{friendly}} importunity of Geneva, at length determined to accept Madame d'Epinay's offer of the Hermitage on conditions which left him an entire sentiment of independence of movement and freedom from all sense of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation,</b> he was immediately exposed to a very copious torrent of pleasantry and remonstrance from the highly social circle who met round D'Holbach's dinner-table. They deemed it sheer midsummer madness, or even a sign of secret depravity, to quit their cheerful world for the dismal solitude of woods and fields. [...] "Only the bad man is alone," [...] wrote Diderot in words which Rousseau kept resentfully in his memory {{as long as he}} lived. The {{men and women of the}} eighteenth century had no comprehension of solitude, the strength which it may impart to the vigorous, the poetic graces which it may shed about the life of those who are less than vigorous; and what they did not comprehend, they dreaded and abhorred, and thought monstrous in the one man who did comprehend it. They were all of the mind of Socrates when he said to Ph√¶drus, [...] "Knowledge is what I love, and the men who dwell in the town are my teachers, not trees and landscape."[252] Sarcasms fell on him like hail, and the prophecies usual in cases where a stray soul does not share the common tastes of the herd. He would never be able to live without the incense and the amusements of the town; he would be back in a fortnight; he would throw up the whole enterprise within three months.[253] Amid a shower of such words, springing from men's perverse blindness to the binding propriety of keeping all propositions as to what is the best way of living in respect of place, hours, companionship, strictly relative to each individual case, Rousseau stubbornly shook the dust of the city from off his feet, and sought new life away from the stridulous hum of men. Perhaps we are better pleased to think of the unwearied Diderot spending laborious days in factories and quarries and workshops and forges, while friendly toilers patiently explained to him the structure of stocking looms and velvet looms, the processes of metal-casting and wire-drawing and slate-cutting, and all the other countless arts and ingenuities of fabrication, which he afterwards reproduced to a wondering age in his spacious and magnificent repertory of human thought, knowledge, and practical achievement. And it is yet more elevating to us to think of the true stoic, the great high-souled Turgot, setting forth a little later to discharge beneficent duty in the hard field of his distant Limousin commissionership, enduring many things and toiling late and early for long years, that the burden of others might be lighter, and the welfare of the land more assured. But there are many paths for many men, and if only magnanimous self-denial has the power of inspiration, and can move us with the deep thrill of the heroic, yet every truthful protest, even of excessive personality, against the gregarious trifling of life in the social groove, has a side which it is not ill for us to consider, and perhaps for some men and women in every generation to seek to imitate.|$|E

60|$|But {{besides the}} benefit reaped by the issuers, or by others through them, {{at the expense}} of the public generally, there is another unjust gain {{obtained}} by a larger class‚Äînamely, by those who are under fixed <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligations.</b> All such persons are freed, by a depreciation of the currency, from a portion of the burden of their debts or other engagements; in other words, part of the property of their creditors is gratuitously transferred to them. On a superficial view it may be imagined that this is an advantage to industry; since the productive classes are great borrowers, and generally owe larger debts to the unproductive (if we include among the latter all persons not actually in business) than the unproductive classes owe to them, especially if the national debt be included. It is only thus that a general rise of prices can be a source of benefit to producers and dealers, by diminishing the pressure of their fixed burdens. And this might be accounted an advantage, if integrity and good faith were of no importance to the world, and to industry and commerce in particular.|$|R

5000|$|The real {{interest}} {{of his work}} lies, first, in the incidental glimpses it affords all through {{of the history of}} his own time; next and more particularly, in the information he has preserved concerning the struggle over the Priscillianist heresy, which disorganized and degraded the churches of Spain and Gaul, and particularly affected Aquitaine. The sympathies here betrayed by Severus are wholly those of St. Martin. The bishop had withstood Maximus, who ruled for some years {{a large part of the}} western portion of the empire, though he never conquered Italy. He had reproached him with attacking and overthrowing his predecessors. on the throne, and for his dealings with the church. Severus loses no opportunity for laying stress on the crimes and follies of rulers, and on their cruelty, though he once declares that, cruel as rulers. could be, priests could be crueller still. This last statement has reference to the bishops who had left Maximus no peace till he had stained his hands with the blood of Priscillian and his followers. Martin, too, had denounced the worldliness and greed of the Gaulish bishops and clergy. Accordingly we find that Severus, in narrating the division of Canaan among the tribes, calls the special attention of ecclesiastics to the fact that no portion of the land was assigned to the tribe of Levi, lest they should be hindered in their service of God. [...] "Our clergy seem", he says, [...] "not merely forgetful of the lesson but ignorant of it, such a passion for possessions has in our days fastened like a pestilence on their souls". We here catch a glimpse of the circumstances which were winning over good men to monasticism in the West, though the evidence of an enthusiastic votary of the solitary life, such as Severus was, is probably not free from exaggeration. Severus also fully sympathized with the action of St. Martin touching Priscillianism. This mysterious Western, offshoot of Gnosticism had no single feature about it which could soften the hostility of a character such as Martin's, but he resisted the introduction of secular punishment for evil doctrine, and withdrew from communion with those bishops in Gaul, a large majority, who invoked the aid of Maximus against their erring brethren. In this connexion it is interesting to note the account given by Severus of the Council of Rimini in 359, where the question arose whether the bishops attending the assembly might lawfully receive money from the imperial treasury to recoup their travelling and other expenses. Severus evidently approves the action of the British and Gaulish bishops, who deemed it unbecoming that they should lie under <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation</b> to the emperor. His ideal of the church required that it should stand clear and above the state.|$|E
40|$|The real payment {{offer and}} the consignation are legal forms of {{voluntary}} payment, {{which can be}} defined as the manifestation of will of the payment obligation‚Äôs debtor by means of which he executes, on his own initiative and in kind the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligation</b> undertaken, regardless of whether the obligational legal relation is national or has an extraneity element. In other words, the payment defines that operation by means of which an obligation to issue {{a certain amount of money}} to the creditor is voluntarily executed by the debtor, in view of terminating the obligational legal relation, with or without extraneity element. Still, the debtor must resort to the institution of the real payment offer and consignation only if he is faced with the creditor‚Äôs reticence in receiving the payment or he is in a fortuitous impossibility to accept it. The reason why the lawmaker made such an institution available to the debtor is given by the fact that the creditor‚Äôs refusal to accept payment may be due to his intention to charge penalties on the debtor for his late payment. Even in the situation when the creditor would be in a fortuitous impossibility to receive the payment, this fact cannot create an advantageous situation for him, in relation to the debtor of the payment obligation, person from whom he can ask penalties for the delayed making of the payment...|$|E

He had to solicit from the ministers certain forms of office, which were to render his sign-manual effectually useful; and these, though they could not be denied, were delayed in such a manner, as to lead Nigel to believe there was some secret opposition, which occasioned the demur in his business. His own impulse was, to have appeared at Court a second time, with the king's sign-manual in his pocket, and to have appealed to his Majesty himself, whether the delay of the public officers ought to render his royal generosity unavailing. But the Lord Huntinglen, that good old peer, who had so frankly interfered in his behalf on a former occasion, and whom he occasionally visited, greatly dissuaded him from a similar adventure, and exhorted him quietly to await the deliverance of the ministers, which should set him free from dancing attendance in London.|$|R

The paper is focused on the enforcement of private, <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligations.</b> Execution procedure and all described institutes are observed from the entitled person's point of view, particularly with regard to her fundamental effort to satisfy her claim. The thesis also deals with the entitled person's options to face the obliged person's means of defense, especially deferral and discontinuance of the execution. The aim is to evaluate the current legislation's adjustment of the position of the entitled person and to try to suggest possibilities of change which could provide more effective execution for the entitled person while preserving the obliged person's rights. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first one presents the position of the topic in the system of law and introduces the subject and the characteristic of the main terms: the execution and the entitled person.

6000|$|I {{have become}} {{impressed}} {{with the belief that}} the act approved March 2, 1867, entitled [...] "An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States," [...] is productive of more evil than good at this time. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but, if this is not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously questioned that those portions of said act providing for what is called involuntary bankruptcy operate to increase the financial embarrassments of the country. Careful and prudent men very often become involved in debt in the transaction of their business, and though they may possess ample property, if it could be made available for that purpose, to meet all their liabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money, they may be unable to meet all their <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligations</b> as they become due, in consequence of which they are liable to be prostrated in their business by proceedings in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditors. People are now so easily alarmed as to monetary matters that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor will necessarily embarrass, and oftentimes accomplish the financial ruin, of a responsible business man. Those who otherwise might make lawful and just arrangements to relieve themselves from difficulties produced by the present stringency in money are prevented by their constant exposure to attack and disappointment by proceedings against them in bankruptcy, and, besides, the law is made use of in many cases by obdurate creditors to frighten or force debtors into a compliance with their wishes and into acts of injustice to other creditors and to themselves. I recommend that so much of said act as provides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of the suspension of payment be repealed.|$|R

They must fund all amounts fixed and structural part of the amount of Revolving Fund (the circulating assets of mining subsided with the debts). Determining the optimal size of capital is an issue of the utmost importance in the financial management of the company, as a possible insufficiency of resources influences long-term solvency, liquidity and return it. Over the long term, the goal of any business is to get a sufficient return on capital invested. Creating a company, maintaining the market position and its economic growth requires resources to ensure optimal deployment, to development activities. Creation and operation of a society is not possible in the absence of the capital which can be considered a set of resources likely to provide future revenue streams. ...|$|E

She spoke of her as you might speak of some young person of genius--in want of encouragement and patronage. It may be that Isabel's a genius; but in that case I've not yet learned her special line. Mrs. Ludlow was especially keen about my taking her to Europe; they all regard Europe over there as a land of emigration, of rescue, a refuge for their superfluous population.

The thing had been easily done, for Sherringham had said: [...] "Oh we must have a sitting-room for our studies, you know, and I'll settle it with the landlady," [...] Mrs. Rooth had liked his [...] "we"--indeed she liked everything about him--and he saw in this way that she heaved with no violence under <b>pecuniary</b> <b>obligations</b> so long as they were distinctly understood to be temporary. That he should have his money back with interest as soon as Miriam was launched was a comfort so deeply implied that it only added to intimacy. The window stood open on the little balcony, and when the sun had left it Peter and Miriam could linger there, leaning on the rail and talking above the great hum of Paris, with nothing but the neighbouring tiles and tall tubes to take account of. Mrs. Rooth, in limp garments much ungirdled, was on the sofa with a novel, making good her frequent assertion that she could put up with any life that would yield her these two conveniences. There were romantic works Peter had never read and as to which he had vaguely wondered to what class they were addressed--the earlier productions of M.

She had always a greasy volume tucked under her while her nose was bent upon the pages in hand. She scarcely looked up even when Miriam lifted her voice to show their benefactor what she could do. These tragic or pathetic notes all went out of the window and mingled with the undecipherable concert of Paris, so that no neighbour was disturbed by them. The girl shrieked and wailed when the occasion required it, and Mrs. Rooth only turned her page, showing in this way a great esthetic as well as a great personal trust.|$|R
