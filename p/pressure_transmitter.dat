40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this article is to measure fluid {{pressure}} drops against the changing velocity on the critical points of the fluid system by using mechatronics equipments and techniques. Critical points of the fluid system to be measured pressure drops are gate valve, globe valve, flow control valve, sudden enlargement, 45 ° or 90 ° junctions etc. Pressure drops occurs mentioned areas much more than other parts of fluid system. Pressure drop is directly concerning with flow rate of fluid. It was used venture-meter and orifice-plate to measure flow rate and fluid velocity in pipe. <b>Pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> were used to measure pressure drops on the critical points of fluid system in according to changing flow rate of fluid. <b>Pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> produce analog signals between 4 - 20 mA in according to changing pressure of fluid in pipe and analog input signals are interpreted through an A/D device, and is originate from pressure sensors. All the received data from <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> are transferred to computer via A/D cards. Received data from <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> is evaluated by using developed program to measure fluid friction losses with changing pressure differences and flow rate, velocity of fluid, Reynolds number, fluid type and some values can be seen on the screen of computer in real time...|$|R

5000|$|The valves input is the [...] "control signal." [...] This {{can come}} {{from a variety of}} {{measuring}} devices, and each different pressure is a different set point for a valve. A typical standard signal is 20-100 kPa. For example, a valve could be controlling the pressure in a vessel which has a constant out-flow, and a varied in-flow (varied by the actuator and valve). A <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter</b> will monitor the pressure in the vessel and transmit a signal from 20-100 kPa. 20 kPa means there is no pressure, 100 kPa means there is full range pressure (can be varied by the transmitters calibration points). As the pressure rises in the vessel, the output of the transmitter rises, this increase in pressure is sent to the valve, which causes the valve to stroke downward, and start closing the valve, decreasing flow into the vessel, reducing the pressure in the vessel as excess pressure is evacuated through the out flow. This is called a direct acting process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − The {{measurement}} of the differential pressure is widely employed in the petrol industry for determining the flow rate, level, blockage of filters and the oil-water interface. The calibration of the differential pressure transmitters is usually made at atmospheric pressure, since there is little concern about the static pressure influence on the transducer performance. As a main contribution, this paper presents a calibration methodology of differential pressure transmitters. The ranges of the studied static pressure (from 0 to 20000 kPa) and differential pressure (from 40 to 250 kPa) cover Petrobras production and exploration operating conditions. To achieve the results, a pressure amplification device was developed and used at each port of the <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Thus, during the calibration of a <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter,</b> the pressure differential at the transmitter ports is deduced from the measured value at nearly atmospheric pressure and the amplification factor. The uncertainty of the results was estimated and the methodology {{was used for the}} calibration of a <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter,</b> showing that its calibrating curve varies with the operating pressure...|$|E
