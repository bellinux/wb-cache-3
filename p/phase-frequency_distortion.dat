50|$|In signal processing, phase {{distortion}} or <b>phase-frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> is distortion, that is, {{change in the}} shape of the waveform, that occurs when (a) a filter's phase response is not linear over the frequency range of interest, that is, the phase shift introduced by a circuit or device is not directly proportional to frequency, or (b) the zero-frequency intercept of the phase-frequency characteristic is not 0 or an integral multiple of 2Ï€ radians.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{object is}} {{the phase of}} frequency distortions in VF channels. The aim is to develop and investigate the discrete measurement methods of phase distortions by the mathematical modelling of objects and also to develop and investigate the principles for hardware realization of the PFD meter in the VF channel has been substantiated. The new algorithms for PFD measurement have been proposed. The measurement error evaluation {{at the expense of}} the channel noises, non-linear distortions and harmonic interferences has been performed. The algorithmic procedure for discovery and measurement of the <b>phase-frequency</b> <b>distortions</b> in VF channels permitting to use more widely the digital engineering possibilities for measurement automation of the transmission system parameters and methods of its hardware realization has been proposedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
