Despite efforts to engage youth in education, there have been only modest improvements in the rates of school completion across OECD countries since the mid- 1990 s.

Using data from three cohorts of the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth and duration models that control for unobserved heterogeneity, this paper 2 ̆ 7 s results suggest <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> encourage an early return to study and <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> develop post-school career plans may be more effective than <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> concentrate on improving numeracy and literacy scores.
