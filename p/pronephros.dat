For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or <b>pronephros)</b> and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E
5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the <b>pronephros</b> in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} envaginations form {{a series}} of transverse tubules each of which communicates {{by means of a}} funnel-shaped ciliated opening with the abdominal cavity, {{and in the course of}} each duct a glomerulus also is developed. A secondary glomerulus is formed ventral to each of these, and the complete group constitutes the <b>pronephros.</b> In humans, the <b>pronephros</b> is just rudimentary, and undergoes rapid atrophy and disappears.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outer}} part of the {{intermediate}} mesoderm, immediately under the ectoderm, in the region from the fifth cervical segment to the third thoracic segment, a series of short evaginations from each segment grows dorsally and extends caudally, fusing successively from before backward to form the pronephric duct. This continues to grow caudally until it opens into the ventral part of the cloaca; beyond the <b>pronephros</b> it is termed the Wolffian duct. Thus, the Wolffian duct is {{what remains of the}} pronephric duct after the atrophy of the <b>pronephros.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm. Kidney development, {{also called}} nephrogenesis, proceeds {{through a series}} of three successive developmental phases: the <b>pronephros,</b> mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|The urinary and {{reproductive}} organs are {{developed from the}} intermediate mesoderm. The permanent organs of the adult are preceded {{by a set of}} structures which are purely embryonic, and which {{with the exception of the}} ducts disappear almost entirely before the end of fetal life. These embryonic structures are on either side; the <b>pronephros,</b> the mesonephros and the metanephros of the kidney, and the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts of the sex organ. The <b>pronephros</b> disappears very early; the structural elements of the mesonephros mostly degenerate, but the gonad is developed in their place, with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the Müllerian as that of the female. Some of the tubules of the mesonephros form part of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|The renal corpuscles and renal tubules, in contrast, are {{developed}} from the metanephrogenic blastema instead of from the ureteric bud. The metanephrogenic blastema is moulded over the growing end of the latter, and becomes {{a part of the}} metanephros in this way. The renal tubules of the metanephros, unlike those of the <b>pronephros</b> and mesonephros, do not open into the Wolffian duct. Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting duct system derived from the ultimate ramifications of the ureteric bud. In the other end, the renal tubules give rise to Bowman's capsules and glomeruli.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the adult}} female: [...] <b>Pronephros</b> disappears. [...] The Mullerian duct, the oviduct. [...] Mesonephros and Metanephros, the kidney, and their {{unseparated}} [...] ducts, the ureters.|$|E

60|$|Section 27. So far, the {{essential}} {{differences between the}} development of fowl and frog, the meroblastic segmentation, absence of a typical gastrula, and the primitive streak, seem comprehensible {{on the theory that}} such differences are due to the presence of an enormous amount of yolk. Another difference that appears later is that, while the tadpole has an efficient <b>pronephros,</b> the fowl, which has no larval (free imperfect) stages in its life history, has the merest indication of such a structure.|$|E
60|$|Figure 3. A {{generalized}} {{diagram of}} the uro-genital organs.-- All references in text. Ms., the mesonephros, is the epididymis in the male, and is reduced in the female; Ms.d., its duct, is the vas deferens in the male, and persists only as the urinary receptacle in the female. Mt. and Mt.d., the metanephros and metanephric duct, become the functional kidney and ureter in both sexes. G. is the gonad (reproductive gland), and M.L. the animal's middle line (median plane). -Ps.-, [Pr.,] the <b>pronephros,</b> is never developed in the Dog-fish; P.d., its supposed duct, is the oviduct of the female, and is suppressed in the male.|$|E
60|$|Section 34. With the {{exception}} of the reduction of the <b>pronephros,</b> what has been said of the development of the frog's nervous system, renal and reproductive organs, and skeleton, applies sufficiently to the fowl for our present purposes. The entire separation of Wolffian and Mullerian ducts {{from the very beginning of}} development is here beyond all question (vide Section 18). But the notochord in the fowl is not so distinctly connected with the hypoblast, and so distinct from the mesoblast, as it is in the lower type, and no gills, internal or external, are ever developed. The gill slits occur with a modification due to the slitting and flattening out of the embryo, already insisted upon; for, whereas in the tadpole they may be described as perforations, in the fowl they appear as four notches between ingrowing processes that are endeavouring to meet in the middle line.|$|E
60|$|Section 39. In its later development, {{the general}} facts already enunciated {{with regard to}} the organs of frog and fowl hold, and where frog and fowl are stated to differ, the rabbit follows the fowl. In the {{circulation}} the left fourth vascular arch (second branchial) gives rise to the aortic arch; in the right the corresponding arch disappears, except so much of it as remains as the innominate artery. The azygos vein (Chapter 3) -is a vestige of- [is derived from] the right posterior cardinal sinus. Both pulmonary arteries in the rabbit are derived from the left sixth vascular arch (= fourth branchial). Compare Section 32. The allantois altogether disappears in the adult fowl; in the adult mammal a portion of its hollow stalk remains as the urinary bladder, and the point where it left the body is marked by the umbilicus or navel. The umbilical arteries become the small hypogastric arteries {{on either side of the}} urinary bladder. There is no trace of a <b>pronephros</b> at all in the rabbit.|$|E
60|$|Section 19. Figure 3, Sheet 17, is a {{generalized}} {{diagram of the}} uro-genital organs in the vertebrata; M.L. is the middle line of the body, G. is the genital organ, Pr. is the <b>pronephros,</b> or fore kidney, a structure which is never developed in the dog-fish, but which has functional importance in the tadpole and cod, and appears as a transitory rudiment in the chick. A duct, which is often spoken of as the pronephric duct (p.d.), and which we have figured under that name, is always developed. Anteriorly it opens into the body cavity. It is also called the Mullerian duct, and in {{the great majority of}} vertebrata it becomes the oviduct, uniting with its fellow, {{in the case of the}} dog-fish, ventral to the oesophagus. In the male it usually disappears; the uterus masculinus of the rabbit is still very generally regarded as a vestige of it. Kolliker has shown, however, that this interpretation is improbable. Ms. is the mesonephros, some or all of which becomes the epididymis in the male of types possessing that organ, and is connected with G. by the vasa efferentia. Mt., the metanephros, is, in -actual fact- [the frog], indistinguishably continuous with Ms., and is the functional kidney, its duct (metanephric duct) being either undifferentiated from the mesonephric (as is the case with the frog) or largely split off from it, as in the dog-fish, to form the ureter.|$|E
60|$|Section 18. The {{origin of}} the renal organ and duct has very {{considerable}} controversial interest.* In Figure 13, Sheet 22, a diagrammatic cross-section, of an embryo is shown. I. is the intestine, coe. the coelom, s.c. the spinal cord; n.c. the notochord, surrounded by n.s., the notochordal sheath, ao. is the dorsal aorta. In the masses of somatic mesoblast on either side, a longitudinal canal appears, which, in the torpedo, a fish related to the dog-fish, and in the rabbit, and possibly in all other cases, is epiblastic in origin. This is the segmental duct, which persists, apparently, as the Wolffian duct (W.D.). Ventral to this appears a parallel canal, the Mullerian duct (M.D.), which {{is often described as}} being split off from the segmental duct, but which is, very probably, an independent structure in the frog. A number of tubuli, at first metamerically arranged, now appear, each opening, on the one hand, into the coelom by a ciliated mouth, the nephrostome (n.s.), and on the other into the segmental duct. These tubuli are the segmental tubes or nephridia. There grows out from the aorta, towards each, a bunch, of bloodvessels, the glomerulus (compare Section 62, Rabbit). These tubuli ultimately become, in part, the renal tubuli, so that the primitive kidney stretches, at first, {{along the length of the}} body cavity from the region, of the gill-slits backward. The anterior part of the kidney, called the <b>pronephros,</b> disappears in the later larval stages. Internal to the kidney on either side there has appeared a longitudinal ridge, the genital ridge (g.r.), which gives rise to testes or ovary, as the case may be.|$|E
50|$|In earlier {{conceptions of}} kidney biology, the nephrotome was {{a section of}} the {{mesoderm}} that gives rise to the <b>pronephros</b> and eventually {{to the rest of the}} kidney. Older texts describe the <b>pronephros</b> as forming through the fusion of multiple nephrotomes.|$|E
5000|$|... {{vestiges of}} the future kidney, the <b>pronephros</b> briefly appears.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the kidney proceeds {{through a series of}} successive phases, each marked by the {{development of}} a more advanced kidney: the <b>pronephros,</b> mesonephros, and metanephros. The <b>pronephros</b> is the most immature form of kidney, while the metanephros is most developed. The metanephros persists as the definitive adult kidney.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} envaginations form {{a series}} of transverse tubules each of which communicates {{by means of a}} funnel-shaped ciliated opening with the abdominal cavity, {{and in the course of}} each duct a glomerulus also is developed. A secondary glomerulus is formed ventral to each of these, and the complete group constitutes the <b>pronephros.</b> In humans, the <b>pronephros</b> is just rudimentary, and undergoes rapid atrophy and disappears.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pronephros</b> {{develops}} in the cervical {{region of the}} embryo.During approximately day 22 of human gestation, the paired pronephri appear towards the cranial end of the intermediate mesoderm. In this region, epithelial cells arrange themselves {{in a series of}} tubules called nephrotomes and join laterally with the pronephric duct. This duct is fully contained within the embryo and thus cannot excrete filtered material outside the embryo; therefore the <b>pronephros</b> is considered nonfunctional in mammals.|$|E
50|$|Older {{anatomical}} texts {{describe the}} <b>pronephros</b> as condensing from nephrotomes, but modern visualization techniques {{have shown that}} this represents a histological artifact.|$|E

50|$|In {{the outer}} part of the {{intermediate}} mesoderm, immediately under the ectoderm, in the region from the fifth cervical segment to the third thoracic segment, a series of short evaginations from each segment grows dorsally and extends caudally, fusing successively from before backward to form the pronephric duct.

50|$|Once {{the more}} complex {{mesonephros}} forms the <b>pronephros</b> undergoes apoptosis in amphibians. In fishes the nephron degenerates but the organ remains and becomes {{a component of the}} immune system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm. Kidney development, {{also called}} nephrogenesis, proceeds {{through a series}} of three successive developmental phases: the <b>pronephros,</b> mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.|$|E
5000|$|The opisthonephros is the {{functional}} adult kidney in lampreys (cyclostomes), most fishes, and amphibians. It is formed from the extended mesonephros along with tubules from the posterior nephric ridge. The functional embryonic kidney in anamniotes is the <b>pronephros.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern {{visualization}} methods, such as scanning electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, and confocal microscopy, {{combined with}} the simple approach of peeling off the epidermis to see the forming kidney, have shown {{that this is not}} the case. Nephric mesenchyme separates from the intermediate mesoderm as a single elongated primordia. As this primordia begins to undergo epithelialization the anterior portions of the <b>pronephros</b> form rounded protrusions, which then later become the dorsal branches of the <b>pronephros</b> that link to nephrostomes (distinct from nephrotomes). These rounded bumps are probably the structures observed in histological sections that are referred to as nephrotomes. Nephrotomes are not related to nephrostomes, which are thin ciliated funnels that link pronephric nephrons to the coelom.|$|E
50|$|The urinary and {{reproductive}} organs are {{developed from the}} intermediate mesoderm.

The <b>pronephros</b> disappears very early; the structural elements of the mesonephros mostly degenerate, but the gonad is developed in their place, with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the Müllerian as that of the female. Some of the tubules of the mesonephros form part of the permanent kidney.|$|E
50|$|Mutations within PAX2 {{have been}} shown to result in optic nerve colobomas and renal hypoplasia. Alternative {{splicing}} of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Pax2 and Pax8 are also necessary for the formation of the <b>pronephros</b> and subsequent kidney structures. Pax2 and Pax8 regulate the expression of Gata3. Without these genes mutations in the urogenital system arise.|$|E
50|$|In both {{amphibians}} and zebrafish the <b>pronephros</b> has {{a single}} nephron attached to a nephric duct, {{which in turn is}} linked to the cloaca. Although these kidneys have a simple anatomical organization with only a single nephron, the nephrons have a segmental and functional complexity that is very similar to that in more complex kidneys such as mesonephroi and metanephroi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pronephros</b> {{develops}} {{from the}} intermediate mesoderm, {{as do the}} later kidneys. It is a paired organ, consisting of a single giant nephron that processes blood filtrate produced from glomeruli or glomera- large embryonic glomeruli. The filtrate is deposited into the coelom. It then passes through thin ciliated tubules into the pronephric nephron where it is processed for solute recovery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pronephros</b> is {{the first}} in a {{sequence}} of kidneys that form in vertebrate embryos. The pronephric primordium develops from the intermediate mesoderm, lying between the paraxial (somitic) mesoderm and the lateral plate. In many organisms (e.g. amphibians) this primodium forms anteriorly then migrates posteriorly to fuse with the cloaca, while in others it forms {{along the length of the}} intermediate mesoderm (e.g. aritra ghosh)...|$|E
50|$|In mammals a {{functional}} <b>pronephros,</b> {{in the context}} of an organ performing waste excretion or osmoregulation, does not develop. However, a kidney primordium that runs along the intermediate mesoderm does form and links up to the cloaca. This duct is known as the pronephric duct, mesonephric duct or Wolffian duct. While this transient primordium never forms functional nephrons, the duct derived from it is essential to the development of the more complex later kidneys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pronephros</b> {{the most}} basic of the three {{excretory}} organs that develop in vertebrates, corresponding to the first stage of kidney development. It is succeeded by the mesonephros, which in fish and amphibians remains as the adult kidney. In amniotes the mesonephros is the embryonic kidney and a more complex metanephros acts as the adult kidney. Once a more advanced kidney forms, the previous version typically degenerates by apoptosis or becomes part of the male reproductive system.|$|E
50|$|The nephrogenic cords are {{bilateral}} condensations of {{the intermediate}} mesoderm. The cords extend from the cervical segments to the sacral {{segments of the}} embryo. The nephrogenic cords are located on the posterior wall of the embryo, {{which is where the}} kidneys are located. The nephrogenic cords go through three phases of development which overlap to some extent, both in space and in time. The 1st phase is the <b>pronephros,</b> the 2nd phase is the mesonephros and the 3rd and final stage is the metanephros.|$|E
50|$|The organ {{is active}} in adult forms of some {{primitive}} fish, like lampreys or hagfish. It is present at the embryo of more advanced fish and at the larval stage of amphibians where it plays {{an essential role in}} osmoregulation. In human beings, it is rudimentary, appears {{at the end of the}} third week (day 20) and replaced by mesonephros after 3.5 weeks. Despite this transient appearance in mammals, the <b>pronephros</b> is essential for the development of the adult kidneys. The duct of the mesonephros forms the Wolffian duct and ureter of the adult kidney. The embryonic kidney and its derivatives also produces the inductive signals that trigger formation of the adult kidney.|$|E
