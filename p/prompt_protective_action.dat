50|$|The {{extended}} parallel {{process model}} (EPPM) {{is a theory}} that explains how cognitive and emotional mechanisms trigger distinct motivational and coping responses such as fear control and danger control responses. Fear control responses minimize fear through emotional coping that generates reassurance through denial of the threat or derogation of the persuasive message. Fear control {{is a process of}} denial that does not involve physically averting behavior to the perceived threat. Danger control is a cognitive process also oriented towards reducing the presented threat. However, unlike fear control response, danger control response may <b>prompt</b> <b>protective</b> <b>action.</b> Thus according to the extended parallel process model, the experience of fear is considered an emotional reaction, and the perceptions of threat are a set of cognitions. The extended parallel process model differs from many other fear appeal arguments because it suggests that that fear arousal and danger control processes are distinct processes where fear arousal need not precede the danger control process that underpin precautionary behaviors.|$|E

40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>actions</b> in {{response}} to environmental threats can be defined {{by a series of}} stages— detection/warning, psychological preparation, logistical preparation, and <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> selection/implementation. In this formulation, which Lindell and Perry (2004) call the <b>Protective</b> <b>Action</b> Decision Model (PADM), detection is defined by environmental cues received directly from the environment, whereas warning is obtained from authorities, news media, and peers (friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers). Psychological preparation consists of predecisional processes, decision making, and information seeking. The predecisional processes are exposure (being in a position to receive threat information either from the environment or from other persons), attention (noticing the information that is available), and interpretation of the environmental cues or comprehension of the warning messages. Decision making consists of a series of stages of conscious information processing. The first stage is risk identification, which seeks to answer the question “Is there a real threat? ” The second stage is risk assessment, which seeks to answer the question “Do I need to take <b>protective</b> <b>action?</b> ” The third stage, <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> search seeks to answer the question “What can be done to achieve protection? ” The fourth stage, <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> assessment, seeks an answer to the question “What are the merits o...|$|R

Only {{a few studies}} have analyzed risk perception of and <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> to technological threats. Mileti and Peek (2000) reviewed the process of forming perceptions and how this process affects public response to warnings of a nuclear power plant emergency. The authors found that the formation of risk perception is guided by the stimulations, cues, and so on that people secure from their environment (for example, warning information), and that this risk perception formation leads to <b>protective</b> <b>actions.</b> This process is not different than that found for other types of hazard agents (Mileti and Peek 2000).

40|$|During the {{response}} to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) emergency about 50 patients died during or shortly after an evacuation when they were not provided with the needed medical support. In addition, during the FDNPP emergency {{it has been shown that}} there were increases in mortality rates among the elderly due to long term dislocation as a result of evacuation and relocation orders and an inability to stay in areas advised to shelter for extended periods. These deaths occurred even though the possible radiation exposure to the public was too low to result in radiation induced deaths, injuries or a meaningful increase in the cancer rate, even if no <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> had been taken. These problems are not unique to the FDNPP emergency and would be expected if the recommendations of many organizations were followed. Neither the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) nor the U. S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adequately take into consideration in their recommendations and analysis the non-radiological health impact, such as deaths and injuries, that could result from <b>protective</b> <b>actions.</b> Furthermore, ICRP, NRC, EPA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) call for taking <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> at doses lower than those resulting in meaningful adverse radiation induced health effects and do not state the doses at which such effects would be seen. Consequently, it would be impossible for decision makers and the public to balance all the hazards both from radiation exposure and <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> when deciding whether a <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> is justified. What is needed, as is presented in this paper, is a method for developing a comprehensive <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> strategy that allows the public, decision makers and others who must work together to balance the radiological with the non-radiological health hazards posed by <b>protective</b> <b>actions,</b> and to counter the exaggerated fear of radiation exposure that could lead to taking unjustified <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> and adverse psychological, sociological and other effects...|$|R

INTENT The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this regulatory issue summary (RIS) to endorse the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) guidance titled “Range of <b>Protective</b> <b>Actions</b> for Nuclear Power Plant Incidents, April 2005, ” as an acceptable range of early-phase <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> that licensees may use {{in the event of}} a nuclear power plant incident. This RIS requires no action or written response on the part of addressees. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 50. 47 (b) (10), requires, in part, that licensees develop a range of <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> for the public in the plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ). Also, 10 CFR 50. 47 (b) (10) requires that guidelines for the choice of <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, be developed and in place. Section III, “The Final Safety Analysis Report, ” of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 requires that plans for coping with emergencies contain information to provide assurance of coordination among the supporting groups and with the licensee. Therefore, changes to a licensee’s emergency plan related to <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> should be coordinated with the offsite response organizations. In this context, “coordinated ” means that the licensee has contacted offsite response organizations and informed them of the proposed change.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effectiveness of a public relations campaign that, during the 2010 hurricane season, sought to enhance disaster preparedness among two transportation disadvantaged groups in New Orleans: vehicle-less individuals who rely on public transit and individuals with mobility impairments who rely on paratransit. I assessed {{the effectiveness of}} the campaign in two ways. First, drawing from the ideas in the <b>Protective</b> <b>Action</b> Decision Model, I interviewed the transportation disadvantaged in New Orleans to determine whether they were receiving the message of the campaign, paying attention to it, and comprehending it. I also interviewed them to learn if they were engaging in risk identification (recognizing that a disaster threat exists), risk assessment (recognizing that the threat can affect them personally), <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> search (searching for ways to address the threat), <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> assessment (comparing a way to address a threat with other methods), and <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> implementation (taking steps to actually prepare for a disaster). 		 A second way I assessed the campaign was by querying, via email, officials familiar with how the campaign was being run. I asked these officials questions aimed at finding out whether the campaign was being conducted in a way that matched the Excellence Theory of Public Relations??? recommendations on how campaigns should be organized at the program, department, and organizational levels. I also reviewed websites and research reports {{to learn more about the}} campaign. 			 The dissertation???s major findings were as follows. The majority of the transportation disadvantaged in New Orleans were receiving, paying attention to, and comprehending the message of the campaign. However, receiving, paying attention to, and comprehending were not shown to automatically translate into high levels of risk identification, risk assessment, <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> search, <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> assessment, and <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> implementation among the participants. Whether people had experienced a disaster in the past was not found to be a useful predictor of whether people engaged in risk identification, risk assessment, <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> search, protection <b>action</b> assessment, or <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> implementation. 		 In regards to public relations excellence, the campaign was found to exhibit excellence at the program and department levels. At the program level, pre- and post-campaign research was found to be a core part of the campaign. At the departmental level, the campaign was found to possess several characteristics of excellence including staff working in an integrated unit and campaign managers being able report directly to senior executives in the city of New Orleans. At the organizational level, however, the campaign was found to be within an organization that lacked excellence. Although structurally, the city government was organized in a manner to promote excellence, obstacles were found that made excellent public relations difficult. The findings regarding excellence should be treated with caution because participation by leaders familiar with the campaign was limited...|$|R

40|$|Appropriate <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> {{recommendations}} or decisions (PARs/PADs) {{are needed}} to achieve maximum protection of a population at risk. The factors that affect <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> decisions are complex but fairly well documented. <b>Protective</b> <b>action</b> decisions take into account population distributions, projected or actual exposure to a chemical substance, availability of adequate shelters, evacuation time estimates, and other relevant factors. To choose in-place sheltering, {{there should be a}} reasonable assurance that the movement of people beyond their residence, workplace, or school will endanger {{the health and safety of}} the public more so than allowing them to remain in place. The decision to evacuate the public should be based on the reasonable assurance that the movement of people to an area outside of an affected area is in the best interest of their health and safety, and is of minimal risk to them. In reality, an evacuation decision is also a resource-dependent decision. The availability of transportation and other resources, including shelters, may factor heavily in the <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> decision-making process. All strategies to protect the health and safety of the public from a release of hazardous chemicals are explicitly considered during emergency decision making. Each institutional facility (such as hospitals, schools, day care centers, correctional facilities, assisted living facilities or nursing homes) in the community should be considered separately to determine what special <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> may be necessary. Deciding whether to evacuate or to shelter-in-place is one of the most important questions facing local emergency planners responding to a toxic chemical release. That such a complex decision with such important potential consequences must be made with such urgency places tremendous responsibility on the planners and officials involved. Researchers have devoted considerable attention to the evacuation/shelter-in-place protection decision. While several decision aids have been developed, no single approach has achieved widespread acceptance based on validity, utility, and effectiveness (Ujihara 1989, Mannan and Kilpatrick 2000). In the absence of an agreed-upon methodology for making this decision, the best strategy for local emergency planners and officials is a thorough understanding of all the components affecting the decision. This paper summarizes what is currently known about the evacuation/shelter-in-place protection decision and points to available literature that more thoroughly explores the individual components of the decision.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of severe accidents at {{nuclear power plants}} can be limited by various <b>protective</b> <b>actions,</b> including emergency responses and long-term measures, to reduce exposures of affected populations. Each of these <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> involve costs to society. The costs of the long-term <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> depend on the criterion adopted for the allowable level of long-term exposure. This criterion, called the ``long term interdiction limit,`` is {{expressed in terms of}} the projected dose to an individual over a certain time period from the long-term exposure pathways. The two measures of offsite consequences, latent cancers and costs, are inversely related and the choice of an interdiction limit is, in effect, a trade-off between these two measures. By monetizing the health effects (through ascribing a monetary value to life lost), the costs of the two consequence measures vary with the interdiction limit, the health effect costs increasing as the limit is relaxed and the <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> costs decreasing. The minimum of the total cost curve can be used to calculate an optimal long term interdiction limit.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the timing of}} <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> recommendations {{in relationship to the}} distance of wildfire to a threatened community using exploratory map animation. The 2003 Southern California Wildfires were animated to assist in understanding the complex interaction between fire progression and warnings to threatened communities. Exploratory map animation provides a useful post-event analysis platform for hypothesis generation. A new method is introduced for interpolating the distance from a wildfire to a threatened community using geospatial data. The results are used to examine incident commander decision-making in regards to the estimated time of arrival of a wildfire at a community. The exploratory map animations were successful in generating an intriguing hypothesis concerning the timing of <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> recommendations and the proportional distance of a wildfire to a threatened community. Following a wildfire, emergency responders can use exploratory map animation as a training tool to evaluate <b>protective</b> <b>action</b> recommendations of wildfires...|$|R
