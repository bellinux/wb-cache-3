This difficulty is due mainly to the high variability and large geographic distribution of the species, which {{has given rise to}} the description of many synonyms since the species was first described nearly 200 years ago. Botanists have attempted to delimitate the species through various morphological, ecological and genetic methods, though to this date some debate remains as to the placement and description of P. moranensis and its relationship to the species to which it is closely related.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the rowers (108 of the 170 - the zygitai and thalamitai), due to {{the design}} of the ship, were unable to see the water and {{therefore}}, rowed blindly, therefore coordinating the rowing required great skill and practice. It is not known exactly how this was done, but there are literary and visual references to the use of gestures and pipe playing to convey orders to rowers. In the sea trials of the reconstruction Olympias, it was evident that this was a difficult <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve,</b> given the amount of noise that a full rowing crew generated. In Aristophanes' play The Frogs two different rowing chants can be found: [...] "ryppapai" [...] and [...] "o opop", both corresponding quite well to the sound and motion of the oar going through its full cycle.|$|E

There has been much study on human inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A University. Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct. Walking robots {{can be used for}} uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Hybrids too have been proposed in movies such as I, Robot, where they walk on two legs and switch to four (arms+legs) when going to a sprint. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are: ...|$|E

2500|$|Also, the California {{electricity}} {{crisis of}} 2000–2001 caused great financial {{damage to the}} state of California. There is much consternation among the citizens of California regarding Davis's handling of the crisis; see that article for more. The legal issues still were not resolved in time to alleviate California's dire need for electricity, and the state instituted [...] "rolling blackouts" [...] and in some cases instituted penalties for excess energy use. In the recall campaign, Republicans and others opposed to Davis's governance sometimes charge that Davis did not [...] "respond properly" [...] to the crisis. In fact most economists disagree, believing that Davis could do little else—and anyone in the governor's office would have had to capitulate as Davis did, in the absence of Federal help. [...] The Bush administration rejected requests for federal intervention, responding that it was California's <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve.</b> [...] Still, subsequent revelations of corporate accounting scandals and market manipulation by some Texas-based energy companies did little to quiet the criticism of Davis's handling of the crisis.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is little}} {{historical}} evidence {{pertaining to the}} period when the city was founded. Scattered Slavic settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but {{it is unclear whether}} any of them later developed into the city. 8th-century fortifications were built upon a Slavic settlement apparently abandoned some decades before. It is still unclear whether these fortifications were built by the Slavs or the Khazars. If it was the Slavic peoples then it is also uncertain when Kiev fell under the rule of the Khazar empire or whether the city was, in fact, founded by the Khazars. The Primary Chronicle (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling Askold and Dir that they live without a local ruler and pay a tribute to the Khazars in an event attributed to the 9th century. At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for [...] "High Place") was built to defend the area. At some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Kiev fell under the rule of Varangians (see Askold and Dir, and Oleg of Novgorod) and became the nucleus of the Rus' polity. The date given for Oleg's conquest of the town in the Primary Chronicle is 882, but some historians, such as Omeljan Pritsak and Constantine Zuckerman, dispute this and maintain that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion – see the Kievian Letter and Schechter Letter.) Other historians suggest that the Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some Khazar tribes to Hungary. According to these the building of the fortress of Kiev was finished in 840 by the lead of Keő (Keve), Csák and Geréb, the three brothers, possibly members of the Tarján tribe (the three names are mentioned in the Kiev Chronicle as Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, none of them are Slavic names and it has been always a hard <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> their meaning/origin by Russian historians. Their names were put into the Kiev Chronicle in the 12th century and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes).|$|E
