40|$|In typical force {{spectroscopy}} experiments, a small biomolecule {{is attached}} to a soft polymer linker that is pulled with a relatively large bead or cantilever. At constant force, the total extension stochastically changes between two (or more) values, indicating that the biomolecule undergoes transitions between two (or several) conformational states. In this paper, we consider the influence of the dynamics of the linker and mesoscopic <b>pulling</b> <b>device</b> on the force-dependent rate of the conformational transition extracted from the time dependence of the total extension, and the distribution of rupture forces in force-clamp and force-ramp experiments, respectively. For these different experiments, we derive analytic expressions for the observables that account for the mechanical response and dynamics of the <b>pulling</b> <b>device</b> and linker. Possible artifacts arise when the characteristic times of the <b>pulling</b> <b>device</b> and linker become comparable to, or slower than, the lifetimes of the metastable conformational states, and when the highly anharmonic regime of stretched linkers is probed at high forces. We also revisit the problem of relating force-clamp and force-ramp experiments, and identify a linker and loading rate-dependent correction to the rates extracted from the latter. The theory provides a framework for both the design and the quantitative analysis of force spectroscopy experiments by highlighting, and correcting for, factors that complicate their interpretation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an all digital {{push-pull}} linear {{voltage regulator}} is proposed {{that consists of}} a digital error detector, a voltage divider, a mode indicator, a <b>pull</b> <b>device,</b> and grouped push devices. The digital regulator is suitable for super- to near-threshold region operation by providing a variable output voltage that ranges from 0. 5 to 1 V in steps of 0. 1 V. The max-imum load current is 100 mA for every output level. The current efficiency is 99. 8 % with only 164. 5 A quiescent current on UMC 65 -nm standard CMOS technology. A response time constraint is developed to provide a design guideline for (all) the digital control system. It describes the correlation between required speed of the digital control system, the output performance {{and the size of}} the decoupling capacitor. A time interleaving control technique is then proposed to have a tradeoff between output performance, quiescent current, and the size of decoupling capacitor.

40|$|A {{possible}} way to extract {{information about the}} reversible dissociation of a molecular adhe-sion bond from force fluctuations observed in force ramp experiments is discussed. For small loading rates the system undergoes {{a limited number of}} unbinding and rebinding transitions observable in the so-called force versus extension (FE) curves. The statistics of these tran-sient fluctuations can be utilized to estimate the parameters for the rebinding rate. This is relevant in the experimentally important situation where the direct observation of the reversed FE-curves is hampered, e. g. due to the presence of soft linkers. I generalize the stochastic theory of the kinetics in two-state models to the case of time-dependent kinetic rates and compute the relevant distributions of characteristic forces. While for irreversible systems there is an intrinsic relation between the rupture force distribution and the pop-ulation of the free-energy well of the bound state, the situation is slightly more complex if reversible systems are considered. For a two-state model, a ’stationary ’ rupture force distribution that is proportional to the population can be defined and allows to consistently discuss quantities averaged over the transient fluctuations. While irreversible systems are best analyzed in the soft spring limit of small <b>pulling</b> <b>device</b> stiffness and large loading rates, here I argue to use stiff pulling devices. An analysis of the rebinding transitions observed experimentally in the FE-curves is expected to be feasible if the stiffness of the <b>pulling</b> <b>device</b> is used as a control parameter in addition to the loading rate.

40|$|AbstractUsing Langevin modeling, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the experimental setup on the unbinding forces measured in single-molecule pulling experiments. We demonstrate that the stiffness of the <b>pulling</b> <b>device,</b> Keff, may influence the unbinding forces through its effect on the barrier heights for both unbinding and rebinding processes. Under realistic conditions the effect of Keff on the rebinding barrier is shown to play the most important role. This results in a significant increase of the mean unbinding force with the stiffness for a given loading rate. Thus, in contrast to the phenomenological Bell model, we find that the loading rate (the multiplicative value KeffV, V being the pulling velocity) is not the only control parameter that determines the mean unbinding force. If interested in intrinsic properties of a molecular system, we recommend probing the system in the parameter range corresponding to a weak spring and relatively high loading rates where rebinding is negligible...|$|E
