The beta-phase (Mg 17 Al 12) was immediately on top of the AZ 91 E, on top of which was the tau-phase (Mg- 32 (Al,Zn) (49)). Nanoindentation showed that the elastic modulus and hardness of each of the intermetallic compounds was significantly greater than that of the AZ 91 E substrate. Staircase displacement bursts occurred during nanoindentation of the intermetallic compounds, attributed to the combination of incipient plasticity at low loads, and the development of dislocation networks due to dislocation pile ups around the indentation at higher loads. Crystallographic analysis of beta phase orientations using EBSD showed that the nanomechanical properties of the intermetallic compound produced through PPDC treatment were isotropic.

Apparent mass, defined as a ratio of base force to base acceleration, measured showed a significant peak frequency. The longitudinal elastic modulus of the bed was calculated from the data. For shallow beds in which the wall friction is negligible, the peak frequency is independent of the cross-sectional area of the bed and sweep rate, but dependent on the bed height and acceleration. Data generated by the top-cap method agreed reasonably for cases in which the packing state was not sensitive to external force.

40|$|Granulation of poorly wetting powders is {{a common}} problem in the pharmaceutical, {{minerals}} and fertilizer industries. It is usually assumed that good wetting {{is a prerequisite for}} good nucleation. Although this is generally true, robust granulations with poor wetting powders are possible. Recent investigation confirmed that nucleation can occur by spreading of hydrophobic sub-micron particles around the droplet, termed &# 039;solid spreading nucleation&# 039;. Moreover, nuclei formed consist of a consolidated powder shell and an empty core, and have extremely high porosity with adequate strength.

40|$|Powders used in {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) are spread into a compact layer of particles for sintering and {{this process is}} repeated layer by layer to form the final products. Spreading of rod-shaped particles in realistic AM settings is simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the effects of particle shape and operating conditions on the bed quality, characterised by its surface roughness and solid volume fraction. It is discovered that larger particle aspect ratios, Ar, or higher spreader translational velocities result in a lower bed quality, i. e. a larger surface roughness and a smaller volume fraction. The surface roughness increases monotonically with Ar. However, the volume fraction exhibits a maximum at Ar = 1. 5 for randomly <b>packed</b> <b>powder</b> beds that are formed by the roller type spreaders moving at low translational velocities.

40|$|Granulation of {{hydrophobic}} powders {{is frequently}} {{required in the}} pharmaceutical industry. The structural complexity of new drug molecules mean that is increasingly common for entire classes of drug compounds to be highly hydrophobic. This creates considerable difficulty in understanding, controlling and trouble-shooting these industrial granulation processes. There have been many recent advances in granulation theory. Essential to this theory is that wetting and spreading of the fluid through the powder particles {{is a prerequisite for}} good granulation. The possibility of a fine, hydrophobic powder spreading over the surface of the liquid during nucleation has been identified theoretically based on surface chemistry and as a potential nucleation mechanism. Recently, investigation confirmed that nucleation can occur by spreading of the sub-micron particles around the template drop to form a "liquid marble". The hollow granule structure formed by the "solid-spreading" nucleation mechanism suggests the possibility of using the controlled, open granule structure to manufacture designer structured agglomerates with advantageous properties, including controlled granule structure and size and excellent ideal flow and handling properties.
