He immediately declared {{he would have}} no further political involvement until the upper-class establishment {{was removed from the}} Conservative leadership. Although supporting Reginald Maudling, he was cheered by Edward Heath's election in 1965. He knew he would have no chance of a comeback in politics and wrote a book called The Greasy Pole, which laid bare his bitterness with his treatment. He also called for reforms of Parliamentary procedure to reduce the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>week</b> to three days and to sit for only 20 weeks in the year.|$|E
50|$|First Minister's Questions is {{the name}} given to Question Time in the Scottish Parliament, {{in the course of}} which the First Minister of Scotland spends 40 minutes on each Thursday that the {{parliament}} is in session answering questions from Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). There are additional sessions during the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>week</b> at which other ministers are called upon to answer subject-specific and general questions. The present format involves the leader of the largest opposition party asking the First Minister six questions, with the leaders of the two next largest opposition party asking two questions.

40|$|Rob Oakeshott {{still has}} a lot {{he wants to get}} done, he tells Peter Browne in Inside Story• AT THE end of a long <b>parliamentary</b> <b>week,</b> fifteen years after {{he was elected to the}} New South Wales parliament, eight and a half years after he {{resigned}} from the National Party, three years after his switch to federal politics, and a fortnight after Newspoll detected a dramatic drop in his local support, Rob Oakeshott is choosing his words carefully. We’re in his electorate office in the main street of Port Macquarie, which runs parallel to the Hastings River, and he’s talking about the issues raised at a dinner in support of same-sex marriage, which he’d attended earlier in the week. Australian Marriage Equality had won a group of politicians in a charity auction at this year’s parliamentary Midwinter Ball. “There are some issues where I have absolutely no problem challenging my electorate for what I consider to be the greater good,” he says. “Whereas for those social, cultural norms, those community norms, which are less… well, they’re still policy but there’s a bit more of a cultural element, which means that history and tradition and what’s going on in every single house actually matters… I find that harder to get a handle on. On some of those more cultural issues you can go into the roughest pub in this community and I think you wouldn’t be able to pick who stood where… Whereas,” he adds quickly, “if it’s a straight-up policy question like pricing carbon, then in my view there’s the science question, the economic question, and then,” he laughs, “talk as fast as you can…” Read the full article  ...|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{research}} adopts {{an interdisciplinary}} approach {{to answer the}} following research question: to what extent could Members of the European Parliament incorporate social networking tools (SNT) as part of their communication resources in engaging with other actors when carrying out their work as legislators? The methodological framework chosen to conduct this study is exploratory and combines two qualitative methods: elite interviews and observation. Interviews with MEPs and their staff aimed to explore MEPs’ understanding of SNT use, their motivations and their perceived benefits of using SNT when carrying out their work as legislators. Interviews with officials of the EP and members of the European civil society were purposely designed as validating interviews. In total, 29 interviews were conducted in 2011 - 2012. Observation of MEPs’ communication patterns during <b>parliamentary</b> <b>weeks</b> has allowed me to assess, on the one hand their communication patterns from an organisational perspective {{and on the other hand}} the potential for introducing new communicative tools into MEPs’ communicative practices. Observation was conducted with two MEPs and their staff during two weeks each. The theoretical framework of this study relies strongly upon communication network theories and organisational studies that explore the adoption of SNT in the workplace. Based on a grounded theory approach, this exploratory study suggests an emergent model of use of SNT for MEPs in carrying out their legislative work, based on MEPs’ motivations and perceived benefits of using these tools. Findings suggest that there are four domains in which MEPs could use SNT in their legislative functions: to democratise lobbying practices in the EP, to raise their awareness of public opinion, to reshape their relationship with journalists and finally to coordinate their actions as representatives with the European civil society’s. Thus, this study explores the adoption of SNT by elected members of the European Parliament by focusing on their understanding of their use of SNT when carrying out their role as legislators...|$|R

40|$|As I {{was putting}} {{together}} notes for this paper in early May, the newspapers brought home pictures more disturbing than the scholarly books: Iranian judges had ruled for a shutdown of reformist newspapers and {{the arrest of}} their editors, allies of President Khatami. During {{the first round of}} <b>parliamentary</b> elections <b>weeks</b> earlier, reformist groups had won a resounding victory; the court's move was read as a delayed reaction on the part of conservatives. Meanwhile, a world away in Chile, judges were clearing away procedural obstacles to a trial of senator-for-life and former president Augusto Pinochet. It was hard not to think of the situation some years back, when Chile's justices upheld the coup, treated Pinochet as a champion of judicial independence, and declined to act on the widespread human rights violations his government had countenanced. 2 Both these moves are controversial, but their political significance is unmistakable. On what authority does a court take such a course? Are judges answerable for their acts and omissions? Should they be? And to whom would they be accountable? Asking judges to be both independent and accountable would appear to be a contradiction in terms. Judicial independence refers, grosso modo, to a state in which other powers are prohibited from interfering in a case brought before the courts; accountability refers to th...|$|R

Two <b>weeks</b> before the 28 October election, Batkivshchyna withdrew 26 parliamentary candidates in favour of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR); UDAR withdrew 26 of its single-seat candidates in favour of Batkivshchyna candidates, attempting to maximise the opposition vote.Batkivshchyna was a de facto umbrella party in the election, whose election list included members of the Reforms and Order, People's Movement of Ukraine, Front for Change, For Ukraine!, People's Self-Defense, Civil Position and Social Christian parties. In July 2012, members of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People joined the list, known as the Fatherland United Opposition. Front for Change leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk headed the list, because Tymoshenko was imprisoned. The list won 62 seats and 25.55 percent of the vote under the proportional party-list system (down from 30.71 percent in 2007 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc), and another 39 in simple-majority constituencies. Competing in 152 of 225 constituencies,; they won a total of 101 seats, 22.67 percent of the 450 seats in the Verkhovna Rada. The party lost about two million votes, compared with the results of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc in the previous election. Yatsenyuk was temporarily selected leader of this parliamentary faction (also) on 12 December 2012.

40|$|On 27 November 2008 the Sergeant at Arms of the United Kingdom House of Commons, Ms Jill Pay, signed a'consent form' {{to permit}} the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police to search the office of then Conservative Shadow Minister for Immigration, Damian Green, in Portcullis House on the {{parliamentary}} estate. Earlier that day Green had been arrested in his Ashford constituency in Kent. The police had warrants to search his home, his constituency office and his second home in London: they did not seek a warrant to search his <b>parliamentary</b> office. A <b>week</b> earlier a junior civil servant in the Home Office was also arrested and made certain admissions of leaking documents to an MP whom, it was said, had'groomed' him to do so. The actual arrest of Mr Green proved more difficult that first anticipated. Police officers staked out his home {{in a rural area}} of Kent and waited for him to emerge. When after some hours he failed to do so they phoned the then leader of the opposition, David Cameron, to enquire of his whereabouts. They did not tell Cameron, who gave them Green's mobile phone number, that they intended to arrest the MP. Green was at a meeting in his constituency where he was eventually detained at about 1. 50 pm. It transpired that the police had the wrong house under surveillance. Green was informed that he was arrested not pursuant to the Official Secrets Act but on suspicion of an offence under the 18 th century common law crime of'misconduct in public office', (R v Bembridge 1783) which attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Coincidently, on the same day as Green's arrest, Mr Justice Southwell sitting at Kingston Crown Court threw out charges of'aiding and abetting willful misconduct in public office' filed 19 months earlier against Milton Keynes Citizen journalist Sally Murrer. Thames Valley police had alleged that Ms Murrer had induced one of their officers to leak confidential documents to her. Even though the material was described as'incomprehensibly trivial', and had never appeared in print, the police'bugged her phones, ransacked her home and office, confiscated her computers, [...] ., [and] humiliated her with a strip search. She also said that'I was told five times that I would go to prison for life'. Damien Green claimed that he too was similarly threatened by police. The case against Murrer failed because the judge ruled that the police had breached Article 10 of the European Human Rights Charter which protects the right of journalists to freedom of expression from interference from the state. The search of Green's parliamentary office while he was detained elsewhere and questioned by the Metropolitan Police naturally raised serious questions of parliamentary privilege [...] -especially since the police removed from the Palace of Westminster his computer hard drive, phone records and other material that his lawyers claimed were undoubtedly privileged. Also controversial was the police failure to secure a warrant for the parliamentary search. At later parliamentary inquiries officers claimed that they did not need a warrant because they believed that access would be granted, but a very senior officer told a parliamentary committee that it was're-explained to the Sergeant at Arms why they could not seek a warrant, because a magistrate or judge would not give us a warrant because clearly they would believe Parliament would surely agree'. For her part, Ms Pay, while apologizing to MPs for the way the matter was handled, denied that she was'mislead','tricked' or'bamboozled' by the police into signing the consent form, she did say'I think I was pressured'. What is clear was that the interaction among the Sergeant, the Clerk of the House of Commons and Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, was less than adequate. Notably none of them was aware of the existence of a memorandum written by the then Commons Clerk, Sir William McKay, in 2000 which established detailed protocols for police searches on the parliamentary estate and gave the Speaker alone the right to grant permissions and challenge warrants...|$|R
