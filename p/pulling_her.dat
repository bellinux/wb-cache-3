Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked.

25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E

Stratus fought back with a clothesline, and {{attempted}} to remove Wilson's shirt after a suplex. Keibler stopped her, and they attempted to double team, but Stratus performed a double clothesline. Lita tagged in, knocked Wilson off the apron, and removed Keibler's shirt after <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> in. Keibler went outside the ring, and Lita chased after her. This allowed Wilson to stomp on Lita, and Keibler removed her shirt. Lita fought back with a snapmare, and attempted a diving crossbody. Wilson and Stratus tagged in, and performed a clothesline. Wilson fought back, and pulled Stratus up while stepping on her hair. She pulled down her top, but Stratus performed a roll-up, and removed Wilson's pants. Lita and Stratus then performed a Poetry in Motion, with Lita performing an aided clothesline to Wilson, before removing Wilson's shirt.

500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Oh Father" [...] on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with [...] "Live to Tell", {{during the}} second segment of the show. As the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] ended, Madonna, who {{was dressed in a}} clergyman's robe with a crucifix around her neck, and a veil around her head, knelt on a church nave, while incense fumes wafted around her. She started singing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from a confession bench, with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background. In the middle of the song, she started singing [...] "Oh Father" [...] while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest. The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: [...] "One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside." [...] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> back up again, thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E

She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery.

2500|$|After {{his work}} with the {{homeless}} community in New York City and Philadelphia, Wodiczko returned to the possibilities of smaller, personal instruments as conceptual and functional objects to offset the problems of communication for urban migrants. Initially based on the iconic staff of the wandering prophet, the Alien Staff (1992 and its variant, 1992/93) was designed to mediate conversation between aliens (the juridical term designating all immigrants whether of legal or illegal status) and the franchised population of an urban environment. [...] The staff not only presented an object of curiosity to passersby, causing them to interrupt their pace long enough to ask questions, it also became a repository of narrative recording and objects both sacred or necessary (e.g., green cards or family mementoes) {{to the lives of}} the immigrants. Influenced by Julia Kristeva’s Strangers to Ourselves (1991), Wodiczko developed new equipment in 1993 that focused even more directly on democratic speech rights for the performative stranger. Mouthpiece (Porte-parole) was intended to act as a protective zone so that the immigrant could expand her narrative outward into a collective experience thereby <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> out of isolation. [...] The video technology, to be worn over the mouth, makes strange the familiar thereby creating a point of entry for passersby to enter into conversation with the immigrant. Between 1993 and 1997, thirteen culturally displaced persons used variants of the Mouthpiece in Paris, Malmö, Helsinki, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Trélazé, and Angers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{politically}} motivated. Cauchon, although {{a native of}} France, {{had served in the}} English government since 1418, and he was therefore hostile to a woman who had worked for the opposing side. The same was true of the other tribunal members. Ascribing a diabolic origin to her victories would be an effective way to ruin her reputation and bolster the morale of English troops. Thus the decision to involve the Inquisition, which did not initiate the trial and in fact showed a reluctance throughout its duration. Seventy charges were brought against her, including accusations of heresy and dressing as a male (i.e., wearing soldiers' clothing and armor). Eyewitnesses later said that Joan had told them she was wearing this clothing and keeping it [...] "firmly laced and tied together" [...] because the tunic could be tied to the long boots to keep her guards from <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> clothing off during their occasional attempts to rape her. Joan was first condemned to life imprisonment and the deputy-inquisitor, Jean Le Maitre (whom the eyewitness said only attended because of threats from the English) obtained from her assurances of relinquishing her male clothes. However, after four days, during which she was said to have been subjected to attempted rape by English soldiers, she put her soldier's clothing back on because (according to the eyewitnesses) she needed protection against rape. Cauchon declared her a relapsed heretic, and she was burned at the stake two days later on 30 May 1431.|$|E
2500|$|Bella has {{received}} a generally negative reception from critics. Publishers Weekly states that, after her transformation into a vampire, [...] "it's almost impossible to identify with her" [...] in Breaking Dawn. Lilah Lohr of the Chicago Tribune compares Bella's character {{to the story of}} the Quileute wolves and describes it as [...] "less satisfying." [...] During Twilight, Kirkus Reviews stated that [...] "Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character", but that her and Edward's [...] "portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot". In the review of New Moon, Kirkus Reviews said that Bella's personality was [...] "flat and obsessive". Laura Miller of salon.com said, in regards to Edward and Bella, [...] "neither of them has much personality to speak of." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Reese, in her review of Breaking Dawn noted, in regard to Bella, [...] "You may wish she had loftier goals and a mind of her own, but these are fairy tales, and as a steadfast lover in the Disney Princess mold, Bella has a certain saccharine appeal", and that during Bella's pregnancy [...] "she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying, especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant." [...] Washington Post journalist Elizabeth Hand noted how Bella was often described as breakable and that [...] "Edward's habit of constantly <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> onto his lap or having her ride on his back further emphasize her childlike qualities", continuing to write that [...] "the overall effect is a weird infantilization that has repellent overtones to an adult reader and hardly seems like an admirable model to foist upon our daughters (or sons)." [...] Gina Dalfonzo, in an article posted on the National Review website, calls Bella [...] "self-deprecating" [...] before her transformation into a vampire, and afterwards she is [...] "insufferably vain". Dalfonzo also states that Bella gets what she wants and discovers her worth [...] "by giving up her identity and throwing away nearly everything in life that matters." [...] Bella Swan was often compared to Katniss Everdeen on the publication of The Hunger Games.|$|E
