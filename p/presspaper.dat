40|$|Paper {{materials}} {{are used as}} the insulation of power transformers. Over time these materials slowly degrade, until they reach a point when they no longer function effectively as transformer insulation, and the transformer has then reached its end of life. The aging rate of paper is affected by temperature, water, oxygen and acids. Investigations have been performed previously on Kraft and Kraft thermally upgraded types of paper. However, {{a different type of}} paper used in transformer insulation, Grade 3 <b>presspaper</b> (which contains cotton), has not been extensively tested and compared to Kraft paper. In these experiments we studied the aging rate of Grade 3 <b>presspaper</b> and compared it to our previous studies of Kraft paper. Traditionally, the aging rate of paper has been studied in sealed vessels. The problem with this approach is that the chemical environment within the vessel will change during aging, and so the aging rate will be affected. In our experiment setup we controlled the water and oxygen content to more accurately determine the aging rate. Similarly to Kraft paper, the aging rate of Grade 3 <b>presspaper</b> with the same water content increased with oxygen content in the oil. Life curves were developed based on the water content of the paper and the oxygen content of the oil...|$|E

Its publisher is Richard Crowe and its editor is Bill Lawrence.It {{was founded by}} Richard Crowe, Reese Crowe, Al Webb and William Lawrence Sr. Its first edition was on September 15, 1982.In 1983, it merged with its competitor, the County Leader.The Crowes were the grandchildren of {{the founder of the}} Springfield <b>Press.Papers</b> that followed the County Press were the Haverford Press in 1985; the Garnet Valley Press in 1992; the Aston Press and the Thornbury Press in 1995; the Brookhaven Press in 1997; and the Media Press in 2000. The Brookhaven Press and the Aston Press were combined into the Hometown Press and the Thornbury Press was folded into the Garnet Valley Press.The Crowes and the Lawrences sold the publications to the Journal Register Co. in October 2002.|$|R
