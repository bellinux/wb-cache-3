6000|$|A day {{was then}} fixed to [...] "open the mines." [...] Captain Hart {{accompanied}} Mr. Geach as interpreter. The Governor, the Commandante, the Judge, {{and all the}} chief people of the place went in state to the mountain, with Mr. Geach's assistant {{and some of the}} workmen. As they went up the valley Mr. Geach examined the rocks, but saw no signs of copper. They went on and on, but still nothing except a few mere traces of very <b>poor</b> <b>ore.</b> At length they stood on the copper mountain itself. The Governor stopped, the officials formed a circle, and he then addressed them, saying, that at length the day had arrived they had all been so long expecting, when the treasures of the soil of Timor would be brought to light, and much more in very grandiloquent Portuguese; and concluded by turning to Mr. Geach, and requesting him to point out the best spot for them to begin work at once, and uncover the mass of virgin copper. As the ravines and precipices among which they had passed, and which had been carefully examined, revealed very clearly the nature and mineral constitution of the country, Mr. Geach simply told them that there was not a trace of copper there, and that it was perfectly useless to begin work. The audience were thunderstruck! The Governor could not believe his ears. At length, when Mr. Geach had repeated his statement, the Governor told him severely that he was mistaken; that they all knew there was copper there in abundance, and all they wanted him to tell them, as a mining-engineer, was how best to get at it; and that at all events he was to begin work somewhere. This Mr. Geach refused to do, trying to explain that the ravines had cut far deeper into the hill than he could do in years, and that he would not throw away money or time on any such useless attempt. After this speech had been interpreted to him, the Governor saw it was no use, and without saying a word turned his horse and rode away, leaving my friends alone on the mountain. They all believed there was some conspiracy that the Englishman would not find the copper, and that they had been cruelly betrayed.|$|E

There is a crossover point, relatively soon, where it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly to mine the moon instead of the increasingly <b>poor</b> <b>ores</b> remaining on earth. At that point government and industry can form a partnership much like The Railroad Act of 1862 to incentivize construction of the transportation infrastructure and lunar mining equipment.

Previous investigation shave shown increased concentrations of lead and some other metals. At {{the end of the}} 20 th century, the MeÅ¾a River was considered a stream with the highest concentrations of heavy metals in Slovenia. When the mine and processing plants ceased to operate, the direct transfer of heavy metals into the environment has strongly decreased. However, the deposits of <b>poor</b> <b>ore</b> and wastes from ore processing have remained as an indirect source of heavy metal pollution. From those places heavy metals have been washed out into the nearby streams, and carried into the MeÅ¾a River and further into the Drava River. Chemical analysis of the MeÅ¾a River and its tributaries has shown heavy pollution of the upper MeÅ¾a River sediments with lead, zinc, molybdenum and cadmium, and partly with arsenic. In the lower MeÅ¾a valley, those concentrations are mildly decreased.

500|$|With {{the need}} for {{expensive}} machinery and horses and for large numbers of workers at each mine, the traditional operation of mines by extended families or by individual entrepreneurs became impractical, and the new deep-level mines came under the ownership of groups of investors and of mining companies. A group of people known as a [...] "tribute team" [...] (often a single extended family) would bid {{for the right to}} work a specified portion of the mine; the men and older boys would dig in the appointed section, and the women, girls and young boys would dress the ore sent up by the men. In later years the practice of bal maidens dressing only the ore sent up by the men of their tribute team was abandoned, and they would instead be paid a flat wage by the mine owner to dress any ore sent up, and the tribute team which had sent up the ore would be billed for the work done. Typical work for a bal maiden in this period was picking ore from rubble, breaking and separating the ore, and carrying ore and metal. Generally girls under 12 would sort the ore, older girls would separate the ore, and grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. As the bal maidens of the smaller tribute teams often did not have the time to dress all the ore sent up, or it was not financially worthwhile to pay for the <b>poorer</b> quality <b>ore</b> to be processed, large quantities of <b>poor</b> quality <b>ore</b> were discarded unprocessed in waste heaps. On those occasions when improved extraction techniques or rises in the price of metals made it worthwhile to process this discarded ore, sometimes separate tribute teams would bid for the right to dress and process this rubble.

40|$|Bacteria of Bacillus genus from BanskÃ¡ HodruÂa {{ore deposit}} and from HornÃ¡ Prievrana kaolin deposit caused a more {{intensive}} destruction of silicate minerals by their activity, especially by the metabolites production. Their activity resulted {{to the development}} of corrosive and enantiomorphic holes on silicate minerals surface when sulphidic minerals were released and the metals were extracted into solution. The monitoring of Bacillus spp. occurrence in various deposits with silicate minerals composition suggested that these bacteria can be found in several deposits and waste dumps with silicate minerals at Slovakia. The widest species representation was detected in samples from the HornÃ¡ Prievrana kaolin deposit. The experiments with primary silicates showed either a more intensive destruction of silicate minerals accompanied by sulphides releasing from these minerals or a more intensive metals extraction from sulphidic minerals after ore dressing. The important percentage of precious metals extraction (30 % of gold and 30 % of argentine) from silicate minerals can suggest a possibility of the regulation of cyanides use in precious metals winning. A process for biological removal of elements from the samples {{was the result of the}} cultivation of organic acids - producing strains of the genus Bacillus. Hovewer, these bacteria synthesized also polysaccharides during bioleaching. Extensive acidic mucopolysaccharide films, which entrapped mineral particles, were identified by the ruthenium red staining. Ore bioleaching can not compete with physical and chemical methods in the rapidity of metal extraction from rich ores without ecological criterion. However, biotechnology becomes an alternative way in metals extraction from <b>poor</b> <b>ores</b> or wastes from the economical as well as the ecological view. The laboratory experiments with secondary silicates confirmed various forms of iron binding in kaolins and an important influence of the iron binding form on the Fe releasing during the bacterial leaching of kaolin. The release of the structural element, dissolved Fe from mica, and Fe from oxyhydroxides were used as indicators of the mineral dissolution and beneficiation of kaolin quality in this study report. They confirmed that bacteria of Bacillus genus are capable of a significant (52 %) iron removal in different times from kaolin either found as oxyhydroxides or also when it is bound in the mica structure. The significant enrichment by fine-grained fraction as a result of bacterial leaching is important also for the quality improvement of kaolins. These experimental results are important also for a possible development of a new industrial technology of kaolin raw material treatment.

In this work, the self-characteristics of PB powder and its single-components were studied respectively, such as the macroscopic properties, microscopic properties, and high-temperature properties, and the behavior and effect in the sintering were mastered. Then, aiming at the uncertain mixed state of blending ore powder, the evaluation system of the PB powder mixed state was built, and the mixed state of blending ore powder mastered. The results show that PB powder is composed of three kinds of iron ore, and the sintering characteristics of different iron ores are obviously discrepant. the evaluation system of the PB powder mixed state can be used to accurately judge the composition of iron ore powder in different batches, which provide technical basis on the effective use of PB powder...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between environmental conflicts and technical progress, trying to understand, {{in the case of}} large mines of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, in Alentejo, how emerging environmental problems conditioned the performance or led to the search for alternative technical solutions, taking as chronological limit for this observation the beginning of World War II. In the absence of the archives of the companies, the research was based on existing administrative documents in the state archives (mining engineers reports, the licensing of mining activities), on reports and documents published in specialized mining press, in particular, the Bulletin of the Ministry of Public Works, Trade and Industry, the Journal of Public Works, Trade and Industry (both in Portuguese), and finally in the local press. Despite that limitation, the information available shows that in global competition markets, the success of the British enterprise in Santo Domingo had the active search for new technical solutions for the creation and adaptation of existing knowledge to local problems in order to maximize the mineral resources available. The early development of the hydrometallurgical processes for the treatment of <b>poor</b> <b>ores,</b> named ânatural cementationâ, can be explained as the way these companies tried to solve problems of competitiveness, boosting economies of scale. Thus, they transferred the environmental costs previously limited to agriculture to more fragile social groups, the poor fishermen of Guadiana River and of Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio. Therefore, the hydrometallurgy of pyrites was developed locally, pioneered in Santo Domingo that allowed the survival and expansion of the British company from the late 1870 s, that is, {{at a time when most}} small mines shut since they were not able to compete globally. Through different consented and regulated processes (judicial), through conflict or parliamentary mediation, the State imposed exceptionally additional costs to companies, either for compensation, the imposing the application of remediation measures to reduce the environmental damage in some cases, thus contributing to derail some projects. These cases suggest that the interaction between local conflicts, corporate behavior and technological progress proves to be complex. This article aims to contribute to the debate on economic and social history between the environment and technological progress, arguing that the fixed costs and economic imponderable social risks were factors that encouraged the companies to search for new solutions and to introduce innovations since that would allow the expansion of their activity. In this process the companies sometimes faced environmental dilemmas and unforeseen costs with consequences on the economy of firms. The nature of the knowledge needed to address the environmental problems they created, however, is of a very different nature from that knowledge needed to face the environmental burdens that were inherent to the development of its activity...|$|R
