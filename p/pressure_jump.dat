40|$|With {{the rise}} of {{hydraulic}} fracturing and the ever increasing need for waste water disposal determining where to dispose of waste water is a significant issue. With record numbers of earthquakes in Oklahoma due to waste water injection {{it is clear that}} the hazards of waste water injection are not fully understood. A step to understanding what is happening in Oklahoma and other places is to investigate the effects of pore fluid pressure on normal and reverse faults. Different styles of faulting were found to occur between normal faults and reverse faults. Pore <b>pressure</b> <b>jumps</b> are found to occur during normal faulting but not during reverse faulting. These pore <b>pressure</b> <b>jumps</b> only occur when there is active fluid injection and the strength of the signal is related to the rate of injection of the pore fluid...|$|R
500|$|An outflow boundary, {{also known}} as a gust front, is a storm-scale or {{mesoscale}} boundary separating thunderstorm-cooled air (outflow) from the surrounding air; similar in effect to a cold front, with passage marked by a wind shift and usually a drop in temperature and a related <b>pressure</b> <b>jump.</b> Outflow boundaries can persist for 24 hours or more after the thunderstorms that generated them dissipate, and can travel hundreds of kilometers from their area of origin. New thunderstorms often develop along outflow boundaries, especially near the point of intersection with another boundary (cold front, dry line, another outflow boundary, etc.). [...] Outflow boundaries can be seen either as fine lines on weather radar imagery or else as arcs of low clouds on weather satellite imagery. From the ground, outflow boundaries can be co-located with the appearance of roll clouds and shelf clouds.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, <b>pressure</b> <b>jumps</b> {{were limited}} to one direction. Most {{commonly}} fast drops in pressure were achieved by using a quick release valve or a fast burst membrane. [...] Modern equipment can achieve pressure changes in both directions using either double reservoir arrangements (good for large changes in pressure) or pistons operated by piezoelectric actuators (often faster than valve based approaches). Ultra fast pressure drops can be achieved using electrically disintegrated burst membranes.

50|$|When {{a single}} step in a {{reaction}} is perturbed in a <b>pressure</b> <b>jump</b> experiment, the reaction follows a single exponential decay function with the reciprocal time constant (1/τ) equal to {{the sum of the}} forward and reverse intrinsic rate constants. In more complex reaction networks, when multiple reaction steps are perturbed, then the reciprocal time constants are given by the eigenvalues of the characteristic rate equations. The ability to observe intermediate steps in a reaction pathway is one of the attractive features of this technology.|$|E
