50|$|The Motley Collection of Theatre and Costume Design is a {{valuable}} source of documentation {{on the history of}} theatre and is housed in the Rare Book and Special Collections Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is a rare collection of original materials on the theatre comprising over 5000 items from more than 150 productions in England and the United States. These materials include costume and set designs, sketches, notes, photographs, <b>prop</b> <b>lists,</b> storyboards, and swatches of fabric. After the members of the Motley Group had retired, Michael Mullin, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, met Margaret Harris and expressed an interest in the University acquiring the over 40 years worth of designs that the group had accumulated. After long negotiations with Sotheby's, who had been contracted to auction the items, the University of Illinois finally reached an agreement in April, 1981, to purchase the entire collection. This ensured that {{a valuable}} resource on the history of 20th century theatre would be preserved intact for the benefit of future generations. The Library has digitized the collection in its entirety to make it publicly available.|$|R
40|$|Friedman et al. (2003) {{develop a}} model in which, in equilibrium, {{controlling}} shareholders may choose either tunneling or <b>propping</b> of their <b>listed</b> companies depending on the magnitude of an adverse shock and {{the magnitude of the}} private benefits of control. In this paper, we employ connected transaction data from China to test the implications of their model. We hypothesize that, when listed companies are financially healthy (in financial distress), their controlling shareholders are more likely to conduct connected transactions to tunnel (<b>prop</b> up) their <b>listed</b> companies and the market reacts unfavorably (favorably) to the announcement of these transactions. Our empirical findings strongly support our hypotheses. We also find that all of the transaction types in our sample can be used for tunneling or propping depending on different financial situations of the firms. Finally, political connection is negatively associated with the announcement effect. Overall, our analysis supports Friedman et al. 's (2003) model by furnishing clear evidence for propping and tunneling to occur in the same company but at different times. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{tunneling}} and <b>propping</b> between Chinese <b>listed</b> {{firms and}} their relevant parties from 2001 to 2005. Evidence from our {{research shows that}} controlling shareholders engage in tunneling and propping through related lending, although tunneling lending exceeds propping lending in both frequency and magnitude. Pyramidal controlling ownership structures increase the level of tunneling lending, while the presence of large, non-controlling shareholders resists tunneling lending. Controlling owners tend to divert fewer funds when firms have better investment opportunities. State ownership was {{not found to be}} detrimental to firms, contradicting some previous research. A high debt ratio is likely to be concomitant with tunneling lending. Firms in financial distress have experienced either more tunneling lending or more propping lending with controlling shareholders...|$|R

40|$|A {{quarter of}} Mississippi’s {{population}} lives {{below the poverty}} line. Poverty is linked to a myriad of health conditions, psychological effects, and inaccessibility of basic resources. Often, those who have never faced the challenges of poverty hold misconceptions regarding the impacts of poverty. It is important to correct misconceptions in order to combat the problems of poverty through such means as better-informed legislation and community action plans. Poverty simulations have recently been designed to educate people about poverty and its challenges. A poverty simulation is a role-playing exercise in which participants are given <b>props</b> and a <b>list</b> of tasks to accomplish in four 15 -minute periods that each represent one month. A successful poverty simulation sensitizes participants {{to the realities of}} poverty, demonstrating the impact the experience has on daily life. The McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement at the University of Mississippi Oxford campus hosted the inaugural Community Action Poverty Simulation (CAPS) on October 27, 2015. This experiment examines the attitudes of people from different backgrounds, raises awareness about the challenges of poverty, and evaluates the impact of the simulation. The data show that the inaugural CAPS at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi succeeded in raising participant awareness. This study also explains a need for a larger room, a more realistic and serious setting, a better introduction of the guidelines {{at the outset of the}} simulation, and a need to recruit from further audiences for future CAPS...|$|R
