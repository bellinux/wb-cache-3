40|$|The {{legitimacy}} {{of judicial review}} seems recently to be under serious critique both empirically and theoretically.

The intention of this thesis is to understand the location of Turkey within the context of the recent struggle which has been started {{on the part of the}} legislature to reclaim its share in ensuring the superiority of the constitution and constitutional rights. This thesis specifically focuses on the Commission on Human Rights Inquiry (CoHRI) as it is the first national human rights protection mechanism established in Turkey operating at the parliamentary level. In this regard, a descriptive analysis of the CoHRI‟s performance of its functions that are related to providing a pre-emptive right review is made. The descriptive analysis suggests that both the legal status of the CoHRI, which results from the formal rules and regulations on legislative commissions generally and on CoHRI particularly; and the functioning of TBMM as a plenary body form of legislature decrease the level of influence CoHRI has in terms of providing a <b>preemptive</b> <b>right</b> review mechanism...|$|R
50|$|For {{several months}} in 1787, Gorham served {{as one of the}} Massachusetts delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention. Gorham {{frequently}} served as Chairman of the Convention's Committee of the Whole, meaning that he (rather than the President of the Convention, George Washington) presided over convention sessions during the delegates' first deliberations on the structure of the new government in late May and June 1787. After the convention, he worked hard to see that the Constitution was approved in his home state.In connection with Oliver Phelps, he purchased from the state of Massachusetts in 1788 pre-emption rights to an immense tract of land in western New York State which straddled the Genesee River, all for the sum of $1,000,000 (about $ today) (the Phelps and Gorham Purchase). The land in question had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York under the 1786 Treaty of Hartford. The pre-emption right gave them the first or <b>preemptive</b> <b>right</b> to obtain clear title to this land from the Indians. They soon extinguished the Indian title to the portion of the land east of the Genesee River, as well as a 185,000 acre tract west of the Genesee, the Mill Yard Tract, surveyed all of it, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. Nathaniel Gorham Jr. (died October 22, 1836, Canandaigua, New York) was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed in charge of his father's interests there.|$|R

5000|$|According to Finkelstein, [...] "the {{mainstream}} Zionist movement {{never doubted}} its 'historical right' {{to impose a}} Jewish state through the 'Right of Return' on the indigenous Arab population of Palestine", and in fact claimed for the Jewish people a prevalent right to Israel, their historical homeland, and acceded the Arabs only rights as incidental residents.

Therefore, the Jews had a <b>preemptive</b> <b>right</b> to Palestine.

Progress is impeded, however, by intractable doctrinal confusion and academic hostility to the right as allegedly inimical to society 2 ̆ 7 s cultural need to manipulate celebrity images. Because the right of publicity is traditionally based on Lockean labor theory and analogized to intellectual property in created works, it is vulnerable to such attacks; to date, no serious attempt {{has been made to}} elaborate an alternative philosophical justification that can withstand them. In this Article, Dean Haemmerli uses Kantian philosophy to justify an autonomy-based right of publicity. In doing so, she challenges both the traditional approach to the right of publicity and its postmodernist critiques. First, the Article 2 ̆ 7 s proposed reconception of the right of publicity rejects the existing doctrinal bifurcation of publicity and privacy rights and explicitly embraces both the economic and moral facets of the individual 2 ̆ 7 s need to control the use of his identity. Second, by grounding the right in personal autonomy rather than purely pecuniary interests, the Article gives it greater weight in the balance against competing First Amendment considerations. At the same time, in order to contain potential abuses of a more expansive right, the Article considers First Amendment, fair use, and first sale doctrine limitations and incorporates various elements of these limitations into proposed legislative language establishing a <b>preemptive</b> federal <b>right</b> of publicity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years, a new {{intellectual}} property right called {{the right of}} publicity has evolved under state common law.

Courts must consider a variety of First Amendment, Copyright. Clause, Commerce Clause, Due Process Clause, and Full Faith and Credit. Clause issues when resolving publicity rights cases. This Note argues that Congress could simplify this area of the law considerably for plaintiffs, defendants, and courts by creating a <b>preemptive</b> federal <b>right</b> of publicity.

Freeze-out tender offers for minority shares averaged about 25 % of the shares’ intrinsic value.
