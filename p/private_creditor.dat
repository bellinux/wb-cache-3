6000|$|Now the {{interesting}} question arises whether these great belligerent states may go bankrupt, {{and if so}} to what extent. States may go bankrupt to the <b>private</b> <b>creditor</b> without repudiating their debts or seeming to pay less to him. They can go bankrupt either by a depreciation of their currency or--without touching the gold standard--through a rise in prices. In the end both these things work out to the same end; the creditor gets so many loaves or pairs of boots or workman's hours of labour for his pound less {{than he would have}} got under the previous conditions. One may imagine this process of price (and of course wages) increase going on to a limitless extent. Many people are inclined to look to such an increase in prices as a certain outcome of the war, and just so far as it goes, just so far will the burthen of the rentier class, their call, tat is, for goods and services, be lightened. This expectation is very generally entertained, and I can see little reason against it. The intensely stupid or dishonest [...] "labour" [...] press, however, which {{in the interests of the}} common enemy misrepresents socialism and seeks to misguide labour in Great Britain, ignores these considerations, and positively holds out this prospect of rising prices as an alarming one to the more credulous and ignorant of its readers.|$|E

40|$|The Brazilian {{position}} {{on the issue of}} private sector participation in the efforts to forestall and resolve emerging markets crises is that there should be an approach of contacting and convincing a large number, but not the totality, of <b>private</b> <b>creditors.</b> They should be convinced that the international public sector loans will allow a transition to stability that is overfinanced in case they voluntarily join in by maintaining their exposure to the country, at the spreads they choose, and with the counterparts they wish to have as clients. We model private sector participation by means of a game. We show that the traditional argument that there is a coordination problem among the <b>private</b> <b>creditors</b> does not exist is in a model without Knightian uncertainty, because there is only one Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium which involves participation. By introducing Knigthian uncertainty, we show that if the degree of uncertainty, as measured by the uncertainty aversion, is high enough, then there is only one Nash equilibrium under uncertainty, which involves nonparticipation. Finally, we show {{that if there is a}} large enough number of <b>private</b> <b>creditors</b> who decrease their uncertainty aversion, then again private participation becomes the unique Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium under Knightian uncertainty. If we interpret the approach and convincing of the <b>private</b> <b>creditors</b> as decreasing their uncertainty aversion, then this last result is a justification of the Brazilian position. In fact, the <b>private</b> <b>creditors</b> would voluntarily choose to maintain their exposures, because private sector participation is the unique Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium under uncertainty of the game. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} four discrete {{periods of}} sovereign default and restructuring {{over the past}} 135 years and seeks to explain the observed variation in aggregated bargaining outcomes between debtor states and private creditors. Utilizing a power-based analytical framework borrowed from Barnett and Duvall (2005), the study assesses the relative impact of four principal regime components on distributional results: the <b>private</b> <b>creditor</b> representative body (institutional power); the degree and orientation of creditor country government/IFI intervention (compulsory power); the structure and condition of the capital markets (structural power); and, the discursive practices surrounding sovereign default (productive power). The analysis suggests that the key <b>private</b> <b>creditor</b> institutions - the British Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, the American Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, and The London Club - have only marginally influenced results, and that outcomes were instead driven by the action (or inaction) of creditor governments, the structure of capital access (centralized or decentralized), and the relative condition of the private capital markets (robust or collapsed). The paper concludes that compulsory and structural regime elements are therefore more salient than institutional ones in the sovereign debt bargaining exercise. From a public policy perspective, this study cautions those who seek a newly-constituted, 21 st-century bondholder council, since such an institution - like its historical predecessors - would find {{its impact on the}} sovereign debt management process highly circumscribed. The thesis also challenges economic theory on the matter of sovereign repayment incentives, arguing that the "either-or" nature of the reputation-sanctions debate (Eaton-Gersovitz (1981) vs. Bulow-Rogoff (1989)) distracts from the fact that these incentives have operated simultaneously over the past 135 years. More specifically, the evidence suggests that structural and compulsory regime elements - the equivalent of reputation and sanctions in the formal models - have largely reinforced one another in the sovereign debt restructuring process, thereby amplifying their impact on negotiating outcomes in each historical period...|$|E

40|$|The {{first half}} of this Essay surveys recent efforts to protect governments from <b>private</b> <b>creditor</b> {{lawsuits}} in national courts. The general shield already in place-a bundle of sovereign immunities that have inspired a rich literature-has looked increasingly fragile in the wake of emerging sovereign bond crises, an impression reinforced by hundreds of lawsuits against Argentina. But the project of bolstering these protections, which culminated in the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s statutory sovereign bankruptcy proposal, kept running into political and technical constraints that looked insurmountable. In the case of Iraq, the United Nations dispensed with these constraints and granted broad new immunities for Iraqi assets, all but destroying the prospect of near-term recovery from litigation. In the second half, I look at the Odious Debt Doctrine, which is experiencing a revival after regime change in Iraq. The doctrine is often cited for the proposition that the countries emerging from nasty dictatorships can repudiate their debts, because those debts came about without the consent of or benefit for their people. But since its invention and throughout the past century-rife with oppressive regimes, revolutions, reckless borrowings, and debt defaults-the doctrine has languished in near complete disuse save for an occasional NGO campaign or bout of parliamentary rhetoric. Just as Iraq is an unlikely source of lessons for sovereign bankruptcy in the age of financial globalization, Argentina 2 ̆ 7 s experience since 2001 helps explain why governments do not use the Odious Debt Doctrine to disavow the obligations of their predecessors...|$|E

In this context, we conclude that the proposal of the Meltzer Commission—for unconditional financial support, but only to states that pre-qualify—could be the source of increased instability. After discussing analogies with private sector arrangements, we compare the operations of the existing Paris Club with proposed Chapter 11 style procedures.

40|$|An {{expanded}} and {{updated version of}} this paper was published in the Summer 2007 edition of the journal "International Finance" (see www. blackwellpublishing. com/journal. asp?ref= 1367 - 0271). Here we highlight the contribution that <b>private</b> <b>creditors</b> have made to resolve expeditiously and even generously the many sovereign debt crises in which they have been involved. The road from debt restructuring to debt forgiveness – from reprofiling to cancellation, in the jargon of the official community – has been a fairly short one for commercial banks and bondholders, but a very long one for the official export-credit and foreign-aid agencies represented by the Paris Club, {{as well as for the}} multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF. They have yet to grant any debt reduction to the middle-income countries that were the object of bailouts during the 1990 s and the recipients of subsequent debt relief from the private sector, and they have moved far too slowly to address the needs of the poorest countries, many of which have received substantial, upfront and unconditional debt forgiveness from <b>private</b> <b>creditors.</b> ...|$|R

However, Prime Minister George Papandreou decided to cancel the referendum on 3 November, if the opposition parties vote in favour of the EU deal. The proposed referendum was later cancelled.|$|R
