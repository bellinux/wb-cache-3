2500|$|India has {{the fifth}} largest {{installed}} wind power {{capacity in the}} world. As of 31 March 2015, the installed capacity of wind power was 23,444 MW an increase of 2312 MW {{over the previous year}} [...] Wind power accounts nearly 8.5% of India's total installed power generation capacity and generated 28.314 billion kWh in the fiscal year 2014-15 which is nearly 2.6% of total electricity generation. The capacity utilisation factor is nearly 15% in the fiscal year 2014-15.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} various {{concepts of}} power. Its {{goal is to}} shed light on a better method for implementing the power concept. The case of Bulgaria’s water user associations’ failure shows the abuse of power by local actors who fear they will lose their influence and the private benefits that they have enjoyed under the former system. The paper provides an empirical study of <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> verified by actors’ perceptions rather than having resource endowments quantified. It also illustrates the contrast between empirically revealed perceived <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> in a local context and their theoretical examination in the distributional theory of institutional change. Studies that set <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> in relation to one another are scarce. Therefore, in this study an innovative, interactive method is used that leads to a ranking of perceived <b>power</b> <b>resources,</b> which is robust against the impact of belonging to different territorial, social, and agricultural producer groups: 1) unrestricted access to information, 2) personal relationships, 3) trustworthiness, 4) cash resources for bribing, 5) menace, and 6) physical power and violence. The implication of this gradation of <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> on collective action solutions addresses complementary measures to disseminate information and compensation measures for those who fear losing their benefits and may therefore oppose the new institutions...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{differences}} in <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> between parties for manifest conflict between them is a neglected topic in conflict studies. Here a power balance model of conflict is outlined which takes the difference in <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> between two parties as the central independent variable and the probability of manifest conflict between them as the dependent variable. Utility of achieving the goal, expectancy of success in conflict initiation and in defense and relative deprivation are the main intervening variables. Predictions from the model challenge the widespread assump-tion that the probability of contlict is highest when parties have equal <b>power</b> <b>resources.</b> Instead a bi-modal distribution of the probability of manifest conflict is predicted. Empirical data are discussed and {{the relevance of the}} model for exchange theories is indicated. Social scientists engaged in the study of social conflict have for a long time devoted surprisingly little interest to the role {{of differences}} in <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> between contending parties in the development of contlict. As Converse (1968, p. 489) observes, this problem has often been defined away by an assumption that the contending parties have equal access to <b>power</b> <b>resources.</b> Those who have recognized the importance of power differences for the probability of conflict between two parties have often only made summary statements concerning the type of relationship to be expected between these variables without spelling out why the assumed relationships would obtain. These state-ments indicate that the probability of conflict is generally predicted to be highest when parties have equal access to <b>power</b> <b>resources</b> (Calver...|$|R
