40|$|Requirements {{applicable}} to urban construction and investment programmes are {{considered in the}} proposed paper. The authors identify the principal problems that prevent successful implementation of the programme-oriented approach and formulate the initial set of the top-priority objectives. They include the basic parameters of the development strategy, indicators of the economic strength of the Programme, overview of any available resources and efficiency of their use in the past, criteria of efficiency of the Program, its constituent blocks and separate actions, methodological recommendations and procedures, mechanisms of distribution and re-distribution of the budgetary funding, commercial risks and procedures that accompany the concentration of urban resources, forms and methods of public control, incentives designated to get co-developers involved into the Programme. The new outlook {{applicable to}} the attainment of the pre-set objectives corrects the economic essence of the Programmes. It consists in the system-based representation of the <b>Programme</b> <b>actions</b> {{as a collection of}} regulatory, management, and financial modules designated to substantiate and explain the target-oriented criteria. In pursuance of the above, the target essence of the economic simulation of the strategy of urban assets management as part of the <b>Programme</b> <b>actions</b> is identified. The authors believe that an integrated Programme may assure sustainable development of the urban area acting as a self-reproducing system capable of facilitating the satisfaction of ever-growing needs of urban residents and corporate entities, guests and partners of cities and towns, that represent an integral social and economic system in its development. In the context accepted by the authors, attainment of the above objective will involve fulfillment of each of the aforementioned requirements. They are to assure the concentration of resources and comprehensive satisfaction of the needs of the urban population in terms of the most popular items of real estate within a particular time span...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} issues are considered by european Institutions {{more and more}} in an integrated view with those concerning the protection of the environment. Various European Directives and <b>programme</b> <b>actions</b> put more focus on the building sector, not only for its importance in the economies of all industrialised countries, but also because it has the greatest potential for the reduction of pollutant emissions. Among the several energy saving measures addressed by the SAVE Directive, a very Important one concerns the Energy Certification of Buildings. This action had already been included into Italian Law N. 10 of January 1991. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission carried out a check of the state of implementation of the part of the Directive concerning the Building Energy Certification and in thhis report an overview of the situation in EU member countries is presented and compared with Italian situation. Moreover, the future trends of the Building Certification are discussed, with particular attention paid to labelling schemes for high quality buildings and environmentally-friendly buildings. JRC.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the process of scaling up and scaling down {{grassroots}} demands through a state-sponsored socio-environmental development programme in Brazilian Amazonia called Proambiente (Pro-environment). The paper attempts to understand the links between the three different levels of the programme actions: the macro (federal government), intermediate (NGOs), and local (community) levels. The central paper s issue is to understand how a state-sponsored socio-environmental development programme interacts with and impacts local communities. The theoretical paper s framework involves the approaches of participatory development and governance. The methodology is based on three levels of qualitative analysis (macro-, intermediary- and local-level). The paper (a) describes the trajectory of the Proambiente and the process of scaling up communities demands; (b) reveals contradictions within the Proambiente implementation; and (c) debates the impacts of the <b>programme</b> <b>actions</b> at local level. The paper reveals that once the state encompasses local people s demands and creates a development programme, the development model absorbs multi-actor interests that change local people s proposals. It also shows that the challenge facing a socio-environmental development programme like the Proambiente is to find a balance between production and conservation aims...|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of the predictive effect of socioeconomic characteristics (SECs) of women on maternal healthcare service utilisation is essential in order to maximise maternal health benefits and outcomes for the newborn. Objectives: To describe how SECs of women contribute to their exclusion from maternal health benefits in Abuja Municipal Areas Council (AMAC) in Abuja, Nigeria. Method: A non-experimental, facility-based cross-sectional survey was done. Data were collected from 384 respondents using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The participants were sampled randomly at antenatal care (ANC) clinics in the five district hospitals in AMAC. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations and measures of inequality. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} test the relationship between SECs (predictors) and maternal healthcare service utilisation. Results: There were differentials in the utilisation of maternal healthcare services (ANC, delivery care, post natal care [PNC] and contraceptive services) amongst women withdifferent SECs; and the payment system for maternal healthcare services was regressive. There were inconsistencies in the predictive effect of the SECs of women included in this study (age,education, birth order, location of residence, income group and coverage by health insurance) on maternal healthcare service utilisation when considered independently (bivariate analysis) as opposed to when considered together (logistic regression), with the exception of birth order, which showed consistent effect. Conclusion: SECs of women were predictive factors of utilisation of maternal healthcare services. There is a need for targeted policy measures and <b>programme</b> <b>actions</b> toward multiple SECs of women in their natural co-existing state in order to optimise maternal health benefits. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to describe how socio-economic characteristics (SEC) of women affect their utilization of maternal healthcare services in Abuja Municipal Areas Council (AMAC) in Abuja Nigeria. A non-experimental, facility-based cross-sectional survey was done. Data was collected using structured interviewer administered questionnaire in 5 district hospitals in AMAC. Sample size of 384 was calculated a priori {{based on the assumption that}} 50 % of the target population utilized maternal healthcare services during their last pregnancy. Equal allocation of samples per facility was done. The ANC register was used as the sampling frame and proportionate allocation of samples per clinic days was undertaken in each facility. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and measures of inequality. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypothesized relationship between socioeconomic characteristics (predictors) and maternal healthcare service utilization. Other than birth order that showed consistent effect, the results of this study indicated that the predictive effect (predisposing and enabling factors) of the SEC of women included in this study (age, education, birth order, location of residence, income group and coverage by health insurance) on maternal healthcare service utilization were not consistent when considered independently (bivariate analysis) as opposed to when considered together through logistic regression. In addition, the study revealed that there was inequality in the utilization of maternal healthcare services (ante-natal care - ANC, delivery care and post natal care - PNC, and contraceptive services) among women with different SEC, and the payment system for maternal healthcare services was regressive. Addressing these predictors in the natural co-existing state (as indicated by the logistic regression) is essential for equitable access and utilization of healthcare during pregnancy, delivery and the postnatal period, and for contraceptive services in AMAC, Abuja Nigeria. Targeted policy measures and <b>programme</b> <b>actions</b> guided by these findings are recommended to optimise returns on investment towards achieving national and global goals on maternal health in NigeriaHealth StudiesD.
