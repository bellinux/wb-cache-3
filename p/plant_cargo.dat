5000|$|New {{business}} {{practices in the}} areas of management and accounting made possible the more efficient operation of large companies. For example, in steel, coal, and iron companies 19th-century accountants utilized sophisticated, fully integrated accounting systems to calculate output, yields, and costs to satisfy management information requirements. [...] South Durham Steel and Iron, was a large horizontally integrated company that operated mines, mills, and shipyards. Its management used traditional accounting methods with the goal of minimizing production costs, and thus raising its profitability. By contrast one of its competitors, Cargo Fleet Iron introduced mass production milling techniques through the construction of modern <b>plants.</b> <b>Cargo</b> Fleet set high production goals and developed an innovative but complicated accounting system to measure and report all costs throughout the production process. However, problems in obtaining coal supplies and the failure to meet the firm's production goals forced Cargo Fleet to drop its aggressive system and return to the sort of approach South Durham Steel was using.|$|R

40|$|Two {{independent}} {{cases of}} oligochaete worms recovered from Korean women’s vaginas are reported. Both specimens were non-parasitic cosmopolitan exotics identified as: microdrile tubificid Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparède, 1862 (Tubificidae) and megadrile dichogastrid Dichogaster bolaui (Michaelsen, 1891) (Octochaetidae) – {{a new record}} for Korea. The tubificid is a freshwater euryhaline species that may reach high numbers in organically rich water e. g. in a paddy field, whereas the earthworm is commonly intercepted by quarantine in <b>plant</b> or vegetable <b>cargos</b> and also appears in bathtubs when it inhabits drainage sys¬tems. Thus, bathing/douching, field working or picnicking without a blanket are suggested as possible modes of ingress. Oligo¬chaetes rarely occur in live human bodies but the few previous historical records are reviewed...|$|R
5000|$|An inquest into Spalding's and Watson's deaths was {{eventually}} held. The causes reviewed during the hearings varied from the negligence of the dive ship's captain, equipment failure, including tangled signal ropes or {{the failure of}} the final cask of air reaching the divers, diver error, putrified air from the rotting cargo of the Belgioso, even sabotage and alcohol. Dive experts today think the most plausible explanation is [...] "a highly noxious effluvia entering the bell which could have come from the putrifying bodies or even the rotting <b>cargo</b> of ginseng <b>plants</b> in the <b>cargo</b> hold." [...] This theory is consistent with the observation that they made no apparent attempt to make an emergency ascent. The exact cause of death of Spalding and Watson is unknown.|$|R

50|$|Until 1927, Łazy {{belonged to}} the gmina of Rokitno Szlacheckie, Bedzin County. In the Second Polish Republic, it was {{originally}} part of Kielce Voivodeship, and on January 1, 1927, the gmina of Rokitno Szlacheckie was transferred to Zawiercie County. The village of Lazy was captured by the Wehrmacht in early September 1939, and remained in German hands until January 20, 1945. After the war, the government of People's Republic of Poland transferred Łazy to Katowice Voivodeship, creating the gmina of Łazy in late 1945. In Communist Poland, Łazy was a local center of industry, with Cement Works Wysoka, Pottery <b>Plant,</b> and large <b>cargo</b> depot of Polish State Railways. In the late 1940s, houses of culture, cinemas and libraries were opened in the gmina of Łazy. The village went through the period of quick development in the 1960s, when waterworks and electrification program were completed. Finally, on January 1, 1967, Łazy received town charter.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} motors kinesin and dynein drive bidirectional motility along microtubules (MTs) in most eukaryotic cells. Land plants, however, are {{a notable}} exception, because they contain {{a large number}} of kinesins but lack cytoplasmic dynein, the foremost processive retrograde transporter. It remains unclear how <b>plants</b> achieve retrograde <b>cargo</b> transport without dynein. Here, we have analysed the motility of the six members of minus-end-directed kinesin- 14 motors in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found that none are processive as native dimers. However, when artificially clustered into as little as dimer of dimers, the type-VI kinesin- 14 (a homologue of Arabidopsis KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin binding protein)) exhibited highly processive and fast motility (up to 0. 6 μm s− 1). Multiple kin 14 -VI dimers attached to liposomes also induced transport of this membrane cargo over several microns. Consistent with these results, in vivo observations of green fluorescent protein-tagged kin 14 -VI in moss cells revealed fluorescent punctae that moved processively towards the minus-ends of the cytoplasmic MTs. These data suggest that clustering of a kinesin- 14 motor serves as a dynein-independent mechanism for retrograde transport in plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} a {{numerical}} procedure {{developed in a}} Matlab® environment is presented, aiming at {{the definition of the}} main dimensions of a fleet of ships devoted to the transportation of a bulk cargo. The procedure is meant to provide preliminary indication in the initial phase of feasibility studies. The optimal dimensions are defined through a full factorial analysis. Relevant input data are information about the cargo to be transported (annual quantity, specific gravity, etc.), about the characteristics of the <b>plants</b> needed for <b>cargo</b> handling (weight, dimension, location on board) and about the route. The algorithm is based on a preliminary design modulus which provides solutions in line with requirements and preliminarily checked as regards basic trim and stability requirements. The analysis includes, on the specific geometry considered, an evaluation of the seakeeping performances of the ship in the sea area covering the transportation route. The influence of adverse meteo-marine conditions reflects into an increase in the consumption and in a decrease in the average speed as compared with nominal values (in calm water). The inherent increase in running costs and the need for an incremented net weight nominal capacity to increase the probability of satisfying the specifications in terms of annual actual transportation flow is accounted for. A first set of results is presented, regarding a possible trade of Compressed Natural Gas in the North Sea area...|$|R
40|$|Two main {{mechanisms}} of protein turnover exist in eukaryotic cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome {{system and the}} autophagylysosomal pathway. Autophagy is an emerging important constituent of many physiological and pathological processes, such as response to nutrient deficiency, programmed cell death and innate immune response. In mammalian cells the selectivity of autophagy is ensured {{by the presence of}} cargo receptors, such as p 62 /SQSTM 1 and NBR 1, responsible for sequestration of the ubiquitinated proteins. In <b>plants</b> no selective <b>cargo</b> receptors have been identified yet. The present report indicates that structural and functional homologs of p 62 and NBR 1 proteins exist in plants. The tobacco protein, named Joka 2, has been identified in yeast two-hybrid search as a binding partner of a small coiled-coil protein, a member of UP 9 /LSU family of unknown function, encoded by the UP 9 C gene strongly and specifically induced during sulfur deficiency. The typical domains of p 62 and NBR 1 are conserved in Joka 2. Similarly to p 62, Joka 2 -YFP has dual localization (cytosolic speckles and the nucleus); it forms homodimers and interacts with a member of the ATG 8 family. Increased expression of Joka 2 and ATG 8 f was observed in roots of tobacco plants grown for two days in nutrient-deficient conditions. Constitutive ectopic expression of Joka 2 -YFP in tobacco resulted in attenuated response (manifested by lesser yellowing of the leaves) to nutrient deficiency. In conclusion, Joka 2, and presumably the process of selective autophagy, might constitute an important part of plant response to environmental stresses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Myosins are actin-activated ATPases {{that use}} energy to {{generate}} force and move along actin filaments, dragging with their tails different <b>cargos.</b> <b>Plant</b> myosins {{belong to the}} group of unconventional myosins and Arabidopsis myosin VIII gene family contains four members: ATM 1, ATM 2, myosin VIIIA and myosin VIIIB. Results In transgenic plants expressing GFP fusions with ATM 1 (IQ-tail truncation, lacking the head domain), fluorescence was differentially distributed: while in epidermis cells at the root cap GFP-ATM 1 equally distributed all over the cell, in epidermal cells right above this region it accumulated in dots. Further up, in cells of the elongation zone, GFP-ATM 1 was preferentially positioned at the sides of transversal cell walls. Interestingly, the punctate pattern was insensitive to brefeldin A (BFA) while in some cells closer to the root cap, ATM 1 was found in BFA bodies. With the use of different markers and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, it was found that myosin VIII co-localized to the plasmodesmata and ER, colocalized with internalized FM 4 - 64, and partially overlapped with the endosomal markers ARA 6, and rarely with ARA 7 and FYVE. Motility of ARA 6 labeled organelles was inhibited whenever associated with truncated ATM 1 but motility of FYVE labeled organelles was inhibited only when associated with large excess of ATM 1. Furthermore, GFP-ATM 1 and RFP-ATM 2 (IQ-tail domain) co-localized to the same spots on the plasma membrane, indicating a specific composition at these sites for myosin binding. Conclusion Taken together, our data suggest that myosin VIII functions differently in different root cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis, BFA-sensitive and insensitive pathways, ER tethering and plasmodesmatal activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The current world {{usage of}} LNG isabout 110 million {{tons per year}} andcurrent {{analysis}} indicates this grow-ing in the next 10 years by 70 to 100 million tons. This may lead to demand for more than 80 new LNG carriers by 2010, in addi-tion to those already under construction. Traditionally LNG carriers have been pro-pelled by steam turbines, as this {{has proved to be}} a simple and reliable solution for these ships. However the relatively low efficiency of the propulsion system (< 30 %) and possible increased size of future LNG carriers has initiated investigations into uti-lizing alternative propulsion systems. Electric propulsion has as a result of these investigations been shown to be an attractive alternative with high overall efficiency (~ 42 %). The first three LNG car-riers with electric propulsion are now under construction at Chantiers de l'At-lantique in France for the French owner Gaz de France, where ABB is delivering the propulsion system on the second and third vessel, which are the world's first vessels with full size cargo capacity (154, 000 m 3) utilizing an electric propul-sion system. In the last years the power <b>plant</b> for the <b>cargo</b> handling system has changed from a 440 V system to a medium voltage system (3. 3 kV or 6. 6 kV) due to increased installed power for the cargo pumps as the ship sizes have increased. Electric propulsion would be the natural extension utilizing the already installed medium voltage power system also for powering the propeller. With the development of the Dual Fuel (DF) engines, which can operate both on gas and diesel oil, electric propulsion has become an attractive solution, due to increased efficiency, increased cargo capac-ity and reduced operational costs. The boil-off gas (BOG) is used directly in the medi-um speed engines, and the propulsion power is transferred to the propellers by the electric power and propulsion plant. Other essential criteria for selecting a propulsion system are the availability and reliability of the propulsion equipment. LNG carriers have long time charters with fixed schedules, and a high penalty of not making the schedule in time. The avail-ability of the conventional steam turbine has proven to be very high, and any alter-native solution to be considered must comply with at least the same level of availability. With the inbuilt redundancy in the electric propulsion system and using reliable components these require-ments are met...|$|R
