The {{building}} was leased to <b>pork</b> <b>butcher</b> F.G Thompson, who made alterations {{to the building}} presumably to separate his business from the laundry and ex-convicts. Urwins Chemical Factory operated on the site from 1913, producing industrial and domestic chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as filing first aid boxes until 1961 when it moved to Stepney bank in Ouseburn. In 1937, the Council decided that the hospital was no longer fit to house people because {{the area around the}} almshouse was very unhealthy.

He described them as [...] "not a whit inferior to those of Epping"; Epping sausages were skinless meat-based sausages. Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow ate his sausages. Advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages in the British Newspaper Archive begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by <b>pork</b> <b>butcher</b> Henry S. Morgan of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the Western Mail on 15 December. Morgan continued to advertise {{over the next several}} years, and by 1874 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from [...] "choice dairy-fed pork".|$|E

According to the wife of one of Tudor's brother officers, there were two accounts about Larissa's background. One {{was that she was}} the daughter of a <b>pork</b> <b>butcher,</b> whom Tudor met when he was posted at Constantinople in 1921. Larissa was said to be a belly-dancer at a night club in Constantinople. A second account of her early life was that she was a woman of good family from St. Petersburg. The colonel of Tudor's regiment reportedly sent brother officers either to teach him some Russian before his marriage or to try to persuade Tudor not to marry Larissa. Tudor, who was in love with Larissa, went ahead with the marriage and was forced to leave the regiment. One of Tudor's first cousins was told that Larissa had escaped from Russia and had been [...] "earning her living the only way she could." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the back}} parlour Charley found more people drinking, and among them three ladies of Mrs. Davis's acquaintance. They {{were all very}} fine in their apparel, and very {{comfortable}} as to their immediate employment, for each had before her a glass of hot tipple. One of them, a florid-faced dame about fifty, Charley had seen before, and knew to be {{the wife of a}} <b>pork</b> <b>butcher</b> and sausage maker in the neighbourhood. Directly he entered the room, Mrs. Davis formally introduced him to them all. 'A very particular friend of mine, Mrs. Allchops; and of Norah's too, I can assure you,' said Mrs. Davis.|$|E
60|$|Also, I {{think she}} was unwise, {{introducing}} me to the shop, for children and dogs--one seems unconsciously to bracket them in one's thoughts--are snobbish little wretches. If only {{her father had been}} a dealer in firewood I could have soothed myself by imagining mistakes. It was a common occurrence, as I well knew, for children of quite the best families to be brought up by wood choppers. Fairies, the best intentioned in the world, but born muddlers, were generally responsible for these mishaps, which, however, always became righted in time for the wedding.

They drew nearer the junction to where a pavement and shops already open and active formed the commercial centre of Easewood. On the opposite side of the way the side door of a flourishing little establishment opened, and a man and his wife and a little boy in a sailor suit came into the street. The wife was a pretty woman in brown with a floriferous straw hat, and the group was altogether very Sundayfied and shiny and spick and span. The shop itself had a large plate-glass window whose contents were now veiled by a buff blind on which was inscribed in scrolly letters: [...] "Rymer, <b>Pork</b> <b>Butcher</b> and Provision Merchant," [...] and then with voluptuous elaboration: [...] "The World-Famed Easewood Sausage." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} at that time none of us quite {{believed}} in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller {{was one of those}} men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have shown him far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives; a <b>pork</b> <b>butcher</b> could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.|$|E
6000|$|For Germany this quite {{unexpected}} rush was {{a reversal}} of the whole tide of the world. It was as if the Rhine itself had returned from the ocean and retired into the Alps. For a long time past every important political process in Europe had been produced or permitted by Prussia. She had pulled down ministers in France and arrested reforms in Russia. Her ruler was acclaimed by Englishmen like Rhodes, and Americans like Roosevelt, as the great prince of the age. One of the most famous and brilliant of our journalists called him [...] "the Lord Chief Justice of Europe." [...] He was the strongest man in Christendom; and he had confirmed and consecrated the Crescent. And when he had consecrated it a few hill tribes had risen and trampled it like mire. One or two other things about the same time, less important in themselves, struck in the Prussian's ear the same new note of warning and doubt. He sought to obtain a small advantage on the north-west coast of Africa; and England seemed to show a certain strange stiffness in insisting on its abandonment. In the councils over Morocco, England agreed with France with what did not seem altogether an accidental agreement. But we shall not be wrong if we put the crucial point of the German surprise and anger at the attack from the Balkans and the fall of Adrianople. Not only did it menace the key of Asia and the whole Eastern dream of German commerce; not only did it offer the picture of one army trained by France and victorious, and another army trained by Germany and beaten. There was more than the material victory of the Creusot over the Krupp gun. It was also the victory of the peasant's field over the Krupp factory. By this time there was in the North German brain an awful inversion of all the legends and heroic lives that the human race has loved. Prussia hated romance. Chivalry was not a thing she neglected; it was a thing that tormented her as any bully is tormented by an unanswered challenge. That weird process was completed of which I have spoken on an earlier page, whereby the soul of this strange people was everywhere {{on the side of the}} dragon against the knight, of the giant against the hero. Anything unexpected--the forlorn hopes, the eleventh-hour inspirations, by which the weak can elude the strong, and which take the hearts of happier men like trumpets--filled the Prussian with a cold fury, as of a frustrated fate. The Prussian felt as a Chicago <b>pork</b> <b>butcher</b> would feel if the pigs not only refused to pass through his machine, but turned into romantic wild boars, raging and rending, calling for the old hunting of princes and fit to be the crests of kings.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether specific cancers {{are associated with}} the occupation of butcher, as has been reported from other countries, a historical prospective cohort study was undertaken. The cohort consisted of all self employed butchers (n = 552) and <b>pork</b> <b>butchers</b> (n = 310) born since 1880 who set up a shop in the canton of Geneva from 1901 to 1969, and of their wives (n = 887). The study group was followed up from 1901 to 1990 for general mortality, from 1942 to 1990 for cause specific mortality, and from 1970 to 1989 for incidence of cancer. There was no trace of 45 men (5 %) and 52 women (6 %). Compared with the general population of the canton of Geneva, <b>butchers</b> and <b>pork</b> <b>butchers</b> experienced a significant increase, taking into account 15 years of latency, in mortality from all causes (observed deaths (Obs) 540, expected deaths (Exp) 445. 5, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 121, 90 % confidence interval (90 % Cl) 113 - 130). There were significant excesses in incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer, cancer of the prostate, and all malignant neoplasms, and in incidence of cancer of the liver. The risk of lung cancer was significantly increased among <b>pork</b> <b>butchers</b> (SMR 176, 90 % Cl 114 - 262; standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 231, 90 % Cl 137 - 368) but not among butchers (SMR 92, 90 % Cl 59 - 138; SIR 113, 90 % Cl 67 - 179). There was also a significant increase in mortality from cancer of the larynx among butchers. For non-malignant causes of death significant excesses were found among all men for ischaemic heart disease, motor vehicle accidents, and cirrhosis of the liver. Analysis of subgroups showed a cluster of deaths from leukaemia among older butchers born between 1880 and 1899 (Obs 5, Exp 0. 6, p < 0. 0001). Exposure of <b>pork</b> <b>butchers</b> to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during meat smoking, which was assessed in a contemporary study, might have contributed to their increased risk of lung cancer. The possible role of other factors, especially cigarette smoking, nitrosamines, and oncogenic viruses was discussed. Moreover, there was evidence from another contemporary study that <b>butchers</b> and <b>pork</b> <b>butchers</b> ate more animal fat, and probably more animal protein, than the average male population of Geneva. These results suggest that dietary factors could be implicated in the excesses of colorectal cancer, cancer of the prostate, and ischaemic heart disease. An increased risk for alcohol abuse might explain the excesses of liver cirrhosis, cancer of the liver, cancer of the larynx and motor vehicle accidents. Among all wives overall mortality was similar to that expected (SMR 100, 90 % Cl 93 - 108) and there was no significant excess risk for any specific cancer nor for any non-malignant cause of death. Results for cancer of the cervix uteri, especially among subgroups, suggest an increased risk consistent with previous findings from other countries...|$|R
