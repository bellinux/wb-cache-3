In terms of baseband technology (smartphones only), WCDMA was 50-55%, TD 25-30% and EDGE 10-15%. According to MediaTek's Q3 2014 conference call, dual-core shipments for entry-level devices continued to be important {{in the second half of}} 2014 with an increase in export shipments as MediaTek's competitiveness China was affected by the transition to 4G.|$|E
25|$|High {{variable}} costs mean that Pandora {{does not have}} significant operating leverage, {{and in the next}} couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of steps {{in which the}} reorganization of chemical bonds may be {{taking place in the}} course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.|$|E

25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products, livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in labor-saving means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect it is remarkable that the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower wage level, like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E
25|$|MediaTek started {{shipping}} SoC solutions with integrated 4G LTE baseband {{in volume}} {{in the second}} half of 2014, which was later than Qualcomm, which had been shipping SoCs with integrated 4G for some time, which was likely to impact MediaTek as Chinese telecom providers such as China Mobile and carriers in other countries push and subsidize LTE technology. Although MediaTek's MT6290 stand-alone 4G baseband combined with its MT6582 or MT6592 SoCs is less profitable for MediaTek than a single-chip 4G solution would be, as of mid-2014 they have been adopted in some models by large manufacturers. However, the first generation of new affordable 4G smartphone models from large MediaTek clients such as Alcatel One Touch and ZTE use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 and 410 platforms with integrated 4G baseband. MediaTek has indicated that chips with 4G were expected to make up 20% of shipments in Q4 2014, with a significant increase expected for 2015, which will also see improvements to its <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> as new 4G chips allow it to target higher market segments.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 the Bell System {{broke up}} into the various Baby Bell {{operating}} companies and AT. As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period. In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT into Lucent Technologies.|$|E

By 1998, Monster was producing 1,000 different products out of a distribution and manufacturing center in Brisbane, California that was established that year. It had created a record label company, Monster Music, in 1989, which was followed by Monster Power for power products such as power cords and surge protectors, in 1998, Monster Game for video game accessories in 2000 and the Monster Mobile division [...] which markets cell phone and digital camera accessories in 2001. A Monster Photo product line was created in 2003 that includes power cells, cables and bags for digital cameras, followed by Monster Signature Series Power. In 2004, it created a spin-off called M-Design, run by Lee's son, which sells furniture with electronics built in.|$|E

The Rally-based Spirit was the successor to VAM's American Rally AMX top-of-the-line performance model that was based on the 1978 U.S. domestic market AMC Concord AMX while the Gremlin-based Spirit can be described as a generation change within an already existing model.|$|E

The Javelin introduced many firsts for VAM, such as a standard four-speed manual transmission and the option for the first time in a regular production model of a three-speed automatic transmission. These were the only transmissions available on the Javelin and only with floor-mounted shifters, just as on the two-seater AMX. Cars with the automatic included a center console with locking compartment, as well as power drum brakes at no extra cost.|$|E
