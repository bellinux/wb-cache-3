40|$|Nowadays in a {{turbulent}} market, developing and launching {{a new product}} is one of most competitive strategies implemented by many large and small enterprises. In fact, launching a new product depends upon the performance of four critical functions: design, manufacturing, distribution and marketing. Their performances would increase or decrease the total time-to-market and consequently time-to-money. Time-to-market would be improved if the manufacturing system can diminish time-to-volume/quality/cost during <b>production</b> <b>start-up</b> phase. In order to overcome the impediment during a start-up phase, the significant parameters which are influencing a <b>production</b> <b>start-up</b> phase should be identified and managed. Hence, a system-wide approach would facilitate a product realization process so as to achieve global optimization throughout the entire process. One of such systems is Concurrent Engineering which can be applied owing to being enable to choose the best practice to improve product introduction process, being capable to improve cross functional integration and communication, and being empowered to apply a set of comprehensive methods for design analysis so that designers can select the most optimal design solution which is not only considering the design constraints, but also taking the constraints of production system, logistics and distribution into account.

40|$|Supplier and {{customer}} markets {{have become more}} global and have forced companies to consider restructuring their supply chains {{to take advantage of}} opportunities in terms of costs, competence, etc. at different locations. One way to take advantage of opportunities in other locations is to outsource parts of the production to suppliers. Production outsourcing implies change from in-house material supply to purchasing materials from a supplier; therefore, production outsourcing can affect material supply in terms of delivery reliability, lead times, and product quality. The focus of this thesis is how the production outsourcing transition from making to buying a product affects material supply. The overall purpose of the thesis is to understand how to ensure reliable and efficient material supply during the whole outsourcing process. With the whole outsourcing process is included from before physical transfer where the decision to outsource is made until a steady state is reached with a continuous supply from the new source. The thesis is answering three research questions using the results of six appended papers. The six papers are based on five studies, i. e., two single case studies, two multiple case studies, and one simulation study. Empirical data in the case studies were mainly collected through interviews with staff working in the outsourcing companies. The first research question identifies what logistics considerations are necessary for each of the phases of a general outsourcing process, in order to accomplish a well functioning supply chain during <b>production</b> transfer and <b>start-up</b> and steady state after physical transfer. The second research question provides a framework for the evaluation of the consequences of outsourcing and the impact on tied-up capital, product quality, customer service, and delivery flexibility of sourcing from a specific supplier. Further, the simulation study showed that supply chain performance can be improved through how the different parts of the supply chain are utilised, which can be accomplished through a sourcing strategy of sourcing stable demand globally and handle uncertainty locally. The third research question describes the material planning environment during <b>production</b> transfer and <b>start-up</b> and shows how the choice and application of the material planning process during <b>production</b> transfer and <b>start-up</b> affects supply chain performance.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on experiences from Volvo Car Corporation and examines pilot <b>production</b> and manufacturing <b>start-up,</b> processes that are here combined under the rubric final verification of product and production system. The purpose of this dissertation is to study pilot <b>production</b> and manufacturing <b>start-up</b> in order, first, to identify and analyze factors affecting final verification performance and, secondly, to develop general principles for how final verification performance can be improved. The concept "final verification performance" is operationalized and measured using the parameters "throughput time" and "efficiency". Final verification throughput time measures the time {{from the start of}} pilot production in the plant until quality targets and quantity targets are attained. Final verification efficiency is measured as the extra cost of manufacturing incurred above a standard cost level as a result of disturbances in the final verification process. The dissertation contributes to an understanding of how the process of getting new products to the market can be shortened and made more efficient. There is a general trend within the automotive industry toward decreasing product life cycles and increasing investment in product and process development. The time from the start of sales until to the product is removed from production is getting shorter, which results in a diminishing window of opportunity for each newly developed product. This window can be enlarged either by making the start-up phase steeper or by hitting the market earlier. Getting high volumes of quality-assured products to the market rapidly and at low cost is essential for competitive success. From this perspective, pilot <b>production</b> and manufacturing <b>start-up</b> are two processes that affect the performance objectives as regards development costs, time to market, and quality. Yet they are generally treated as separate phenomena, either unrelated or only loosely connected, rather than as one integrated process. There is a general lack of empirical studies capturing the complexity of the two processes and the problems encountered during them. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} studies of the factors affecting performance during the final verification process and suggesting how performance can be improved. Six separate case studies conducted within the scope of two longitudinal research projects make up the empirical base. The projects were carried out at two production facilities, namely the manufacturing of engines at the East plant in Skövde (Sweden) and the final assembly of automobiles in Torslanda (Sweden) and Gent (Belgium). Drawing on the results of the case studies, this dissertation contributes: (i) a framework of concepts and models for studying and analyzing the process of final verification; (ii) a measurement instrument based on factors affecting final verification performance; and (iii) methodological and organizational principles for improving final verification performance.
