25|$|It is {{possible}} to identify the type of inhibitory effect a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.|$|E
25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an action {{potential in the}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> will trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} part or region of a neuron to change in strength over time. There are two largely recognized categories of plasticity: synaptic and nonsynaptic. Synaptic plasticity deals directly with the strength of the connection between two neurons, including amount of neurotransmitter released from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron,</b> and the response generated in the postsynaptic neuron. Nonsynaptic plasticity involves modification of neuronal excitability in the axon, dendrites, and soma of an individual neuron, remote from the synapse.|$|E
50|$|Glycine {{transporters}} (GlyTs) are plasmalemmal neurotransmitter transporters. They {{serve to}} terminate the signaling of glycine by mediating its reuptake from the synaptic cleft into back <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> There are two glycine transporters: glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) and glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2).|$|R
30|$|Reserpine is an {{antipsychotic}} and {{antihypertensive drug}} {{used for the}} relief of psychotic symptoms, and irreversibly blocks VMATs in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> (Preskorn 2007). Reserpine was proposed to directly bind and competitively inhibit the efflux pump during proton/substrate antiport (Holler et al. 2012).|$|R
50|$|The {{postsynaptic cell}} {{then goes on}} to {{innervate}} the targeted end effector (i.e. gland, smooth muscle, etc.). Because paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord, <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts, which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations.|$|R
25|$|A neuron affects other neurons by {{releasing}} a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined {{not by the}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> or by the neurotransmitter, but {{by the type of}} receptor that is activated. A neurotransmitter {{can be thought of as}} a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks. Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> {{releasing}} an inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as GABA, can cause an {{inhibitory postsynaptic potential}} (IPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron, bringing the membrane potential {{farther away from the}} threshold, decreasing its excitability and making it more difficult for the neuron to initiate an action potential. If an IPSP overlaps with an EPSP, the IPSP can in many cases prevent the neuron from firing an action potential. In this way, the output of a neuron may depend on the input of many different neurons, each of which may have a different degree of influence, depending on the strength and type of synapse with that neuron. John Carew Eccles performed some of the important early experiments on synaptic integration, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963. Complex input/output relationships form the basis of transistor-based computations in computers, and are thought to figure similarly in neural circuits.|$|E
500|$|In certain brain regions, {{amphetamine}} {{increases the}} concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. Amphetamine can enter the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> either through [...] or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter. Upon entering the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron,</b> amphetamine activates [...] which, through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, causes DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization ( [...] reuptake inhibition), but [...] phosphorylation alone induces the reversal of dopamine transport through DAT (i.e., dopamine [...] ). Amphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through an unidentified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux. Through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, [...] reduces the firing rate of dopamine neurons, preventing a hyper-dopaminergic state.|$|E
40|$|Synaptic {{activity}} modulates synaptic {{efficacy and}} {{is important in}} learning and development. Here we show that development of excitability in <b>presynaptic</b> motor <b>neurons</b> required synaptic activation of postsynaptic muscle cells. Synaptic blockade broadened action potentials and decreased repetitive firing of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Consistent with these findings, synaptic blockade also decreased potassium-current density in the presynaptic cell. Application of neurotrophin- 3, but not related neurotrophins, prevented these changes. Recordings from patches of somatic membrane indicated that modifications of presynaptic potassium and sodium currents occurred in a remote, nonsynaptic compartment. Thus, activity-dependent postsynaptic signals modulated presynaptic excitability, potentially regulating transmission at all synapses of the presynaptic cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> remains controversial. This study utilized dopaminergic and noradrenergic toxins {{to assess the}} presence of COMT in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> originating from the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area or locus coeruleus. Destruction of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons was assessed by measuring the dopamine and noradrenaline content in the projection areas of these neurons. Additionally, COMT protein expression and activity were examined in several projection areas {{to determine whether there}} are any changes in COMT values. Colocalization studies were done to identify COMT-containing postsynaptic neurons. Despite successful lesioning of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons, no changes in COMT protein expression or activity could be noted. These results strongly suggest that COMT is not present in presynaptic dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons. There was a high colocalization of COMT with the GABAergic marker of short neurons both in the striatum and cortex but only a weak, if any, with the cholinergic marker in the cortex...|$|R
40|$|Layer V {{pyramidal}} {{cells in}} rat barrel cortex {{are considered to}} play an important role in intracolumnar and transcolumnar signal processing. However, the precise circuitry mediating this processing is still incompletely understood. Here we obtained detailed maps of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto the two major layer V pyramidal cell subtypes, intrinsically burst spiking (IB) and regular spiking (RS) cells, using a combination of caged glutamate photolysis, whole- cell patch- clamp recording, and three- dimensional reconstruction of biocytin- labeled cells. To excite <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> with laminar specificity, the release of caged glutamate was calibrated and restricted to small areas of 50 x 50 mum in all cortical layers and in at least two neighboring barrel- related columns. IB cells received intracolumnar excitatory input from all layers, with the largest EPSP amplitudes originating from neurons in layers IV and VI. Prominent transcolumnar excitatory inputs were provided by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> also located in layers IV, V, and VI of neighboring columns. Inhibitory inputs were rare. In contrast, RS cells received distinct intracolumnar inhibitory inputs, especially from layers II/ III and V. Intracolumnar excitatory inputs to RS cells were prominent from layers II- V, but relatively weak from layer VI. Conspicuous transcolumnar excitatory inputs could be evoked solely in layers IV and V. Our results show that layer V pyramidal cells are synaptically driven by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> located in every layer of the barrel cortex. RS cells seem to be preferentially involved in intracolumnar signal processing, whereas IB cells effectively integrate excitatory inputs across several columns...|$|R
500|$|Amphetamine {{is also a}} {{substrate}} for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter, [...] Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2, amphetamine induces {{the collapse}} of the vesicular pH gradient, which results in the release of dopamine molecules from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol via dopamine efflux through VMAT2. Subsequently, the cytosolic dopamine molecules are released from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> into the synaptic cleft via reverse transport at [...]|$|E
500|$|Once in the synapse, {{dopamine}} binds to and activates dopamine receptors. These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors, {{which are}} located on dendrites (the postsynaptic neuron), or presynaptic autoreceptors (e.g., the D2sh and presynaptic D3 receptors), which {{are located on}} the membrane of an axon terminal (the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron).</b> [...] After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter. Once back in the cytosol, dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2, making it available for future release.|$|E
2500|$|In neurons with [...] TAAR1, TAAR1 {{agonists}} {{increase the}} concentrations of the associated monoamines in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing post-synaptic receptor binding. Through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs), TAAR1 can reduce the firing rate of dopamine neurons, in turn preventing a hyper-dopaminergic state. [...] Amphetamine and trace amines can enter the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> either through [...] or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine and trace amines produce competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter.

50|$|The {{vesicular}} monoamine transporter (VMAT) is a {{transport protein}} {{integrated into the}} membrane of synaptic vesicles of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> It acts to transport monoamine neurotransmitters - such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine - into the vesicles, which release the neurotransmitters into synapses as chemical messages to postsynaptic neurons. VMATs utilize a proton gradient generated by V-ATPases in vesicle membranes to power monoamine import.|$|R
25|$|Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is {{released}} from <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> into the synaptic cleft. It {{acts as a}} ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A.|$|R
40|$|Pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{glycoprotein}} E (gE) {{is a type}} I {{viral membrane}} protein that facilitates the anterograde spread of viral infection from the peripheral nervous system to the brain. In animal models, a gE-null mutant infection spreads inefficiently from <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> to postsynaptic neurons (anterograde spread of infection). However, the retrograde spread of infection from post- to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> remains unaffected. Here we show that gE is required for wild-type localization of viral structural proteins in axons of infected neurons. During a gE-null PRV infection, a subset of viral glycoproteins, capsids, and tegument proteins enter and localize to the axon inefficiently. This defect is most obvious in the distal axon and growth cones. However, axonal entry and localization of other viral membrane proteins and endogenous cellular proteins remains unaffected. Neurons infected with gE-null mutants produce wild-type levels of viral structural proteins and infectious virions in the cell body. Our results indicate that reduced axonal targeting of viral structural proteins is a compelling explanation {{for the lack of}} anterograde spread in neural circuits following infection by a gE-null mutant...|$|R
2500|$|Cocaine blocks DAT by binding {{directly}} to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport. In contrast, amphetamine enters the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to [...] or enters synaptic vesicles through [...] When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKIIα-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine.|$|E
2500|$|Here is {{a summary}} of the {{sequence}} of events that take place in synaptic transmission from a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> to a postsynaptic cell.

2500|$|Cocaine {{prevents}} the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. [...] Thus {{they stay in}} the synapse longer, causing excitement of the sympathetic nervous system and evoking a stress response. The euphoria experienced by cocaine users {{is thought to be}} largely due to the way it {{prevents the}} neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> which released it.|$|E
40|$|SummaryEmerging data {{implicate}} microRNAs (miRNAs) in {{the regulation}} of synaptic structure and function, but we know little about their role {{in the regulation}} of neurotransmission in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Here, we demonstrate that the miR- 310 – 313 cluster is required for normal synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of miR- 310 – 313 cluster leads to a significant enhancement of neurotransmitter release, which can be rescued with temporally restricted expression of mir- 310 – 313 in larval <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Kinesin family member, Khc- 73 is a functional target for miR- 310 – 313 as its expression is increased in mir- 310 – 313 mutants and reducing it restores normal synaptic function. Cluster mutants show an increase in the active zone protein Bruchpilot accompanied by an increase in electron dense T bars. Finally, we show that repression of Khc- 73 by miR- 310 – 313 cluster influences the establishment of normal synaptic homeostasis. Our findings establish a role for miRNAs in the regulation of neurotransmitter release...|$|R

2500|$|The {{strength}} of a synapse has been defined by Sir Bernard Katz {{as the product of}} (presynaptic) release probability pr, quantal size q (the postsynaptic response to the release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle, a 'quantum'), and n, the number of release sites.

2500|$|The α2 {{receptor}} {{couples to}} the Gi/o protein. It is a presynaptic receptor, causing negative feedback on, for example, norepinephrine (NE). When NE is {{released into the}} synapse, it feeds back on the α2 receptor, causing less NE release from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> This decreases the effect of NE. [...] There are also α2 receptors on the nerve terminal membrane of the post-synaptic adrenergic neuron.|$|E

40|$|Young Investigator Colloquium 3 To {{address the}} role of serotonergic {{projections}} from dorsal raphe nucleus to the medial vestibular nucleus (MV), whole-cell patchclamp was employed to investigate the serotonergic modulation of spontaneous synaptic transmission within the MV of rats. Perfusion of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) to brainstem slices robustly facilitated both spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in a subgroup of MV neurons. That this enhancement effect of 5 -HT on sIPSCs and sEPSCs were both abolished with tetrodotoxin indicates that 5 -HT acts on its receptor that expressed in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Using different receptor antagonists, we further identified that GABAA and glycine receptors {{took part in the}} enhancement effect on sIPSCs whereas AMPA receptor was involved in sEPSCs. This 5 -HT-induced effect on both sIPSCs and sEPSCs could be mimicked with application of 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist but was blocked with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist.

2500|$|Dopaminergic {{antipsychotics}} affect dopamine neurons by binding to postsynaptic dopamine receptors, {{where they}} function as receptor antagonists; in contrast, ADHD stimulants are indirect agonists of postsynaptic dopamine receptors; in other words, these stimulants increase levels of synaptic dopamine which then binds to postsynaptic receptors.

2500|$|Action {{potentials}} {{are most}} commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> Typically, neurotransmitter molecules are {{released by the}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. [...] This binding opens various types of ion channels. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the cell membrane and, thus, the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory. [...] Whether the voltage is increased or decreased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the cable equation and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with {{the distance from the}} synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter. [...] Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the axon hillock and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential. [...] More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must work together at nearly the same time to provoke a new action potential.
