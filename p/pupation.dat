5|$|The {{period from}} {{hatching}} to <b>pupation</b> lasts 10 days to two years, exceptionally {{up to six}} years. Climate is a major factor, because development is slower in colder regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a <b>pupation</b> stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
25|$|A prepupal {{stage is}} often present and {{characterized}} by larval dispersion and migration {{away from the}} food source {{in search of a}} <b>pupation</b> site. The body length of the larva decreases during this stage in preparation for <b>pupation.</b> If the larvae are restricted from movement and not allowed to disperse during the prepupal stage, a 24-hour delay in <b>pupation</b> will be observed. Thus, in medicocriminal investigations, if a corpse is wrapped and causes restriction of maggot migration, altered developmental times should be considered. The prepupal stage takes 1.5 days and the pupal stage takes 3 days at a temperature of 29°C. <b>Pupation</b> usually occurs near the soil surface or near decaying flesh, and the skin of the larvae hardens to form a dark brown puparium or outer casing. Adults emerge after <b>pupation</b> and mate 3–7 days after emergence in summer, and 910 days after emergence in autumn. Adults are capable of living for 2330 days, and oviposition occurs about 5 days after mating.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of <b>pupation</b> they descend close to the ground, looking for {{suitable}} spots to pupate. The caterpillar constructs a tubular cell from a leaf by drawing the edges together with thick strands of silk. In this cell, the caterpillar prepares an extensive silk bed on which it sits awaiting <b>pupation.</b> The freshly formed pupa clings onto the silken pad almost immediately.|$|E
25|$|Silkworm {{breeding}} {{is aimed}} at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better <b>pupation</b> rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced {{are directly related to}} the <b>pupation</b> rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater <b>pupation</b> rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.|$|E
25|$|When the {{population}} is spread out and running low, <b>pupation</b> can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, <b>pupation</b> is not restricted to these locations, but can take place in sheltered and open locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees. Usually, the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.|$|E
25|$|Parasites {{include the}} tachinid flies Sturmia convergens and Lespesia archippivora. Lesperia-parasitized {{butterfly}} larvae suspend, but die prior to <b>pupation.</b> The fly's maggot lowers {{itself to the}} ground, forms a brown puparium and then emerges as an adult.|$|E
25|$|The larvae reach {{maturity}} between mid-June {{and early}} July, then enter the pupal stage, during which larvae change into adult moths. <b>Pupation</b> lasts from seven to 14–17 days. The adult moth will emerge, fully developed, by splitting the pupal skin.|$|E
25|$|S. haemorrhoidalis {{is hardly}} ever used in {{forensic}} investigations, {{due to its}} global distribution {{and the fact that}} little is known about them. Usually, other more researched flies and beetles, if present on the body, take precedence. The fly has a <b>pupation</b> time ranging from 93 hours to 153 hours. Development from larvae to adult can range from 252 to 802 hours. Knowing the <b>pupation</b> and life cycle times of S. haemorrhoidalis and taking into consideration that this species is ovoviviparous allows investigators to calculate how long the fly has been on the corpse. If time of colonization of the corpse by maggots is known, it can help determine the PMI, or post-mortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Under {{artificial}} rearing the <b>pupation</b> {{took place on}} the underside of the leaf. The pupa is attached by a white pad at the cremaster, and has a fine girdle. It is only 22mm long and the colour varies from yellow green on young growth, to emerald on mature leaves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pupation</b> {{takes place}} {{low to the}} ground. The pupa is {{suspended}} by a silken body band and attached to the substrate by a black cremaster. Its entire body is bright leaf green. A continuous yellow runs from the cremaster to the head, the head ending in a snout. In the similar Catopsilia pyranthe the snout is short.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} grow fast in warm weather, sometimes pupating {{within a}} month. Caterpillars have 4 moults in total. The pupa remains {{attached to a}} foodplant stem by a silk girdle. <b>Pupation</b> lasts {{for two or three}} weeks and in good years there can be as many as three generations per year, with adults still on the wing at the beginning of November.|$|E
25|$|Most saturniid larvae feed on {{the foliage}} of trees and shrubs. A few, {{particularly}} Hemileucinae such as Automeris louisiana, A. patagonensis, and Hemileuca oliviae, feed on grasses. They moult at regular intervals, usually four to six times before entering the pupal stage. Prior to <b>pupation,</b> a wandering stage occurs, and the caterpillar may change colour, becoming more cryptic just before this stage.|$|E
25|$|Come <b>pupation</b> time, {{the larvae}} become {{yellowish}} green and the longitudinal lines disappear. The pupa stage lasts for 16 to 29 days during late {{spring and early}} summer and decreases during the peak summertime. The pupae are 11–13mm long and pale green. They are suspended head downward from a silken pad at their abdomen, called a cremaster, either from a log, a food plant, or a stick.|$|E
25|$|The pupae {{start off}} the same creamy white colour as the larvae, but slowly {{turn to a}} dark brown during <b>pupation.</b> They have a soft body and are {{generally}} shorter and thicker than the grass grub larvae, they grow to between 10–30mm in length. The pupae have a thin translucent skin called the epidermal layer, through which the developing wings and legs can be seen.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of <b>pupation</b> the {{caterpillar}} {{comes out of the}} leaf and weaves a silk pad and a tight body band and then moults to form the pupa. The pupa can be either on the under or upper surface of the leaf. It is yellow and covered with long light hairs. The pupa is also marked with numerous black spots all over the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pupation</b> occurs {{relatively}} {{close to}} the food source of the S. nudiseta larvae {{because they tend to}} not typically migrate very far. S. nudiseta larvae {{are one of the few}} species that can successfully pupate in a confined location. Besides the encasing cocoon, the outside environment is also helpful to the protection of this puparium since dust and soil particles have been found coating the outside surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} Micrococcus flacidifex danai also infects larvae. Just before <b>pupation,</b> {{the larvae}} migrate to a horizontal surface and die {{a few hours}} later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no invasive powers, but causes secondary infections in weakened insects. It is a common {{cause of death in}} laboratory-reared insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproduction}} and survival rates of C. megacephala {{are closely related}} to developmental factors, including the amount of available food, and competition from larvae of other species, such as C. rufifacies. In the presence of competing larvae, those of C. megacephala spend less time feeding, leading to early <b>pupation,</b> smaller adults, and early reproduction. C. rufifacies is known to cannibalize maggot masses and is thus a huge competitor.|$|E
25|$|Haliplids live in {{the aquatic}} {{vegetation}} {{around the edges of}} small ponds, lakes, and quiet streams. Adults are omnivorous, eating insect eggs, small crustaceans, hydrozoan polyps, and algae, while the larvae eat only algae. The species of Peltodytes deposit eggs on the surface of aquatic plants, while Haliplus chews out a cavity in the plants for their eggs. There are three instars, and <b>pupation</b> takes place on land in a chamber constructed by the larva.|$|E
25|$|When larvae hatch {{from their}} eggs, {{they are either}} red or yellow. Their bodies have a slender and flat {{appearance}} with short legs due to their minimal movement. The larvae are covered in hair and have two horn-type projections on the dorsal area of the last body segment. Immediately after birth, they start searching for food close to where they hatched. They feed on wood-borer insects on trees, or feed on their species' substrate or prey of choice. Feeding is {{the main purpose of}} the larval stage to prepare for <b>pupation.</b> Once their larval stage is complete the tree dwelling species {{make their way to the}} bottom of the tree to pupate. The pupal stage can last from 6 weeks to one year depending on the need to overwinter, and how short the overall lifecycle is for a particular species. A majority of clerid species pupate in earthen cells which are made from soil and certain enzymes secreted from their mouths. The rest remain in pupal cells. Adult beetles emerge from <b>pupation</b> and spend a variable time of their life maturing, and eventually oviposit. Sexually mature adults or imagos of Thanasiumus sp. overwinter inside the wood-borer-infested trees and oviposit during the spring.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} and {{development}} of Phormia regina {{is similar to that}} of most other dipteran species, in which females oviposit their eggs into a nutrient substrate and after hatching the larvae continue feeding throughout three instar stages until they have stored up enough calories to commence <b>pupation</b> and finally emerge as adult blow flies. Each transition from first, second, and third instar is marked by a molt, and eventually the third-instar larvae develop sclerotized (hardened) casings which envelop and protect them throughout metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|A picornavirus-like causes {{sacbrood}} disease. Affected larvae {{change from}} pearly white to gray and finally black. Death {{occurs when the}} larvae are upright, just before <b>pupation.</b> Consequently, affected larvae are usually found in capped cells. Head development of diseased larvae is typically retarded. The head region is usually darker {{than the rest of}} the body and may lean toward the center of the cell. When affected larvae are carefully removed from their cells, they appear to be a sac filled with water. Typically, the scales are brittle but easy to remove. Sacbrood-diseased larvae have no characteristic odor.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} of development, it is {{relatively}} large compared to the earlier instars. The caterpillar completes its growth. At this point, it is 25 to 45mm long and 5 to 8mm wide. This {{can be compared to}} the first instar, which was 2 to 6mm long and 0.5 to 1.5mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before <b>pupation,</b> larva must consume milkweed to increase their mass. Larva stop feeding and search for a <b>pupation</b> site. The caterpillar attaches itself securely to a horizontal surface, using a silk pad. At this point, it latches on with its hindlegs and hangs down. It then molts into an opaque, blue-green chrysalis with small gold dots. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8–15 days. The cuticle of the chrysalis becomes transparent and the monarch's characteristic orange-and-black wings become visible. At the end of metamorphosis, the adult emerges from the chrysalis, expands and dries its wings and flies away. Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larva and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.|$|E
25|$|Cleridae have a {{large number}} of niches and feeding habits. Most genera are predaceous and feed on other beetles and larvae; however other genera are {{scavengers}} or pollen feeders. Clerids have elongated bodies with bristly hairs, are usually bright colored, and have variable antennae. Checkered beetles range in length between 3 millimeters and 24 millimeters. Cleridae can be identified based on their 5–5–5 tarsal formula, division of sternites, and the absence of a special type of vesicle. Female Cleridae lay between 28–42 eggs at a time predominately under the bark of trees. Larvae are predaceous and feed vigorously before <b>pupation</b> and subsequently emergence as adults.|$|E
25|$|These are medium nematocerans, halfway in size between {{mosquitoes}} and midges. The body is compact, wings are clear except for veins close to leading edge, and antennae are short with compact segments appearing like rings. Thorax is dorsally humped and dark brown or black (see photograph of Simulium). Life-cycle {{is similar to}} mosquitoes: females lay eggs on plants at surface of streams and rivers; larvae settle onto solid substrate in water and feed on suspended organic detritus; <b>pupation</b> occurs at water surface. Hosts are most livestock species, horses and poultry and many wild animals. Humans also may be severely distressed by blackflies. Feeding is through skin with short complex slashing mouthparts.|$|E
25|$|Predatory coccinellids {{are usually}} found on plants which harbour their prey. They {{lay their eggs}} near their prey, to {{increase}} the likelihood the larvae will find the prey easily. In Harmonia axyridis, eggs hatch in three to four days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen. Depending on resource availability, the larvae pass through four instars over 10–14 days, after which <b>pupation</b> occurs. After a teneral period of several days, the adults become reproductively active {{and are able to}} reproduce again later, although they may become reproductively quiescent if eclosing late in the season. Total life span is one to two years on average.|$|E
25|$|The Vanessa indica is not {{reported}} as a pest on any crop but on ramie it causes considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect {{the growth of}} the plant. The larvae of this insect feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look like the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and later fold the leaves {{in such a way that}} both the margins are attached by a silky web and <b>pupation</b> takes place inside the folded leaf. Later the adult emerges as a butterfly.|$|E
25|$|The first instar of the {{larval stage}} is between 1.5–3mm long. These larvae {{have been found}} to have a very high {{mortality}} rate when compared to other larvae at this stage of development. There is only approximately a 65% survival rate after this instar. At the second instar, the larvae are 3–7mm long and have a very high level of viability. During the third instar level, the larvae are 7-19.5mm. This level is broken down into two stages. The first stage is when the larvae continue to feed and collect nutrients needed during <b>pupation.</b> The second stage of development is when the third instar larvae begin the search for a suitable place to pupate where it can begin the pre-pupal stage.|$|E
25|$|Adults of {{the genus}} Hippobosca are large, robust flies that retain their wings to fly for {{repeated}} blood meals, between hosts such as cattle, camels or horses in a herd. Stout piercing mouthparts project downward from the head (see Hippobosca in Gallery). The abdomen bulges largely, especially when containing a developing larva. The life-cycle is the larviparous type, {{similar to that of}} tsetse-flies, few offspring are produced per female but their survival rate is high. In species that never develop wings as adults, such as Melophagus ovinus, the sheep-ked, the fully developed larvae are deposited by the female on the hair coat of the host. There <b>pupation</b> occurs rapidly followed by complete metamorphosis into an adult (see photograph of Melophagus).|$|E
25|$|Through {{the study}} of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis larvae, {{barbiturates}} were found to increase {{the length of the}} larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase {{in the time it takes}} to reach the stage of <b>pupation.</b> Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development. However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults. Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{butterflies}} take flower nectar {{and sometimes}} roost in trees. Adults fly {{through much of}} the year. The natural habitat is open brushy areas and subtropical hammocks, often in pine woodlands. Many populations now exist in suburban areas with ornamental cycads. Adults keep close to a site with host plants, thus the species forms small colonies. The females, however, may disperse in search of more hosts. The butterfly's flight is slow, unlike the swift, erratic flight of many other Lycaenidae. Like many Lepidoptera, male Atalas have hair-pencils (coremata) on their abdomens used in courtship—the male hovers in front of the female, wafting pheromones exuded from the pencils in her direction. Eggs are laid in clusters of 10-50 on the leaf tips of the host plant. Larvae feed on the leaves. <b>Pupation</b> is usually on the host plant.|$|E
25|$|P. exigua nests {{are white}} or light brown and exhibit domed, paper {{envelopes}}. These fibrous envelopes {{cover the entire}} comb. The comb is suspended from a leaf or branch {{by one or more}} peduncles, with an exit-hole on the side or bottom of the envelope. The nests are also observed to provide many entrance holes, which seem to be a unique feature to the species. On average, there are 1.7 combs and 566 cells per colony. While P. exigua nests typically have one comb, additional combs are sometimes found on certain nests. Cells with brown wafers of meconium towards the bottom indicate that there has been an emergence of new larvae; this discoloration {{is the result of the}} larva shedding its waste products during <b>pupation.</b> P. exigua tend to build their nests in locations facing west; it is suggested that this specific placement leads to higher environmental temperatures and proportionally greater foraging activity.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of dipteran flies {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. Veterinary parasitology also covers arthropods in the Class Acari, the ticks of domestic animals and mites of livestock which have distinctly different structure from arthropods in the Class Insecta. However, flies in the Order Diptera show clear division of the body into head, thorax and abdomen with distinct segmentation of the thorax and abdomen. The thorax contains large blocks of muscle that power the single pair of wings. Digestive and reproductive organs fill the abdomen. Also unique to the Diptera {{is a pair of}} halteres (derived from wings during evolution) that aid agile flight by these flies. Mosquitoes have veined and scaled wings, long legs, long hypodermic mouthparts sheathed in a protective labium (see photograph of Aedes female engorged with blood). Adult females lay eggs in batches on surface of stagnant water. Larvae feed on microorganisms and organic detritus in water. <b>Pupation</b> occurs at the surface of the water. Feeding by females is {{on a wide variety of}} mammals and birds, whilst males feed on plant sugars.|$|E
25|$|The {{developmental}} {{stages of}} C. megacephala include egg, larva and pupa. A female fly may lay {{as many as}} 200 to 300 eggs, often in human feces, meat or fish. Larval stages include first, second and third instals or growth periods. The eggs take approximately one day to develop, while the larvae take 5.4 days and the pupae 5.3 days. Population numbers as well as body size are greatly influenced by temperature. The adult lifespan of the fly is approximately seven days. The development of C. megacephala {{is linked to the}} length of time spent feeding in the larval stage, as well as to temperature; the lower the temperature, the more slowly the larvae develop. In laboratory studies conducted at 27°C., eggs hatch in 18 hours; the first molt occurs in 30 hours; the second molt in 72 hours; <b>pupation</b> after 144 hours; and the adult emerges after approximately 234 hours. These intervals vary depending on geographical location; other environmental factors also can determine how long flies will stay in the larval stage. Males tend to emerge two or three hours ahead of the females.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{grass grub}} has an annual life cycle, taking {{typically}} one year under normal climatic conditions but {{can take up}} to two years in adverse weather such as drought or significant cold periods (this also includes periods where the soil moisture is very high), or due to a food shortage. Over that one-year period the adult beetles live for 4–6 weeks emerging in spring (October – December) when the air temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and undertake two main flights, the first flight is to mate and the second and consecutive are to feed and lay clutches of eggs. Females are the last to emerge from the soil, this leads to localized infestations due to them being unable to reach a significant distance before being mated. Egg cluster size can range from 5-80 eggs and range from 80–250mm {{below the surface of the}} soil. Females can lay two to three clusters over a two to three week period. Costelytra zealandica larvae hatch between November and March (depending on the time they were laid). They start to feed on roots of clover and pasture plants from the time they hatch until September. They undergo three stages called instars before <b>pupation.</b>|$|E
