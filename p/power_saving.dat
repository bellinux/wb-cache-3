40|$|Abstract — It is {{well known}} that {{significant}} <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> can be obtained by disabling or shutting down parts of a circuit during idle periods. One method is to use a high level partitioning technique which considers both the controller and the datapath together. The FSMD is split into two or more simpler communicating processors. These separate processors can then be clock gated or power gated to achieve dramatic <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> since only one processor is active at any given time. Here, we propose a technique which uses simulated annealing to efficiently partition a FSMD for power gating. We use this non-linear model to partition 4 application circuits. We then develop a framework to estimate the potential <b>power</b> <b>savings.</b> The estimation framework shows that up to 69 % static <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> and 30 % dynamic <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> can be expected.

25|$|Annual {{wind power}} {{production}} is currently (2014) equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in Denmark. The proportion {{of this that}} is actually consumed in Denmark has been disputed, as the considerable hydropower resources of Norway (and to some extent, Sweden) is used as grid storage with low loss. Hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating <b>power,</b> <b>saving</b> water for later, and can export electricity to Denmark when wind power output drops. Short term, Denmark imports electricity from Norway during daytime and exports in nighttime. Long term, Denmark imports electricity in summer and exports in winter. Wind is higher in autumn and winter, when consumption is also high. This service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found {{around the world in}} pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants.|$|E

2500|$|Like their mobile K6-2+/III+ predecessors, the CPUs {{were capable}} of dynamic clock {{adjustment}} for power optimization, and also {{was the reason for}} the unlocked multiplier. When the system is idle, the CPU clocks itself down via lower bus multiplier and selects a lower voltage. When a program demands more computational resources, the CPU quickly (there is some latency) returns to an intermediate or maximum speed with appropriate voltage to meet the demand. This technology was marketed as [...] "PowerNow!" [...] and was similar to Intel's SpeedStep <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> technique. The feature was controlled by the CPU, motherboard BIOS, and operating system.

Many algorithms have been proposed for periodic and aperiodic task models but none support the canonical sporadic task model.

DVSST was implemented in the µC/OS-II real-time operating system for embedded systems and its overhead was measured using a stand-alone Rabbit 2000 test board.
