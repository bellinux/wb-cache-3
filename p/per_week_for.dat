5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours <b>per</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|On Dominica, Omar's close pass to {{the island}} left 30 {{families}} homeless and severely hampered the fishing community. On December15, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved $9.16million for assistance to those affected by Omar {{on the island and}} to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane. On December18, the government of Dominica invested $4million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of 140 fishermen were provided with $250 <b>per</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> a total of four weeks. Sixty-two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased 121 boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another $794,000 was spent to repair 47 boats and construct another 28 that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the {{frequency}} of breakfast eating was related with overweight/obesity in Korean adolescents. Method: We analyzed the data collected in the 5 th KYRBWS, in which 72, 399 adolescents participated in 2009. We assessed the association between frequency of breakfast eating and body mass index by using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 20, 962 (54. 9 %) boys and 18, 479 (54. 0 %) girls skipped breakfast 7 days(all days) <b>per</b> <b>week</b> at baseline. <b>For</b> boys, the odds ratios(ORs) between being overweight and frequency of breakfast eating were 1. 040 for 3 - 5 times <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 092 <b>for</b> 1 - 2 time(s) <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 059 <b>for</b> no breakfast <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> compared to 6 - 7 times per week(p> 0. 05). The ORs between being obese and frequency of breakfast eating were 1. 011 for 3 - 5 times <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 0. 968 <b>for</b> 1 - 2 time(s) <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> and 0. 932 <b>for</b> no breakfast <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> compared to 6 - 7 times per week(p> 0. 05). For girls, the ORs between being overweight and frequency of breakfast eating were 0. 990 for 3 - 5 times <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 0. 992 <b>for</b> 1 - 2 time(s) <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 019 <b>for</b> no breakfast <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> compared to 6 - 7 times per week(p> 0. 05).

25|$|The {{poverty line}} in the UK is {{commonly}} defined as being 60% of the median household income.

In the same year, 4.0million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into account.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a cohort study of alcohol consumption and total cancer incidence and mortality in 73 [*] 281 subjects (35 [*] 007 men and 38 [*] 274 women) aged 40 – 59 {{years old at}} baseline over a 10 -year follow-up period. During 1990 – 2001, a total of 3403 cases of newly diagnosed cancer and 1208 cancer deaths were identified. In men, the lowest risk of developing cancer was observed among occasional drinkers, and a linear positive association with increased ethanol intake was noted (hazard ratio 1. 18 for 1 – 149 [*]g <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 17 <b>for</b> 150 – 299 [*]g <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 43 <b>for</b> 300 – 449 [*]g <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> 1. 61 <b>for</b> ⩾ 450 [*]g <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> P <b>for</b> trend < 0. 001). The positive relation was similar for cancer incidence and mortality, but was more striking among current smokers and alcohol-related cancers. Relatively few women were regular drinkers. Our results suggest that increased ethanol intake linearly elevates the risk of cancer, and that nearly 13 % of cancers among males {{in this study were}} due to heavy drinking (⩾ 300 [*]g <b>per</b> <b>week</b> of ethanol), to which smoking substantially contributed. The simultaneous reduction of smoking is therefore important for reducing the effect of alcohol on cancer risk...|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we {{describe}} analyses to assess associations between total {{time spent on}} the internet and measures of physical activity and BMI.

A multivariate model examined associations of internet use with the number of days <b>per</b> <b>week</b> reported <b>for</b> each of the four physical activities. Models were adjusted for gender and race.
