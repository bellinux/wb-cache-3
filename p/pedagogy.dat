40|$|Designing {{learning}} environments to incorporate active learning <b>pedagogies</b> is difficult as definitions are often contested and intertwined. This article seeks {{to determine whether}} classification of active learning <b>pedagogies</b> (i. e., project-based, problem-based, inquiry-based, case-based, and discovery-based), through theoretical and practical lenses, could function as {{a useful tool for}} researchers and practitioners in comparing <b>pedagogies.</b> This article classified five active learning <b>pedagogies</b> based on six constructivist elements. The comparison was completed through a comparative analysis and a content analysis informed by a systematic literature review. The findings were that learner-centeredness is a primary goal of all pedagogies; however, there is a strong dissonance between each <b>pedagogy’s</b> theoretical underpinnings and implementation realities. This dissonance complicates differentiating active learning <b>pedagogies</b> and classification as a comparative tool has proved to have limited usefulness...|$|R

Africa has produced many outstanding knowledge systems, despite the fact that one can be led to think otherwise based on the projections of the major media. As a researcher, I became familiar with African ways of knowing by absorbing the rich, tradition-based heritage and cultural lore from my Jamaican-born parents. A review of the relevant literature confirms that much of what is classified as African religions, myths, and art are in fact best understood as elements of various African knowledge systems. This study examines African knowledge systems, their <b>pedagogies,</b> and the use of their <b>pedagogies</b> in the European American institutions of higher learning. Specifically, this study examines the use of African <b>pedagogies</b> by Dr. Grant D. Venerable II, who served as a professor of chemistry in various American universities. This study also examines the effect that African <b>pedagogies</b> had on the students of Dr. Venerable. This study finds that the <b>pedagogies</b> of African knowledge systems offers American students a unique and in-depth understanding of the subject matter and it also gives them a deeper appreciation for life. This study also finds that the <b>pedagogies</b> of African knowledge systems have a historical legacy that reaches back into ancient Africa. These systems and their <b>pedagogies</b> were brought to and preserved in North America by enslaved African people. Furthermore, such <b>pedagogies,</b> when the conditions are right, may be useful in American colleges and universities. Finally, this study calls for further research on other African American teachers who are holders of the <b>pedagogies</b> of African knowledge systems.

For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a large Australian {{commissioned}} research study that mapped classroom <b>pedagogies</b> called 2 ̆ 7 productive <b>pedagogies</b> 2 ̆ 7. The model of <b>pedagogies</b> derived from an admixture of theory and empirical observations and worked together what Fraser (1997) calls a politics of redistribution and a politics of recognition in its desire {{to make a difference}} in relation to schooling as a positional good, a good in and of itself, and in terms of making a difference in relation to the multiple differences extant in contemporary society. Statistical analysis of classroom observations indicated there were four dimensions of productive <b>pedagogies,</b> notably intellectual demand, connectedness, supportiveness and working with and valuing of difference. The actual <b>pedagogies</b> mapped were more akin to 2 ̆ 7 <b>pedagogies</b> of indifference 2 ̆ 7, not in relation to the extent of teacher care and teacher work as therapy, but in respect of making a difference, in the low levels of intellectual demand and connectedness, and in the virtual absence of the difference dimension across the approximately 1000 lessons observed. In working across the critical <b>pedagogies</b> literatures and empirical studies of classrooms the paper constitutes a pedagogical theory of the middle ground and attempts to provoke debate about future pedagogical research, related policy and classroom practices...|$|R

40|$|Within nursing education, {{graduate}} <b>pedagogies</b> {{are relatively}} unexplored, with research commonly focused upon undergraduate and continuing education. In {{order to address}} the increasingly complex organisational challenges in the workplace, mid-career nurses and midwives are turning to graduate education. In one graduate course on cultures of learning in the workplace, a constructivist approach to learning was adopted. Post-course analysis of data, from the feedback on the course from students, student choice of assignment topics, and reflections of the course facilitators, revealed three <b>pedagogies</b> unique to graduate education. The <b>pedagogies</b> were labelled 'keeping the space open', 'theoretical concepts as tools', and 'resonance and action as praxis'. The intended outcome of the course is revealed in a fourth theme, 'developing practice in the workplace'. This evaluation suggests that constructivist <b>pedagogies</b> used with graduate students may be different to those <b>pedagogies</b> used with undergraduate and continuing education students. We argue that graduate <b>pedagogies</b> move nursing education beyond strategies that seek integration of theory and practice, towards a dialectic between theory and practice. No Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own <b>pedagogy,</b> also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential <b>pedagogy</b> in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to reflect on “Buen Vivir” in relation to education in Ecuador, and analyzes real possibilities towards an education focused {{on the construction of}} a more just and fair society, where difference is experienced with equality and dignity. It is about an education for a society of “Good Living”. We propose the possibility of intercultural education practices where other epistemologies, other types of knowledge, other ways of being and understanding the world, other ways of learning and living, play a part. We propose thinking about education from different rationalities, often subaltern to an occidental modern rationality, traditionally viewed as the only legitimate truth. To think about a different kind of education presumes recognizing and learning about already existing experiences on intercultural education and cultural diversity in Ecuador. For this, other <b>pedagogies</b> are necessary. It is about <b>pedagogies</b> for social transformation, <b>pedagogies</b> for relevancy and autonomy, <b>pedagogies</b> for resistance, emancipation, liberation, and dialogue on an even ground, <b>pedagogies</b> that are respectful of differences, not homogenizing, that are about liberation and transformation.

There is a recognition that schools do not meet the needs of some boys. However, there is also a recognition that schools do not meet the needs of many girls and that some boys are a problem for girls and teachers as well as each other. Hence, this paper suggests ways in which <b>pedagogies</b> directed towards the specifics of boys 2 ̆ 7 education can improve the educational experiences of girls, boys and teachers. In the process it also notes some of the dangers of a take up of the productive <b>pedagogies</b> model with boys without a demonstrated commitment to gender justice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an Australian government-commissioned {{research}} study that documented classroom <b>pedagogies</b> in 24 Queensland schools. The research created {{the model of}} ‘productive pedagogies’, which conjoined what Nancy Fraser calls a politics of redistribution, recognition and representation. In this model <b>pedagogies</b> are differentiated to support the role of schooling as a positional good, a good in itself, and a good towards the betterment of the broader social world. In contrast with the model’s intentions, the <b>pedagogies</b> mapped in the study’s classrooms lacked differentiation; indeed, they reflected ‘pedagogies of indifference’ and were seen as producing and legitimising social inequalities. The paper theorises the redistributive, recognitive and representative justice possibilities of ‘productive pedagogies’ towards more equitable outcomes for marginalised students. The paper justifies its reprising of this research {{in light of the}} contemporary policy emphasis on teaching quality, the reductive impact on <b>pedagogies</b> of high-stakes testing, and the context of growing inequality which limits the potential effects of schools and teacher <b>pedagogies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: This paper reports {{doctoral}} {{research that}} explored body <b>pedagogies</b> in sport coaching and culture. Few {{studies have focused}} on body <b>pedagogies</b> as an integral dimension of sport coaching and on the experience of being coached and a member of a particular sporting culture. Even less is known about the long-term impact that particular body <b>pedagogies</b> may have on athletes’ lives, health and well-being. Purpose: This paper seeks to contribute to a growing literature that acknowledges coaching as a complex pedagogical and social process. It reports on research aimed at providing new insights into the expression and lived experiences of body <b>pedagogies</b> in the context of elite and sub-elite swimming. A particular aim of the research was to address the impact, if any, of body <b>pedagogies</b> on swimmers’ lives, health and well-being – first, at the time when the participants were adolescent elite and sub-elite swimmers, and second, some 10 – 30 years later. Methods: The research utilised narrative ethnography and autoethnography to explore the experiences of three female participants as adolescents participating at sub-elite and elite levels in Australian swimming, and as adults. Semi-structured interviews and collaborative development of narrative accounts were used to generate stories of experiences as adolescent swimmers and as adults in the present day. Findings: The experiences of these three swimmers suggest that body <b>pedagogies</b> focused on weight, shape, body fat and performance permeated Australian competitive swimming culture. These body <b>pedagogies</b> formed prominent aspects of the discourse of the participants’ coaches and their practice within this study. Furthermore, body <b>pedagogies</b> were shown to have powerful and long-standing influence upon the participants’ feelings about their bodies and themselves. This research also suggests, however, elements of mediation of and resistance to dominant ideas and established pedagogical practices. Conclusion: The research provides vivid insights into the subtle yet extremely powerful ways in which particular ideas ‘operate’ and become integral to ways of ‘being’ and ‘acting’ through body <b>pedagogies</b> within but also beyond both the sub-elite and elite contexts of Australian swimming sporting culture. Docility was shown by the three swimmers as they internalised body <b>pedagogies</b> and control, until they became their own ‘controller or overseer’ of their swimmer bodies. This points to a need for more research that focuses on the experiences and impact of body <b>pedagogies</b> in sport coaching...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{a large portion of}} {{scientific}} literature has been dedicated to the questions of realization of teaching and its improvement. However, one question remains in the background – folk <b>pedagogies</b> and their influence on teaching.    The main objective {{of this paper is to}} help us get acquainted with this phenomenon that exists in the teaching practice, its significance and pedagogical implications. In the first part of the paper, we deal with definitions of folk <b>pedagogies</b> and related concepts and their mutual relationship, in order to analyze the similarities and differences in the meaning of the concepts in use. Starting from important determinants of teachers’ folk <b>pedagogies,</b> we will attempt to reassess some of the proposed methods and ways to raise consciousness about teachers’ folk <b>pedagogies,</b> methods to analyze and change them. Based on the existing knowledge on teachers’ folk <b>pedagogies,</b> we will try to point out their significance and implications they have on education practice.       Starting from the existing findings about folk <b>pedagogies,</b> we have separated three important implications for educational practice: a) teachers should be viewed as creators of their own coherent theories about learning and teaching; b) changing and improving one’s teaching practice is a result of the teacher’s willingness to reflect on his or her own folk pedagogies; and c) teachers’ folk <b>pedagogies</b> should be seen as the starting point for teacher professional development programs...|$|R
