40|$|Aircraft {{emissions}} impact {{human health}} though degradation of air quality. The majority of previous analyses of air quality impacts from aviation have considered only landing and takeoff emissions. We show that aircraft cruise emissions impact human health over a hemispheric scale {{and provide the}} first estimate of <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> attributable to aircraft emissions globally. We estimate ~ 8000 <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> per year are attributable to aircraft cruise emissions. This represents ~ 80 % of the total impact of aviation (where the total includes the effects of landing and takeoff emissions), and ~ 1 % of air quality-related <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> from all sources. However, we note {{that the impact of}} landing and takeoff emissions is likely to be under-resolved. Secondary H[subscript 2]SO[subscript 4]−HNO[subscript 3]−NH[subscript 3] aerosols are found to dominate mortality impacts. Due to the altitude and region of the atmosphere at which aircraft emissions are deposited, the extent of transboundary air pollution is particularly strong. For example, we describe how strong zonal westerly winds aloft, the mean meridional circulation around 30 − 60 °N, interaction of aircraft-attributable aerosol precursors with background ammonia, and high population densities in combination give rise to an estimated ~ 3500 <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> per year in China and India combined, despite their relatively small current share of aircraft emissions. Subsidence of aviation-attributable aerosol and aerosol precursors occurs predominantly around the dry subtropical ridge, which results in reduced wet removal of aviation-attributable aerosol. It is also found that aircraft NO[subscript x] emissions serve to increase oxidation of nonaviation SO[subscript 2], thereby further increasing the air quality impacts of aviation. We recommend that cruise emissions be explicitly considered in the development of policies, technologies and operational procedures designed to mitigate the air quality impacts of air transportation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Regional and urban-rural {{disparities in}} {{premature}} {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) mortality were evident in the US as early as 1950. Recent favorable trends {{at the national level}} may obscure less favorable outcomes for certain regions and localities. The authors examined trends in <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality</b> for 1985 - 1995 for black and white adults ages 35 - 64 years for four categories of urbanicity in two regions of the US (South and non-South). METHODS: All counties in the US (excluding Alaskan counties) were grouped by urbanicity and region. Annual age-adjusted CHD mortality rates were calculated for adults ages 35 - 64 by racial category (African American or white) and gender for each geographic area for the years 1985 - 1995. Loglinear regression models were used to estimate average annual percent declines in mortality for each of 28 geo-demographic groups. Data were also collected on selected socioeconomic resources by urbanicity for the non-South (excluding Alaska) and South. RESULTS: For both white and black adults ages 35 - 64, the highest rates of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality</b> and slowest mortality declines were observed in the rural South. For white men and women, marked disparities in <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality</b> across categories of urbanicity were noted in the South but not outside the South. Unexpectedly high rates of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality</b> were observed for African Americans in major metropolitan areas outside the South despite favorable levels of socioeconomic resources. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality</b> by region and urbanicity appear to have widened between 1985 and 1995. Residents of the rural South had the highest rates of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality,</b> and rural communities in the South face significant barriers to effective heart disease prevention and control...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{its history}} of use in {{patients}} with aHUS, kidney transplantation {{does not address the}} continued and uncontrolled complement activation that leads to progressive, systemic TMA. As many as 90% of patients with aHUS experience TMA in the transplanted organ, leading to transplant failure. Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are still at continued risk of neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular complications and, importantly, <b>premature</b> <b>mortality.</b> Following kidney transplantation, the ongoing, uncontrolled, chronic complement activation associated with aHUS causes graft loss in 66% of children and 55% of adults, as well as continued inflammatory and TMA insult to other organs. Combined liver-kidney transplantation is only available to very few patients, due to the limited supply of solid organs. In addition, there is a substantial near-term risk of mortality, which many physicians and patients consider excessive. In recent years, some transplant centers have begun to administer eculizumab to patients with TMA who receive a kidney transplant. This strategy has been effective in preventing TMA recurrences in these patients.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s the Fraser Canyon was {{transformed}} from a First Nations and fur trade corridor to a busy route, called the Cariboo Road, used by gold rush miners seeking access to the upper Fraser Basin. During the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a new transcontinental railroad to unite the far-flung provinces of the young Dominion of Canada. This nation-building project saw new railroad tracks constructed on the west riverbank at Hells Gate, connecting the British Columbia coast to the Interior (and the rest of Canada) through the Fraser Canyon. Some assert that rocks and debris dumped into the river during construction of the CPR constricted the river flow and impeded salmon passage, {{though there is no}} documented historical or physical evidence to support this claim. By early 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway began a second transcontinental railway along the south and east bank of the canyon, which was completed in a year's time. While carving into canyon walls to create new rail-bed, rock and debris were again dumped into the river in significant volumes at various locations, including Hells Gate. In early 1914, two years after the completion of the CNR and during construction of a new tunnel, a large rockslide fell into the river just above the Hells Gate portal. Debris dispersed on the river bottom caused a 5-meter vertical drop in water depth and increased water velocity from five meters per second to 6.75m/second. As observed and noted by local residents and later by biologists {{in the aftermath of the}} slide, noticeably higher water velocity seemed to exceed the swimming capacity of the salmon, resulting in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and reduced populations of salmon fry in the subsequent year. In an initial attempt to redress the ecological and physical changes at Hells Gate that impeded migrating salmon, tons of rocks and debris were removed from the river during the winter of 1914-1915. By early 1915, Hells Gate was pronounced clear. While government officials declared that the river at Hells Gate was fully restored, many biologists maintain that the slide permanently altered the river's ecology.|$|E

40|$|Over 10, 000 <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> {{per year}} {{globally}} {{are attributed to}} the exposure to particulate matter caused by aircraft emissions. Unlike previous studies {{that focus on the}} regional impacts from the aircraft emissions below 3, 000 feet, this thesis studies the impact from emissions at all altitudes and across continents on increasing particulates in a receptor region, thereby increasing exposure. In addition to these intercontinental impacts, the thesis analyzes the temporal variations of sensitivities of the air quality and health, the proportion of the impacts attributable to different emission species, and the background emissions' influence on the impact of aircraft emissions. To quantify the impacts of aircraft emissions at various locations and times, this study uses the adjoint model of GEOS-Chem, a chemical transport model. The adjoint method efficiently computes sensitivities of a few objective functions, such as aggregated PM concentration and human exposure to PM concentration, with respect to many input parameters, i. e. emissions at different locations and times. Whereas emissions below 3, 000 feet have mostly local impacts, cruise emissions from North America impair the air quality in Europe and Asia, and European cruise emissions affect Asia. Due to emissions entering Asia, the <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> in Asia were approximately two to three times larger than the global mortalities caused by the Asian emissions. In contrast, North America observed only about one-ninth of the global <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> caused by North American emissions because emissions get carried out of the region. This thesis calculates that most of the <b>premature</b> <b>mortalities</b> occured in Europe and Asia in 2006. Sensitivities to emissions also have seasonal and diurnal cycles. For example, ground level NOx emissions in the evening contribute to 50 % more surface PM formation than the same emissions in the morning, and cruise level NOx emissions in early winter cause six times more PM concentration increase than the same emissions in spring. Aircraft NOx emissions cause 78 % of PM from aviation emissions, and given the population exposure to PM concentration increase, NOx contributes 90 % of the total impact. By showing the second-order sensitivities, this study finds that increases in background emissions of ammonia increase the impact of aircraft emissions on the air quality and increases in background NOx emissions decrease the impact. These results show the effectiveness of the adjoint model for analyzing the longterm sensitivities. Some of the analyses presented are practically only possible with the adjoint method. By regulating emissions at high sensitivities in time and region, calculated by the adjoint model, governments can design effective pollutant reduction policies. by Jamin Koo. Thesis (S. M.)

Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health {{disadvantages}} exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Impacts of different modelling approaches are also explored. A cross-sectional study of 229 general practices in the East Midlands was undertaken. The main outcome measure was numbers of premature CHD deaths in patients registered at the practices (April 2006 to March 2009). Publicly available data describing both population characteristics and aspects of primary care were utilised. A novel method of estimating smoking prevalence in practice populations was described and differing methods of describing the performance of primary care in detecting hypertension were evaluated. Population characteristics and markers of quality of primary care were associated with variations in <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality.</b> Increases in: the percentage of practice populations on practice diabetes registers, the proportion who were over 65, the proportion who were male, and the estimated smoking prevalence in patients with chronic conditions were all associated with increasing levels of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality.</b> Control of serum cholesterol levels in those with CHD {{and the percentage of}} patients recalling access to their preferred general practitioner, a measure of continuity of care, were both associated with decreased counts of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality.</b> Increasing levels of undiagnosed hypertension prevalence were associated with increased levels of <b>premature</b> CHD <b>mortality.</b> Similar results were found for all-age mortality; there is less evidence that continuity of care is associated with all-age CHD mortality.

Particular reference {{is given to}} the dose-response relationship between physical activity and <b>premature</b> all-cause <b>mortality</b> and seven chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, colon cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and osteoporosis). The strength of the relationship between physical activity and specific health outcomes is evaluated critically. Literature was obtained through searching electronic databases (e. g., MEDLINE, EMBASE), cross-referencing, and through the authors' knowledge of the area. For inclusion in our {{systematic review}} articles must have at least 3 levels of physical activity and the concomitant risk for each chronic disease. The quality of included studies was appraised using a modified Downs and Black tool. Through this search we identified a total of 254 articles that met the eligibility criteria related to <b>premature</b> all-cause <b>mortality</b> (N = 70), cardiovascular disease (N = 49), stroke (N = 25), hypertension (N = 12), colon cancer (N = 33), breast cancer (N = 43), type 2 diabetes (N = 20), and osteoporosis (N = 2). Overall, the current literature supports clearly the dose-response relationship between physical activity and the seven chronic conditions identified. Moreover, higher levels of physical activity reduce the risk for <b>premature</b> all-cause <b>mortality.</b> The current Canadian guidelines appear to be appropriate to reduce the risk for the seven chronic conditions identified above and all-cause mortality. </p...|$|R
