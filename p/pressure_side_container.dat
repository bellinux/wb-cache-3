40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the loss sources in an advanced GE transonic compressor design with high reaction and high stage loading. This advanced compressor has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured compressor efficiency is significantly lower than the efficiency calculated with various existing tools based on RANS and URANS. The general understanding is that some important flow physics in this modern compressor design are not represented in the current tools. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a half stage at the NASA Glenn Research Center. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to determine whether a higher-fidelity simulation can pick up any additional flow physics that can explain past efficiency miss with RANS and URANS. The results from the Large Eddy Simulation were compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator, resulting in large loss generation on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator. On the other hand, existing tools based on the RANS and URANS do not calculate this high total temperature and low total pressure on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator. The calculated loss through the stator from LES seems to match the measured data and the GE data interpretation. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES indicates that the accumulation of high loss near the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator is due to the interaction of the rotor wake with the stator blade. The strong rotor wake interacts quite differently with the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator than with the suction side of the stator blade. The concave curvature on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator blade increases the mixing of the rotor wake with the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> boundary layer significantly. On the other hand, the convex curvature on the suction side of the stator blade decreases the mixing and the suction side blade boundary layer remains thin. The jet velocity in the rotor wake in the stator frame seems to magnify the curvature effect in addition to inviscid redistribution of wake fluid toward the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the blade...|$|R

40|$|The present paper reports an {{investigation}} of unsteady loss generation in the stator due to the incoming rotor wake in an advanced GE transonic compressor design with a high-fidelity numerical method. This advanced compressor with high reaction and high stage loading has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured efficiency in this advanced compressor is {{significantly lower than the}} design intention/goal. The general understanding is that the current generation of compressor design/analysis tools miss some important flow physics in this modern compressor design. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with a detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a half stage at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Detailed data-match analysis by GE identified an unexpected high loss generation in the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator passage. Higher total temperature and lower total pressure are measured near the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator. Various analyses based on the RANS and URANS of the compressor stage do not calculate the measured higher total temperature and lower total pressure on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to find the fundamental mechanism of this unsteady loss generation in the stator due to the incoming rotor wake. The results from the LES were first compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator, as the measured data showed, resulting in large loss generation on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the stator. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES shows that the rotor wake, which has higher total temperature and higher total pressure relative to the free stream, interacts quite differently with the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the blade compared to the suction side of the blade. The higher temperature in the wake remains high as the wake passes through the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the blade. On the other hand, the total temperature diffuses as it passes through near the suction surface. For the presently investigated compressor, the classical intra-stator wake transport to the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the blade by the slip velocity in the wake seems to be minor. The main causes of this phenomenon are three-dimensional unsteady vortex interactions near the blade surface. The stabilizing effect of the concave curvature on the suction side keeps the rotor wake thin. On the other hand, the destabilizing effect of the convex curvature of the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> makes the rotor wake thicker, which results in a higher total temperature measurement at the stator exit. Additionally, wake stretching through the stator seems to contribute to the redistribution of the total temperature and the loss generation...|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} difference between {{both sides of}} the leak can affect the movement of material through the leak. Fluids will commonly move from the higher <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> to the lower <b>pressure</b> <b>side.</b> The larger the {{pressure difference}}, the more leakage there will typically be. The fluid <b>pressures</b> on both <b>sides</b> include the hydrostatic pressure, which is pressure due to the weight from the height of fluid level above the leak. When the pressures are about equal, there can be an exchange of fluids between both sides, or little to no net movement of fluid across the leak.|$|R

40|$|Japan; *to whom {{correspondence}} and reprint requests {{should be addressed}} Abstract. To investigate the mechanism of alveolar bone remodeling in response to orthodontic force application, we examined the distribution of osteoclasts and pre-osteoclastic cells using quantitative immunohistochemistry of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. For orthodontic force to be produced by the Waldo method, an orthodontic elastic band was inserted between the upper first and second molars of rats. The observed areas of periodontal tissues around second molars were the distal surfaces of mesial roots, as the <b>pressure</b> <b>side,</b> and the mesial surfaces of distal roots, as the tension side. Specific expression of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase at the ultrastructural level was detected in mononuclear and multinucleated pre-osteoclastic cells, as well as osteoclasts with ruffled borders on bone surfaces. At 6 hrs after orthodontic force application, many osteoclasts and pre-osteoclastic cells with H+-ATPase expression were first observed in vascular canals of the alveolar bone crest near the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the periodontal ligament, {{but the number of}} osteoclasts was not increased in the periodontal ligament. On day 1 after tooth movement, osteoclasts were increased in number in the periodontal ligament and in adjacent alveolar bones on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side,</b> but were seldom observed in corresponding areas on the tension side. The number of osteoclasts increased until day 7, but had decreased by day 14. These results suggest that, in bone remodeling during experimental tooth movement, (1) osteoclasts and pre-osteoclastic cells can be identified by H+-ATPase immunohistochemistry, (2) osteoclasts and pre-osteoclastic cells are rapidly induced after force application, (3) osteoclast induction first occurs in vascular canals of the alveolar bone crest on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side,</b> and then, (4) the number of osteoclasts increases in the periodontal ligament on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side...</b>|$|R

40|$|Within a European {{research}} project experimental studies were performed concerning {{the determination of}} the film cooling efficiency on the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of trailing edges of high pressure turbine blades. The experiments were carried out at the linear cascade wind tunnel (EGG) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Göttingen. The thermodynamic investigations were performed using the same cascade geometries and trailing edge configurations as for the aerodynamic measurements. Two different trailing edge geometries with coolant ejection were investigated. The first configuration was equipped with a <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> cutback while for the second configuration the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> film cooling was realized by a row of cylindrical holes. The determination of the surface temperatures was done by using a combination of IR-thermography and thermocouples. Preliminary studies showed the feasibility to use metallic surfaces of the suction side of the adjacent blade as a mirror for IR-thermography. Thus it is possible to observe the <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> near the trailing edge of interest by means of an infrared camera. The camera was mounted outside of the cascade’s free stream ensuring no influence to the aerodynamic boundary conditions. Up to seven flush mounted thermocouples {{on each side of the}} trailing edge were used for an in-situ calibration of the infrared pictures and thermal loss calculations.
