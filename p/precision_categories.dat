Several algorithms were proposed {{in the past for}} road-map integration; however, these algorithms are not efficient and some of them even require human feedback. Thus, they are not suitable for many important applications (e. g., Web services) where efficiency, in terms of both time and space, is crucial. This paper presents two efficient algorithms for integrating maps in which roads are represented as polylines. The main novelty of these algorithms is in using only the locations of the endpoints of the polylines rather than trying to match whole lines. Experiments on real-world data are given, showing that our approach of integration based on matching merely endpoints is efficient and accurate (that is, it provides high recall and <b>precision).</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an estimator for such models appropriate for heterogeneous data; specifically, data obtained from different categories that share some common structure, but also exhibit differences. An example of such a data structure is gene networks corresponding to different subtypes of a certain disease. In this setting, estimating a single graphical model would mask the underlying heterogeneity, while estimating separate models for each category ignores the common structure. We propose a method which jointly estimates several graphical models corresponding to the different categories present in the data. The method aims to preserve the common structure, while allowing for differences between the categories.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the brain}} {{mechanisms}} underlying invariant visual recognition {{has remained a}} central tenet of cognitive neuroscience. Much of our current understanding {{of this process is}} based on knowledge gained from visual areas studied individually.

Surprisingly, relatively {{little is known about the}} precise dynamics of visual processing along the ventral stream of the visual cortex. Here we recorded intracranial field poten-tials (IFPs) from multiple intermediate areas of the ventral stream of the visual cortex in two behaving monkeys engaged in a rapid face catego-rization task. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, we quantified at millisecond <b>precision</b> the face <b>category</b> information con-veyed by IFPs in areas of the ventral stream. We further investigate the relationship between the selectivity and latency of individual electrodes as estimated with classical univariate vs. multivariate techniques and conclude on the similarity and differences between the two approaches. ...|$|R

While the Category I IMT is essentially complete, research on IMT algorithms continues to improve its performance {{so that it can}} eventually meet Category II/III approach requirements. To the extent possible, it is desirable to satisfy Category II/III requirements with modifications to the existing single-frequency (L 1) LAAS architecture in order to provide Category II/III initial operational capability (IOC) before the second civil frequency (L 5) is present on a sufficient number of GPS satellites. This will also provide a backup operational mode in a future dualfrequency LAAS if either L 1 or L 5 is interfered with. This paper addresses IMT improvements to detection of satellite signal deformation, code-carrier divergence monitoring of both potential satellite failures and ionosphere spatial anomalies, and position-error monitoring at a “remote ” monitor receiver that is some distance away from the existing reference receiver antennas. With these relatively-limited modifications to the existing Category I LGF architecture, significant performance improvements are demonstrated. While the degree to which these improvements are sufficient depends on changes now being considered to the Category II/III requirements, we believe that, with further refinement, they will be sufficient to provide acceptable IOC and dual-frequency backup availability...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology {{represents}} {{a significant improvement}} in classification of urinary specimens. The system acknowledges the difficulty in cytologically diagnosing low-grade urothelial carcinomas and has developed categories {{to deal with this}} issue. The system uses six categories: unsatisfactory, negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NHGUC), atypical urothelial cells, suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma, high-grade urothelial carcinoma, other malignancies and a seventh subcategory (low-grade urothelial neoplasm). Methods: Three hundred and fifty-seven urine specimens were independently reviewed by four cytopathologists unaware of the previous diagnoses. Each cytopathologist rendered a diagnosis according to the Paris System categories. Agreement was assessed using absolute agreement and weighted chance-corrected agreement (kappa). Disagreements were classified as low impact and high impact based on the potential impact of a misclassification on clinical management. Results: The average absolute agreement was 65 % with an average expected agreement of 44 %. The average chance-corrected agreement (kappa) was 0. 32. Nine hundred and ninety-nine of 1902 comparisons between rater pairs were in agreement, but 12 % of comparisons differed by two or more categories for the category NHGUC. Approximately 15 % of the disagreements were classified as high clinical impact. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that the scheme recommended by the Paris System shows adequate <b>precision</b> for the <b>category</b> NHGUC, but the other categories demonstrated unacceptable interobserver variability.

40|$|The feature {{selection}} {{is an important}} part in automatic text classification. In this paper, we use a Chinese semantic dictionary — Hownet to extract the concepts from the word as the feature set, because it can better reflect the meaning of the text. However, as the concept definition in the dictionary sometimes cannot express the word properly, we define the expression power for every sememe and every definition of the word in further process, and define the relation degree between the sememe and the definition. A threshold is set in the sememe tree, the sememe of the little information is filtered, and the words of weak definition are reserved in expression power. By this method, we construct a combined feature set that consists of both sememes and the Chinese words. The values of sememes are given according to their expression power and relation to the word. By comparing seven feature weighing methods in text classification, we propose a CHI-MCOR weighing method according to the weighing theories and classification precision.

The enrichment assay approach exploits a hybrid of two passively-detected ionizing-radiation signatures: the traditional enrichment meter signature (186 -keV photon peak area) and a non-traditional signature, manifested in the high-energy (3 to 8 MeV) gamma-ray continuum, generated by neutron emission from UF 6.
