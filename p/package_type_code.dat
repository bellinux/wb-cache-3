Basic IC <b>packages</b> <b>types</b> for quadracs include discrete packaging (DPAK), power packaging (PPAK), and in-line packaging (IPAK). Other IC <b>package</b> <b>types</b> include diode outline (DO), transistor outline (TO), and small outline transistor (SOT). Quadracs that use metal electrode leadless face (MELF) packaging have metallized terminals at each end of a cylindrical body. Other available <b>package</b> <b>types</b> for quadracs include thin small outline package (TSOP), thin shrink small outline L-leaded package (TSSOP), and thin small outline J-lead (TSOJ) package.|$|R
30|$|Chinese {{consumers}} {{are willing to}} pay a small premium for pistachio with original, no-salt and no-sugar flavor. The average WTP is 2.02 Chinese Yuan ($ 0.3) to move from sweet pistachios to an original product. The WTP estimate is not statistically significant for the Original to Salty variable, meaning Chinese consumers do not prefer original flavor to salty flavor. Combining this result with results in Table 7, we conclude that original or salty flavor is more attractive than the sweet flavor. WTP estimates are not significant for the <b>package</b> <b>type</b> and <b>package</b> size variables, indicating that respondents' WTP will not change with <b>package</b> <b>type</b> and <b>package</b> size. The WTP estimates are the greatest for the COO attributes, followed by the original flavor attributes. In addition, respondents will not pay a premium for preferred <b>package</b> <b>type</b> or <b>package</b> size. This result agrees with the relative importance estimates in Table 6. The WTP estimate for <b>package</b> <b>type</b> in Table 8 is insignificant, but the coefficient estimate for <b>package</b> <b>type</b> is significant in Table 5. This seems to suggest that respondents consider <b>package</b> <b>type</b> when purchasing pistachio, however, they will not pay a premium for pistachios that have a preferred <b>package</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R

40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Process: This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes.</b> Basic attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> are described in RFC 1771, pages 12 through 15. These, and new attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> {{that are used in}} the Internet are registered with the IANA. The actual process will involve the documentation of such attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> in an RFC. There is no intention of segmenting the code space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other sectioning. As each attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> {{is in the process of}} being developed, it will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use. At the time an attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> is assigned a number by the IANA, the documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the authorized attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> value. IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically updated Assigned Numbers RFC [6]. Requests for assignment of a new attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA. ORG) with a subject that includes the phrase "BGP Attribute Type".

However, while <b>type</b> and creator <b>codes</b> extended the flexibility of the system — a particular type of file was not restricted to opening in a particular application — they suffered many of the same problems as file extensions. <b>Type</b> and creator <b>codes</b> could be lost when files were transferred across non-Macintosh systems (such as Unix-based servers), and the plethora of <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> made identification problematic.|$|R
