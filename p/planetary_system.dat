5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} <b>planetary</b> <b>system.</b> Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a <b>planetary</b> <b>system.</b> Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with {{what appears to be}} the beginnings of its own <b>planetary</b> <b>system.</b> Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet.|$|E
5|$|A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term plutoid {{was adopted by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group <b>Planetary</b> <b>System</b> Nomenclature. The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing <b>planetary</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> around a normal star to have mutual {{inclination}} between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12. This discovery is {{generally considered to be}} the first definitive detection of a <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> around another star.

5|$|Kepler-40 {{hosts the}} sixth <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> to be {{discovered}} in the orbit of a star with a mass of over 1.8 solar masses. It lies 2700 parsecs (8806.4 light years) away from Earth, making it more distant than any previously verified planet discovered by Kepler, and has an apparent magnitude of 14.58. Thus, it is invisible to the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this <b>planetary</b> <b>system,</b> although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E

5000|$|From the 1940s on Van de Kamp and {{his staff}} made similar claims of <b>planetary</b> <b>systems</b> around the nearby stars Lalande 21185, 61 Cygni, and many others, {{based on the same}} flawed {{photographic}} plates.

5|$|The first {{standard}} nomenclature for Martian albedo features {{was introduced by}} the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named La Planète Mars. The Working Group for <b>Planetary</b> <b>System</b> Nomenclature (WGPSN) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> is also {{notable for}} the orbital {{properties}} of its planets. It {{is the only}} known system of orbital companions to exhibit a triple conjunction in the rare phenomenon of Laplace resonance (a type of resonance first noted in Jupiter's inner three Galilean moons). It is also the first extrasolar system around a normal star with measured coplanarity.|$|E
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with {{a small fraction of}} heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a <b>planetary</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 2.59, Gamma Corvi—also known as Gienah—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. It is an aging blue giant around four times as massive as the Sun. The young star Eta Corvi has been found to have two debris disks. Three star systems have exoplanets, and a fourth <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> is unconfirmed. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova—a white dwarf and brown dwarf in very close orbit.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation of planetary systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a <b>planetary</b> <b>system</b> over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

30|$|If selected, {{this mission}} {{will follow the}} ongoing CoRoT and Kepler {{missions}} to obtain a new sample of transiting exoplanets, focussing on terrestrial planets around bright stars (mV ≤ 11 mag).

However, previous transit searches have shown that well constrained stellar parameters are crucial to derive accurate planet parameters. PLATO therefore combines photometric transit search with astroseimology of the central stars of <b>planetary</b> <b>systems.</b> These astroseismologi-cal studies are further keys to obtain a well constrained age (goal: 10 % accuracy; Kjeldsen et al., 2009) of stars, and therefore <b>planetary</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
