5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E

These <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> together with others obtained from the literature for five dinitrophenylated-amino acids were used to investigate the suitability of the Collander equation to correlate <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> in polymer–salt ATPS.

25|$|The <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is defined}} at a {{specified}} temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase.

Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E
