They lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. The Iroquois and other tribes used the Pine Creek <b>Path</b> <b>through</b> the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that the Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there, though they did use the <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it.|$|E

5|$|M-43 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} southwestern and central parts of the US state of Michigan. The highway runs from South Haven to Webberville along an indirect <b>path</b> <b>through</b> both rural areas and larger cities. The trunkline follows three overall segments: a southeasterly track from South Haven to Kalamazoo, a northeasterly course to the Hastings area and an easterly route through the Lansing area.|$|E

5|$|The tornado took a <b>path</b> <b>through</b> Rockland, Westchester, and Fairfield counties, downing or {{uprooting}} {{thousands of}} trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse.

They used the <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including one just north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E
5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north {{with the}} Nile river protecting his right flank and the Azande cavalry contingent on his left. At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern {{portion of the}} Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took {{the southern}}most path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E

At least 85 homes in La Paz sustained damage, and many telephone {{lines in the}} region were down {{at the height of}} the storm. Wind gusts estimated at 120mph (195km/h) swept through San José del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite the damage, no deaths were reported in the wake of Paul.|$|E
5|$|M-201 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that serves as a}} spur route for the village of Northport near the northern tip of Leelanau County. The trunkline zig-zags through to provide a <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the village, connecting with the county road that provides access to Leelanau State Park. The highway was first shown on state maps in the late 1940s, and remains unchanged since.|$|E

A long-tracked wedge tornado caused EF2 damage along a <b>path</b> <b>through</b> rural portions of Texas and Louisiana. An EF3 tornado destroyed multiple structures and caused severe damage at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, as well. A total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed the 26th, though no fatalities occurred.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1879, the {{settlement}} of Independence was established {{just west of the}} pass, taking its name from the Independence Day holiday, and soon lending it to the pass among other natural features in the area. Independence's gold deposits were quickly opened by miners. By the following year the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company had improved the <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the pass, which followed a route close to Highway 82's present alignment, to the point that horses could make the trip.|$|E
5|$|The Giro was raced on {{a unique}} <b>path</b> <b>through</b> Italy, taking the peloton to some {{historic}} {{cities and towns}} in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any well-known, storied climbs, the many intermediate and mountain stages {{in the second and}} third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult. The 10th and the 16th stages were both called the race's queen stage, as both contained multiple difficult mountain climbs.|$|E

Entering the Exmoor National Park, it cuts inland past North Hill, Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at Hurlestone Point. After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way.|$|E
