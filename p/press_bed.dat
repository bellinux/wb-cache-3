50|$|The {{transparency}} {{of the glass}} plate {{can be used to}} advantage, in that the plate may be placed over a preliminary drawing on paper to guide the artist in creating a drawing on the plate. This is done by placing the drawing face down on a light table (to allow for the reversal of the image in printing) and placing the vitreograph plate on top of it.Although glass is unaffected by compression in the printing press, it will break under tension. For that reason, vitreographs are always printed on an etching press, whose rigid bed will support the glass plate firmly. In addition, the <b>press</b> <b>bed</b> must be level and working conditions in the print shop immaculate. A particle of grit or dirt between <b>press</b> <b>bed</b> and the plate will create a tension point that will cause the glass to crack when pressure is applied.|$|E

5000|$|Both the Communal Dining Building and Monumental Civic Building were {{supplied}} by adjacent service complexes, comprising multiple store rooms (with food provisions stored in decorated pithoi) and kitchens equipped with large stone-lined hearths. The Service Building of the Monumental Civic Building also contained a well-preserved olive press facility—the earliest documented lever-and-weights press, or beam press, in the post-Bronze Age Aegean. Although an Archaic beam {{press has been}} reported from excavations at the Greek city of Klazomenai, the evidence for olive pressing at Azoria includes a <b>press</b> bench, <b>press</b> <b>beds,</b> sockets for wooden beams, a press weight, roller-crusher and mortar block, a collection basin, a small trapetum mortarium, a hearth and cooking stand, oil-separation vessels, and quantities of press cake (crushed olive pits, collected after grinding and pressing for use as fuel for hearths).|$|R
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the <b>press</b> <b>bed</b> and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} kinematic {{and dynamic}} {{investigations of the}} main press forming mechanism of a thermoforming machine. A multibody analysis of this press forming mechanism, which lifts and rotates a <b>press</b> <b>bed,</b> was carried out. <b>Press</b> <b>bed</b> lifting, which is necessary to form the component, is performed {{by means of a}} first rod and toggle mechanism. <b>Press</b> <b>bed</b> rotation to eject the formed component is produced by means of a second rod and must be appropriately shifted. These rods are oscillating followers driven by cams, making it possible to precisely define trajectories {{as a function of the}} motor shaft rotation angle. Analysis is performed by numerically solving the equations of motion. Cam synthesis on the basis of the oscillating followers ’ trajectories makes it possible to obtain cam profiles in order to evaluate pressure angles and check that there is no undercutting. System dynamics is investigated in order to evaluate motor torque and analyse internal stresses on the hinges. In addition, some experimental results and those obtained with the dynamic model are compared. Performance improvement of the actual machine is carried out by modifying the trajectory of the <b>press</b> <b>bed</b> by means of a numerical code at the purpose developed. This approach is more convenient than the use of a commercial multibody code, which is not specifically built for parametric studies...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{fumigant}} delivery through microirrigation (drip) lines has {{the potential}} to replace direct soil injection into planting beds. However, wetting coverage in these Spodosols must be improved to increase soilborne pest and weed control. Field trials were carried out to determine the impact of soil moisture on the extent of wetting cross-sectional areas through varying irrigation times. Soil moisture contents were: a) 7 % moisture (field capacity), and b) 20 % (saturation), along with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h of irrigation. <b>Pressed</b> <b>beds</b> had 70 cm tops. Drip lines had emitters spaced 30 cm apart delivering 0. 056 L·min– 1 per m of row at 55 kPa, and two drip lines were buried at 2. 5 cm below the surface and 30 cm apart from each other. Water was mixed with a blue marking dye to analyze the water distribution patterns. Beds were opened at the emitters and high-resolution digital pictures were taken for each treatment. Resulting images were adjusted using photographic software and covered areas across the beds were determined. Regression analysis showed significant quadratic equations for both soil moisture situations, with saturated soils obtaining the highest cross section coverage (90 and 94 % after 8 and 10 h). In field capacity beds, the maximum cross section coverage obtained was 82 %. Within each soil moisture situation, there were no differences between 8 and 10 h of irrigation...|$|R

Originally driven from a pulley on a shaft (which drove all the presses), it was later driven by a 2 HP three-phase electric motor. A lot of experimenting was necessary to get the correct pulley size for the motor, as the range of standard size flat pulleys was limited. One size was too small, the next size too large to drive the press at the correct speed. The problem was overcome by using the smaller size pulley and winding some thin rope around it to build {{it up to the}} correct size.|$|R
