5|$|Upon release, {{the game}} {{received}} praise from critics, {{with the majority}} of criticism going towards some of its altered gameplay mechanics. Despite strong sales in both Japan and North America, it failed to meet <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> targets. Alongside Episode II, the staff expanded the Xenosaga series into other projects. A portion of the planned Xenosaga narrative by Takahashi and Saga was made into , released in 2004 for mobile devices. The game was remade along with Episode I as part of Xenosaga I & II for the Nintendo DS. The final Xenosaga game, Xenosaga Episode III, was released in 2006.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} week {{on sale in}} Japan, Xenosaga Episode II reached second place in gaming charts, selling around 186,000 units. The {{following}} week the game dropped to the third place with further sales of over 32,000 units, contributing to a general decline in game sales during that period. Within two weeks of its release, the game had sold nearly 219,000 units in Japan. According to Namco's fiscal report in February 2005, the game had sold 280,000 units in Japan by that time. According to their later 2005 fiscal year report, Episode II was one of Namco's better-selling titles in North America, although no exact sales figures were given. According to a later report, Episode II underperformed commercially, reaching just over 50% of Namco's <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> target.|$|E

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>sales</b> and {{delivery}} processes entail complex negotiations between client and contractor, as {{the details of}} the project are agreed upon during extensive interaction, often over a substantial period of time. Although very little research has been done on project negotiations as such, established {{research in the area of}} negotiation analysis provides a theoretically well-founded framework for studying project negotiations. This study applies the negotiation analysis framework to describe and analyze negotiations in the context of <b>project</b> <b>sales</b> {{and delivery}} processes. The body of this report first develops an understanding of the concept of negotiation and reviews the negotiation analysis approach. Second, the <b>project</b> <b>sales</b> and delivery process and its distinctive features are reviewed and their implications on negotiations in projects are analyzed. Third, the logic and concepts of negotiation analysis are used to describe and analyze a selected set of negotiation strategies available to either the client or contractor at different phases of a single project. The main results of the study include a conceptualization of the <b>project</b> <b>sales</b> and delivery process as a negotiation problem, and a qualitative description of selected negotiation strategies in terms of negotiation analysis. The concepts used (e. g. phases of negotiation, interests, issues, and best alternatives to a negotiated agreement) can be applied in practical settings for the purposes of training professionals and preparing for negotiations, and ultimately for transforming negotiation games in the favor of practicing negotiators...|$|R
5|$|Human Entertainment {{went out}} of {{business}} in 2000, and Sunsoft became the sole owner of the Clock Tower intellectual property. A new game in the series, Clock Tower 3, was officially announced on 11 April 2001, with Capcom revealing they would be co-developing it with Sunsoft. They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. Released in December later that year, Clock Tower 3 was a commercial failure. Capcom had <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> of at least 450,000, {{but by the end of}} 2003, it had only sold 122,022 units. Clock Tower 3s commercial failure is speculated as the reason why Capcom and Sunsoft have not revisited the series since.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
25|$|The city's TIF {{financing}} proposal was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (chief {{economist at the}} business consulting firm MBG Information Services) argued that the convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel room rates throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance {{to make up the}} lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to the two studies conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said.|$|E

500|$|Before commencing {{production}} of the Aurion, Toyota Australia manufactured the full-size Avalon model at its Altona plant in Melbourne until June 2005. Production of the Avalon had begun in 2000, taking much of its basic design and mechanical features from the then six-year-old Avalon model sold in North America. The Avalon was offered as a larger, more upmarket car than the Toyota Camry, which it was built alongside. The original sales predictions were not met, with the Avalon failing to challenge rivals such as the Holden Commodore and the Ford Falcon. The reasoning behind this has been widely attributed to the Avalon's older design and styling, which has been widely described as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} front-wheel drive configuration and smaller engine displacement. In its best year, the Avalon only managed to reach half of Toyota's <b>projected</b> <b>sales</b> target, with many potential buyers opting for the slightly smaller sized V6 Camry, featuring the same engine as the Avalon.|$|E

50|$|When <b>projecting</b> <b>sales</b> for {{relatively}} new products, marketers typically use {{a system of}} trial and repeat calculations to anticipate sales in future periods. This works {{on the principle that}} everyone buying the product will either be a new customer (a 'trier') or a repeat customer. By adding new and repeat customers in any period, we can establish the penetration of a product in the marketplace. It is challenging, however, to <b>project</b> <b>sales</b> to a large population on the basis of simulated test markets, or even full-fledged regional rollouts. Marketers have developed various solutions to increase the speed and reduce the cost of test marketing, such as stocking a store with products (or mock-ups of new products) or giving customers money to buy the products of their choice. These simulate real shopping conditions but require specific models to estimate full-market volume on the basis of test results.|$|R
