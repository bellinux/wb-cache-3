5|$|This ordinance, {{with the}} {{reorganisation}} of the islands, was enacted to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>method</b> for removing the Chagos Islanders {{so that the}} islands {{could be used by}} the United States as a military base, particularly the island of Diego Garcia. From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US for military purposes, and by an exchange of notes dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base. This agreement was to last for 50 years, with an additional 20-year extension if neither party wished to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Windscreens (or {{windshields}} – {{the terms}} are interchangeable) <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>method</b> {{of reducing the}} effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.|$|E

2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective input offset voltage present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>method</b> for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E
