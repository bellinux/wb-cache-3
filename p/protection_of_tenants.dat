It focuses {{on the impact of}} growth and analyses how the government policy of positive discrimination (also known as Bumiputeras) has helped to address historical backwardness and thus reduce ethnic tensions in the country. The state also launched the policy of diversification, which involved various combinations of policy initiatives; for instance, the expansion of new industries was encouraged, especially if they focused on production for foreign markets. As a result, job opportunities increased. The government also undertook measures to tackle rural poverty, modest land reforms, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenant</b> rights, and other rural development measures to protect the rural poor. All these measures to a certain extent helped to reduce rural poverty. This paper offers an explanation as to how the net implications for employment and growth have been achieved. I think this study is important because a review of Malaysia’s economic strategies and development could be a very useful example for other developing countries. The key finding of the study is that the state has to a great extent been successful in its role and objective of promoting economic and social development in Malaysia. However, the economic strategy that is based on export markets and credits to provide the stimulus for growth may likely encounter difficulties due to increased competition unleashed by the forces of globalisation. These difficulties could arise despite evidence on trends in economic growth and employment creation which suggest that Malaysia’s recent transition to a high-growth trajectory has been accompanied by low inflation and decreased levels of unemployment and poverty...|$|R

At {{the beginning of the}} thesis is done a historical excursion, from the legal regulations of the {{termination of the}} lease according to the roman law, the ABGB, the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the lease after the establishment of the Czechoslovak republic, the Civil code of 1950 and the Civil code of 1964, until the amendment made after the year 1989. The next chapter analyses the legal regulations of the lease - the concept, the subject of the lease, the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tenant</b> and the rights and obligations follow from the termination of the lease. The first way how rental can also be terminated is the expiry of the term, after that follows the renewal of the lease, with which the expiry of the period closely related. The fifth chapter deals with the termination of the lease, which is the most extensively regulated in OZ and also is a frequent subject of lawsuits. Therefore I focus on the notice to quit in detail, in terms of both - the tenant and the landlord's perspective. While the death of the landlord does not affect the duration of the lease, the death <b>of</b> the <b>tenant</b> may terminate the lease, if there is no transfer of the lease and if tenant's heir is not known within six months <b>of</b> the <b>tenant's</b> death (§ 2284 Civil Code).

The Work was submitted during the vacantia legis period (i. e. the period between the force and effect of the law) of Act. No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the "new Civil Code".

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} the Government Housing policies and legislation mainly since the 1940 s and after an evaluation of them to put forward proposals and recommendations that might lead to a solution of the housing problem especially in the urban sector. This dissertation is in four parts s the magnitude of the problem; review of existing policies, legislation and the institutional framework 5 critical evaluation of the policies and the legislation; and proposals and recommendations. The body of the dissertation is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 identifies the problem of housing in Sri Lanka with special: references to the urban sector. It briefly traces how the problem started with the Second World Mar and it analyses quantitatively the housing needs in 1971. It goes on further to deal with the age and condition of the urban housing stock, its structural composition, the urban tenure pattern, housing amenities and the relation between rents and household income. It also has a section dealing with the housing situation in Colombo with special focus on the tenements, slums and shanties* Chapter 2 deals with the Government's policies on housing. It points out the necessity of the State to intervene to solve the housing problem especially that of the lower income group. The Chapter starts with the Government's concern over the health of the people as well as over the predicament of tenants. It goes on to deal how with the establishment of the National Housing Fund and the Institution of the National Housing Department, the Government became directly involved in the provision of housing through the granting of housing loans and by the direct construction of houses. This Chapter shows that in 1970, as a manifestation of its socialist policies, the coalition Government enacted various pieces of legislation with the intention of equitable distribution in the housing sector. A summary of Government policies concludes this Chapter, Selected pieces of legislation are summarised in Chapter 3. It covers the evolution of rent control in Sri Lanka, from 1942 and a comprehensive survey is made of the 1972 Rent Act. The other legislation summarised in this Chapter are the Ceiling on House Property Law, the Apartment Ownership Law, the Common Amenities Board taw, the Housing Developers (Special Provisions) Law, the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tenants</b> (Special Provisions) Act, the Local Authorities Housing Act, the National Housing Act, and the Colombo District (Low-Lying Areas) Reclamation and Development Board Act. In all these laws only the main provisions are summarised. Chapter 4 deals with the institutional and administrative framework. It is pointed out that the main institutions that administer most of the provisions of housing legislation are the local authorities and the National Housing Department. The Common Amenities Board, the Building Materials Corporation, and the Town and Country Planning Department are some of the other institutions discussed in this Chapter. A critical evaluation of Government policies and legislation in the field of housing is attempted in Chapter 5. Sections of certain legislation are analysed and sometimes dissected arriving at a result which proves the naivity of some of the provisions in the legislation. A major part of this Chapter is devoted to an evaluation of the rent laws. In-depth analyses and evaluations are also made of the Ceiling on House Property Law, the Housing Developers Law, and, the Government's policy of housing the lower income earners? in high-rise flats. After an examination of how much of the Government's goals and objectives are achieved (or rather not achieved), the Final Chapter spells out the various proposals and recommendations regarding a positive approach for the alleviation of the housing problem in Sri Lanka.

The latter requires an understanding of the civil court system and the legal personnel of the law (solicitors, barristers and judges).

40|$|Includes bibliographic referencesIn {{comparison}} with other European and international countries, Switzerland has long had a relatively high proportion <b>of</b> <b>tenants,</b> and thus in the public consciousness been considered as the 'land of tenants'. In South Africa, on the other hand, data estimate that around 20 per cent of all households do in rent. However, {{this does not mean}} that nowadays the rental housing market in South Africa does not play as important a role as in Switzerland. Indeed, the case is precisely the opposite. Therefore, in order to make a considerable contribution towards the social well - being of the population for the rental housing market of both countries, a functioning rent legislation that enables the accessibility to rental housing in general, and guarantees the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tenants</b> without neglecting the legitimate interest of the landlords in particular, is crucial. Indeed, both countries, although having two different legal systems, can fall back on rent legislation that has been developed over several decades. To what extent the two rental legislations can currently be considered as progressive and practical will be examined with the help of this thesis by performing a comparative analysis of the principal rights and obligations of the landlords an d tenants, which are granted and imposed by each jurisdiction. Thereby, in order to gain a better understanding of these rights and obligations, not only is a minimum amount of knowledge about the essence of contracts between landlord and tenant required, but if necessary certain procedural aspects in connection therewith need to be considered. Accordingly, before looking concretely at the specific rights and duties of the renting parties in both countries alongside the determination of the applicable law, a brief introduction to the nature and formation of the contract between the landlord and <b>tenant</b> <b>of</b> each jurisdiction will be provided. With regard to the granted rights, particular attention will also be paid to the several solutions which are available to one contracting party in case of non - performance of the contractual and legal obligations by the other party. Finally, an assessment will be made on whet her the Swiss rent legislation can serve as a role model or basis for an improvement and further development of the South African rent legislation, and vice versa, by pointing out their similarities and differences, and strengths and weaknesses...|$|R

40|$|Price and yield {{uncertainty}} {{are traditional}} considerations in agricultural markets {{and their impact}} on development. Agricultural producers in transition economies face an additional risk factor – changes in the institutional <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> property rights. This paper illustrates how institutional uncertainty may affect investment, land use, and crop mix patterns. In particular, in the Ukrainian example, the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenants</b> are viewed as uncertain in anticipation of establishment of an open market for sale of agricultural land. Establishment of the land market in Ukraine has been postponed several times over the last 15 years and a significant number of lease contracts are not formalized. A large panel of farm-level data was used to show that a higher share of rented land is associated with a lower share of land used for investment intensive perennial crops controlling for prices and other factors. The difference in response to uncertainty is found to be significant among three crop types: perennials, grains and oil crops. The implication is that the lower level <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> use rights and uncertainty regarding the future regulation of land sales market lead to under-investments in more capital intensive crops. As a result, tenants deviate from the optimal crop mix, reducing the productivity <b>of</b> <b>tenant</b> farms.

40|$|Published online: 20 Aug 2015 This paper {{contributes}} {{insights into}} the role of tenure in modifying the relationship between housing affordability and health, using a cross-national comparison of similar post-industrial nations—Australia and the United Kingdom—with different tenure structures. The paper utilises longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey and British Household Panel Survey to examine change in the mental health of individuals associated with housing becoming unaffordable and considers modification by tenure. We present evidence that the role of tenure in the relationship between housing and health is context dependent and should not be unthinkingly generalised across nations. These findings suggest that the UK housing context offers a greater level <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> to <b>tenants</b> living in unaffordable housing when compared with Australia, and this finds expression in the mental health of the two populations. We conclude that Australian governments could improve the mental health of their economically vulnerable populations through more supportive housing policies. Rebecca J.
