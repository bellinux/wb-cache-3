(1) In {{accordance with the}} findings on mean single-tree volume <b>increment</b> <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> of all species benefits from climate change in the first projection period in both regions except for European beech and oak in Uelzen under the median and maximum scenario. (2) The uncertainty range widens over time {{and in most cases}} encompasses positive as well as negative deviations. Especially European beech strongly reacts on climate scenarios with positive deviations up to 2 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 as well as negative values down to – 3 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in the third period. (3) Basically, the positive effect of climate change in the first period diminishes over time and even turns negative in many cases. While the deviation in <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> of Scots pine shows only a few small negative values in the third period, <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> of oak is negatively affected by climate change in Uelzen entirely but not so much in Fläming. The climate effect on <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> of European beech shows a disparate picture over time with positive tendencies under minimum and median climate scenario in Uelzen and a clearly negative trend under median and maximum climate scenario in Fläming. (4) Scots pine is the least sensitive species, both positive and negative. Climate change has the strongest impact on European beech with the most positive deviations in Fläming in the first period and the most negative deviations in Uelzen and Fläming in the third period.

40|$|Determining a {{sustainable}} withdrawal rate {{is an important}} factor to consider in retirement investment planning. An equally important problem is determining an accumulation rate yielding an investment large enough for retirement. Both these problems involve predicting the effect of periodic incremental changes to an investment. Making predictions using historical averages does not yield accurate solutions because of the large variability in security returns. Instead we use use a different measure: Given an initial investment and a <b>periodic</b> <b>increment,</b> what is the probability of reaching the desired investment target given a particular investment strategy? We illustrate the utility of this approach by considering the accumulation rates yielding a desired retirement goal, the tradeoff between placing retirement savings in taxed and tax-deferred accounts, the effect on retirement income of decreasing the the investment’s stock portion annually, the importance of considering different assets in investment planning, the size of an investment resulting from annually saving in an individual retirement account, the accumulation rate sufficient to pay for college education, and ¥ the risk-reward tradeoffs of various assets on short-term investments. Most importantly, we empirically explore the robustness of our analyses by considering the effect of small decreases in return rates and small variations in investment time periods.

30|$|While the {{analysis}} of single-tree and <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> in the three projection periods reveals the immediate impact of changing climatic conditions on forest growth, the evaluation of changes in MAImax aims at the long-term, aggregating climatic effect on forest productivity. Basically, the results on <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> and MAImax are in accordance. On average the productivity of all pine stands close to rotation age will profit from climate change until 2070, {{with the exception of}} the MAImax-value under maximum climate scenario in Fläming in the third projection period. Consequently, looking at overall productivity climate change does not negatively affect the management of Scots pine stands being harvested in Uelzen and Fläming until 2070. Contrary, persistent dryer climates heavily affect beech management with MAImax losses up to – 3 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in Uelzen and – 2 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in Fläming. Especially in stands with beech as the leading species it might be necessary to adapt the management goals, e.g. to reduce the target diameter in order not to unduly extend rotation age. As a summary, the effect of climate change on the growth of Scots pine and European beech is quite similar looking at <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> and MAImax. However, small distinctions are obvious for oak. The reported losses in volume increment for oak in the second and third period in both regions are not as pronounced looking at MAImax. Especially in comparison to beech MAImax-values for oak indicate only minor losses (Fig. 7) while the negative deviations in <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> in the third period especially in Uelzen and under maximum climate scenario in Fläming seem considerable (Fig. 6). In the case of Uelzen, we explain this discrepancy with the cultivation effort of oak even on less favourable sites in the beginning of the 1970 s. These oak stands seem to suffer under dryer conditions, thus, the deviations in <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> are negative. However, these stands are not included in the data used for MAImax assessment because of the age restriction. On the other hand, the older oak stands mainly stock on sites which are not so much affected by dryer conditions, thus, deviations in MAImax are positive.|$|R

Six experimental square plots (900 m 2) were set up for comparison of two thinning intensities: heavy thinning (F: approximately 30 % of basal area removed), light thinning (d: approximately 15 % of basal area removed) and control (Co). The comparison concerned: (1) the <b>periodic</b> <b>increment</b> of the trees {{in terms of volume}} (Ipv), average dbh (Ipd), height (Iph) and the variation of height/diameter ratio (S) in time; (2) forest canopy cover, indirectly expressed in term of relative irradiance (I. R.). Eight years after the felling, the results highlight that F thinning: (a) increases the homogeneity of timber, as the stand volume is concentrated in dominant trees; (b) favours tree diameter increment: Ipd values increase significantly according to the thinning intensity; (c) reduces tree height increment (lower values of Iph were recorded in the F plots); (d) promotes stand stability: lower value of S are highlighted in F plots, and no significant increase of this parameter in time has been recorded. As regards canopy cover, a significant negative correlation was recorded between stand basal area after the thinning and I. R. at ground level. After harvesting, a significant difference in terms of average I. R. between thinning intensities (F, d and Co) was also recorded: nowadays, significant differences of average I.

Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid. Both plots developed a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution, characteristic of uneven-aged forests, after sixty years of management. The 1936 attempt at group-selection cutting in the Saltonstall plot did not maintain the reverse J-shaped diameter distribution that had initially existed. The stand was essentially even-aged and the diameter distribution shifted to a broad bell-shaped form and then to a rotated sigmoid curve when a new age class grew large enough {{to be included in the}} tally. The thinning of the Perry plot also turned the initial bell-shaped diameter-distribution curve to the rotated sigmoid form for the same reason. Annual <b>periodic</b> <b>increment</b> (including harvested volumes) was 52 and 50 cubic feet/acre for the Saltonstall and Perry plot, respectively.

A study {{concerning the}} productivity of eucalyptus and the soil water availability {{was carried out in}} Guanhães region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Evaluations were accomplished for precipitation events occurring over the rainy seasons (PEC), water balance components, annual indices for aridity (Ia), hydric (Ih) and moisture (Im), as well as the monthly <b>periodic</b> <b>increment</b> (IPM), annual average, over the period from 1985 to 1998. The wood productivity was affected by PEC, and the lowest IPM values were observed in the years preceded by either dry rainy season or very dry rainy season, whereas the highest IPM values were observed in those years preceded by rainy season classified as rainy or very rainy one. For periods with increased or decreased PEC, a correlation of this variable with IPM was verified, and a R² value above 0. 80 was obtained. For an increase and reduction of 100 mm in PEC, the IPM showed an increase of 0. 51 m³ ha- 1 month- 1 and a reduction of 0. 80 m³ ha- 1 month- 1, respectively. With some exceptions, higher IPM values were observed in the years subsequent to the years with higher Im and Ih; and in those years preceded by a negative Im, a reduction was verified in IPM. The IPM was higher for the age range from 3 to 5 than for that from 5 to 7 years, whereas the value for the average local index was 28. 90...|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} <b>periodic</b> <b>increments</b> of the annuli {{to verify}} the annual growth-age relationship in two populations of a freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera laevis (Bivalvia, Unionoida), in northern Japan and confirmed that one annulus is added each year. The relationship between yearly shell growth and age {{was regarded as a}} unimodal distribution. We fitted several growth models to the shell length-age relationships of these two populations, which had different densities and age distributions. The Gompertz function showed the best fit, in terms of both RSS (residual sum of squares) and the difference between the observed maximum shell length and the asymptotic shell length. The life span of M. laevis was shorter than that reported for Margaritifera margaritifera populations at higher latitudes (≥ 50 °N), which have been widely recognized as threatened. Margaritiferid mussels living at lower latitudes tend to have shorter life spans and smaller maximum size. These results suggest that margaritiferid mussels in southern regions such as M. laevis in Japan and M. margaritifera in Spain may be particularly vulnerable when conditions are unsuitable for juvenile mussels for prolonged periods...|$|R

The volumes and pressures required to fill and rupture the lungs were log normally distributed. The pressure-volume data were examined mathematically to see if some simple standardized inflation procedure might expand all lungs while rupturing none. It was found that no procedure could be completely successful in initially expanding the lung without rupture but that proce-dures based on pressure should in practice be better than those based on volume; the best results should derive from the application of an initial pressure, followed if no improvement occurs by <b>periodic</b> <b>increments</b> of pressure.

30|$|An example {{illustrates}} how {{results from a}} drought vulnerability assessment following the method proposed by Spellmann et al. (2007, Spellmann et al. 2015) can valuably be amended by quantitative information on future species productivity. In a former study, we evaluated the necessity of adapting tree species selection in Uelzen and Fläming taking drought restrictions into account (Albert et al. 2017). For Uelzen we concluded {{that the number of}} Scots pine dominated stands will increase from 60 % refraining from drought limitations to 69 % under medium climate scenario and even 80 % under maximum climate scenario until 2070 (under minimum climate scenario the proportion is estimated to be constant). This strong preference of Scots pine in future tree species selection based simply on drought vulnerability limits is in line with the current analysis that no severe losses neither for <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> (Fig. 6) nor for MAImax (Fig. 7) are to be expected. For oak, however, a recommended slight increase from 7 % under the assumption of sufficient water supply to 8 % under maximum climate scenario might be challenged looking at the projected future productivity. If the productivity goal is rated high in the decision process, potential losses in <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> of up to – 2.5 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 might influence the decision process on species selection towards more productive species under climate change although oak qualifies as a species to be cultivated under the drought vulnerability limits. Evaluating European beech requires a different line of reasoning. In our species selection study we expected the proportion of beech dominated stands in Uelzen to drop from 16 % with no assumed drought limitations to 14 % under minimum, and an insignificant 2 % under median and maximum climate scenario. While these recommendations are based solely on the intrinsic and fuzzy approach transferring expert-knowledge of species’ productivity and risks into drought vulnerability classes we complement and confirm these results with sound information on projected substantial losses for beech looking at <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> and MAImax under climate change in Uelzen.|$|R

The original worldwide map of stand productivity was downscaled from a 53  km[*]×[*] 53  km to a 3  km[*]×[*] 3  km resolution using geospatial interpolation (Liang et al. work-in-progress). For improved accuracy, we extracted productivity values from the downscaled map to the locations of the US inventory plots used in this analysis.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} microclimatic conditions on tree growth in different site types for natural deciduous forests in Korea. First, we classified all the sites into 36 types according to their aspect (east, west, south, and north), elevation (higher than 1, 000 m, 700 ~ 1, 000 m, and lower than 700 m), and topographical conditions (ridge, slope, and valley). For each site type, we measured diameter growth with increment borer, and then estimated <b>periodic</b> annual <b>increment</b> of diameter, height and volume. We applied a topoclimatological technique for estimating microclimatic conditions, and produced monthly climatic estimates from which 17 weather variables (including indices of warmth, coldness, and aridity) were computed for each site type. The <b>periodic</b> annual <b>increments</b> of diameter, height, and volume were then correlated by regression analysis with those weather variables to examine effects of microclimate on tree growth by site type. We found that the correlation of diameter growth by site type was significantly correlated with most weather variables except daily photoperiod. Water condition was the most important factor for the height growth. For volume growth, on the other hand, the conditions such as relatively high temperature and low humidity provided favorable environment. Our regression analysis shows that aridity index is a good predictor for tree growt...|$|R

30|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{a method to}} assess {{the long-term effects of}} persistent dryer climate conditions on forest growth and productivity by comparing mean single-tree volume <b>increment,</b> <b>periodic</b> volume <b>increment</b> and mean annual increment at biological rotation age (MAImax) under constant climate conditions and under three climate projections until 2070. The projected changes in forest growth within a specified uncertainty range serve as quantitative contributions to provide decision support in forest planning, e.g. adapting silvicultural management strategies, evaluating species future site suitability and assessing the impact on timber supply. The quantitative analysis of possible productivity changes under persistent dryer climate complements the expert-knowledge based drought vulnerability assessment which is applied in northwestern Germany today (cf. Table 2). The drought vulnerability assessment as a synoptic approach qualitatively aggregates the effects of drought on tree growth, vitality and mortality based on thresholds for site water budget. The reported projection of productivity changes quantifies effects of persistent dryer climates on forest growth separately. In addition, the effects of drought on vitality and mortality still needs to be quantified on a level suitable for forest management.|$|R
40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} and kinetics of the fcc (delta) to monoclinic (alpha-prime) {{phase transformation}} and its reversion in a plutonium-gallium alloy {{have been studied}} using differential scanning calorimetry, resistometry, and dilatometry. Under ambient conditions, the delta phase is metastable in a Pu- 2. 0 at% Ga alloy. Thermal cycling to below the ambient temperature results in a partial transformation to the alpha-prime phase; this transformation is composition-invariant and exhibits martensitic behavior. Because this transformation results in an unusually invariant large 25 % volume contraction that cannot be fully accommodated by purely elastic adjustments, the transformation mode is expected to involve burst formation of individual alpha-prime particles. However, upon cooling, these individual bursts were not resolved by the above techniques, although signals corresponding to the overall accumulation of many alpha-prime particles were observed. On the other hand, upon heating, signals from differential scanning calorimetry, resistometry, and dilatometry showed a series of discrete changes occurring in <b>periodic</b> <b>increments</b> beginning at approximately 32 C. These features correspond to the cooperative reversion of many alpha-prime particles to the delta phase; {{they appear to be}} the result of an interplay between the autocatalytically driven reversion of a cascade of individual martensite units, and self-quenching caused by small changes of temperature and/or stress accompanying each individual transformation burst.

30|$|Ring {{measurements}} {{were conducted in}} the laboratory {{with the aid of}} a digital caliper and an illuminated magnifier. Cores of relict and encroachment trees were used to determine <b>periodic</b> annual radial <b>increment</b> in 10 yr intervals from the inception of the encroachment cohort. For relict tree cores, an additional 10 yr period was measured to capture the growth rate prior to the appearance of the encroachment cohort. Robust, species-specific, and size-appropriate models of bark thickness from southern Oregon (Larsen and Hann 1985) were employed in the calculation of annual basal area increment from the measures of radial growth. Because cores were taken from bole locations between approximately 0.4 m to 1.4 m, subsequent calculations of radial and basal area increment derived from the cores are best interpreted as broadly representing the segment of tree boles within those height bounds, rather than at a specific height (e.g., tree base or breast height). In circumstances where cores did not permit accurate readings (e.g., heavy tannin accumulation and indistinguishable rings), they were discarded from the analysis. Different sample sizes were employed to estimate <b>periodic</b> annual <b>increment</b> due to variation in total number of annual rings per core.|$|R
