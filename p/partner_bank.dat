40|$|We {{report the}} results of a field {{experiment}} that randomly offered Malawian smallholder farmers formal savings accounts. We tested two primary treatments, offering either: 1) “ordinary” accounts, or 2) both ordinary and “commitment ” accounts. Commitment accounts allowed customers to restrict access to their own funds until a future date of their choosing. A control group was not offered any account but was tracked alongside the treatment groups. The commitment treatment led to increases in deposits at the <b>partner</b> <b>bank,</b> and over the next agricultural year caused increases in agricultural input use, crop sales, and household expenditures. The effects of the commitment treatment are not due to literally “tying the hands” of farmers, since farmers in that treatment mostly saved in ordinary accounts (rather than commitment accounts). We discuss other possible channels through which the commitment treatment’s effects may have operated, such as reduced sharing with one’s social network as wel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} in which asset linkages in a syndicated loan agreement can infect a healthy bank when its <b>partner</b> <b>bank</b> fails. We investigate how capital constraints affect {{the choice of the}} healthy bank to takeover or liquidate the exposure held jointly with the failing bank, and how the bank’s ex ante optimal capital holding and possibility of contagion are affected by anticipation of bail-out policy, capital requirements and the joint exposure. We identify a range of factors that strengthen or weaken the possibility of contagion and bailout. Recapitalization with common stock rather than preferred equity injection dilutes existing shareholder interests and gives the bank a greater incentive to hold capital to cope with potential contagion. Increasing the minimum regulatory capital does not necessarily reduce contagion, while the requirement of holding conservation capital buffer could increase the bank’s resilience to avoid contagion...|$|E
40|$|The recent credit {{crisis and}} the {{increased}} internationalization of the European banks have given {{the debate about the}} role of national regulators a renewed urgency. We therefore investigate the determinants of bondholders' abnormal returns for both domestic and cross-border bank merger announcements that involve European acquirers for the period 1998 - 2002. We find that bondholders' abnormal returns are higher for Domestic Mergers than cross-border mergers, in direct contrast to evidence from equity prices where no difference is found. Further investigations in which we control for the changes in market power for example suggest this result may be indicative of investors perceiving Domestic Mergers as increasing the probability of a government bailout in case of distress. Banks' bondholders also experience higher abnormal returns when the country of the <b>partner</b> <b>bank</b> has stricter rules in relation to forbearance of prudential regulations than the own country, and when functional diversification between lending and fee/trading activities increases.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{a special}} corporate banking product, {{the so called}} cash-pool, which gained remarkable popularity {{in the recent years}} as firms try to centralize and manage their liquidity more efficiently. The novelty of this paper is the formalization of a valuation model which can serve as a basis for a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the most important benefits of the firms arising from the pooling of their cash holdings. The literature emphasizes several benefits of cash-pooling such as interest rate savings, economy of scale and reduced cash-flow volatility. The presented model focuses on the interest rate savings complemented with a new aspect: the reduced counterparty risk toward the bank. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the value of a cash-pool is higher in case of firms with large, diverse and volatile cash-flows having less access to the capital markets especially if the <b>partner</b> <b>bank</b> is risky and offers a high interest spread. It is also shown that cash-pooling is not the privilege of large multinational firms any more as the initial direct costs can be easily regained within a year even in the case of SMEs...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{to analyze}} the {{similarities}} and differences between the regional finance of Japan and South Korea (hereinafter, “Korea”), we compared questionnaires to small to midsize companies located in Korea’s Daegu/Gyeongbuk region with questionnaires to small to midsize companies located in Japan’s Kansai and Tokai regions. From the results, we were able to confirm that regional finance systems in Japan and Korea are very similar. For example, in the US, there is an overwhelming amount of small to midsize companies with only one <b>partner</b> <b>bank,</b> however, in Japan and Korea, having multiple partner banks is the norm. Therefore, the practice of having multiple partner banks should not be considered as being unique to Japan, rather, it can be inferred that such a phenomenon is natural in certain social, economical, and legal systems. Contrastingly, we found various differences between Japan and Korea. For example, in response to the question on the assessment of financial institutions, Korea firms gave the most positive assessment for “provision of funds,” whereas Japanese firms gave the most positive assessment for “knowledge on your companies. ” These differences can be understood as the causes of the discrepancy between Japan and Korea in the level of economic development. ...|$|E
40|$|While {{remittance}} {{flows to}} developing countries are very large, it is unknown whether migrants desire {{more control over the}} uses to which remittances are put. This research uses a randomized field experiment to investigate the importance of migrant control over the use of remittances. In partnership with a large Salvadoran bank, we offered US-based migrants from El Salvador facilities for channeling remittances into savings accounts in their home country. We randomly varied migrant control over El Salvador-based savings by offering different types of accounts across treatment groups. The treatment that offered migrants the greatest degree of control over savings had the highest impact on savings accumulation at the <b>partner</b> <b>bank,</b> compared to comparison groups offered less or no control over savings. Effects of this treatment on savings are concentrated among migrants who express demand for control over remittances in the baseline survey. We also find positive spillovers of our savings intervention in the form of increased savings at other banks (specifically, banks in the U. S.), which is likely due to the financial education implicitly conveyed by our intervention. Our findings point to the potential for future innovations to enhance migrant control over remittance uses in other areas such a...|$|E
