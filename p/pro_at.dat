5|$|Apple {{received}} criticism {{after an}} incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 WWDC. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors {{instead of the}} newer E5 series. The line also lacked then-current technologies like SATA III, USB 3, and Thunderbolt, the last {{of which had been}} added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO Tim Cook promised a more significant update to the line in 2013. Apple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac non-compliant. The last day to order was February 18, 2013. The first generation Mac Pro was removed from Apple's online store following unveiling of the redesigned second generation Mac <b>Pro</b> <b>at</b> a media event on October 22, 2013.|$|E

25|$|Another great {{irritant}} {{was that}} it was open to all pros including A pros. Indeed, one pro was in the mains of the pro car race and therefore had a real shot at becoming National no. 1 pro, despite being only an A pro. On top of everything else, A pro needn't had been a <b>pro</b> <b>at</b> the start of the season. An amateur could theoretically race the required number of nationals as an amateur, turn pro before the Grand National and have a shot at the Pro number one title and the car.|$|E

In 1907 Hobens married an Irish girl, Delia Agnes Lally (1881–1969), and together {{they would have a}} house full of children, eight in all. At the time of his marriage he changed his surname from Hoben to Hobens.|$|E

25|$|Georges St-Pierre, a French-speaking Quebecer, {{was born}} on May 19, 1981 in Saint-Isidore, Quebec, to Roland and Pauline St-Pierre. St-Pierre had a {{difficult}} childhood, attending a school where others would steal his clothes and money. As a child he played hockey, skated and participated in several sports. He began learning Kyokushin karate at age seven from his father and later from a Kyokushin Karate Master to defend himself against a school bully. He took up wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and boxing after his karate teacher {{died when he was}} around 16 years old. Before turning pro as a mixed martial artist, St-Pierre worked as a bouncer at a Montreal night club in the South Shore called Fuzzy Brossard and as a garbageman for six months to pay for his school fees. Turning <b>pro</b> <b>at</b> age of 21 he had a black belt in Kyokushin already.|$|E
25|$|Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic {{used the}} Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed {{sponsors}} to Wilson in 2005. He couldn't find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson {{agreed to make}} him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head. After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed <b>Pro</b> <b>at</b> the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign. Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip. In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.|$|E

500|$|Original {{marketing}} {{materials for the}} Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 × dual-core 2.66GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words [...] "starting at" [...] or [...] "from" [...] when describing the pricing, but the online US Apple Store listed the [...] "Mac <b>Pro</b> <b>at</b> $2499", the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26GHz each. Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard expansion slots for graphics adapters and other expansion cards.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} annual High School Hoops magazine, the players {{weighed in on}} the subject of the new rules {{regarding}} draft eligibility. Many of them felt that it was unfair. Kansas State freshman Bill Walker, said (as a junior in high school), [...] "I'm against it. I don't see why you have to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous." [...] Jerryd Bayless said [...] "It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go <b>pro</b> <b>at</b> 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go <b>pro</b> <b>at</b> 18." [...] A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said [...] "It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain." [...] In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that [...] "…I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. Some guys who come in, like from this year's draft, it will help." [...] Brandan Wright said that [...] "It may hurt guys who need money, but it will help people grow and develop." ...|$|E
