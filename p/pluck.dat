5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens <b>pluck</b> yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to <b>pluck</b> fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to analyze the financial benefit of using Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method. The approach of the research is to compare the cash flow from Shear <b>Plucking</b> and Manual <b>Plucking</b> in one <b>plucking</b> cycle (4 years). Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method need additional treatment for land handling, additional tool for the modified scissor and additional fertilizer for the land. These treatments need additional cost. In the other side, Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce tea more than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method. Result of the research, show that Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method give more benefit than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method. Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce about 5. 000 to 6. 000 tons tea per hectare per year. Manual <b>Plucking</b> only produce tea about 2. 500 to 3. 000 tons per hectare per year. It means Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce about 2. 000 to 3. 000 tons more tea, than Manual <b>Plucking</b> per hectare per year. The cost of Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method is higher than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method, but if we compared with amount of product that produces by Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method, Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS) in this method is still lower than Cost Of Goods (COGS) in Manual <b>Plucking</b> method. The average price of goods sale for Manual <b>Plucking</b> method is more beneficial than Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method, because it's influence by the quality or grade of tea that can be produced by each method. Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method quality or grade of tea is better than Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method. In the future, Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method can be applied to other areas that havent used this metho...|$|R

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens <b>pluck</b> yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to <b>pluck</b> grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to <b>pluck</b> fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also <b>pluck</b> snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing and {{catching}} insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens <b>pluck</b> yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E
5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species <b>pluck</b> yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E

40|$|Whisker <b>plucking</b> in {{developing}} and adult rats provides a convenient method of temporarily altering tactile input {{for the purposes of}} studying experience-dependent plasticity in the somatosensory cortex. Yet, a comprehensive examination of the effect of whisker <b>plucking</b> on the response properties of whisker follicle-innervating trigeminal ganglion (NVg) neurons is lacking. We used extracellular single unit recordings to examine responses of NVg neurons to controlled whisker stimuli in three groups of animals: (1) rats whose whiskers were <b>plucked</b> from birth for 21 days; (2) rats whose whiskers were <b>plucked</b> once at 21 days of age; and (3) control animals. After at least 3 weeks of whisker re-growth, NVg neurons in <b>plucked</b> rats displayed normal, single whisker receptive fields and could be characterized as slowly (SA) or rapidly adapting (RA). The proportion of SA and RA neurons was unaffected by whisker <b>plucking.</b> Both SA and RA NVg neurons in <b>plucked</b> rats displayed normal response latencies and angular tuning but abnormally large responses to whisker movement onsets and offsets. SA neurons were affected {{to a greater extent than}} RA neurons. The effect of whisker <b>plucking</b> was more pronounced in animals whose whiskers were <b>plucked</b> repeatedly during development than in rats whose whiskers were <b>plucked</b> once. Individual neurons in <b>plucked</b> animals displayed abnormal periods of prolonged rhythmic firing following deflection onsets and aberrant bursts of activity during the plateau phase of the stimulus. These results indicate that whisker <b>plucking</b> exerts a long-term effect on responses of trigeminal ganglion neurons to peripheral stimulation...|$|R
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may <b>pluck</b> snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to <b>pluck</b> petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to <b>pluck</b> food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} <b>plucked</b> {{instruments}} (such as the lute), the musician directly touches the strings (usually <b>plucking)</b> {{to produce the}} sound. This has important consequences: Different tone/timbre (of a single note) can be produced by <b>plucking</b> the string in different manners and in different positions. For example, <b>plucking</b> an open string will sound brighter than playing the same note(s) on a fretted position (which would have a warmer tone).|$|R
50|$|When all ten strings are <b>plucked,</b> {{one method}} of tuning the begena is to tune {{each pair of}} strings {{to one of the}} pitches in a pentatonic scale.

Finally, while playing the begena using six strings, the left hand <b>plucks</b> strings one, three, four, six, eight, and ten (starting from the left side when facing the instrument). The {{pointing}} finger <b>plucks</b> strings three and four while the other fingers are in charge of controlling one string each.
