50|$|The example above shows Schulze STV's {{resistance}} to vote management. Since it performs Condorcet <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparisons,</b> like CPO-STV, it doesn't suffer from defects caused by sequential exclusions.

40|$|Abstract In the {{analytic}} hierarchy process (AHP), {{the consistency of}} <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> {{is measured by the}} consistency index (CI) value of <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrices. The CI value is defined by the size and the principal eigenvalue of comparison matrix, and the larger the CI value is, the less consistent <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> is. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of consistency intervals, in which the <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> value can move without exceeding given CI threshold. The proposed method is based on the eigenvalue method but does not calculate the principal eigenvalue and eigenvector at all, and hence, the method enables quick estimation. The method also enables us to detect which <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> leads to inconsistency of <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> and what extent the consistency can be improved, if the CI value of an original comparison matrix is large. Several numerical examples show that the proposed method is practically efficient...|$|R

40|$|Efficiency, {{the basic}} concept of multi-objective {{optimization}} is investigated {{for the class}} of <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrices. A weight vector is called efficient if no alternative weight vector exists such that every pairwise ratio of the latter’s components {{is at least as}} close to the corresponding element of the <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix as the one of the former’s components is, and the latter’s approximation is strictly better in at least one position. A <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix is called simple perturbed if it differs from a consistent <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix in one element and its reciprocal. One of the classical weighting methods, the eigenvector method is analyzed. It is shown in the paper that the principal right eigenvector of a simple perturbed <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix is efficient.

A <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix is called double perturbed if it can be made consistent by altering two elements and their reciprocals.

50|$|One {{family of}} Condorcet methods {{consists}} of systems that first conduct {{a series of}} <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparisons</b> and then, {{if there is no}} Condorcet winner, fall back to an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} linear {{programming}} method for generating {{the most favorable}} weights (LP-GFW) from <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrices, which incorporates the variable weight concept of data envelopment analysis (DEA) into the priority scheme of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to generate the most favorable weights for the underlying criteria and alternatives {{on the basis of}} a crisp <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrix. The proposed LP-GFW method can generate precise weights for perfectly consistent <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrices and approximate weights for inconsistent <b>pairwise</b> <b>comparison</b> matrices, which are not too far from Saaty's principal right eigenvector weights. The issue of aggregation of local most favorable weights and rank preservation methods is also discussed. Four numerical examples are examined using the LP-GFW method to illustrate its potential applications and significant advantages over some existing priority methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
