50|$|Amphibian: Male <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> (Dendrobates auratus) {{take on a}} {{very active}} {{parenting}} role. Females are lured by the males to rearing sites where they deposit their eggs. The male fertilises these eggs and accepts the burden of defending and caring for the young until they are independent. Because the male contributes {{a higher level of}} parental investment, females must compete for opportunities to leave their eggs with the limited available males.|$|E
50|$|Several {{scientists}} and students have undertaken studies in Piedras Blancas National Park, using La Gamba Field Station {{as a base}} for their investigative trips. They have produced a booklet with descriptions of 37 amphibian and 42 reptile species of the Esquinas rainforest. You are likely to encounter spectacularly colored frogs such as the red-eyed leaf frog or <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frogs,</b> tree frogs, glass frogs, rain frogs and cane toads. The nocturnal concert of frog calls at Esquinas Lodge is unforgettable. Basilisks and iguanas frequent the streams, anole lizards {{can be seen in the}} garden, and geckos can be seen chasing insects in the main lodge building at nighttime. The most common and most dangerous snake is the fer-de-lance, but coral snakes, vine snakes, boa constrictors and pit vipers are seen occasionally. Spectacled caimans live in the ponds, and American crocodiles can be seen in larger rivers and mangrove swamps.|$|E
50|$|Most animal {{sightings}} can {{be expected}} on the coastal track, with scarlet macaws (the largest population in the country) flying overhead, hermit crabs on the beach, pelicans fishing in the sea and, on the sections that go slightly inland, spider monkeys (take care not to get urinated on {{when they are in}} a tree overhead), tamandua anteaters, pumas, white faced capuchin monkeys, lineated woodpeckers and coatis (to name just a few). With luck one might even spot a tapir, even though they're nocturnal. Corcovado is also a good place to spot the red-eyed tree frog, as well as the glass frog with its transparent skin, and the enamel-bright <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frogs.</b> From Estación Sirena one can follow many short tracks, on which one can also take short night-strolls into the forest with a good chance of running into a tapir. They're impressive to see but harmless if left in peace. Jaguars are present and some individuals frequent the beach near Madrigal at night. You are very likely to see their tracks, sometimes very fresh and frequent, but very unlikely to see the actual cat. The most common animal in the park is by far the white-nosed coati, which one can expect to encounter dozens of times on the beach hike between La Leona and Sirena, digging for and feeding on the abundant moon crabs.|$|E
5000|$|The Golfodulcean poison <b>frog</b> or Golfodulcean <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Phyllobates vittatus) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae endemic to Costa Rica.|$|R
50|$|The splendid poison <b>frog</b> or splendid <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Oophaga speciosa) is {{a species}} of poison dart frog endemic to {{the eastern end of}} Cordillera de Talamanca, western Panama. Its natural {{habitats}} are humid lowland and montane forests.|$|R
50|$|Allobates femoralis (common name brilliant-thighed poison <b>frog,</b> brilliant-thighed <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog)</b> is {{a species}} of frog in the family Aromobatidae.It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname. Its natural habitat is {{tropical}} lowland forests.|$|R
40|$|Within the anuran amphibians, dendrobatoids (<b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frogs)</b> are {{renowned for}} their parental care, {{but the lack}} of highly {{variable}} DNA markers so far precluded precise and comprehensive measurements of their genetic mating system. Here we present 10 polymorphic microsatellites for Allobates femoralis, a widespread dendrobatoid from the Amazon basin. In 24 field-collected individuals, we found between seven and 15 alleles per locus, without deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or linkage disequilibrium. The loci will be employed to quantify reproductive success in view of male territoriality and female mate choice, as well as to determine the fine-scale genetic structure of local populations...|$|E
50|$|The yellow-bellied poison <b>frog,</b> yellow-bellied <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog,</b> or yellowbelly poison frog (Andinobates fulguritus) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is found in northwestern Colombia (Chocó Department and the westernmost Antioquia and Risaralda) and east-central Panama.|$|R
50|$|Minyobates steyermarki (formerly Dendrobates steyermarki) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae endemic to Cerro Yapacana in {{southern}} Venezuela. It is also known by the common names of demonic poison <b>frog,</b> demonic <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog,</b> or Yapacana's little red frog. It is monotypic in the genus Minyobates.|$|R
5000|$|Andinobates altobueyensis (synonyms [...] ) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Alto del Buey {{mountain}} in the Serranía del Baudó range, in the Chocó Department of western Colombia. Its common names include Alto de Buey poison <b>frog,</b> golden <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog,</b> and golden poison frog.|$|R
50|$|The marbled poison <b>frog</b> or marbled <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Epipedobates boulengeri) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae found in western Colombia (Cauca, Nariño, Valle del Cauca Departments, {{including}} Gorgona Island) and northwestern Ecuador, at elevations of 10 - 1500 m asl. It likely represents a species complex {{of at least two}} species.|$|R
50|$|The phantasmal poison <b>frog</b> or phantasmal <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Epipedobates tricolor) is {{a species}} of poison dart frog. It is endemic to Ecuador and known from the Andean slopes of the central Ecuador in Bolívar Province. They have radiant colors. This species is endangered, and {{there are only a}} few {{locations}} in the wild where they are known to live.|$|R
50|$|The lovely poison <b>frog</b> or lovely <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Phyllobates lugubris) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is found on the Caribbean versant of Central America from southeastern Nicaragua through Costa Rica to northwestern Panama, with one record {{just west of the}} Panama Canal. Populations from the Pacific versant, {{formerly}} included in this species, are now identified as Phyllobates vittatus.|$|R
50|$|The {{endangered}} Guajira mouse opossum (Marmosa xerophila) {{has been}} recorded in some places in Falcón.The species is found only in dry areas in Colombia and Venezuela around the mouth of Lake Maracaibo, mostly tropical thorn or very dry forest with mean temperatures above 24 C and rainfall from 250-500 mm.Much of its habitat has been converted to agriculture, and the remnants are very fragmented.The main breeding period in the Paraguaná Peninsula is the dry season in June and July.It may occur in the Cerro Santa Ana National Monument but has not been recorded there. Other vulnerable species found in the more wooded areas are ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), cougar (Puma concolor) and jaguar (Panthera onca).A <b>poison-arrow</b> <b>frog</b> species, Mannophryne lamarcai, was discovered in a small area of Socopó Ridge in Falcón at 520 m.The frog, considered critically endangered, was found in 2004 in a small marsh beside a dirt road and in calm sections of a small stream.The surrounding area was cloud forest that had been cleared to create cattle pasture.|$|R
