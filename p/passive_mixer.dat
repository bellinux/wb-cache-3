The films were designed to perform as <b>passive</b> <b>mixers</b> or adsorptive layers in sensors. Clustered films from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and nonafluoro(iso) butyl ether (HFE®) precursors on silicon, acrylic and glass substrates were prepared in an in-built plasma reactor. Profilometry and ellipsometry measurements were performed to determine thickness and refractive indexes. The chemical composition {{and the presence of}} carbon nodules were inferred from infrared (FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman microscopy data. Chemical characterization points out a silicone like structure, sensible to the presence of humidity as determined by CV analysis, and a fluorinated surface that protects against ultraviolet radiation (UVC). The film resistance to base/acid solutions was verified in an optical microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed cluster formation in the film. Microscopic images were analyzed using ImageJ® software in order to determine cluster size and density. Contact angle measurements evaluated the hydrophobic/hydrophilic film character for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These films present hydrophobic and organophilic characteristics; however, exposure to UVC leads to hydrophilic surfaces. The performance of miniaturized structures was simulated with FEMLAB ® 3. 2 software and then they were built and tested. Using a mechanical mask, 3 D-microchannels were modified and used as <b>passive</b> <b>mixers</b> and/or spray formation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the design of wideband SAW-less receivers for softwaredefined radios. The entire body of work is based on a single RF front-end architecture type: a <b>passive</b> <b>mixer</b> connected directly to the antenna port of the radio, without an LNA or matching network up front. This structure is inherently wideband which allows for a single receiver front-end to operate at a wide range of frequencies, as tuned by its local oscillator (LO). Additionally, the mixer exhibits the property of transparency from the baseband port of the radio to the RF port of the radio, and vice versa. The focus {{of the first half of}} the thesis is on developing a simple theoretical framework for the impedance characteristics of the <b>passive</b> <b>mixer,</b> and implementing a maximally flexible receiver which utilizes the mixer's transparency to the fullest extent. Additionally, it is shown that mixing with 8 non-overlapping phases instead of the traditional 4 has benefits beyond harmonic rejection extending to improved noise performance and increased impedance tuning range. This receiver exhibits low noise figure (~ 3 dB), excellent wideband linearity (IIP 3 [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 25 dBm), and unprecedented RF impedance control from the baseband side of the <b>passive</b> <b>mixer.</b> Another wideband receiver is presented which explores increasing the number of LO phases even further to 16 and 32, increasing the impedance matching range.

Finally in a new design, the power consumption of the receiver architecture is decreased by a factor of 5 x (and not scaling with RF frequency).

Yet, the inter-stage high-Q filter, rejecting the leaked transmit (Tx) signal between the LNA and mixer, is prevalent in frequency division duplexed (FDD) receivers, so that the amplified Tx signal does not corrupt overall receiver performance. This research is focused on the method of eliminating the inter -stage high-Q filter by adopting new circuit topologies. The main consideration is given to mixer design, since the mixer needs to be either highly linear or to reject the Tx signal by itself.
