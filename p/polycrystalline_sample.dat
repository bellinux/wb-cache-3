A sample in which these orientations are fully random is said to have no distinct texture.

Note that smaller currents (in average) are measured in the polycrystalline stack. However, since the EOT of the <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>sample</b> is smaller (see Table 1), its lower conductivity can only be attributed to the crystallinity of the stack and not to the reduction of the oxide thickness.

Both samples have also been analyzed with KPFM [21], which can provide information about the presence of charge and trapping centers in the stack.
