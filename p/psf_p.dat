40|$|The Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is an RNA {{pathogen}} {{that uses}} the host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) to replicate. Previous studies identified the right terminal domain of genomic polarity (R 199 G) of HDV RNA as an RNAP II promoter, but the features required for HDV RNA {{to be used as}} an RNA promoter were unknown. In order to identify the structural features of an HDV RNA promoter, I analyzed 473, 139 sequences representing 2, 351 new R 199 G variants generated by high-throughput sequencing of a viral population replicating in 293 cells. To complement this analysis, I also analyzed the same region from HDV sequences isolated from various hosts. Base pair covariation analysis indicates a strong selection for the rod-like conformation. Several selected RNA motifs were identified, including a GC-rich stem, a CUC/GAG motif and a uridine at the initiation site of transcription. In addition, a polarization of purine/pyrimidine content was identified, which might represent a motif favourable for the binding of the host Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated-splicing-factor (<b>PSF),</b> <b>p</b> 54 and Paraspeckle Protein 1 (PSP 1). Previously, it was shown that R 199 G binds both RNAP II and PSF, that PSF increased the HDV levels during in vitro transcription and that p 54 binds R 199 G. In the present study, I showed that PSP 1 also associates with HDV RNA and I investigated whether these proteins are required for HDV replication. My results show that knockdown of <b>PSF,</b> <b>p</b> 54 and PSP 1 resulted in a decrease of HDV accumulation. These proteins are highly concentrated in paraspeckles, which are nuclear structures involved in storage of transcripts generated by RNAP II. I found that upon viral replication in 293 cells, PSP 1 appeared as bigger foci present outside of the nucleus, while PSF and p 54 foci remained in the nucleus. NEAT 1 is a long non-coding RNA essential for the formation of paraspeckles. Upon HDV replication, I found an increase of the intensity and size of NEAT 1 foci that correlates with an increase of NEAT 1 transcripts. Altogether, these data suggest that HDV replication results in an alteration of the paraspeckles structures, providing foundation for further investigation of the paraspeckles role in HDV cycle. Overall, the present study addresses the importance of the HDV RNA structure and of the host paraspeckle proteins for HDV replication...|$|E

Methods We intensively surveyed three replicated plots for each restoration approach and cored and measured all living trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm using dendroecological methods. Dynamics of aboveground biomass and stem volume were calculated {{by means of}} allometric relationships and one-way tree volume models based on continuous variation of DBH. Important findings Forests in all three restoration approaches entered into an accelerated growth phase after 20 years, when significant differences in average DBH were observed among different forest types. Planted spruce (Picea asperata) forest (PSF) showed faster growth in mean DBH than secondary birch (Betula spp.) forest (SBF) and secondary coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (SMF). In the process of recovery, SMF had the highest aboveground biomass and stand volume; its biomass was significant {{higher than that of}} <b>PSF</b> (<b>p</b> SBF>PSF. After 30 years, the order changed to SMF>PSF>SBF. Results indicated that SMF had an advantage in both biomass and stand volume accumulation among the three restoration approaches...|$|E

40|$|The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of {{the largest}} subunit of {{eukaryotic}} RNA polymerase II (pol II) {{plays an important role}} in promoting steps of pre-mRNA processing. To identify proteins in human cells that bind to the CTD and that could mediate its functions in pre-mRNA processing, we used the mouse CTD expressed in bacterial cells in affinity chromatography experiments. Two proteins present in HeLa cell extract, the splicing and transcription-associated factors, <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO, bound specifically and could be purified to virtual homogeneity by chromatography on immobilized CTD matrices. Both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated CTD matrices bound these proteins with similar selectivity. <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO also copurified with a holoenzyme form of pol II containing hypophosphorylated CTD and could be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for this and the hyperphosphorylated form of pol II. That <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO promoted the binding of RNA to immobilized CTD matrices suggested these proteins can interact with the CTD and RNA simultaneously. <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO may therefore provide a direct physical link between the pol II CTD and pre-mRNA processing components, at both the initiation and elongation phases of transcription...|$|R

The interactions between nuclear receptors and RNA splicing factors link gene transcription initiation with pre-mRNA splicing, providing a coordinated {{control of the}} products of gene transcription. Here we report that two RNA splicing factors, PTB-associated splicing factor (<b>PSF)</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb, synergistically form protein complexes with the androgen receptor (AR) in a ligand-independent manner and inhibit its transcriptional activity. PSF does not affect AR protein stability, {{as in the case}} of the progesterone receptor, but impedes the interaction of AR with the androgen response element. Both splicing factors interact directly with mSin 3 A and attract mSin 3 A to the AR complex in a synergistic manner. The suppression of AR transcriptional activity by <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb is reversed by the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity.

To study how Bir 1 p promotes accurate segregation of chromosomes, we generated and analyzed a temperature-sensitive allele, bir 1 - 46, and carried out genetic screens to find genes that interact with bir 1 +. We identified <b>Psf</b> 2 <b>p,</b> {{a component of the}} GINS complex required for DNA replication initiation, as a high-copy-number suppressor of the bir 1 - 46 growth defect. Loss of <b>Psf</b> 2 <b>p</b> function by depletion or deletion or by use of a temperature-sensitive allele, psf 2 - 209, resulted in chromosome missegregation that was associated with mislocalization of Bir 1 p. We also found that the human homolog of <b>Psf</b> 2 <b>p,</b> <b>PSF</b> 2, was required for proper chromosome segregation. In addition, we observed that high-copy-number expression of Pic 1 p, the fission yeast homolog of INCENP (inner centromere protein), suppressed bir 1 - 46. Pic 1 p exhibited a localization pattern typical of chromosomal passenger proteins. Deletion of pic 1 + caused chromosome missegregation phenotypes similar to those of bir 1 - 46. Our data suggest that Bir 1 p and Pic 1 p act as part of a conserved chromosomal passenger complex and that Psf 2 p/GINS indirectly affects the localization and function of this complex in chromosome segregation, perhaps through an S-phase role in centromere replication...|$|R

While COX- 1 is constitutively expressed, COX- 2 is inducible and up-regulated in response to many signals. Since increased transcriptional activity accounts for only part of COX- 2 up-regulation, we chose to explore other RNA processing mechanisms in the regulation of this gene. Previously, we showed that COX- 2 is regulated by alternative polyadenylation, and that the COX- 2 proximal polyadenylation signal contains auxiliary upstream sequence elements (USEs) that are very important in efficient polyadenylation. To explore trans-acting protein factors interacting with these cis-acting RNA elements, we performed pull-down assays with HeLa nuclear extract and biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides representing COX- 2 USEs. We identified <b>PSF,</b> <b>p</b> 54 nrb, PTB, and U 1 A as proteins specifically bound to the COX- 2 USEs. We further explored their participation in polyadenylation using MS 2 phage coat protein-MS 2 RNA binding site tethering assays, and found that tethering any of these four proteins to the COX- 2 USE mutant RNA can compensate for these cis-acting elements. Finally, we suggest that these proteins (p 54 nrb, PTB, PSF, and U 1 A) may interact as a complex since immunoprecipitations of the transfected MS 2 fusion proteins coprecipitate the other proteins...|$|E

We have previously described a form of U 1 A present in human cells in significant amounts that is not associated with the U 1 snRNP or U 1 RNA but instead is part of a novel complex of non-snRNP proteins that we have termed snRNP-free U 1 A, or SF-A. Antibodies that specifically recognize this complex inhibit in vitro splicing and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, suggesting that this complex may play an important functional role in these mRNA-processing activities. This finding was underscored by the determination that one of the components of this complex is the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor, PSF. In order to further our studies on this complex and to determine the rest of the components of the SF-A complex, we prepared several stable HeLa cell lines that overexpress a tandem-affinity-purification-tagged version of U 1 A (TAP-tagged U 1 A). Nuclear extract was prepared from one of these cell lines, line 107, and affinity purification was performed along with RNase treatment.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of activator- and CTD-mediated stimulation of pre-mRNA processing. Affinity chromatography experiments reveal that two factors previously implicated in the coupling of transcription and pre-mRNA processing, <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO, preferentially bind a strong rather than a weak activation domain. Elevated expression in human 293 cells of PSF bypasses the requirement for a strong activator to promote efficient splicing and 3 ′-end cleavage. Truncation of the pol II CTD, which consists of 52 repeats of the consensus heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS, to 15 heptapeptide repeats prevents PSF-dependent stimulation of splicing and 3 ′-end cleavage. Moreover, <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb/NonO bind in vitro to the wild-type CTD {{but not to the}} truncated 15 -repeat CTD, and domains in PSF that are required for binding to activators and to the CTD are also important for the stimulation of pre-mRNA processing. Interestingly, activator- and CTD-dependent stimulation of splicing mediated by PSF appears to primarily affect the removal of first introns. Collectively, these results suggest that the recruitment of PSF to activated promoters and the pol II CTD provides a mechanism by which transcription and pre-mRNA processing are coordinated within the cell...|$|R

40|$|Rotators {{interacting}} with a pendulum via small, velocity independent, potentials are considered. If the interaction potential {{does not depend}} on the pendulum position then the pendulum and the rotators are decoupled and we study the invariant tori of the rotators system at fixed rotation numbers: we exhibit cancellations, to all orders of perturbation theory, that allow proving the stability and analyticity of the dipohantine tori. We find in this way a proof of the KAM theorem by direct bounds of the k [...] th order coefficient of the perturbation expansion of the parametric equations of the tori in terms of their average anomalies: this extends Siegel's approach, from the linearization of analytic maps to the KAM theory; the convergence radius does not depend, in this case, on the twist strength, which could even vanish ("twistless KAM tori"). The same ideas apply to the case in which the potential couples the pendulum and the rotators: in this case the invariant tori with diophantine rotation numbers are unstable and have stable and unstable manifolds ("whiskers") : instead of studying the perturbation theory of the invariant tori we look for the cancellations that must be present because the homoclinic intersections of the whiskers are "quasi flat", if the rotation velocity of the quasi periodic motion on the tori is large. We rederive in this way the result that, under suitable conditions, the homoclinic splitting is smaller than any power in the period of the forcing and find the exact asymptotics in the two dimensional cases (e. g. {{in the case of a}} periodically forced pendulum). The technique can be applied to study other quantities: we mention, as another example, the homoclinic scattering phase shifts.

Each step of transcription is regulated {{by a variety of}} cis-elements and trans-factors. Maturation of RNAPII transcripts is also a complicated course consisting of transcript capping, splicing and 3 end processing. It is widely accepted that RNAPII transcription and its RNA processing are interactional and different processes of RNAPII transcript maturation influence each other. In the attempt of finding the non-coding RNAs that can regulate the activity of RNAPII in mammals, we found that U 1 snRNA is associated with RNAPII no matter if RNAPII is transcribing or not. Moreover, using fluorescence microscopy, we showed that the interaction between U 1 snRNA and RNAPII is independent on splicing, which is the main function of U 1 snRNA. During the investigation of the effect of RNAPII on transcript maturation, I focused on post-translational phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNAPII, which is the unique domain of RNAPII in all RNAPI, II and III.

However, intramedullary nailing (IMN) of the humerus has gained in popularity over the last two decades. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of plate fixation versus intramedullary nailing of midshaft humeral fractures. The study included 91 patients treated at the department of Trauma Surgery of the University hospital of Leuven; 42 fractures had been treated by plate fixation and 49 by IM nailing. Union, functional outcome, possible complications and the need for additional surgery were compared between the IMN and PSF group. No significant difference in terms of fracture union and functional recovery was noted between the two groups. There were four cases of postoperative radial nerve palsy in the PSF group, versus two in the IMN group (non significant difference). A significantly larger number of patients with restrictive pain and/or functional hindrance in the shoulder or elbow was noted in the IMN group (p = 0. 0053). Problems with osteosynthesis material occurred as often in the PSF group as in the IMN group. One patient developed wound infection at the shoulder after antegrade nailing. A significantly larger number of complications was seen in the IMN group than in the <b>PSF</b> group (<b>p</b> = 0. 05).

These structures can induce mutagenesis, chromosomal translocations and genomic instability. We wanted to determine if proteins that bind triplex DNA structures are quantitatively or qualitatively different between colorectal tumor and adjacent normal tissue and if this binding activity correlates with patient clinical characteristics. Methods Extracts from 63 human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal tissues were examined by gel shifts (EMSA) for triplex DNA-binding proteins, which were correlated with clinicopathological tumor characteristics using the Mann-Whitney U, Spearman’s rho, Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox log-rank tests. Biotinylated triplex DNA and streptavidin agarose affinity binding were used to purify triplex-binding proteins in RKO cells. Western blotting and reverse-phase protein array were used to measure protein expression in tissue extracts. Results Increased triplex DNA-binding activity in tumor extracts correlated significantly with lymphatic disease, metastasis, and reduced overall survival. We identified three multifunctional splicing factors with biotinylated triplex DNA affinity: U 2 AF 65 in cytoplasmic extracts, and <b>PSF</b> and <b>p</b> 54 nrb in nuclear extracts. Super-shift EMSA with anti-U 2 AF 65 antibodies produced a shifted band of the major EMSA H 3 complex, identifying U 2 AF 65 as the protein present in the major EMSA band. U 2 AF 65 expression correlated significantly with EMSA H 3 values in all extracts and was higher in extracts from Stage III/IV vs. Stage I/II colon tumors (p[*]=[*] 0. 024). EMSA H 3 values and U 2 AF 65 expression also correlated significantly with GSK 3 beta, beta-catenin, and NF- B p 65 expression, whereas p 54 nrb and PSF expression correlated with c-Myc, cyclin D 1, and CDK 4. EMSA values and expression of all three splicing factors correlated with ErbB 1, mTOR, PTEN, and Stat 5. Western blots confirmed that full-length and truncated beta-catenin expression correlated with U 2 AF 65 expression in tumor extracts. Conclusions Increased triplex DNA-binding activity in vitro correlates with lymph node disease, metastasis, and reduced overall survival in colorectal cancer, and increased U 2 AF 65 expression is associated with total and truncated beta-catenin expression in high-stage colorectal tumors. </p...|$|R

The triplet ground state is mainly favored when negative hyperconjugation is involved. In the boryl-, alkyl-, and silyl-substituted phosphinidenes, the triplet state remains by far the ground state. When the substituents have pi-type lone pair electrons (i. e., -NX(2), -PX(2), -OX, -SX), the singlet state becomes stabilized by such an amount that both states have similar energies or even a change in ground state occurs. The most stabilized singlet ground states are attributed to <b>PSF</b> and PSCl. <b>P</b> and S have similar p-orbital sizes, making pi-delocalization easier. Implantation of alkyl and/or amino groups in the beta-position of amino- and phosphinophosphinidenes also contributes to a singlet stabilization. Bulky beta-groups also destabilize the triplet state by a steric effect. From a practical viewpoint, amino (P-NR(2)) and phosphino (P-PR(2)) derivatives bearing large alkyl groups (R) are the most plausible and feasible targets for preparing phosphinidenes possessing a closed-shell singlet ground state. status: publishe...|$|R

MÉTODO: Foram analisados 113 prontuários de hipertensos do programa tradicional e 113 do PSF. RESULTADOS: Os hipertensos do PSF foram estatisticamente diferentes dos demais (p OBJETIVO: Este trabajo compara dos grupos de hipertensos: uno atendido por el proceso tradicional de asistencia en la unidad básica de salud y otro acompañado por el programa salud de la familia (PSF). MÉTODO: Fueran analizados 113 prontuarios de cada grupo RESULTADOS: Los hipertensos del <b>PSF</b> fueron diferentes (<b>p</b> OBJECTIVE: The study {{compared}} {{two groups}} of hypertensive patients: one attended by the traditional process of basic health unit care {{and the other one}} followed by the Family Health Program (FHP). METHOD: 113 records of hypertensive patients attended by the traditional process basic heath unit care and 113 by the FHP RESULTS: The results showed that hypertensive patients from FHP were different (p< 0. 05) in relation to the others on the predominance of the white race; lower education level; fewer workers; older age and higher weight; more tobacco users; less alcoholic beverage, less physical activity, and longer time of hypertension. The patients from FHP had more nursing appointments, nursing home visit, medical home visit, and participation in specific groups; however, there were fewer medical appointments and more attendance at the emergence room. The patients at FHP presented a significant reduction in the blood pressure (152 ± 24 / 92 ± 15 vs 142 ± 21 / 85 ± 13 mm Hg) from the beginning {{to the end of the}} period of the study with initial systolic blood pressure higher than the patients from the traditional program.

40|$|International audienceIGF regulates steroidogenesis in granulosa cells through {{expression}} of the cytochrome P 450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P 450 scc) (CYP 11 A 1), the rate-limiting enzyme in this biosynthetic process. We showed previously that the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) acts as a repressor, whereas Sp 1 is an activator, of P 450 gene expression. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate IGF-stimulated ERK signaling regulating P 450 scc gene expression in the immortalized porcine granulosa cell line JC- 410. We used a reporter gene under control of the IGF response element from the P 450 scc promoter. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation with U 0126 [1, 4 -diamino- 2, 3 -dicyano- 1, 4 -bis(o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene] blocked IGF-I induction of IGF response element reporter gene activity. Western blotting revealed that IGF-I treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK that was specifically inhibited by U 0126. ERK activation led to phosphorylation of T 739 (an ERK site) on Sp 1 that was diminished by U 0126 or over{{expression of}} PSF. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of nuclear extracts showed that phosphorylated ERK (pERK) bound PSF under basal conditions. IGF-I caused dissociation of pERK from PSF. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that PSF and Sp 1 constitutively occupy the P 450 scc promoter independent of IGF-I treatment. These events provide a potential molecular mechanism for release of <b>PSF</b> repression of <b>P</b> 450 scc expression by dissociation of pERK and subsequent pERK-mediated phosphorylation of Sp 1 to drive transcriptional induction of the P 450 scc gene in the absence of altered binding of PSF or Sp 1 to the promoter. Understanding IGF-I regulation of these critical ovarian signaling pathways is the first step to delineating ovarian hyperstimulation syndromes such as polycystic ovarian syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Tumor redox is an {{important}} factor for cancer progression, resistance to treatments, and a poor prognosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to define tumor redox (over-reduction) using 62 Cu-diacetyl-bis(N 4 -methylthiosemicarbazone) (62 Cu-ATSM) PET and compare its prognostic potential in head and neck cancer (HNC) with that of 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (18 F-FDG). Thirty HNC patients (stage II-IV) underwent pretreatment 62 Cu-ATSM and 18 F-FDG PET scans. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVATSM and SUVFDG) and tumor-to-muscle activity concentration ratios (TMRATSM and TMRFDG) were measured. Reductive-tumor-volume (RTV) was then determined at four thresholds (40 %, 50 %, 60 %, and 70 % SUVATSM), and total-lesion-reduction (TLR) was calculated as the product of the mean SUV and RTV for 62 Cu-ATSM. In 18 F-FDG, metabolic-tumor-volume (MTV) and total-lesion-glycolysis (TLG) were obtained at a threshold of 40 %. A ROC analysis was performed to determine % thresholds for RTV and TLR showing the best predictive performance, and these were then used to determine the optimal cut-off values to stratify patients for each parameter. Progression-free-survival (PFS) and cause-specific-survival (CSS) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The means ± standard deviations of PFS and CSS periods were 16. 4 ± 13. 4 and 19. 2 ± 12. 4 months, respectively. A ROC analysis determined that the 70 % SUVATSM threshold for RTV and TLR was the best for predicting disease progression and cancer death. Optimal cut-offs for each index were SUVATSM = 3. 6, SUVFDG = 7. 9, TMRATSM = 3. 2, TMRFDG = 5. 6, RTV = 2. 9, MTV = 8. 1, TLR = 14. 0, and TLG = 36. 5. When the cut-offs for TMRATSM and TLR were set as described above in 62 Cu-ATSM PET, patients with higher TMRATSM (p = 0. 03) and greater TLR (p = 0. 02) showed significantly worse PFS, while patients with greater TLR had significantly worse CSS (p = 0. 02). Only MTV in 18 F-FDG PET predicted differences in <b>PSF</b> and CSS (<b>p</b> = 0. 03 and p = 0. 03, respectively). Tumor redox parameters measured by 62 Cu-ATSM PET may be determinants of HNC patient outcomes and help define optimal patient-specific treatments...|$|R
