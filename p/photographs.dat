5|$|As {{part of his}} job, he {{travelled}} around Britain, from Scotland in {{the north}} to the Scilly Isles in the south, often conducting his fieldwork by bicycle.

5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring <b>photographs</b> and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring <b>photographs</b> {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured <b>photographs</b> made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven <b>photographs</b> joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E
5|$|Beato's <b>photographs</b> of the Second Opium War are {{the first}} to {{document}} a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His <b>photographs</b> of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The <b>photographs</b> were not taken in this order, as the <b>photographs</b> of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E

5|$|By October 1860, Rossier had {{returned}} to Nagasaki, where he took <b>photographs</b> of the harbour {{on behalf of the}} British Consul, George S. Morrison, for which Rossier was paid $70. Although Rossier's <b>photographs</b> of Japan were advertised by Negretti and Zambra on at least two occasions in 1860, the firm did not publish them until October or November 1861. Five of Rossier's views of Japan appeared earlier, in George Smith's book, Ten Weeks in Japan, in April 1861, and that July, eight of Rossier's Japan <b>photographs</b> appeared in the form of lithographs in Henry Arthur Tilley's book, Japan, the Amoor, and the Pacific. An 1861 edition of the Illustrated London News included several engravings under the collective title Domestic Life in China, the images having been taken from Rossier's stereographs. One of the <b>photographs</b> Negretti and Zambra had advertised in 1860 became the first commercial photograph taken in Japan to be published, and is the earliest known hand-coloured Japanese photograph.|$|E
