40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} typically possess low {{charge carrier}} mobilities and Langevin-type recombination dynamics, which both negatively impact {{the performance of}} organic solar cells and photodetectors. Charge transport in organic solar cells is usually characterized by the mobility-lifetime product. Using newly developed transient and steady state photocurrent measurement techniques we show that the onset of efficiency limiting <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> {{is determined by the}} charge that can be stored on the electrodes of the device. It is shown that significant <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> can be avoided when the total charge inside the device, defined by the trapped, doping-induced and mobile charge carriers, is less than the electrode charge. Based upon this physics we propose the mobility-recombination coefficient product as an alternative and more convenient figure of merit to minimize the recombination losses. We validate the results in 3 different organic semiconductor-based light harvesting systems with very different charge transport properties. The findings allow the determination of the charge collection efficiency in fully operational devices. In turn, knowing the conditions under which non-geminate recombination is eliminated enables one to quantify the generation efficiency of free charge carriers. The results are relevant {{to a wide range of}} light harvesting systems, particularly those based upon disordered semiconductors, and require a rethink of the critical parameters for charge transport...|$|E

40|$|Time-resolved {{photoluminescence}} (PL) measurements {{have been}} used to study the temperature-dependent <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> dynamics in Cu[2]ZnSnS[4] (CZTS) single crystals. We found a significant change of nearly four orders of magnitude of the PL decay time, from microseconds at low temperatures to subnanoseconds at room temperature. The slow PL decay at low temperatures indicates localization of the photocarriers at the band tails. Due to the large band tail states, the PL decay time depends strongly on both the photon energy and excitation density. It is pointed out that the drastically enhanced nonradiative recombination at high temperatures {{is one of the main}} factors that determine the power conversion efficiency of CZTS-based solar cells...|$|E

The photocarriers are rapidly localized to shallow tail states within a typical time constant of several picoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds. The sub-nanosecond PL decay dynamics indicate the importance of multiple carrier trapping processes in the shallow tail states. Therefore, it is concluded that the tail states dominate the optical responses of Cu[2]ZnSnS[4] single crystals...|$|R
40|$|Light {{harvesting}} systems {{based upon}} disordered materials {{are not only}} widespread in nature, but are also increasingly prevalent in solar cells and photodetectors. Examples include organic semiconductors, which typically possess low charge carrier mobilities and Langevin-type recombination dynamics - both of which negatively impact the device performance. It is accepted wisdom that the "drift distance'' (i. e., the distance a photocarrier drifts before recombination) {{is defined by the}} mobility-lifetime product in solar cells. We demonstrate that this traditional figure of merit is inadequate for describing the charge transport physics of organic light harvesting systems. It is experimentally shown that the onset of the <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> is determined by the electrode charge and we propose the mobility-recombination coefficient product as an alternative figure of merit.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of semiconductor photodetectors {{is limited by}} <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> during the carrier transport process.

The material was fabricated by sintering chloride-capped CdTe nanocrystals into polycrystalline films, where Cl selectively segregates into grain boundaries acting as n-type dopants. Photogenerated electrons concentrate in and percolate along the grain boundaries - a network of energy valleys, while holes are confined in the grain interiors.

40|$|<b>Photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> {{dynamics}} in ternary chalcogenide CuInS 2 quantum dots (CIS QDs) was studied {{by means of}} femtosecond transient-absorption (TA) and nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Under strong excitation, the TA {{dynamics in}} CIS QDs is well described by a simple rate equation including single-carrier trapping, free-to-bound recombination, and trap-assisted Auger recombination. Under weak excitation, on the other hand, the PL decays of the QDs are composed of a short-lived component caused by surface trapping and a long-lived one caused by free-to-bound recombination. It is found that the surface trapping accelerates markedly with decreasing QD size while the free-to-bound radiative recombination hardly depends on the QD size. Besides this, we observed both {{a decrease in the}} PL lifetimes and a dynamic spectral redshift, which are attributed to the surface trapping and the coexistent inhomogeneous broadening in CIS QDs. The spectral redshift becomes less pronounced in CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs because of the suppression of the fast nonradiative recombination caused by the passivation of the surface traps. These results give clear evidence that the free-to-bound model is appropriate for interpreting the optical properties of CIS QDs...|$|E

We developed a model, using separate <b>photocarrier</b> trapping, <b>recombination,</b> and thermal reactivation processes, which very accurately fits the measurements. The measured material structures all exhibit a slow secondary decay process, which {{is attributed to}} thermal reactivation of the trapped carriers, either into the conduction band, or into high-energy defect states. We examined the influence of superlattice structure, dopants, DC bias, and temperature. Analysis shows {{that all of the}} THz energy produced by the photocarrier trapping and decay processes are at frequencies less than 1 THz, while the reactivation process only serves to create {{a large portion of the}} bias power dissipated. Energy higher than 1 THz must be created by a fast generation process or band-filling saturation. This allows pulsed THz generation even from a long-lifetime material. Pure optical pump-probe measurements are necessary to expose slow material processes, and eliminate the influence of electrical terminals and THz antennas. These measurements and modeling of THz photoconductive devices are necessary in order to optimize the output spectrum and power. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

It was also found that a higher intensity and a longer wavelength of constant light was more effective.

The challenges to realizing an efficient photoanode include the integration of a semiconductor light absorber and a metal oxide electrocatalyst to optimize corrosion protection, light trapping, hole transport, and <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> sites. To efficiently explore metal oxide coatings, we employ a high-throughput methodology wherein a uniform BiVO_ 4 film is coated with 858 unique metal oxide coatings covering a range of metal oxide loadings and the full (NiâFeâCoâCe) O_x pseudoquaternary composition space. Photoelectrochemical characterization of the photoanodes reveals that specific combinations of metal oxide composition and loading provide up to a 13 -fold increase in the maximum photoelectrochemical power generation for oxygen evolution in pH 13 electrolyte. Through mining of the high-throughput data we identify composition regions that form improved interfaces with BiVO_ 4. Of particular note, integrated photoanodes with catalyst compositions in the range Fe_((0. 4 â 0. 6)) Ce_((0. 6 â 0. 4)) O_x exhibit high interface quality and excellent photoelectrochemical power conversion.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) passes through a maximum with the increase of N, which is ascribed to the competition between the increase in optical absorption and <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination.</b> The maximal IPCE values for the In 2 O 3 /CdS and ZnO/CdS heterostructures are attained at N â 20, whereas for TiO 2 /CdS, the appropriate N value is an order of magnitude higher. The photocurrent and Raman spectroscopy studies of CdS nanoparticles revealed the occurrence of the quantum confinement effect, demonstrating the most rapid weakening with the increase of N in ZnO/CdS heterostructures. The structural disorder of CdS nanoparticles was characterized by the Urbach energy (E U), spectral width of the CdS longitudinal optical (LO) phonon band and the relative intensity of the surface optical (SO) phonon band in the Raman spectra. Maximal values of E U (100 â 120 meV) correspond to Ð¡dS nanoparticles on a In 2 O 3 surface, correlating with the fact that the CdS LO band spectral width and intensity ratio for the CdS SO and LO bands are maximal for In 2 O 3 /CdS films. A notable variation in the degree of disorder of CdS nanoparticles is observed only in the initial stages of CdS growth (several tens of deposition cycles), indicating the preservation of the nanocrystalline state of CdS over a wide range of SILAR cycles...|$|E

The research has shown good optical properties in a-BP:H films, but electrical properties acceptable for use in window layers have not been demonstrated yet. We have also found an interesting, conductive and transparent BPC:H film in a remote deposition region of the reactor, but have been unable to transfer deposition of this film to the standard interelectrode region. We have developed our capability to deposit nip sequence amorphous silicon based solar cells, and have demonstrated an open circuit voltage greater than 0. 7 V. We have continued our studies of built-in potentials in a-Si based solar cells using the electroabsorption technique, extending our measurements to include cells with wider bandgap intrinsic layers and Schottky barrier test structures. We have made the first time-of-flight drift mobility measurements on a-Si:H prepared by hot wire (HW) deposition.

40|$|International audienceCarrier {{dynamics}} of an organic molecular semiconductor, rubrene, was investigated by optical- pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy from 1 to 15 THz.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{demonstration}} of the generation of terahertz (THz) pulses from photoconductive (PC) antennas, research has pushed toward the development of smaller, cost efficient, and faster THz systems. This dissertation presents the work accomplished in order to realize these more practical terahertz (THz) photoconductive (PC) systems. First, this work will present a novel ErAs:GaAs photoconductive switch {{used to make a}} THz source excited by 1550 nm laser pulses. It will be shown that the excitation process taking place in the material relies on extrinsic (rather than intrinsic) photoconductivity. Then, several experiments will be presented that aim to improve the efficiency of the device and further the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. The erbium composition of the photoconductive layer will be varied and the effects of these variations on THz generation will be investigated. Then the wavelength of the drive laser used to excite the extrinsic photoconductive mechanism will be varied, while recording the photocurrent responsivity. This wavelength study will be used to find the optimal drive wavelength for maximum THz power. In conclusion, the results of these experiments will show that extrinsic PC THz generation is practical, cost effective, and capable of producing an average THz power of more than 100 Î¼ W. Coinciding with this high power level, the bandwidth of this new source was found to be 350 GHz, corresponding to a <b>photocarrier</b> <b>recombination</b> time of 450 fs. The work presented in this section will provide a path to develop superior THz PC sources that have a higher THz-power-to-cost ratio than {{the current state of the}} art. 	 	 Photoconductive antennas are mostly used to conduct spectroscopy measurements, either in time domain systems (TDS) or in frequency domain systems (FDS). Currently, both techniques can reach high-frequencies (3 Ìe 1 THz) but struggle to do so while making fast, high-resolution measurements (3 Ìc 2 GHz). In addition, both methods can be time consuming to set up and perform. A superior spectrum analysis technique would greatly facilitate THz application development by making results easier and less expensive to obtain. Therefore, the second part of this dissertation addresses the need for quicker and more precise THz spectrum analysis by demonstrating a new type of THz spectrum analyzer based on a high-speed, tunable, Fabry-Perot interferometer. This new and unique spectrum analyzer reduces the time required to obtain a THz spectrum (a few seconds), while producing a more precise result (3 Ìc 2 GHz resolution). After the presentation of this concept, the various experimental design iterations will be shown, while explaining the improvements gained from each. Then experimental demonstrations of the new spectrum analyzer will be presented, and possible future improvements will be discussed. 	 	 While the Fabry-Perot based spectrum analyzer is an improvement for THz spectroscopy, it can suffer from two issues: mirror reflectivity that changes with frequency, and the inability to easily tune the mirror reflectivity to optimize the system for different applications. These issues make it challenging to obtain an accurate and useful THz spectrum. Therefore the third part of this dissertation is motivated by these problems and presents a solution; the use of structured-surface-plasmon (SSP) enhanced polarizers as Fabry-Perot mirrors. The SSP polarizers used in this work are composed of metal wire-grids with sub-wavelength feature sizes and high metal fill-factors. It will be shown that high fill-factor SSP polarizers can achieve superior THz performance, compared to traditional THz polarizers, with an extinction ratio exceeding 60 dB. With the use of these polarizers as mirrors, the Fabry-Perot can achieve variable mirror reflectivity by changing the polarizer orientation angle. This will allow t [...] ...|$|E
