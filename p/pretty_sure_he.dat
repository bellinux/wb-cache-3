500|$|As {{early as}} 2004, agents working for Afghan {{intelligence}} determined that Bin Laden {{was living in}} a major settled area in Pakistan proper, rather than the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Amrullah Saleh told The Guardian. Leading Saleh and Afghan intelligence to that conclusion were [...] "thousands of interrogation reports" [...] and the assumption that Bin Laden [...] "a millionaire with multiple wives and no background of toughness would not be living in a tent". [...] "I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was in the settled areas of Pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate the tribal areas, and we had massive numbers of informants there. They could find any Arab but not Bin Laden." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
2500|$|So {{we went on}} out to Los Angeles and did ten tunes in two four-hour {{sessions}} [...] All {{of those}} tunes were standards, which I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had recorded before (and had hits on). But this time they had been arranged by Neal Hefti with our instrumentation and voicing in mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> does,' {{said the}} aunt; 'I did not stay long when I saw that I was not wanted, but I {{heard him say}} {{something}} about his having a home for her now, and her cutting out the Redcastle ladies.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A boar!" [...] said Bladud, {{in a low}} whisper, as he unslung his bow. [...] "Come, now, it {{will take}} all our united force to slay that brute, for, if I have not lost my power of judging such game, I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he's</b> a very big old boar with {{formidable}} tusks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I don't know {{anything}} about that Captain," [...] said Burke, [...] "or what he is after, but I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> won't dare to do anything to Shirley as long as I keep him in sight. And now I'm going to bear down on him again to hail him!" ...|$|R
60|$|I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was shamming, and {{to prove}} it, made a slight {{movement}} as if to rise.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> don't. Leastwise I didn't tell him, an' there's {{nobody else}} down there as knows {{anything}} about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{picked her}} up at Rome; but never mind where--somewhere. Now (this is entirely between ourselves), is she very plebeian?' ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} he had spoken with Trump about the visit, Rodman replied, “Well, I’m <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>pretty</b> much happy with the fact that I’m over here trying to {{accomplish}} something that we both need.” Rodman publicly presented a copy of Trump's book, [...] "The Art of the Deal" [...] to North Korean officials, as a personal gift for Kim Jong Un. In a twitter video posted by Rodman, his agent Chris Volo said, [...] "He's the only person on the planet that has the uniqueness, the unbelievable privilege of being friends with President Trump and Marshal Kim Jong Un." [...] Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and [...] "open doors between both countries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad!" [...] {{declared}} the young Southerner. [...] "But brace up, Ben, 'While {{there is life}} there is hope,' and it's a <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> thing that <b>he</b> wasn't killed." [...] And with this ray of comfort Ben had to be content.|$|R
6000|$|... "That? Oh, that's a young artist; young Englishman, named Tracy; very promising--favorite pupil of Hans Christian Andersen {{or one of}} {{the other}} old masters--Andersen I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> it is; <b>he's</b> going to half-sole some of our old Italian masterpieces. Been talking to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe so," [...] {{answered}} Jessie. [...] "Still, I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> couldn't {{afford to}} join Clavering {{and at the}} same time take up a big block of shares in Mr. Vane's mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Philip {{laughed with}} {{pleasure}} at the recollection, and Mildred laughed too. She was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had drunk {{more than was}} good for him. That was exactly what she had expected. She knew men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> did, {{although}} he didn't ask any questions. He {{knew about the}} robbery, and he knew well enough that I didn't have any three hundred dollars of my own to give him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well now, {{it appears}} to me," [...] rejoined Bones, [...] "that the man seems <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> of what <b>he</b> believes, and very {{reasonable}} in what he says, but I don't {{know enough about the}} subject to hold an opinion as to whether it's true or false." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{then he got}} to {{wandering}} along, and <b>pretty</b> soon, <b>sure</b> enough, <b>he</b> was telling! He was poking along {{through his}} ups and downs, and when he come to that place he went right along. He says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Terence replied. [...] "I feel <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that if <b>he</b> hadn't, {{you would}} not have knocked off spirits. Well, it is a glorious morning for starting, but I am afraid the fine weather won't last long. Everyone says that the rains {{generally}} begin about this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't ask that, Rose, but I wish you'd weigh {{and compare}} the two suits, and then choose which seems best. I leave it to your own commonsense," [...] {{answered}} Dr. Alec, feeling <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had won.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For my part,' said Dolly, in a {{thoughtful}} manner, 'I half believe Mr Chester {{is something like}} Miggs in that respect. For all his politeness and pleasant speaking, I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was making game of us, more than once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mother," [...] said Seth, [...] "thee'dst {{be doing}} Dinah a wrong by telling Adam what thee think'st about her. It 'ud {{do nothing but}} mischief, for it 'ud make Adam uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her. And I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> feels nothing o' the sort." ...|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{appeared}} on the November 1 episode of Raw in a pre-taped segment, where she dreams that Vince McMahon awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate. Vince's heart rate elevated {{more and more as}} Prinze informed him on what was [...] "wrong" [...] with WWE since he went into a coma. After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of [...] "the runs", in which he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside. McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies [...] "Yeah, he's in a coma. I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he's</b> brain dead."; McMahon responds by saying [...] "thank God," [...] and then lays back down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Lord Lufton. [...] "She will do {{exceedingly}} {{well for}} Justinia." [...] Now {{this was not}} good-natured {{on the part of}} Lord Lufton; and his mother felt it the more strongly, inasmuch as it seemed to signify that he was setting his back up against the Lufton-Grantly alliance. She had been <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> would do so in the event of his suspecting that a plot was being laid to catch him; and now it almost appeared that he did suspect such a plot. Why else that sarcasm as to Griselda doing very well for his sister? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, oi {{was afraid}} that soom sich thawt might be in your moind, Maister Ned, but it can't be done that way. But oi doan't know," [...] he said thoughtfully, [...] "perhaps it moight, arter all. Perhaps the chap as was a-coomin' forward moight take it into his head to go to Ameriky. Oi shouldn't wonder if he did, In fact, now oi thinks on't, oi am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> as <b>he</b> will. Yes. Oi can say for sartin as that's what he intends. A loife vor a loife you know, Maister Nod, that be only fair, bean't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, we {{may as well}} go indoors. The fellow is {{well out}} of our reach now, and we may be <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> will never again show his face here. Fortunately he heard nothing, for the serving men had but just left the room, and we had not yet begun to talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may as well}} {{mention it}} at last," [...] Nick went on. [...] "I had to say {{something}} to him in the lobby there when we met--something I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> couldn't like. I let him have it full in the face--it seemed to me better and wiser. I let him know that Juliet's married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] she interrupted. [...] "Nonsense! I {{ought not}} to have left you alone all this time, and, besides, I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> helped you into this trouble for his own ends. Anyway, we are all right now. I shall be in New York {{for a few days}} before I go to Washington. When I do go, you must see whether you can get leave and come with me." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Granny Fox kept {{thinking}} about Danny Meadow Mouse. She {{knew that he was}} fat, and it made her mouth water every time she thought of him. She made up her mind that she must and would have him. She knew that Danny had been very, very much frightened when she and Reddy Fox had tried so hard to catch him by plunging down through the snow into his little tunnels after him, and she felt <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> wouldn't go far away from the old fence-post, in the hollow of which he was snug and safe.|$|R
6000|$|Old Mother Nature {{shook her}} head. [...] "It wouldn't do, Peter, to trust {{you with a}} gun like Jimmy Skunk's," [...] said she. [...] "You are {{altogether}} too heedless and careless. If you had a scent gun like Jimmy's, I am afraid there would be trouble in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadow all the time. I suspect that you would drive everybody else away. Jimmy is never heedless or careless. He never uses that little scent gun unless he is in real danger or thinks he is. Usually <b>he</b> is <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> is before he uses it. I'll venture to say that not one of you has seen Jimmy use that little scent gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chilson {{went away}} suddenly," [...] he said. [...] "As to Delamore, of course {{as he is}} a Member {{he had to stop}} through the Session, but from what I hear, and as you know I have some good sources of information, I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> has got his conge too. I fancy Carthew is the favourite. As a rule I don't like these men who go in for racing, but he is a deuced-nice fellow. I have seen a good deal of him. He put me up to {{a good thing for the}} Derby ten days ago. He gives uncommonly good supper parties, and has asked me several times, but I have not gone to them, for I believe there is a good deal of play afterwards, and I cannot stand {{unlimited}} loo." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am taking}} all {{precautions}} {{to keep my}} name out of print {{in connection with this}} matter. And we will now keep the invention itself out of print as well as we can. Descriptions of it have been granted to the [...] "Dry Goods Economist" [...] (New York) and to a syndicate of American papers. I have asked Mr. Kleinberg to suppress these, and he feels <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> can do it.|$|E
60|$|They were abominably cold, {{even in my}} pockets, and I had {{suffered}} past several places {{trying to think of}} an excuse to go in. I now asked the druggist if he had something which I felt <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had not, and this put him in the wrong, so that when we fell into talk he was very polite. We agreed admirably about the hard times, and he gave way respectfully when I doubted his opinion that the winters were getting milder. I made him reflect that {{there was no reason for}} this, and that it was probably an illusion from that deeper impression which all experiences made on us in the past, when we were younger; I ought to say that he was an elderly man, too. I said I fancied such a morning as this was not very mild for people that had no fires, and this brought me back again to Janssen and Marina, by way of the coke-cart. The thought of them rapt me so far from the druggist that I listened to his answer with a glazing eye, and did not know what he said. My hands had now got warm, and I bade him good-morning with a parting regret, which he civilly shared, that he had not the thing I had not wanted, and I pushed out again into the cold, which I found not so bad as before.|$|E
6000|$|Bessie Grahame {{had been}} committed, it would seem, under suspicions of no great weight, since the minister, after various conferences, found her defence so successful, that he {{actually}} pitied her hard usage, and wished for her delivery from prison, especially as he doubted whether a civil court would send her to an assize, or whether an assize would be disposed to convict her. While the minister was in this doubt, a fellow named Begg was employed as a skilful pricker; by whose authority it is not said, he thrust a great brass pin up to the head in a wart on the woman's back, which he affirmed to be the devil's mark. A commission was granted for trial; but still the chief gentlemen in the county refused to act, and the clergyman's own doubts were far from being removed. This put the worthy man upon a solemn prayer to God, [...] "that if he would find out a way for giving the minister full clearness of her guilt, he would acknowledge it as a singular favour and mercy." [...] This, according to his idea, was accomplished in the following manner, which he regarded as an answer to his prayer. One evening the clergyman, with Alexander Simpson, the kirk-officer, and his own servant, had visited Bessie in her cell, to urge her to confession, but in vain. As they stood on the stair-head behind the door, they heard the prisoner, whom they had left alone in her place of confinement, discoursing with another person, who used a low and ghostly tone, which the minister instantly recognised as the Foul Fiend's voice. But for this discovery {{we should have been}} of opinion that Bessie Grahame talked to herself, as melancholy and despairing wretches are in the habit of doing. But as Alexander Simpson pretended to understand the sense of what was said within the cell, and the minister himself was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> heard two voices at the same time, he regarded the overhearing this conversation as the answer of the Deity to his petition, and thenceforth was troubled with no doubts either as to the reasonableness and propriety of his prayer, or the guilt of Bessie Grahame, though she died obstinate, and would not confess; nay, made a most decent and Christian end, acquitting her judges and jury of her blood, in respect of the strong delusion under which they laboured.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of the {{fundamental}} and seemingly simple aims of math-ematical knowledge management (MKM) is to develop and standardize formats that allow to “represent {{the meaning of the}} objects of mathemat-ics”. The open formats OpenMath and MathML address this, but differ subtly in syntax, rigor, and structural viewpoints (notably over calculus). To avoid fragmentation and smooth out interoperability obstacles, effort is under way to align them into a joint format OpenMath/MathML 3. We illustrate the issues that come up in such an alignment by looking at three main areas: bound variables and conditions, calculus (which relates to the previous) and “lifted ” n-ary operators. Whenever anyone says “you know what I mean”, you can be <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> does not know what he means, for if he did, he would tell you. — H. Davenport (1907 – 1969) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{everything}} {{will depend upon}} {{the result of the}} fight with the column. There is no doubt {{that they are going to}} be attacked in great force; which, as far as it goes, is all the better for us. If it were only a question of sniping by a small body of men, the colonel would no doubt push steadily on, contenting himself with firing occasional volleys into the bush; but if he is attacked by so strong a body as there appears to be round him, he will halt and give them battle. If so, we may be <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> will send them flying into the bush; and they won't stop running till they get back to the river. In that case, when we have allowed them all to pass we can go boldly on, and overtake the column at their halting place, this evening.|$|R
5000|$|Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 20 reviews. Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson called it [...] "a cohesively constructed concept album that will reward repeat listens." [...] Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented Cudi's themes of [...] "the stoned-and-alone rapper" [...] and stated, [...] "the music is as consuming and intoxicating as the lifestyle Cudi describes." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin commended it for [...] "boldly reshaping Cudi's sound - with vivid production" [...] and stated [...] "The dizzy friction between rap's grasping for control and rock's desire {{to lose it}} entirely give Cudi's confessions a dicey, volatile edge." [...] AllMusic writer David Jeffries said that, [...] "just like on his debut, the soundscape is spacy and far-reaching, making this interstellar therapy session a much more interesting transmission. At its best, it's fascinating." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole expressed that [...] "the hybrid production style proves an atmospheric and eerie delight" [...] and commended Cudi for his unconventional musical approach, writing in conclusion, [...] "Pursuing genius {{at the expense of}} consistency might work out just fine for Cudi: I'm not convinced that he's a good rapper, but I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he's</b> an important one." [...] Mark Beaumont of NME called it [...] "a grungy, filthy record full of angels and demons." [...] Pitchforks Jayson Greene called Man on the Moon II [...] "a bumpy listen", but found it [...] "more fully realized" [...] than Cudi's debut album.|$|R
