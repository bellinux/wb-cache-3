40|$|An 84  year {{old women}} {{developed}} erythematous blotchy erythema and <b>purpuric</b> <b>rashes</b> over the lower limbs {{three days after}} being started on intravenous cefuroxime for acute diverticulitis. A skin biopsy specimen showed a mixed infiltrate of lymphoid cells and eosinophils; many of the lymphocytes were large, pleomorphic, and showed a raised mitotic rate.

Typical mycosis fungoides cells, marked epidermotropism, and Pautrier's abscesses were not seen.

40|$|Background:Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is {{the most}} common {{vasculitis}} of childhood. HSP can affect multiple organs presenting with a characteristic rash in most of the patients. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited inflammatory disease common in mediterranean populations. HSP {{is the most}} common vasculitis seen in children with FMF. Case Presentation:A 16 year old boy was referred with history of abdominal pain lasting for 20 days. He was hospitalized and had appendectomy. Due to the persistence of his abdominal pain after surgery he was admitted to our hospital. His physical examination showed palpable <b>purpuric</b> <b>rashes</b> symmetrically distributed on lower extremities. Abdominal examination revealed periumbilical tenderness. Laboratory tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and severe proteinuria. The fecal occult blood testing was positive. Based on these clinic findings, the patient was diagnosed as HSP with renal, gastrointestinal tract and skin involvement. We performed DNA analysis in our patient because he had diagnosis of vasculitis with severe symptoms and found that he was carrying heterozygote P 369 S mutation. Conclusion:Our case is noteworthy as it indicates that it may be important not to overlook presence of FMF mutations in patients with a diagnosis of severe vasculitis...|$|R
40|$|Septic shock {{caused by}} Neisseria meningitidis is {{typically}} rapidly evolving and often fatal despite antibiotic therapy. Further {{understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying the disease is necessary to reduce fatality rates. Postmortem samples from the characteristic <b>purpuric</b> <b>rashes</b> of the infection show bacterial aggregates in close association with microvessel endothelium but the species specificity of N. meningitidis has previously hindered {{the development of an}} in vivo model to study the role of adhesion on disease progression. Here we introduced human dermal microvessels into SCID/Beige mice by xenografting human skin. Bacteria injected intravenously exclusively associated with the human vessel endothelium in the skin graft. Infection was accompanied by a potent inflammatory response with the secretion of human inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Importantly, infection also led to local vascular damage with hemostasis, thrombosis, vascular leakage and finally purpura in the grafted skin, replicating the clinical presentation {{for the first time in}} an animal model. The adhesive properties of the type IV pili of N. meningitidis were found to be the main mediator of association with the dermal microvessels in vivo. Bacterial mutants with altered type IV pili function also did not trigger inflammation or lead to vascular damage. This work demonstrates that local type IV pili mediated adhesion of N. meningitidis to the vascular wall, as opposed to circulating bacteria, determines vascular dysfunction in meningococcemia...|$|R

50|$|IgA {{nephropathy}} is {{the most}} common glomerulonephritis worldwide. Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus.
