40|$|Accessing the {{perceptually}} {{relevant information}} contained in music signals is a classical multidimensional signal processing problem. Applications like automatic transcription, content based audio classification, music indexing etc. require identification and <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> notes played by polyphonic instruments under noisy conditions. An important step {{in the direction of}} generic automatic transcription is the process <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking.</b> The ease <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> depends on the clarity with which the instrument can be recognized in “ecological ” music signals. Intuitively, identification of the perceptually significant parameters of an instrument must facilitate the process <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> polyphonic instruments. Popular approaches for <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> are use <b>of</b> sinusoidal models and auditory models. Previous methods <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> are discussed and analyzed for performance under polyphonic conditions.

40|$|Intonation is an {{important}} concept in Carnatic music that is characteristic of a raaga, and intrinsic to the musical expression of a performer. In this paper we approach the description of intonation from a computational perspective, obtaining a compact representation <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> a recording. First, we extract pitch contours from automatically selected voice segments. Then, we obtain a a <b>pitch</b> histogram <b>of</b> its full pitch-range, normalized by the tonic frequency, from which each prominent peak is automatically labelled and parametrized. We validate such parametrization by considering an explorative classification task: three raagas are disambiguated using the characterization of a single peak (a task that would seriously challenge a more naïve parametrization). Results show consistent improvements for this particular task. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative assessment on a larger collection of raagas, showing the discriminative power of the entire representation. The proposed generic parametrization of the intonation histogram should be useful for musically relevant tasks such as performer and instrument characterization. 1...|$|R

40|$|The HMM-based speech {{synthesis}} system can produce high quality synthetic speech with flexible modeling of spectral and prosodic parameters. In this approach, short term spectra, fundamental frequency (F 0) and duration are generated by multi-stream HMMs separately. However {{the quality of}} synthetic speech degrades when feature vectors used in training are noisy. Among all noisy features, pitch tracking errors and corresponding flawed voiced/unvoiced (VU) decisions are the two key factors in voice quality problems. Pitch tracking errors occur more often in Mandarin vowels of Tone 3 and Tone 4, because the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> these vowels can be very low and sometimes treated as aperiodic signal. On the other hand, F 0 values in unvoiced regions, such as consonants, are normally defined as unavailable; it is then impossible to use standard HMMs for F 0 modeling. Currently a preferred method to solve this {{is to use a}} multi-space distribution HMM (MSDHMM). In this approach, discrete distributions are used for modeling the VU decision and continuous Gaussian distributions are used for F 0 modeling within the voiced regions. Due to this assumption of undefined F 0 values in unvoiced regions and the special structure of MSDHMM, the generated F 0 values are limited in accuracy. In this paper, an F 0 generation process model is used to estimate F 0 values in the region <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> errors, as well as in unvoiced regions.

50|$|PAL {{usually has}} 576 visible lines {{compared}} with 480 lines with NTSC, meaning that PAL has a 20% higher resolution, {{in fact it}} even has a higher resolution than Enhanced Definition standard (854x480). Most TV output for PAL and NTSC use interlaced frames meaning that even lines update on one field and odd lines update on the next field. Interlacing frames gives a smoother motion with half the frame rate. NTSC is used with a frame rate of 60i or 30p whereas PAL generally uses 50i or 25p; both use a high enough frame rate to give the illusion of fluid motion. This {{is due to the}} fact that NTSC is generally used in countries with a utility frequency of 60 Hz and PAL in countries with 50 Hz, although there are many exceptions. Both PAL and NTSC have a higher frame rate than film which uses 24 frames per second. PAL has a closer frame rate to that of film, so most films are sped up 4% to play on PAL systems, shortening the runtime of the film and, without adjustment, slightly raising the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the audio <b>track.</b> Film conversions for NTSC instead use 3:2 pull down to spread the 24 frames of film across 60 interlaced fields.
