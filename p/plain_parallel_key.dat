50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>keys</b> are {{the most}} widely used. They have a square or {{rectangular}} cross-section. Square keys are used for smaller shafts and rectangular faced keys are used for shaft diameters over 6.5 in or when the wall thickness of the mating hub is an issue. Set screws often accompany <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> to lock the mating parts into place. The keyway is a longitudinal slot in both the shaft and mating part.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In current day scenario, {{the need}} to protect {{information}} has become very important and hence the need for cryptographic algorithms is high. Here, we extend the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> encryption algorithm and bring out its full potential by implementing the various cryptographic modes such as cipher block chaining and interleaved cipher block chaining where commendable increase in efficiency and reduction in encryption and decryption time can be seen. We have also considerably increased the key size by using 1024 bit and 2048 bit keys for the algorithmic implementation and in CBC and interleaved CBC execution. Our practical analysis has brought to front the salient features of the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> encryption algorithm and its ability to provide enhanced data protection when using a larger key size along with its randomness property. In theoretical analysis, it can be shown that remarkable reduction in encryption and decryption time of cryptographic systems is achieved and an enhanced strength to the system against brute force attacks is achieved. Furthermore, PCA can be extended for different cryptographic modes, using varying key size and number of keys used in the process. Keywords — <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> encryption, cipher block chaining, CBC, interleaved CBC, ICBC, RSA. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the paper}} we study <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> {{exchange}} among multiple parties. The status of <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> exchange can be depicted by a key graph. In a key graph, a vertex represents {{a party and}} an edge represents a relation of two parties who are to share a key. We first propose a security model for a key graph, which extends the Bellare-Rogaway model for two-party key exchange. Next, we clarify the relations among the various security notions of key exchange. Finally, we construct an efficient key exchange protocol for a key graph using the randomness re-use technique. Our protocol establishes the multiple keys corresponding to all edges of a key graph in a single session. The security of our protocol is proven in the standard model...|$|R

50|$|Physio-graphically, Somalia {{is a land}} {{of limited}} contrast. In the north, a {{maritime}} semidesert <b>plain</b> <b>parallels</b> the Gulf of Aden coast, varying in width from roughly twelve kilometers {{in the west to}} as little as two kilometers in the east. Scrub-covered and generally drab, this plain, known as the Guban (scrub land), is crossed by broad, shallow watercourses that are beds of dry sand except in the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the vegetation, which is a combination of low bushes and grass clumps, is quickly renewed, and for a time the guban provides some grazing for nomad livestock. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.|$|R

A highly focused beam of near-infrared light (1064 nm) was applied, inducing an electrothermal microfluidic vortex that carried nanoparticles to its center where they were accumulated. This technique was demonstrated with 49 nm and 100 nm fluorescent polystyrene particles and characterized as a function of applied AC frequency and voltage. With this technique the location and shape of colloidal concentration was reconfigured by controlling the optical landscape, yielding dynamic control of the aggregation.
