50|$|In simple terms, {{the process}} of {{polishing}} concrete is similar to sanding wood. Heavy-duty <b>polishing</b> <b>machines,</b> for example concrete grinder, are used to gradually grind down surfaces to the desired degree of shine and smoothness.

50|$|Harvested rice {{is subject}} to milling to remove the husk, which {{encloses}} the kernel. Before this process is started, the rice from the field {{is subject to}} a cleaning process to remove stalks and any extraneous material by means of special machinery. In the case of parboiled rice, a steam pressure process is adopted for milling. After drying, the rice is subjected to further processing to remove the hull and then polished. Brown rice is processed through a shelling machine which removes the hull. The resulting brown rice retains the brawn layer around the kernel. In the case of white rice, the hull and the brawn are removed and polished in a <b>polishing</b> <b>machine,</b> producing a polished kernel.|$|E

The first {{documents}} referring to Créteil are from the Merovingian era, when it was known as Vicus Cristoilum The name comes from the prefix crist and oilum.

The [...] "clearing" [...] of the [...] "ridge" [...] of the Mont-Mesly is on the road connecting Paris and Sens (Trunk Road 19 today). In 1406, the place name [...] "Créteil" [...] makes its appearance after successive deformations from Cristoill (1278), Cristeuil, Cresteul then Creteuil.|$|E

50|$|Between 1438 and 1446 (several {{decades before}} the {{activities}} of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin {{on a wide variety}} of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a folding ladder and a gem <b>polishing</b> <b>machine.</b> Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Liège's Speculum musicae. The best known part is his treatise on the design and construction of musical instruments, containing, amongst others, the earliest illustration of a harpsichord. He gave a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. All instruments were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295).|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} time {{required}} to complete the fuel polishing process depends on several factors. One {{of the most important}} is the specific fuel <b>polishing</b> <b>machine</b> used. Fuel cleaning machines can polish at rates from 8 litres per minute to upwards of 400 litres per minute, however the factors which govern the process are about more than just flow rate. In fact a high flow rate can be detrimental to the overall effect due to increased pressures in the filter stages and adverse disturbance in the fuel tank. Another factor can be the quality of the fuel. If the fuel is highly contaminated it will typically take longer to clean than a batch of cleaner fuel of the same volume. The third factor to take into account is the volume of fuel to be processed. It may seem obvious but the larger the volume of fuel that requires polishing, the longer it will take to complete the cleaning process.|$|E
5000|$|Very old {{traces of}} {{occupation}} exist, in particular a <b>polishing</b> <b>machine</b> {{found on the}} southern slope of the valley. The village really started to develop around the priory of Wandrille Saint, depending on the Abbey of Saint-Wandrille. In 854, a charter of Charles the Bald mentions Marcoussis. Initially, {{it would only be}} absolutely necessary for one vinyard at Bution, near to Arpajon. The monks losing Bution settled in Marcoussis {{at the beginning of the}} 12th century. The absence of records prevents an exact description of what was the priory at the time. It is known only that in 1298, there remained only one monk and that the village had 120 inhabitants. Célestins arrived at the beginning of the 15th century, and absorbed the possessions of the old ruined priory. But the history of Marcoussis also includes the construction desired by Jean de Montagu in 1404-1408. Minister of Finance for Charles VI of France he built his castle here (of which only the base and a tower remains, known as the Oubliettes), the convent of Célestins (remains of the cellars and a portion of the gate) and ordered the rebuilding of the village church. The church shelters a superb marble statue of the Virgin Mary donated by Jean de Berry to the convent of Célestins. The kings came to hunt at Marcoussis and there remains the royal house built under Louis XV. There was a commandry of the order of Saint Jean of Jerusalem from the 13th century (Brother Baudoyn commander of the [...] "meson of the flood" [...] in 1290); a vault is still visible. On the plateau close to Nozay, an important establishment of [...] Alcatel shelters research laboratories.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>polishing</b> <b>machine</b> with {{serial-parallel}} {{mechanism is}} presented. Since the machine {{make use of}} horizontal layout, {{the gravity of the}} moving part causes deformation of the end-effector and affects the machining accuracy. As a result, it is essential to analyze the deformation due to gravitational effect. Firstly, the structure and working principle of the serial-parallel <b>polishing</b> <b>machine</b> is introduced. Secondly, the compliance model of the parallel mechanism is formulated based upon the virtual work principle and the deformation superposition principle. The compliance model is established by taking both the deformations of leg system and drive system into account. Hence, the gravity of all moving components and the corresponding deformations are calculated. The results show that gravity has a greater effect on the positional accuracy of the machine. This investigation will provide informative guidelines for optimal stiffness design and gravity compensation of the <b>polishing</b> <b>machine.</b> Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
