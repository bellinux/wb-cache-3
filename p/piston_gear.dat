40|$|For {{aerospace}} applications, vapor compression {{heat pump}} {{can be used}} as thermal control system to collect the heat from electronic devices and transport heat to radiator by which heat can be rejected to space. Heat pumps can be used in two cases. The first consists of raising the temperature of heat energy so that the amount of radiator surface required is reduced. The second involves situations where heat cannot be directly rejected by radiators, because the heat sink temperature is higher than that of the heat source. However, the key problem is to make a small and lightweight refrigeration compressor. In order to meet the need for aerospace applications, an innovative miniature hermetic Wankel compressor was proposed and designed in this paper. We fabricated the components such as shell, cylinder, rotor, <b>piston</b> <b>gear,</b> stationary gear, rotor and stator of motor. A compressor prototype was manufactured by integrating these components. The experimental system was built to test the performances of compressor prototype. The effects of condensing temperature, compressor rotation speed and refrigerant charge on the compressor performance were obtained. The influences of tilt angle on the performances of compressor were also investigated. The results indicated that the prototype have good performance, reliability and micro-gravity adaptability...|$|E

The lever {{is linked to}} the valve <b>gear</b> <b>piston</b> inside the high pressure steam port. The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve <b>gear</b> <b>piston</b> could safely be moved a short distance using the lever as a fulcrum linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead.|$|R
50|$|Steam turbine {{locomotives}} lack <b>pistons,</b> valve <b>gear</b> {{and other}} fore-aft reciprocating components {{making it possible}} to balance the wheels and connecting rods to eliminate hammer blow. Steam turbine locomotives were tried by several companies around the world in the 1930s and 1940s (such as the Pennsylvania Railroad's S2 6-8-6 and the LMS' Turbomotive). Whilst many of these turbine locos suffered problems in service (usually excessive fuel consumption and/or poor reliability) they did prove to be free from hammer blow and offered a way of achieving high power outputs and speeds without causing track damage.|$|R
50|$|One {{practical}} application of elastic neutron scattering/diffraction {{is that the}} lattice constant of metals and other crystalline materials can be very accurately measured. Together with an accurately aligned micropositioner {{a map of the}} lattice constant through the metal can be derived. This can easily be converted to the stress field experienced by the material. This has been used to analyse stresses in aerospace and automotive components to give just two examples. The high penetration depth permits measuring residual stresses in bulk components as crankshafts, <b>pistons,</b> rails, <b>gears.</b> This technique has {{led to the development of}} dedicated stress diffractometers, such as the ENGIN-X instrument at the ISIS neutron source.|$|R

2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, <b>pistons,</b> valve <b>gear</b> and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|R
50|$|The Merlin was an {{evolution}} of earlier modification programmes performed by Swearingen Aircraft. Ed Swearingen started the developments {{that led to}} the Merlin through gradual modifications to the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air business aircraft which he dubbed Excalibur. Then a hybrid aircraft was developed, with a new fuselage and vertical fin, mated to salvaged and modified (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear. This was the SA26 Merlin, more-or-less a pressurized Excalibur but fitted with a different model engine, the Lycoming TIGO-540 6-cylinder <b>geared</b> <b>piston</b> engine. The TIGO 540 was used despite the fact {{that one of the reasons}} the IO-720 was used in the Excalibur was that the Queen Air series' IGSO-480 and IGSO-540 engines from the same manufacturer were so troublesome. The decision was soon made to offer increased engine power, which was achieved through installing two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-20 turboprop engines, resulting in the SA26-T Merlin IIA.|$|R
40|$|Vane {{pumps are}} simple in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a vane pump is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as <b>gear</b> pumps and <b>piston</b> pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow ripple. Power steering vane pumps are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of vane pump, and indeed to <b>piston</b> and <b>gear</b> pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model of a vane pump is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring. A simplified method for calculation of pump flow ripple from in-situ pump pressure ripple measurements and system impedance is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Friction, wear, and {{lubrication}} {{have direct}} influence on performance, reliability, and service life of mechanical systems with moving components. The useful life {{of these systems}} and their efficiency can be improved by improving the surface properties/ performance at sliding interfaces. Further, the usage of materials for sliding systems is limited in extreme environments, such as high temperature, and space, etc., due to their limited surface properties. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a new class of composites with superior surface properties, i. e., low friction and high wear resistance for extreme environmental conditions. Alumina, a well understood material for its tribological performance, is a merit choice for applications where high wear resistance is required, such as pump bearings, seal rings, valve seats, <b>piston</b> components, <b>gears,</b> cutting tool inserts and artificial joints. We propose to develop a novel alumina based ceramic composite to enhance its surface and tribological properties using a powder compaction technique. The newly developed composites will be characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope (FTIR), Optical microscope, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM), Goniometer and Surface profilometer. In-situ formation of high temperature stable phases, effect of sintering temperature, and percentage of reinforcement on phase formation will be studied. Investigation of effect of sintering temperature and percentage of reinforcement on density, porosity, and grain size will be conducted. The composites will be characterized for their tribological properties (friction and wear). The mechanisms for modified friction and wear will be proposed. The process parameters and compositions will be optimized. XRD results confirmed the formation of Al 18 B 4 O 33, and AlB 2 and FTIR confirmed the presence of B 2 O 3. Increase in sintering temperature and wt % of boron affected the porosity, grain size, and hardness of the composites. The coefficient of friction was lower for the composites compared to pure alumina ceramic. The coefficient of friction decreased with increase in sintering temperature. The wear mechanism was found to be micro-fracture using ESEM and SEM studies...|$|R

40|$|LectureReciprocating {{compressors}} {{constructed to}} API- 618 standards find application in refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipelines around the world. These compressors are constructed with a force-fed lubricated crosshead that drives a double-acting piston via a piston rod. Looseness {{in the running}} <b>gear</b> (<b>piston</b> assembly, connecting rod assembly, and crosshead assembly) results in knocks (impulse events) that are usually detected at the crosshead guide with accelerometers and, in some cases, with proximity probes measuring the piston rod vibration at the pressure packing case. Crosshead guide accelerometers have proven successful in detecting and preventing catastrophic failure; however, the alarm set points for the vibration levels have been derived heuristically because no model exists that relates forces and impacts within the running gear to the vibration of the crosshead guide. This paper presents {{a model of the}} crosshead system that estimates the vibration response of the crosshead and crosshead guide in reaction to the forces and impulses in the running gear. The model incorporates the oil-film behavior including non-linear, position-dependent stiffness and damping. The paper also examines the system response in the time domain and the complex plane (eigenvalue migration). The numerical model results are validated by comparison with data acquired on operating machines in known conditions of distress. The results show good agreement between the model and crosshead and piston rod vibration data, both in the timing and amplitude of vibration. Using the results of the model and historical data collected from operating reciprocating compressors the paper concludes with guidelines for filtering of crosshead accelerometer signals and alarm thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{internal}} combustion engine technology development has been targeted towards improving operating efficiency and thereby lowering fuel consumption. Friction Mean Effective Pressure (FMEP) accounts for 7 - 15 % of the total indicative power produced in an engine cycle for large diesel engines, such as in trucks. The base-engine components such as <b>piston</b> rings, bearings, <b>gears,</b> seals and pumps contribute 60 % - 70 % of this FMEP. Minimizing the friction losses in the engine would translate to a direct reduction in fuel consumption. The development of low friction engine technology requires extensive studies and testing, with major challenges associated with the accurate measurement of individual component contribution to the overall engine friction power loss. Therefore, the requirement for a ‘Virtual Engine Friction Strip Test’ using modern simulation tools is exigent. This thesis project, {{in association with the}} Tribology and Mechanics research group, at the Advanced Technology and Research department at Volvo Group Trucks Technology aims at developing a full engine strip down test simulation model. Owing to the large number of active components on an engine contributing to the overall friction losses, the scope of this study is restricted to the major friction contributors in the cranktrain – piston rings, skirts, journal bearings on the connecting rods and the main crankshaft journal bearings. A one-dimensional analytical model was prepared using the Gamma Technologies’ GT-Suite simulation tool. The dynamics of the crankshaft and the piston cylinder unit are modeled. The hydrodynamics of the lubrication films for the bearings, rings and skirts are solved quasi-statically, and mixed lubrication and asperity contact lubrication are also modeled. Combined with an oil thermal model, a shear thinning model, and accurate measurement data, a detailed insight of the engine friction can be obtained. The model was validated against various other simulation approaches and against strip tests of the Volvo MD 13 Euro 4 DST Engine. The same test conditions of the strip tests are reproduced on the simulation model, and the results are compared. In order to establish the model fidelity and robust solution methodology, it is also used to perform various studies on friction reduction techniques. This Virtual Engine Strip Test simulation model provides an opportunity to analyze new friction reduction methods and unconventional engine designs, towards the development of a low friction engine...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the knowledge and the characterization of micro Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). It is based on experimental data and simulation models. An oil-free scroll expander is tested {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions in order to better characterize its performance. Particular attention is paid to the tightness of the machine which is obtained using a magnetic coupling. The measured isentropic efficiency reaches 75 % which is higher than typical values reported in the literature. From the experimental results, a performance map of the expander is generated. This performance map can be used to provide fast and accurate calculation of the volumetric and isentropic performance of the expander {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions. Five displacement pumps adapted to μ-ORC systems are also tested. These pumps are diaphragm, <b>piston,</b> plunger and <b>gear</b> types. The measured values include the overall efficiency, the volumetric efficiency and the NPSH. A deep analysis of the performance is performed to quantify the losses of each pump, of their electric motor and of their frequency drive. This analysis shows that the weakness of the overall effectiveness (max. 46 %) of the pumps tested is mainly due to the low efficiency of the electric motor. A semi-empirical model of the diaphragm pump is proposed and validated based on manufacturer data. This model can predict the mechanical power of the pump and the flow delivered with a good accuracy. The simulation models developed for the expander and the pump are used to simulate a configuration including the pump, the generator and the expander on a single shaft. This configuration aims to avoid the use of a motor and a frequency drive whose performance is poor in the range of power consumed by the pump of a μ-ORC system. The results show a significant increase in the net power produced using the integrated configuration Finally, performance of a prototype of μ-ORC suitable for recovering heat from a two-stage screw compressor are measured and analyzed. The prototype allows generating maximum 3. 9 % of the electrical power consumed by the compressor. Several optimization options of the prototype are evaluated numerically, showing that the power generation could be increased up to 5. 4 % of the compressor consumption. These options include using the integrated configuration and optimizing the intercooler boiler design...|$|R
