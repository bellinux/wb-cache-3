40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} legal {{protection}} {{of victims of}} human trafficking in Sweden. Human trafficking involves the exploitation of often already vulnerable individuals and {{is a violation of}} their human rights. Human trafficking is also a threat to state security as a component of transnational organized crime and illegal migration, and has therefore long been a subject of international cooperation.      In this thesis international responses to human trafficking are categorized as being focused on two distinct and separately protected parties, namely the individual and the state. The implementation of these international responses have, in the case of Sweden, mainly led to new criminal regulation relating to human trafficking, and in this thesis international as well as Swedish legal measures against human trafficking are analyzed from a victimological perspective. The overall aim is to investigate and analyze whether victims of trafficking have received an enhanced legal protection through Swedish criminal law.      The thesis shows that human trafficking is not considered a problem in the Swedish legislative context, and that the international measures to protect victims of trafficking have not been regarded to any great extent. Few victims of trafficking in Sweden are even identified as victims, and measures against human trafficking have largely been associated with measures against prostitution. To legally connect human trafficking with prostitution is, however, problematic because these crimes have different primary <b>protective</b> <b>interests</b> and the victims have different roles in the investigation and litigation process. From a victim's perspective, the categorization of the crime is crucial because the status of plaintiff, as is required for the possibility for financial redress and other legal rights, is assessed in Sweden by how the offense is classified. It is therefore important for the victims of human trafficking to be identified and categorized correctly in order to be defined as plaintiffs and obtain protection under criminal law. As a result of all these factors, the intended enhanced legal protection for victims of trafficking in Sweden is lost...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I infuse {{political}} and legal theory with peer-to-peer decentralized design features. This experiment studies how property and liability, two core legal institutions attached to individual persons, react and can be transformed (like chemical elements) when applied a peer-to-peer, distributed design, with an empirical and evolutionary approach of hacking the law, seen as a regulatory system. In this jurisprudential analysis unfolding the theory of distributed architecture, I study the effect of applying peer-to-peer to the liberal legal institutions of property, liability and democratic political participation. In that sense, beyond using technology {{as a tool of}} the law, I propose to use technology as a tool for exploring and modeling the law. Peer to peer fragmentation is particularly disruptive for the law because the legal reasoning is used accustomed to operate on subjects which are characterized by and uniquely attached to some spatio-temporal existence. This ontological difference between the nature of distributed technology and positivist legal thinking is also reflected in the gap between the law, traditionally much more <b>protective</b> of the <b>interests</b> of capital with its identified owners, than of the commons, with a crowd of distributed peers...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{considers}} the constitutional validity of executive privilege claims {{made by the}} President against statutorily authorized information requests. The Article concludes that such claims are constitutionally illegitimate and that courts, when turned to, should order compliance with statutorily authorized demands for information {{in the face of}} executive privilege claims. This conclusion is reached in two steps. First, perusal of Article I 2 ̆ 7 s list of legislative powers and Article II 2 ̆ 7 s list of presidential powers does not clearly resolve the issue. Rather, such perusal alone offers fair ground to deem control of executive branch information both within Congress 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 sweeping clause 2 ̆ 2 power and within the President 2 ̆ 7 s execution power. Second, a broader analysis of constitutional text, structure and history demonstrates that information control has special constitutional significance. Specifically, such analysis suggests that secrecy within the political branches must, to be legitimate, remain a politically controllable tool of the people. To keep such secrecy within the ultimate control of the people, mechanisms must exist to keep the secrecy 2 ̆ 2 shallow 2 ̆ 2 and politically checkable. In other words, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the very fact of such secrecy is subject to public debate, reconsideration and reprisal. This is particularly crucial with respect to executive branch activities, given that branch 2 ̆ 7 s special capacity for secrecy. The natural mechanisms to keep government secrecy shallow and politically checkable are statutory authorizations to Congress, to the public and to agencies to demand information. Furthermore, the statutory process itself is sufficiently <b>protective</b> of any <b>interests</b> in secrecy...|$|R
40|$|We {{test the}} 'law matters' and 'legal origin' claims using a newly created panel dataset meas-uring legal {{change over time}} {{in a sample of}} {{developed}} and developing countries. Our dataset improves on previous ones by avoiding country-specific variables in favour of functional and generic descriptors, by taking into account a wider range of legal data, and by considering the effects of weighting variables in different ways, thereby ensuring greater consistency of cod-ing. Our analysis shows that legal origin explains part of the pattern of change in the adop-tion of shareholder protection measures over the period from the mid- 1990 s to the present day: in both developed and developing countries, common law systems were more <b>protective</b> of shareholder <b>interests</b> than civil law ones. We explain this the result {{on the basis of the}} head start common law systems had in adjusting to an emerging 'global' standard based mainly on Anglo-American practice. Our analysis also shows, however, that civil law origin was not much of an obstacle to convergence around this model, since civilian systems were catching up with their counterparts in the common law. We then investigate whether there was a link in this period between increased shareholder protection and stock market devel-opment, using a number of measures such as stock market capitalisation, the value of stock-trading and the number of listed firms, after controlling for legal origin, the state of economic development of particular countries, and their position on the World Bank rule of law index. We find no evidence of a long-run impact of legal change on stock market development. This finding is incompatible with the claim that legal origin affects the efficiency of legal rules and ultimately economic development. Possible explanations for our result are that laws have been overly protective of shareholders; transplanted laws have not worked as ex-pected; and, more generally, the exogenous legal origin effect is not as strong as widely sup-posed.

40|$|Abstract Background The TPH 2 gene encodes {{the enzyme}} {{responsible}} for serotonin (5 -HT) synthesis in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Stereotypic and repetitive behaviors {{are influenced by}} 5 -HT, and initial studies report an association of TPH 2 alleles with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and with autism. GLO 1 encodes glyoxalase I, the enzyme which detoxifies α-oxoaldehydes such as methylglyoxal in all living cells. The A 111 E GLO 1 protein variant, encoded by SNP C 419 A, was identifed in autopsied autistic brains and proposed {{to act as an}} autism susceptibility factor. Hyperserotoninemia, macrocephaly, and peptiduria represent some of the best-characterized endophenotypes in autism research. Methods Family-based and case-control association studies were performed on clinical samples drawn from 312 simplex and 29 multiplex families including 371 non-syndromic autistic patients and 156 unaffected siblings, as well as on 171 controls. TPH 2 SNPs rs 4570625 and rs 4565946 were genotyped using the TaqMan assay; GLO 1 SNP C 419 A was genotyped by PCR and allele-specific restriction digest. Family-based association analyses were performed by TDT and FBAT, case-control by χ 2, endophenotypic analyses for 5 -HT blood levels, cranial circumference and urinary peptide excretion rates by ANOVA and FBAT. Results TPH 2 alleles and haplotypes are not significantly associated in our sample with autism (rs 4570625 : TDT P = 0. 27, and FBAT P = 0. 35; rs 4565946 : TDT P = 0. 45, and FBAT P = 0. 55; haplotype P = 0. 84), with any endophenotype, or with the presence/absence of prominent repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (motor stereotypies: P = 0. 81 and 0. 84, verbal stereotypies: P = 0. 38 and 0. 73 for rs 4570625 and rs 4565946, respectively). Also GLO 1 alleles display no association with autism (191 patients vs 171 controls, P = 0. 36; TDT P = 0. 79, and FBAT P = 0. 37), but unaffected siblings seemingly carry a protective gene variant marked by the A 419 allele (TDT P Conclusion TPH 2 gene variants are unlikely to contribute to autism or to the presence/absence of prominent repetitive behaviors in our sample, although an influence on the intensity of these behaviors in autism cannot be excluded.

An {{estimated}} 181 million individuals (33.2 percent of the population) live in poverty and seventy-one million of these (12.9 percent) in indigence. Between 2002 and 2008, forty-one million people were able to sustain enough progress to no longer be characterized as poverty but with the current Global recession, this number has decreased by nine million. Ten of the 15 countries with {{the highest levels of}} inequality are in the region. Women, indigenous populations and those of African descent are most affected. Females in the region take a greater part in the informal economy and have double the workload than males but are paid less for their efforts. When compared to those of European descent, twice as many members of indigenous and African descended populations, on average, live on US$1 per day. Latin America still faces corrupt political, judicial, and security institutions <b>protective</b> of the <b>interests</b> of the wealthy. The second edition of the Global Burden of Armed Violence report by the Secretariat of the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development, released in October 2011, characterized El Salvador as being the “most violent country in the world” during 2004-9, with an average annual violent death rate of over 60 per 100,000 people during that period, just ahead of Iraq. During the first week of November (2011), Manuel Melgar (the justice and public security minister of El Salvador) resigned from his post. The region overall is second to South Africa in terms of levels of crime and violence. Educational practices are also being questioned across the region. Chile has been experiencing five months of protests against the government‘s attempt to maintain the higher education’s private sector model. Students and teachers in opposition hope to revert to a state funded model, under an “Education for All” slogan in fear of emerging from universities with debts and loans. These street demonstrations, now catching congress’ attention, are a threat to Chiles’ 2012 budget. Without the proposed spending, potential education, health, training and anti-poverty programs will cease. [...] In Latin America, risks of inflation and excessive currency appreciation are a concern to the region’s long-term growth prospects and present instability in the financial sector. Current events such as the European debt crisis, the slow recovery in the US, natural and nuclear disasters in Japan and the implications from the political turmoil in the Middle East stall progress within the region and foreshadow more difficult economic conditions.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that activating mutations of genes encoding the Notch family of transmembrane receptors, specifically Notch 1, {{are associated with}} oncogenic transformation. Previous data from our lab has shown that an active form of Notch 1 (Nic) provides a protective effect against apoptosis in D 011. 10 T cells, and that this effect {{may be attributed to}} Nic binding the pro-apoptotic protein Nur 77. Nur 77 is an immediate early gene that is upregulated during negative selection of thymocytes and activation-induced apoptosis in D 011. 10 T cells. Nur 77 upregulation is tightly regulated and requires MEF 2 D, NFAT, and the co-activator, p 300, to effectively respond to apoptotic stimuli. In this report we show that Nic has the ability to interfere with the induction of transcription of Nur 77, and that this interference {{is directly related to the}} inability of p 300 to bind the Nur 77 promoter in the presence of Nic. We also show that blocking Notch activation through gamma secretase-inhibitors or siRNA directed against Notch 1 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines restores Nur 77 upregulation in response stimuli. These observations support a model in which during thymocytes negative selection activating mutations of Notch 1 inhibit the upregulation of a crucial proapoptotic molecule. ^ Studies to determine the mechanism by which Nur 77 induces apoptosis have indentified a unique translocation of Nur 77 from the nucleus to the cytosol. It has been determined that once in the cytosol Nur 77 interacts with members of the Bcl- 2 family of proteins at the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction induces a conformational change of Bcl- 2 so that is becomes pro-apoptotic instead of <b>protective.</b> Of similar <b>interest</b> is the role that Nur 77 itself plays during the induction of activation-induced apoptosis which may be independent of Bcl- 2 conformational change. In an effort to describe possible functions of Nur 77, DO 11. 10 cells that have Nur 77 under a tet-inducible promoter were observed for changes IP 3 R. Initial results from our lab suggest that Nur 77 alone has the ability to induce cell death in DO 11. 10 cells using this tet-inducible system. Interestingly we have been able to identify distinct changes in IP 3 R isoforms during stimulation induced apoptosis and Nur 77 -dependent apoptosis. Current experiments are focused on a mechanism beyond the known function of the Nur 77 /Bcl- 2 interaction; that Nur 77 may also be acting as a physical barrier between the known anti-apoptotic interaction of IP 3 R and Bcl- 2, leading to sustained calcium flux. ...|$|R
