50|$|Flight {{feathers}} comprising <b>primary</b> remiges, <b>secondary</b> remiges, <b>and</b> tail retrices {{are preserved}} on the London specimen, though no contour feathers are documented.

The <b>primaries</b> <b>and</b> distal <b>secondaries</b> appear the same length, approximately 130 mm long. De Beer's original count of six <b>primaries</b> <b>and</b> ten <b>secondaries</b> is {{considerably less than}} the number documented in the later Berlin specimen. He also observed covert feathers above {{the base of the}} primaries, which show fine details of the barbs.
