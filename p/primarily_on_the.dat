5|$|At Essex County Road11, Highway3 enters rural southwestern Ontario, and is {{dominated}} by farmland for much of its length through Essex County. The now four-laned route becomes divided as it follows the Essex Bypass around {{the southern edge of}} Essex, with commercial services lining the highway, <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side. Returning to farmland and narrowing to a two lane undivided road, the highway continues southeast, passing nearby, but avoiding, several small communities that the original highway travelled through.|$|E

5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{upper parts}} of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} highly positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humour, cinematic feel, and graphics. The game's music was also lauded.

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fruits of forest trees, most notably those {{belonging}} to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E

5|$|This type Ia {{category}} of supernovae produces consistent peak luminosity {{because of the}} uniform mass of white dwarfs that explode via the accretion mechanism.

5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the marshy Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the steep slope up to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south and east sides of the burgh.|$|E
