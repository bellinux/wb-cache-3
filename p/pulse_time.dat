40|$|Abstract — Wire {{electro-discharge}} machining (WEDM) is a fully extended and competitive machining process widely used for hard {{and difficult to}} machine materials. In the present research, experimental investigation have been conducted {{to find out the}} wire wear rate at different machining parameter Such as peak current, <b>pulse</b> on <b>time,</b> <b>pulse</b> off <b>time,</b> based on full factorial design of experiment. Molybdenum wire of 0. 18 mm and EN- 8 material were used as tool and work piece material for the experiment, ANOVA analysis were done to find out the effect of peak current, <b>pulse</b> on <b>time,</b> <b>pulse</b> off <b>time</b> on wire wear and found that the increasing in peak current slowly increase the wire wear but increasing in <b>pulse</b> on <b>time</b> increase the wire wear rapidly and <b>pulse</b> off <b>time</b> not much affects the wire wear.

50|$|Since a THz pulse can be {{intense and}} short, e.g., single-cycle, it is {{experimentally}} possible to realize situations where {{duration of the}} <b>pulse,</b> <b>time</b> scale related to Rabi- {{as well as the}} THz photon energy ħω are degenerate. In this situation, one enters the realm of extreme nonlinear optics where the usual approximations, such as the rotating-wave approximation (abbreviated as RWA) or the conditions for complete state transfer, break down. As a result, the Rabi oscillations become strongly distorted by the non-RWA contributions, the multiphoton absorption or emission processes, and the dynamic Franz-Keldysh effect, as measured in Refs.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid the}} use of a {{separate}} delay line store for every line termination it was convenient to use, in each group of 800 lines, three sets of five stores coded to correspond with the ZXY designation of the line. As the drum rotated it generated waveforms corresponding to the ZXY code of the line whose information was available at that time. These waveforms indicated the appropriate delay lines and if a call was to be set up a selected pulse was injected into the selected delay lines which caused them to open the line gates repeatedly at the selected <b>pulse</b> <b>time,</b> the pulse continuing to circulate until the connection was cleared.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} for {{this technique is}} relatively similar to performing a standard gel electrophoresis except that instead of constantly running the voltage in one direction, the voltage is periodically switched among three directions; one {{that runs through the}} central axis of the gel and two that run at an angle of 60 degrees either side. The pulse times are equal for each direction resulting in a net forward migration of the DNA. For extremely large molecules (up to around 2 Mb), switching-interval ramps can be used that increases the <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> for each direction {{over the course of a}} number of hours—take, for instance, increasing the pulse linearly from 10 seconds at 0 hours to 60 seconds at 18 hours.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pulse</b> transit <b>time</b> (PTT) is {{the time}} taken for the {{arterial}} pulse pressure wave to travel from the aortic valve to a peripheral site. For convenience, it is usually measured from the R wave on the electrocardiogram to the pulse wave arrival at the finger. <b>Pulse</b> transit <b>time</b> is inversely proportional to blood pressure, and the falls in blood pressure which occur with inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) correspond to rises (lengthening) in <b>pulse</b> transit <b>time.</b> In awake normal subjects, the size of these inspiratory rises in <b>pulse</b> transit <b>time</b> correlate well with the degree of inspiratory effort.

50|$|The typical lasers used {{as light}} sources are pulsed, which provide a higher peak power than the continuous-wave lasers. Also the short <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> {{is useful for}} good {{temporal}} resolution. Some of the widely used laser sources are Nd:YAG laser, dye lasers, excimer lasers, and ion lasers. The light from the laser (usually a beam) is passed {{through a set of}} lenses and/or mirrors to form a sheet, which is then used to illuminate the medium. This medium is either made up of fluorescent material or can be seeded with a fluorescent substance. The signal is usually captured by a CCD or CMOS camera (sometimes intensified cameras are also used). Timing electronics is often used to synchronize pulsed light sources with intensified cameras.|$|E
50|$|The inertia of a {{collapsing}} bubble generates high {{pressures and}} temperatures capable of ionizing {{a small fraction}} of the noble gas within the volume of the bubble. This small fraction of ionized gas is transparent and allows for volume emission to be detected. Free electrons from the ionized noble gas begin to interact with other neutral atoms causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. Surface emission emits a more intense flash of light with a longer duration and is dependent on wavelength. Experimental data suggest that only volume emission occurs in the case of sonoluminescence. As the sound wave reaches a low energy trough the bubble expands and electrons are able to recombine with free ions and halt light emission. Light <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> is dependent on the ionization energy of the noble gas with argon having a light pulse of 160 picoseconds.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of pulse-based UWB SAR {{is that the}} transmitting and receiving front-end electronics are difficult to design for high-power applications. Specifically, the transmit duty cycle is so exceptionally low and <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> so exceptionally short, that the electronics must be capable of extremely high instantaneous power to rival the average power of conventional radars. (Although {{it is true that}} UWB provides a notable gain in channel capacity over a narrow band signal because of the relationship of bandwidth in the Shannon-Hartley theorem and because the low receive duty cycle receives less noise, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, there is still a notable disparity in link budget because conventional radar might be several orders of magnitude more powerful than a typical pulse-based radar.) So pulse-based UWB SAR is typically used in applications requiring average power levels in the microwatt or milliwatt range, and thus is used for scanning smaller, nearer target areas (several tens of meters), or in cases where lengthy integration (over a span of minutes) of the received signal is possible. Note, however, that this limitation is solved in chirped UWB radar systems.|$|E

5000|$|When AuNP {{are exposed}} to NIR light, the {{oscillating}} electromagnetic field of the light causes the free electrons of the AuNP to collectively coherently oscillate. Changing {{the size and shape}} of AuNP, changes the wavelength that gets absorbed. A desired wavelength would be between 700-1000 nm because biological tissue is optically transparent at these wavelengths. While all AuNP properties are sensitive to change in their shape and size, Au nanorods properties are extremely sensitive to any change in any of their dimensions regarding their length and wide or their aspect ratio. When light is shown on a metal NP, the NP forms a dipole oscillation along the direction of the electric field. When the oscillation reaches its maximum, this frequency is called the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). AuNR have two SPR spectrum bands: one in the NIR region caused by its longitudinal oscillation which tends to be stronger with a longer wavelength and one in the visible region caused by the transverse electronic oscillation which tends to be weaker with a shorter wavelength. The SPR characteristics account for the increase in light absorption for the particle. As the AuNR aspect ratio increases, the absorption wavelength is redshifted and light scattering efficiency is increased. [...] The electrons excited by the NIR lose energy quickly after absorption via electron-electron collisions, and as these electrons relax back down, the energy is released as a phonon that then heats the environment of the AuNP which in cancer treatments would be the cancerous cells. This process is observed when a laser has a continuous wave onto the AuNP. Pulsed laser light beams generally results in the AuNP melting or ablation of the particle. Continues wave lasers take minutes rather than a single <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> for a pulsed laser, continues wave lasers are able to heat larger areas at once.|$|E
