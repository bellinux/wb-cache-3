5|$|The hybrid <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticized, {{with one}} of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

In addition to its players, Tech's football <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noted for its coaches and its, in many cases bizarre traditions and game finishes. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the highest-scoring game in American football history, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak (8 games) against the University of Georgia, Tech's most time-endured rival.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{called the}} {{greatest}} technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated {{many areas of}} technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, {{the driving force behind}} early research into integrated circuits (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.|$|E
