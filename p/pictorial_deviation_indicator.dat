In this paper, we propose a deviation measurement for coordinated exchange rate policies in East Asia to enhance the {{monetary authorities}}' surveillance process for their regional monetary cooperation. We estimate an AMU (Asian Monetary Unit) as a weighted average of East Asian currencies according to the method to calculate the ECU used under the EMS before introducing the euro into some EU countries. We consider four types of AMU, {{which are based on}} trade volume, nominal GDP, GDP measured at PPP, and international reserves. After choosing both the AMUs based on GDP measured at PPP weight and trade weight from a viewpoint of stability of the AMU value in terms of a currency basket composed of the US dollar and the euro, we calculate the <b>deviation</b> <b>indicators</b> from the benchmark rates for each of the East Asian currencies. We compare both nominal and real <b>deviation</b> <b>indicators</b> by taking into account inflation rate differentials. The real <b>deviation</b> <b>indicator</b> should be adequate for surveillance over effects of exchange rate policy on real economy while the nominal one can be frequently watched in real time. ...|$|R

Hence, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Three Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to detect possibilities of economic crises and to prompt the restructuring or reforming of a rigid structure or system. Although monitoring the exchange rates of the currencies of these countries vis-à-vis the U.

For this, current paper proposes a deviation measurement for coordinated exchange rate policies in Central Asian countries to enhance the regional monetary cooperation. Central Asian Currency Unit - CACU is calculated as a weighted average of Central Asian currencies against USD following the method {{used to calculate the}} European Currency Unit (ECU) and the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU) introduced by Ogawa and Shimizu (2005) for East Asian countries; and indicator that displays the degree of deviation of Central Asian currencies against CACU at the benchmark rate. Three types of CACU are considered in the paper based on nominal GDP, GDP measured at PPP and trade volume, while <b>deviation</b> <b>indicator</b> is grounded on arithmetic average of GDP at PPP and trade volume shares. Findings indicate that Central Asian currencies significantly deviate in terms of other Central Asian currencies. Furthermore, nominal and real <b>deviation</b> <b>indicators</b> signal that the trends vary in both the scales and directions.

Contribution of each currency to weighted average of AMU-wide <b>Deviation</b> <b>Indicators</b> shows that movements in the Japanese yen have contributed {{to those in the}} weighted average of the AMU-wide <b>Deviation</b> <b>Indicators</b> over time during the sample period from January 2000 to January 2010. Moreover, we use concepts of β and σ convergences in the context of economic growth to analyze statistically convergence or divergence for the ASEAN+ 3 + 3 currencies. The addition of Indian rupee into the ASEAN+ 3 currencies make the regional currencies unstable before and during the global financial crisis. Moreover, comparison between ASEAN+ 3 + 3 and ASEAN+ 3 +Indian currencies shows that the addition of only Indian rupee into them is relatively more stable than the addition of the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar as well as the Indian rupee since September 2008.
