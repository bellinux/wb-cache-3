As can be seen, {{there was a huge}} reduction in the particle sizes measured by TEM, as compared to when {{the materials}} were measured using the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>analyser</b> (Figure  6). It was noted though that one of the drawbacks of using the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>analyser</b> was that it did not allow particles to be individually measured. This explains the reduction in size when the data (Figure  6) was compared to the TEM analyses, as particles were individually measured. In the latter case, the average size was found to be 57 and 28 nm for as-received fly ash and CNFs from acetylene-treated coal fly ash, respectively. To confirm these findings, BET was used to study their surface areas (Figure  7). The results showed that the CNFs produced at 500 °C displayed the highest surface area (59 m 2 /g). Studies have shown that the lower the particle size, the higher the surface area [12].|$|E

A number of varying shaped ‘particles’, in the form of static test images, are observed with the imaging system and the effect of varying shape size on the resulting measurements is investigated.

40|$|Abstract The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the important parameters for characterisation of quality of metal powders. Specific material properties such as ability to flow, reactivity as well as compressibility and its hardening potentials – hence the most important characteristics of sintered metals- are determined by the size distribution. The correct <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution is}} the key to best product quality in atomisation processes of aluminium, milling of pure metals and other processes. This paper presents the modular laser diffraction <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>analysers</b> HELOS & RODOS for laboratory applications and the MYTOS & TWISTER laser diffraction systems for in- and on-line process installations, which provide real-time information about metal powder quality directly from the production process, including representative sampling in the process pipe for diameters from 50 mm to 800 mm. The most recent development to characterise simultaneously the size and the shape distribution of metal powders is QICPIC. Dynamic high speed image analysis with up to 500 pictures/second allowing for the analysis of millions of particles in only seconds, in combination with effective dry powder dispersers (RODOS, GRADIS) is the key to unique precision and quality overcoming the limitations of conventional imaging systems. The unrivalled, patented dry powder disperser RODOS is the guarantee for complete dispersion of the dry products to be analysed down to the nanometric range of 0. 1 microns.

To avoid settling of <b>particles,</b> smaller <b>sized</b> (3 - 10 micrometers) particles are preferred, while larger <b>sized</b> <b>particles</b> {{can be used in}} MR brakes, MR clutches, etc. as mechanical stirring action in those mechanisms does not allow particles to settle down.

For smoother and more cohesive BSA particles with DS of 2. 06 the measured and calculated values differed by 27 % (compared to the value measured by PSDA 3603) and 115 % (compare to the value measured by Aerosizer). This variation resulted from the difficulty to completely disperse the more cohesive particles during measurement.

40|$|Gunshot residue (GSR) mixture {{consists}} of partially burned particles of propellant and characteristic particles of elements originating from the primer, bullet, propellant and some additives in the propellant. Since Harrison and Gillory [1] drew forensic scientists’ {{attention to the}} fact that GSR contained trace amounts of inorganic compounds such as lead, barium and antimony, a number of analytical techniques have been tested trying to find and establish sensitive, selective and reliable methods to identify and analyse gunshot residues. The standard procedure for the analysis of gunshot residues involves imaging these small metallic particles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and subsequent compositional analysis using Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX). This study focuses on the analysis organic compounds in GSR. It is motivated by the increasing need to overcome the problems with the analysis of lead-free ammunitions. A comprehensive literature review was performed in order to determine the most commonly encountered organic compounds in GSR. These compounds include diphenylamine, methylcentralite, ethylcentralite, nitroglycerine, 2 -nitrodiphenylamine and 4 -nitrodiphenylamine. It has been clearly demonstrated using standard materials and appropriate calibration curves that gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is capable of providing limits of detection that are consistent with the concentrations of the key organic constituents found in gunshot residues. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the relative concentrations of seven key components can be used to provide branding information on the shotgun cartridges. A strong relationship was found between the chemical composition of fired and unfired powder. Therefore, it is possible to differentiate between two ammunition brands through the analysis of the organic constituents. Traditional fingerprint powders such as titanium dioxide, aluminium, carbon black, iron oxide, lycopodium spores and rosin are used to enhance fingerprint left at the scene of crime. More recently nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be highly effective for the enhancement of the fingerprints [2]. Silica nano-particulates of defined size and shape were synthesised and functionalised with two different functional groups (phenyl and long chain hydrocarbon) using a Tri- phasic Reverse Emulsion (TPRE) method. These nano-particulates were characterised using scan electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, <b>particles</b> <b>size</b> <b>analyser,</b> BET surface area and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These powders were used as an effective agent to visualise latent fingerprints on different surfaces. Furthermore, they have been utilised to absorb any organic materials within the fingerprint from the discharged of weapon. Analyses of the adsorbed organic residues were performed using GC/MS and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that the synthesised silica nano-particulate fingerprint powder gave better result in term of their ability to absorb organic materials in GSR and enhance the visualisation of the latent fingerprint compared to a single commercial powder...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automated pre-production <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution <b>analyser</b> for <b>particles</b> in the 20 - 2000 #mu#m size range. This work is follow up to the vibro-spring particle sizer reported by Shaeri. In its most basic form, the instrument comprises a horizontally held closed coil helical spring that is partly filled with the test powder and sinusoidally vibrated in the transverse direction. <b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution data are obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring {{the mass of the}} powder discharged from the spring's coils. The <b>size</b> of the <b>particles</b> on the other hand is determined from the spring 'intercoil' distance. The instrument developed by Shaeri had limited use due to its inability to measure sample mass directly. For the device reported here, modifications are made to the original configurations to establish means of direct sample mass measurement. The feasibility of techniques for measuring the mass of powder retained within the spring are investigated in detail. Initially, the measurement of mass is executed in-situ from the vibration characteristics based on the spring's first harmonic resonant frequency. This method is often erratic and unreliable due to the particle-particle-spring wall interactions and the spring bending. An much more successful alternative is found from a more complicated arrangement in which the spring forms part of a stiff cantilever system pivoted along its main axis. Here, the sample mass is determined in the 'static mode' by monitoring the cantilever beam's deflection following the wanton termination of vibration. The system performance has been optimised through the variations of the mechanical design of the key components and the operating procedure as well as taking into account the effect of changes in the ambient temperature on the system's response. The thesis also {{describes the}} design and development of the ancillary mechanisms. These include the pneumatic feeding of the test powder into the spring, the non-interfering spring extension mechanism and means for measuring the cantilever deflection and hence the sample mass via a non-contact transducer. For an automated operation, a control software is developed which car allow an unattended analysis whilst providing <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution in real-time. Data are reported in conjunction with a variety of powders with different size, density and shape. Typical resolutions in terms of size and mass measurement are better than #+-# 10 #mu#m and #+-# 0. 1 g respectively.
