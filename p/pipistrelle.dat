5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western <b>pipistrelle</b> bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
5|$|Common mammals {{found here}} include the red fox, red squirrel, hare and rabbit, mole, wood mouse, bank vole and field vole. Two species of bats {{frequent}} the site regularly to hunt: the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and common <b>pipistrelle</b> (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). They cannot, however, establish their habitat {{due to the}} lack of roosting sites in the reserve's young trees.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common <b>pipistrelle,</b> soprano <b>pipistrelle,</b> Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

50|$|This {{section is}} also a {{practical}} introduction to the recognition of bat species, using <b>Pipistrelles</b> as an example. More detailed and technical information is given below.|$|R
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi {{is known}} from four places on Madagascar, all below 80m (260ft) altitude, of which two {{are on the}} west and two {{on the east side}} of the island. Among the eastern {{collection}} sites, Kianjavato is a rural town surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where P.raceyi were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a mistnet over a river, and Tampolo is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, Kirindy and Mikea, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the <b>pipistrelle</b> Hypsugo anchietae has also been recorded. The true distribution of P.raceyi is probably larger than that currently known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western <b>pipistrelle,</b> that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male <b>pipistrelle,</b> noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
50|$|Bats favor larger hibernacula {{where large}} groups may roost together, {{including}} natural caves, mines, cellars, {{and other kinds}} of underground sites and man-made structures, like ice-houses. Within these hibernacula, the bats are still highly tuned to environmental factors. Little brown bats in northern latitudes hibernate for up to 8 months during the winter, and leave their roosts in the warm spring weather when insect prey is plentiful again. Bats gauge the outside temperature by being attuned to the airflow at the hibernacula entrance, which is driven by temperature differences between inside and outside the hibernacula, allowing bats to leave when the temperature begins to warm. Some hibernacula are shared between multiple species, such as common <b>pipistrelles</b> roosting with soprano <b>pipistrelles.</b> Behavior other than hibernating can also occur at hibernacula; common <b>pipistrelles</b> produce most of their mating calls and mate with each other in and near their hibernacula.|$|R
50|$|Vesper or evening bats {{comprise}} the largest family of bats {{with at least}} 45 species in China. Members include mouse-eared bats, long-eared bats, <b>pipistrelles,</b> noctules and barbastelles.|$|R
50|$|This {{in effect}} gives {{the best of}} both worlds, {{enabling}} precise distance and speed measurement. Some species alternate calls with and without a CF component, and <b>Pipistrelles</b> usually use an FM only call at short ranges.|$|R
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's <b>pipistrelle.</b> 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} <b>pipistrelle.</b> It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
25|$|Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), gray bat (Myotis grisescens), {{little brown}} bat (Myotis lucifugus), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), {{and the eastern}} <b>pipistrelle</b> bat (Pipistrellus subflavus).|$|E
50|$|This is {{a typical}} call from a Myotis species. It sounds like hard dry clicks. It was {{recorded}} at 40 kHz which was not critical, but this was chosen because it was above the crickets and below <b>Pipistrelles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bat {{call from}} a bat {{approaching}} or departing at 6.8 m/s calling at 50 kHz will typically show a doppler shift of +- 1 kHz and pro rats. This can cause uncertainty with some species such as <b>Pipistrelles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{species such}} as the <b>Pipistrelles</b> start their call with an FM {{component}} but {{the rate of change}} of frequency slows to an almost CF end part. On a spectrogram, his appears as a [...] "hockey stick" [...] shape.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, {{as part of}} the National Bat Monitoring Programme, BCT {{began the}} first {{systematic}} UK-wide survey of Nathusius’ pipistrelles in order to improve knowledge of the distribution of this species. Nathusius’ <b>pipistrelle</b> is considered to be rare in the UK but is widespread and may be under-recorded in some areas. As this species is often found at large water bodies, particularly during the autumn migration period, the survey involves surveying lakes twice during September, and making audio recordings from broadband bat detectors in order to verify Nathusius’ <b>pipistrelle</b> calls through sonogram analysis.|$|E
25|$|Of the bat species {{using the}} wood, there are records of common and soprano <b>pipistrelle,</b> noctule, Leisler and brown long-eared bats (the only site in Southwark where {{these have been}} recorded).|$|E
25|$|Two {{species of}} native rats, the Maclear's and bulldog rats, have become extinct since {{the island was}} settled, while the Javan rusa has been introduced. The endemic Christmas Island shrew {{has not been seen}} since the mid-1980s and may be already extinct, while the Christmas Island <b>pipistrelle</b> (a small bat) is {{critically}} endangered and probably also extinct.|$|E
5000|$|Note the [...] "ploppy" [...] {{sound of}} the call and the [...] "feeding buzzes" [...] as it homed in on insects. The Soprano <b>Pipistrelle's</b> call sounds very similar, but at a higher {{frequency}} setting on the heterodyne bat detector.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not well}} {{understood}} why most, but not all, cases of cryptic bat rabies {{can be traced to}} Silver-haired bats and Eastern <b>pipistrelles,</b> but it is believed that the strain of rabies virus in these species is particularly virulent.|$|R
30|$|Nyctalus noctula was {{the most}} {{frequently}} recorded bat species, making up about 35 % of all recordings and occurring in about 85 % of recording occasions (Additional file 6), while the three <b>pipistrelles</b> P. nathusii, P. pygmaeus, and P. pipistrellus were less often recorded (16, 11, and 6 %, respectively). Although the three <b>pipistrelles</b> were less active than N. noctula, they occurred in about 55 to 80 % of recording occasions (Additional file 6). With about 3 and 0.7 %, respectively, M. bra/dau and M. nattereri were the least often recorded species (Additional file 6). Since GLMMs for these bat species did not converge or fitted badly, {{they had to be}} excluded from further analyses.|$|R
25|$|The {{river and}} its banks, support, amongst others, Kingfishers, tawny and barn owls, herons, moorhean, coot, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers, <b>pipistrelle</b> bats and otters. Migrating Canada and Graylag Geese {{frequent}} the nearby fields {{on their way}} up from the Solway Firth / Caerlaverock area or coming down from Spitzbergen in the winter.|$|E
25|$|BCT runs NBMP surveys {{aimed at}} beginners {{as well as}} experts, and their current surveys include the Sunset/Sunrise survey, Field Survey, Waterway Survey, Roost Count, Hibernation Survey, Woodland Survey and Nathusius’ <b>Pipistrelle</b> Survey. The results from these surveys are {{compiled}} into an annual report, available to view on the BCT website. Currently, statistically robust trends are produced for 11 of the UK’s 17 breeding species.|$|E
25|$|The {{heathland}} is {{a significant}} local habitat for the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) dominate the mats in the grassland in spring-time. The common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common toad (Bufo bufo) and common frog (Rana temporaria) all inhabit the ponds, and the high insect numbers associated with the water attract bats, such as the common <b>pipistrelle</b> (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus).|$|E
5000|$|Banana <b>pipistrelles</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} much of Africa south of the Sahara, except for the Namib and Kalahari deserts. They are found in both lowland and montane rainforests, open savannah, and other wooded areas such as plantations. Six subspecies are currently recognised: ...|$|R
50|$|Banana <b>pipistrelles</b> are insectivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on beetles and small moths. They fly {{close to the}} ground, typically between 2 and 5 m high and catch insects in mid-air. They emerge to feed {{less than an hour}} after sunset, and fly continuously through a relatively small area, rarely travelling more than 100 m from their roost. Echolocation in banana <b>pipistrelles</b> consists of steep, frequency modulated calls lasting four or five milliseconds, with a dominant frequency of about 43 kHz. Males also make longer calls with up to eight syllables when encountering other males; sometimes two individuals may engage in ultrasonic vocal 'duels' lasting up to twenty minutes and concluding with a chase through the air. When distressed, both sexes emit noisy 'squabble' calls of variable pitch.|$|R
50|$|House bats {{including}} the Gobi big brown bat, northern bat, thick-eared bat, serotine bat are also {{closely related to}} <b>pipistrelles,</b> noctules and barbastelles. Other relatives within this extensive subfamily include Tickell's bat, great evening bat, harlequin bat, greater Asiatic yellow bat, particoloured bat and Asian particolored bat.|$|R
25|$|Fauna of County Kilkenny {{includes}} hedgehogs, otters, badgers, foxes, and bats such as Leisler's bats, Daubenton's bat, {{the brown}} long-eared bat {{and the common}} <b>pipistrelle.</b> There is also sika deer, fallow deer, stoat, red squirrel and pygmy shrew. The bird nesting period is from 1 March until 1 September. Woodlands, trees and hedgerows form a network of habitats, ecological ‘corridors’ essential for wildlife to flourish and move between habitats.|$|E
25|$|Kingfishers {{have been}} seen just {{downstream}} and the estate's woodland policies and river contain, amongst others, tawny and barn owls, herons, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers, <b>pipistrelle</b> bats and probably otters. Migrating Canada and greylag geese frequent the nearby fields on their way up from the Caerlaverock or coming down from Spitzbergen in the winter. Duncan McNaught in 1895 records that he found a kingfisher's nest at an arms length inside an earthen burrow at Chapelton on the Annick.|$|E
25|$|Hares are {{a common}} site on the Kilmaurs road near the Townhead of Lambroughton old entrance, but rabbits are a rarity hereabouts. Foxes can be seen and heard in the woods by the Annick and {{migrating}} geese use the fields as a migration stop. Lapwings are an annual visitor as are the swallows and housemartins which nest in the buildings of East Lambroughton farm. Other animals present are the <b>pipistrelle</b> bats, moles, hedgehogs, toads, kestrels, treecreepers, ravens, wagtails, sparrows, blue-tits, great tits, pheasants, snipe, wrens, buzzards, chaffinches, blackbirds, greenfinches, rooks, etc. The rare hummingbird hawk-moth was seen near the Lambroughton Crossroads in 1985 and Duncan McNaught also recorded this species in 1912.|$|E
50|$|Hampstead Heath is an {{important}} refuge for wildlife, including grass snakes, foxes, rabbits, slowworms, squirrels and frogs. Common kingfishers, jackdaws, <b>pipistrelles</b> and Daubenton's bats are seen over the ponds. Some introduced species have also thrived at the site, for example muntjac deer, terrapins and ring-necked parakeets.|$|R
40|$|No {{coronavirus}} {{was detected}} by PCR in lung and intestine samples of 100 bats, mostly common <b>pipistrelles</b> (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), collected dead between 2008 and 2013 for rabies surveillance in Belgium. The negative results contrast with the high prevalence of coronaviruses detected in fecal pellets from live-captured bats in some European countries...|$|R
50|$|From Fresnerie (street and park) to the Vilaine, {{through the}} course of Vilaine, the walker can {{discover}} flying bats, <b>pipistrelles</b> and other birds. All these species, as well as their habitats, are protected. They nest in the stone walls and under the roof of the old houses, hunt around the trees and on the Vilaine.|$|R
