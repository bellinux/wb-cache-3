5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{computer}} networks, jitter is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the packet latency across a network. A network with constant latency has no variation (or jitter). <b>Packet</b> <b>jitter</b> is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean latency.

5000|$|Frame delay {{variations}} (FDV): Also {{known as}} <b>packet</b> <b>jitter,</b> {{this is a}} measurement of the variations in the time delay between packet deliveries. As packets travel through a network to their destination, they are often queued and sent in bursts to the next hop. There may be prioritization at random moments also resulting in packets being sent at random rates. Packets are therefore received at irregular intervals. The direct consequence of this jitter is stress on the receiving buffers of the end nodes where buffers can be overused or underused when there are large swings of jitter.|$|E

To this aim, suitable measurement systems, also known as “protocol analyzers,” are used. In particular, special-purposearchitecture-based protocol analyzer (SPAPA) and generalpurpose-architecture-based protocol analyzer (GPAPA) are the most widespread measurement solutions. In both cases, the measurement chain involves a reference data traffic generator and one or more nodes, suitably displaced at the measurement points {{of interest in the}} network.
