5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck was {{featured}} prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money. Cramer exited the Wreck's <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> {{to start the}} show and one of Cramer's trademark soundboards {{was attached to the}} front bumper.|$|E
25|$|Also unique {{was that}} the <b>{{passenger}}</b> <b>door</b> was four inches (101mm) longer than the driver's. This made passenger loading easier, particularly from the rear seats; and they would also tend to use the safer curb side in countries that drive on the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} sustained significant structural damage. There was major {{damage to}} the left wing's leading edge, leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps, and spoilers. The left wing fuel tank was breached near the outboard end of the outboard flaps. The front radome and weather radar were heavily damaged, and {{damage to the}} underside of the fuselage extended {{from the front of the}} aircraft all the way back to the left front <b>passenger</b> <b>door.</b> The nose landing gear well and the main electronics bay also were damaged.|$|E

25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> and {{shattering}} the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E
25|$|One {{version that}} did {{see the light}} of day was the Metro 25, which {{featured}} an increased passenger capacity of 25 at the expense of the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod for baggage. A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989. Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another jet-powered aircraft with TFE731s in over-wing pods.|$|E
25|$|Sullenberger {{opened the}} cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began {{evacuating}} the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed {{from the front}} right <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which a flight attendant was unable to reseal. Water was also entering {{a hole in the}} fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats. One passenger was in a wheelchair. Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to confirm it was empty.|$|E
50|$|The former Class 460 units (458531-458536) have ribbon glazed windows, smaller {{windows on}} <b>passenger</b> <b>doors,</b> {{and did not}} have the recess for a pantograph, {{preventing}} the future conversion to AC overhead power, because the Class 460s were built specifically for Gatwick Express, and thus cascades to AC-electrified routes were never envisioned in the original specification. The former Class 458/0 units (458501-458530) retains original window frames, larger windows on <b>passenger</b> <b>doors,</b> and the recess for the pantograph on PTSO vehicle, allowing for a future conversion to AC overhead power. However, an additional carriage from former Class 460 units retains ribbon glazed windows and smaller windows on <b>passenger</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of the cars. The man checks his watch and puts a CD in the car's stereo before the video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who opens the car's <b>passenger</b> <b>door.</b> The next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look down on them from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building. The Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] single.|$|E

2500|$|Chokri C., a Tunisian aged 37. This suspect {{allegedly}} sent Lahouaiej-Bouhlel a Facebook {{message in}} April 2016, which read, [...] "Load the truck with 2,000 tons of iron (...) release the brakes my friend, and I will watch." [...] Fingerprints of this suspect {{were found on}} the <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> of Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's truck, and CCTV footage showed him seated next to Lahouaiej-Bouhlel as he drove the truck along the Promenade des Anglais on the evening of 12 July.|$|E
2500|$|The Cessna 205 was {{introduced}} late in 1962 as a 1963 model year. [...] The six-seat aircraft {{was essentially a}} Cessna 210 with fixed landing gear and with changes to the crew and <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> arrangement, being officially designated by Cessna as a [...] "Model 210-5". [...] The 205 retained the early 210’s engine cowling bulge, originally where the 210 stowed its nosewheel on retraction. This distinctive cowling was made more streamlined on the later Cessna 206.|$|E

Immediately afterwards, the couple continued to exchange fire with police from inside their vehicle at around 3:00p.m. Malik opened the side <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> and shot at the first police vehicle to stop, which was about [...] away from the SUV. Farook exited out of the driver's front door, stood between the two open doors, and opened fire on the same vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The Breguet 670 {{did not go}} into {{production}} and only the prototype was built. In June 1936 structural problems appeared when the <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> detached from the fuselage, fortunately whilst the aircraft was on the ground; {{it turned out that}} the adhesive attaching soundproofing material to the cabin walls was attacking the duralumin. [...] After a major rebuild ownership passed in March 1938 to La Société Francaise des Transportes Aérien, a company formed to supply aircraft clandestinely to the Spanish Republican government forces during the Spanish Civil War. It may have been used for spares or re-registered in Spain but destroyed by bombing in Catalonia.|$|E
2500|$|Hudson {{resorted to}} a variety of {{marketing}} ploys to get consumers interested in the Jet, including the [...] "Tea Cup Test". This Fuel economy test utilized special kits comprising a glass cylinder, valves and rubber hoses that Hudson dealers attached to test cars. The glass cylinder was mounted {{to the inside of the}} front <b>passenger</b> <b>door,</b> with the hoses feeding into the engine's fuel line. An amount of gasoline equal to the amount held in a tea cup was added to the glass cylinder, and the car was driven away by a potential customer while a salesperson monitored the cylinder in an effort to prove how far a Jet could travel on that small amount of gasoline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was a metal monocoque, with a {{port side}} <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> aft of six windows [...] on each side, one per seat. Though the standard seat arrangement was for twelve, two seats could be removed {{to allow the}} installation of chaises-longues for longer flights. The pilots' cabin was enclosed, with side by side dual control seating. [...] The tail unit carried twin vertical endplate fins, slightly oval on a tailplane that had strong dihedral. [...] The balanced rudders and elevators were metal structures with the only fabric covering used on the aircraft. [...] The elevators carried trim tabs. [...] There was a small tailwheel, the main undercarriage retracting into the inner engine nacelles.|$|E
2500|$|McGee {{appeared}} on the show's seventh season, , in 1998, during which she was described by The Seattle Times as [...] "the cynical girl from New York state". During filming, she appeared sick and was suffering from headaches, and during the 14th episode, she told the others that she had Lyme disease, then left during the next episode. As she was leaving, a heated exchange with another housemate, Stephen Williams, ended with him opening the <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> of her car and slapping her. The producers gave the cast the {{decision as to whether}} to evict Williams, and they decided to let him stay if he would attend anger-management therapy. Activist Jello Biafra discussed the event: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was duralumin throughout and {{was flat}} sided and bottomed, though its top was slightly rounded and the nose was rounded in both plan and elevation. [...] The pilots' cabin had two seats side-by-side, fitted with dual control and radio equipment by the righthand seat. Behind them {{there was a}} separate cabin with a [...] floor, which could be fitted as a navigator's post or a bar and gave access to an underfloor baggage hold; a port-side external door accessed this space and allowed the pilots to reach their positions via an internal door. A second internal door opened into the passenger cabin, [...] in plan and [...] high, which had nine rows of seats, {{one on each side}} under its own window. There was a toilet at the rear and behind it a final space containing a library and the main <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> port-side.|$|E
