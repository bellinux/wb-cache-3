5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with <b>piano</b> <b>wire.</b> Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

25|$|James Horsfall was a {{wire drawer}} from Digbeth who invented {{high tensile steel}} wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also made possible the construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|E

For hydrography, she had a sounding machine with 600 fathoms (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of <b>piano</b> <b>wire,</b> deep-sea reversing thermometers, and density salinometers.|$|E
500|$|Nebe was {{involved}} in the July 20 plot against Adolf Hitler; he was to lead a team of twelve policemen to kill Himmler but the signal to act never reached him. After the failed assassination attempt, he fled and went into hiding on an island in the Wannsee. He was arrested in January 1945, after a former mistress betrayed him. Nebe was sentenced to death by the People's Court on 2 March and, according to official records, was executed in Berlin at Plötzensee Prison on 21 March 1945 by being hanged with <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> from a meat hook, in accordance with Hitler's order that the bomb plotters were to be [...] "hanged like cattle".|$|E

Mike Scully described the ensuing laughter at his suggestion as the most intense he had ever heard from the staff, saying: [...] "They were literally choking because the joke was so unexpected. It was a shocked kind of laugh, and it just started rolling, one of those laughs that build the more they reverberate through you." [...] In the unemployment line, the unemployment recipient with the bucket hat and the beard is a caricature of George Meyer.

500|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Joris de Man, The Flight, and Niels van der Leest, with vocalist Julie Elven {{serving as the}} primary performer. Lucas van Tol, music supervisor and senior sound designer, provided the composers with a game design document, insisting on an intimate sound for the score. For the tribal theme, they experimented with bows on <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> and resonator guitars (with layered tracks of harmonicas {{on top of the}} latter) and playing cellos with plectrums or the back of a bow to convey how contemporary instruments would be played by someone to whom the instruments were unknown; de Man also used a contrabass flute and made synth pads from blowing on a Thai bamboo flute, noting [...] "distant pads and ambiences, and wide, spread out chords seemed to work well". Circuit-bent synthesizers and percussive loops, run through impulse responses of metal and iron being beaten, were devoted to making a thematic identifier for the machines based on technology and metal. Van Tol required that the music be supplied in stems so that different pieces could be combined. The positive response to the first E3 trailer's main theme led it {{to be included in the}} main menu. The composers also did the motion capture for diegetic music vignettes, portraying in-game tribal musicians. The game's soundtrack, featuring 80 tracks that span over four hours, was released digitally via Spotify in March 2017.|$|E

2500|$|On April 10, 1985, {{a former}} lodger of Berdella's, 23-year-old Robert Sheldon, arrived on his doorstep, {{asking if he}} could again stay at his house for short period of time. According to Berdella, {{although}} Sheldon was responsible in paying rent, he considered him [...] "an inconvenience" [...] and, although he was not physically attracted to this victim, chose to drug and hold him captive on April 12 {{when he returned home}} from work to find Sheldon intoxicated in his home. Berdella was adamant he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as an individual upon whom he could [...] "express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on". Sheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of drain cleaner in his left eye, the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips, the binding of his wrists with <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands, and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his hearing capacity.|$|E

On February 15, 1900, Wells Fargo Express Agent Jeff Milton, a friend of Goodfellow, arrived on board a train in Fairbank, near Benson, Arizona. Former lawman-turned-outlaw Burt Alvord and five other robbers attempted to rob an arriving train of its cash. Milton was seriously wounded in the [...] left arm and the railroad dispatched a special engine and boxcar to transport Milton from Benson to Tucson for treatment. In Tucson, Dr. H. W.

They wanted to amputate his arm at the elbow, but he refused and got a ride to Dr. Goodfellow's office. Goodfellow successfully cleaned and treated Milton's wound but told him he would never be able to use the arm again. Milton's arm healed but was of little use and noticeably shorter than his right arm.|$|E
2500|$|Supplies and {{ammunition}} {{were brought up}} towards the position along the steep slope from the Komiatum Ridge, and on 20 June, Japanese patrols from the 66th, with guides from the 102nd, began probing the Australian position on Lababia Ridge, which was held by about 80 men. Japanese sappers defused the booby traps that the Australians had created out of <b>piano</b> <b>wire</b> and hand grenades, but being unfamiliar with the mechanisms of the Australian grenades, left them in place, rather than using them against the defenders. Sporadic firing occurred throughout the day, but no major attack developed. The following day, 21 June, Australian patrols noticed signs of Japanese activity along the track towards the observation post that had been established further east along the ridge. Around 07:30 the telephone line to the post was cut and shortly afterwards, Japanese troops approaching the main Australian position began setting off booby traps {{that had been set}} up as early warning devices. Around 14:00 the Japanese launched an assault from the north and north-east of the Australian position, supported by mortars. This was repelled, but followed up by another attack in the early afternoon, including a bayonet charge. Over the course of the afternoon, a total three attacks were made to the sound of bugle calls. While intended to frighten the Australian soldiers, these actually served to warn the defenders of their approach.|$|E
50|$|The minipiano, {{despite its}} {{name and the}} elegant {{appearance}} of the 'Pianette' model, is a sturdy and heavy instrument; it appears small only because it differs in appearance from an upright which takes up more room and is more bulky because the chamber in which the strings are held is situated {{in front of the}} player and above the keys and appears therefore to take up more space. On the minipiano, the soundboard and the strings are neatly positioned underneath the keys {{at the back of the}} piano, protected by a simple wooden frame to which fabric is attached to prevent dust getting in. When a key is pressed, the action which results in the striking and dampening of the <b>piano</b> <b>wires,</b> results from a mechanism which contrasts to any existing piano made today: a long thin but sturdy metal rod which reaches halfway down the back of the instrument is lifted. This lifting motion causes the <b>piano</b> <b>wires</b> to be struck and then dampened when the key is released as is typical of a traditional piano, at least on those notes which require dampening (on a minipiano, the highest 13 notes are not dampened).|$|R
