5000|$|... a PPD module {{that handles}} {{a list of}} <b>Postscript</b> <b>Printer</b> Description (PPD) files; ...|$|E
50|$|It is a <b>Postscript</b> <b>printer.</b> Its Windows driver {{has some}} {{popularity}} to generate Postscript files (.ps) for printing later.|$|E
50|$|<b>PostScript</b> <b>Printer</b> Description (PPD) {{files are}} created by vendors to {{describe}} the entire set of features and capabilities available for their PostScript printers.|$|E
50|$|Genera {{supports}} printing to <b>postscript</b> <b>printers,</b> {{provides a}} printing queue {{and also a}} PostScript interpreter (written in Lisp).|$|R
50|$|Since AmigaOS 2.1, in the Prefs (Preferences) system directory, {{there is}} a printer {{preferences}} program called PrinterPS, which allows the use of <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers</b> on the Amiga.|$|R
5000|$|DoubleTalk: Access Windows-Based Network Resources - Access Windows fileservers, {{transfer}} {{files to}} and from shared Windows workstations over the network and print to shared PC-based <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{output to}} a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer,</b> the printer driver reads the {{information}} in the main file and assigns the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black files to their corresponding separation files.|$|E
50|$|Type 5 {{is similar}} to the Type 4 format but is used for fonts stored in the ROMs of a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer.</b> It is also known as CROM font (Compressed ROM font).|$|E
5000|$|Like CUPS, foomatic supposes that {{applications}} {{will produce}} output in PostScript. If the output spools to a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer,</b> no further action is needed. Otherwise, the most generic way to act is: ...|$|E
50|$|InterPrint was a {{printing}} {{product designed to}} allow Macintoshes to print to <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers</b> connected over TCP/IP networks. Mostly used in corporate and prepress environments, the product integrated directly into Apple's printer architecture.|$|R
25|$|Some desktop {{printers}} {{also support}} direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable <b>printers</b> also support <b>PostScript,</b> but most <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers</b> {{do not support}} direct PDF printing.|$|R
50|$|The {{typeface}} Helvetica Narrow was not {{converted to}} OpenType, because the Type 1 original was a mathematically squished version of Helvetica, {{rather than an}} actually designed condensed typeface. This was originally done to conserve ROM space in <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ghostscript {{can also}} serve as the {{back-end}} for PDF to raster image (png, tiff, jpeg, etc.) converter; this is often combined with a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> driver in [...] "virtual printer" [...] PDF creators.|$|E
5000|$|Occasionally {{one might}} {{encounter}} modern uses of other codes, such as code 4 (End of transmission, EOT, [...] )), used {{to end a}} Unix shell session or <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> transmission. For the full list of control characters, see ASCII.|$|E
5000|$|Xfig saves {{figures in}} its native text-only [...] "Fig" [...] format. Xfig has a {{facility}} to print figures to a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> too.A convenient {{feature is the}} PSTEX or PDFTEX export format that allows a smooth integration of Xfig-generated images into LaTeX documents.|$|E
50|$|Type 1 (also {{known as}} PostScript, PostScript Type 1, PS1, T1 or Adobe Type 1) is the font format for single-byte digital fonts {{for use with}} Adobe Type Manager {{software}} and with <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers.</b> It can support font hinting.|$|R
5000|$|Since AmigaOS 2.0 a {{standard}} printer.device {{was changed to}} control various printers at same time. The Printer preferences were divided in three main panels: Prefs:Printer which selects main printer and other basic elements such as [...] "Print Spacing" [...] and [...] "Paper Size". PrinterGFX controlled features like Dithering and Scaling. PrinterPS controlled <b>Postscript</b> <b>Printers.</b> The printer drivers surprisingly remained almost same of Workbench 1.3, with 4096 limits.|$|R
40|$|S L W {{assumes that}} colour {{transparencies}} will be produced from layers, each printed {{in a single}} colour. This sub-style allows a suitable dvi driver to produce multi-coloured slides in one go (i. e., using a single layer). It is customisable for <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers</b> or simpler colour devices like the the HP PaintJet. ...|$|R
50|$|With the PostScript {{background}} {{established with}} Fontographer, Altsys developed FreeHand in 1988 as a Macintosh Postscript-based illustration program using Bézier curves for drawing and editing. In 1989, Fontographer 3.0 was released, featuring an auto-trace tool and automatic generation of hints for <b>Postscript</b> <b>printer</b> fonts.|$|E
50|$|A RIP can be {{implemented}} either as a software component of an operating system or as a firmware program executed on a microprocessor inside a printer, though for high-end typesetting, standalone hardware RIPs are sometimes used. Ghostscript and GhostPCL are examples of software RIPs. Every <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> contains a RIP in its firmware.|$|E
50|$|The {{document}} to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as <b>PostScript,</b> <b>Printer</b> Command Language (PCL), or Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS). The {{raster image processor}} converts the page description into a bitmap which is stored in the printer's raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page {{is known as a}} raster line or scan line.|$|E
40|$|The MetaPost system {{implements}} a picture-drawing language {{very much}} like Knuth's except that it outputs PostScript commands instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps. MetaPost is a powerful language for producing figures for documents to be printed on <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers.</b> It provides easy {{access to all the}} features of PostScript and it includes facilities for integrating text and graphics...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of <b>PostScript,</b> <b>printers</b> were designed to print character output given the text - typically in ASCII - as input. There were a number of technologies for this task, but most shared the property that the glyphs were physically difficult to change, as they were stamped onto typewriter keys, bands of metal, or optical plates.|$|R
5000|$|CUPS uses PPD {{drivers for}} all of its <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers,</b> and has even {{extended}} the concept to allow for PostScript printing to non-PostScript printing devices, by directing output through a CUPS filter. Such a file is no longer a standard PPD, but rather a [...] "CUPS-PPD".CUPS clients usually read the current PPD file from the server every time a new print job is created.|$|R
5000|$|An EPS file is {{a stream}} of generic PostScript {{printing}} commands.Thus many <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> drivers have an option to save as EPS, or to add EPS DSC information to their output which you can [...] "print to file".Saving as EPS was a feature of Microsoft's PSCRIPT.DRV Windows printer driver and Adobe's ADOBEPS.DRV Windows printer driver for Windows versions prior to Windows 2000.|$|E
50|$|Saito {{made use}} of his bilingual {{upbringing}} in 1992 when Datastorm Technologies, Inc., intent on entering the Japanese market, asked I/O Software to localize Procomm Plus for NEC’s PC98 series of computers. After Symantec acquired Datastorm, it made a similar request for Norton Utilities. Saito performed those tasks and also devised methods for displaying Japanese characters on IBM-compatible machines and printing them on a <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> {{description}} languages supports registration black, {{starting with}} PostScript language level 2. This {{is done by}} referring to a spot color with the special name All. This never generates a spot plate. Instead it marks all of the plates that are there. The All color space {{can be used with}} a tint value between 0.0 (no mark) to 1.0 (full intensity). Generally, only 1.0 would be used.|$|E
50|$|Printer Job Language (PJL) is {{a method}} {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard for switching printer languages at the job level, and for status readback between the printer and the host computer. PJL adds job level controls, such as printer language switching, job separation, environment, status readback, device attendance and file system commands. While PJL was conceived as an extension to Printer Command Language (PCL), it is now supported by most <b>PostScript</b> <b>printers.</b> Many printer vendors have extended PJL to include commands proprietary to their products. Not all PJL commands documented by HP are implemented in all HP or other vendor products. PJL resides above all the other printer languages and parses commands first. The syntax mainly uses plain English words.|$|R
50|$|VIPP was {{originally}} written by couple of Xerox systems Analysts in Switzerland {{to enable the}} highest speed <b>Postscript</b> <b>printers,</b> at that time 50 pages per minute, to have the features of Xerox's proprietary production printing languages PDL and FDL which provide simple variable data printing. Xerox Corporation adopted the idea and developed their work by putting these procedures on Sun Microsystems hosts where the Adobe interpreter also resides. Together, these modules give complete control over the printing engine and data stream.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The MetaPost system {{implements}} a picture-drawing language {{very much}} like Knuth's METAFONTexcept that it outputs PostScript commands instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps.

50|$|The LaserJet 4, {{especially}} the 4/4M/4+/4M+ models, have become {{known for their}} durability, mainly due to their reliable construction, {{as well as the}} printers built-in PCL (and optional <b>PostScript)</b> <b>printer</b> language support which is still used in computers to this day. Hewlett Packard dominated the laser printing sector during this time in part due to their reliability, relatively affordable pricing, and the spread of LaserJet 4 models from personal use up to heavy business use.|$|E
50|$|TrueType outline fonts. Up to this point, all fonts on the Macintosh were bitmapped, or {{a set of}} {{bitmapped screen}} fonts paired with outline <b>PostScript</b> <b>printer</b> fonts; TrueType {{for the first time}} offered a single font format that scaled to any size on screen and on paper. This {{technology}} was recognized as being so important that a TrueType extension for System 6 was also released, along with an updated Font/DA Mover capable of installing these new kinds of fonts into the System 6 System file.|$|E
50|$|Building on {{the success}} of the {{original}} LaserWriter, Apple developed many further models. Later LaserWriters offered faster printing, higher resolutions, Ethernet connectivity, and eventually color output in the Color LaserWriter. To compete, many other laser printer manufacturers licensed Adobe PostScript for inclusion into their own models. Eventually the standardization on Ethernet for connectivity and the ubiquity of PostScript undermined the unique position of Apple’s printers: Macintosh computers functioned equally well with any <b>Postscript</b> <b>printer.</b> After the LaserWriter 8500, Apple discontinued the LaserWriter product line in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to Apple.|$|E
