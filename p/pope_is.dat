50|$|Theoderic, king in Italy, and an Arian grew {{suspicious}} of the new alliance between Rome and Constantinople. John who succeeded as <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> sent to Constantinople to restore Arian churches there. Thus the orthodox Catholic <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> sent to urge the restoration of churches to heretics. This the pope did with limited success. Having failed, upon his return the <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> arrested and died in prison.|$|R

5|$|As the Catholic Church {{holds that}} women cannot be validly ordained, {{women are not}} {{eligible}} for the papacy. Though the <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> the Bishop of Rome, he need not be of Italian background. , the three most recent conclaves have elected a Pole, a German, and an Argentinian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> also Sovereign of Vatican City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is {{as head of the}} Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Before his {{permanent}} job with The Canberra Times, <b>Pope</b> <b>was</b> published by that newspaper's Sunday Times {{during the early}} 2000s. <b>Pope</b> <b>was</b> later the editorial political cartoonist for Sydney's The Sun-Herald during the mid 2000s.|$|R

5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the <b>Pope</b> <b>is</b> regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the {{successor}}s of Christ's apostles, and that the <b>Pope</b> <b>is</b> the successor to Saint Peter to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> {{verified}} by the Cardinal Camerlengo, or Chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out his Christian (not papal) name {{three times in the}} presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, and of the Cleric Prelates, Secretary and Chancellor of the Apostolic Camera. The Cardinal Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals. The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents, but today merely is a symbol of the end of the pope's reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> chosen. Originally, in the event a <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|R

5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 had also significant legal consequences. Up to that time, the {{election of}} the new Pope required unanimity among the electors, which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the unanimity impossible. To avoid the schism in the future, the Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree Licet de evitanda discordia, which established the rule that the <b>Pope</b> <b>is</b> elected with a majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|With the {{strength}} of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin launches the Siege of Jerusalem to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens must take great care not to destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the Holy Land now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of Tiberias, Tyre and Ascalon, but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the <b>Pope</b> <b>is</b> informed of the Crusader defeat in the Middle East, the Third Crusade is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final missions tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified Citadel from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King Richard of England, as well as constructing the Great Mosque of Samarra, the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.|$|E

50|$|In April 1982 <b>Pope</b> <b>was</b> {{elected to}} the Parliament of Victoria in the {{electorate}} of Monbulk.

5|$|In 814, Wulfred {{travelled}} to Rome {{to visit}} Pope Leo III. Although {{the exact nature}} of his business with the <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries. He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half-century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the– then victorious– Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active {{in the last years of}} Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Pope</b> <b>is</b> {{elected by}} the College of Cardinals. Women are not {{appointed}} as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.

25|$|As a bishop, the <b>pope</b> <b>is</b> {{referred}} to as a Vicar of Christ.

5000|$|Hostiensis {{believed}} {{that while the}} pope should follow positive law he was not bound by it.

[...] For any other violation of law the <b>pope</b> could <b>be</b> judged by no one save God. [...] Further, except {{in the event that}} a mortal sin would result, the <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> to be obeyed in everything he commanded, including violations of positive law, since the <b>pope</b> <b>was</b> above that law. [...] The only exception to this <b>was</b> if the <b>pope’s</b> command violated the conscience of the one being commanded, in which case the one being commanded should not obey.|$|R
