40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we concern {{ourselves}} with the observability of monocu-lar SLAM from a non-linear control theory perspective. Such a study {{is necessary for}} {{a full understanding of}} the monocular SLAM problem and helps formulate the necessary conditions to make it converge. Past work has focused on using observability analysis performed on linearly approximated systems, to calculate the unobservable directions for incorporating into the robot motion planner. Here we focus on conditions to mantain observability at all times, keeping in view robotic applications with predetermined coverage strategies like mine-sweeping and surveillance robots. The observability analysis performed herein helps us to determine the number of known landmarks (beacons) necessary for SLAM con-vergence. We calculate observability while preserving the nonlinearity of the sys-tem, which also provides a comparison with the results obtained previously with linear techniques. We use this analysis to build a strategy for maintaing observ-ability when the beacons are obscured from sight. We acheive this by considering the most certain landmark at the time of beacon obscurity, as a secondary beacon. This allows the rest of the states to continue to converge, and the price we pay is in form of the levelling off of the estimate of the ”beaconized ” landmark. We also provide an understanding of the need for triangulation for full state reconstruction by including disparity as a separate measurement. We then consider the effect of including disparity as a measurement in the Kalman filter and show that this will cause an increase in the measurement noise covariance before being incorporated into the filter. This {{is due to the fact}} that disparity is a measurement dependent on the current and previous states whereas the Kalman filter requires that the mea-surement be a function of the current <b>state</b> only. <b>Where</b> <b>applicable,</b> we reconcile our theoretical findings with numerical simulations and present the results. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceComprehensive and {{training}} simulators that provide realistic visual and haptic feedback during cell indentation tasks are currently investigated. Complex cell geometry inherent to biological cells and intricate mechanical properties drive {{the need for}} precise mechanical and numerical modeling to assure accurate cell deformation and force calculations. Advances in alternative finite element formulation, such as mass-tensor approach, have reached the <b>state</b> <b>where</b> they are <b>applicable</b> to model soft cell deformation in real time. The geometrical characteristics and the mechanical properties for different cells are determined with AFM indentation. A real-time, haptics-enabled simulator for cell centered indentation has been developed which utilizes the atomic force microscopy data (mechanical and geometrical properties of embryonic stem cells (mESC)) to accurately replicate the indentation task and predict the cell deformation during indentation in real-time. This tool {{can be used as}} a mechanical marker to characterize the biological state of the cell. The operator is able to feel in real-time the change in the stiffness during cell deformation between fixed and live cells. A comparison study with finite element simulations using a commercial software and the experimental data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physically-based model...|$|R
