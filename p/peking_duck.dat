25|$|By the mid-20th century, <b>Peking</b> <b>Duck</b> {{had become}} a {{national}} symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served <b>Peking</b> <b>Duck</b> for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.

25|$|<b>Peking</b> <b>duck</b> is a dish from Beijing {{that has}} been {{prepared}} since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced {{in front of the}} diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven.

25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.

In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the <b>Peking</b> <b>Duck</b> {{to the rest of}} the world.|$|E

2500|$|The ducks used {{to prepare}} <b>Peking</b> <b>Duck</b> {{originated}} in Nanjing. They were small, had black feathers, {{and lived in}} the canals around the city linking major waterways. With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barge traffic increased in the area. Often these barges would spill grain into the canals, providing food for the ducks. [...] By the Five Dynasties, the new species of duck had been domesticated by Chinese farmers. Black feathered birds fell out of favor once, with the invention of refrigeration, birds were sold in the marketplace pre-plucked. Nowadays, <b>Peking</b> <b>Duck</b> is prepared from the white feathered Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). Newborn ducks are raised in a free range environment for the first 45 days of their lives, and force fed 4 times {{a day for the}} next 15–20 days, resulting in ducks that weigh 5–7kg (11–15lbs). The force feeding of the ducks led to an alternate name for the dish, Peking Stuffed Duck (...) [...]|$|E
