The model takes into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of skin fluorophores and their photophysical characteristics. Both the spatial distribution of fluorescence of skin tissues and the possibility of localization of a detected fluorescence signal are studied. The spatial distribution of fluorescence centers (fluorophores) in the medium is assumed to closely follow the spatial distribution of collagen fibers of the skin. The equalization of the refractive indices at the air–skin interface is shown to lead to a higher degree of localization of the fluorescence signal detected from a biosensor located in a near-surface skin lay...|$|E

The literature is sparse concerning the factors of importance for occupational therapy students’ academic performance in, and satisfaction with, their education programme. Method: This cross-sectional study explored sociodemographic, relationship, education and work-related variables and their associations with the students’ academic performance and satisfaction with the education programme. The data were analysed with multivariate linear regression. Results: Participants were 123 students (mean age 24 years, 80 % women) enrolled in an undergraduate occupational therapy programme in Norway. Having prior experience of higher education was associated with better academic performance, whereas having occupational therapy as the highest <b>priority</b> <b>line</b> of study at entry, and spending fewer hours on self-studies, were associated with lower satisfaction with the education programme. Conclusion: To improve academic performance, occupational therapy educators are encouraged to help students learn about the tasks, requirements, standards and culture that constitute higher education.

40|$|This review {{analyzes}} the historical development and advances {{of the research}} on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in Mexico, as well as the prospects for future research. AMF-research has been focused on studying both diversity and functionality in several ecosystems of Mexico, but mainly in the tropical dry and rainy ecosystems, and the agricultural systems. In Mexico, 95 species of AMF have been recorded, representing 41 % of the known species worldwide. The functional effects of AMF colonization have been examined in approximately 10 % of the known host plants, but greenhouse studies continue to dominate over those conducted under field conditions. Even though research to date has been at the organismic level, further effort is needed due to the high plant diversity in Mexico. Studies on AMF biomass under field conditions and more taxonomic determination are required based on morphological features, biochemical determinations (fatty acids) and molecular tools. In addition, ecophysiological and ecological in situ studies would help in understanding the relationships among AMF, soil fauna, nutrients, and host plants. The contribution of AMF to ecosystemic processes is a <b>priority</b> <b>line</b> of research that requires an integrated approach (inter- and multidisciplinary) in order to define the role of AM symbioses for biogeochemical models.

40|$|Information on benthos {{biodiversity}} {{is scarce}} in the CCLME and inventories of marine fauna are only available for Morocco and the Canary Islands; a regional report was recently compiled {{in the framework}} of the CCLME project. A major review of benthic biodiversity in West Africa was carried out by Le Loeuff and Von Cosel (1998), who reported the highest specific richness between Cape Blanc (Mauritania) and Cape Verga (Guinea Bissau). Although a latitudinal biodiversity pattern was not observed, preliminary results of R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen and Vizconde de Eza surveys recorded the highest diversity values in Western Sahara and also higher diversity on the shelf and upper slope than in deep waters. An important faunistic change between tropical and temperate biota has been reported at Cape Blanc latitude. The zoobenthos of Cape Verde and the Canary Islands shows some specific features linked to their volcanic origin, insularity and oceanographic conditions. Epibenthic communities maintain a similar structure throughout the region, despite the differences in their specific composition. Decapods seem {{to be the most important}} group, in terms of both abundance and biomass, being other representative taxa molluscs, echinoderms, sponges, cnidarians and polychaetes. Echinoderms, mainly holothuroids, are clearly dominant in deep waters. Suspension‐feeder assemblages, previously recorded in the entire upwelling area, do not seem to play an important role in the current epibenthic communities. Although tropical coral reefs have not been reported in NWA, vulnerable ecosystems, like the giant coldwater coral reef, canyon systems, seamount and grounds of sponges and gorgonians, still exist in deep waters of the continental slope, despite the intensive fishing exploitation over more than 50 years. Studies focused on these important vulnerable marine ecosystems, as well as on the currently unknown bottoms of deep‐shelf and slope (Senegal, Guinea‐Bissau, Guinea and Cape Verde), are strongly recommended in order to protect these deep‐water areas threatened by the trawling fleets’ displacement and by the oil and mineral resources exploitation. The assessment of the main benthic taxa during scientific and commercial demersal surveys would improve the ecosystem approach to marine resources management and also help keep track of changes in benthic biodiversity over time. Benthic research in regional marine scientific institutes should be promoted and strengthened and be considered as a highest <b>priority</b> <b>line.</b> AECIDVersión del edito...|$|E

40|$|The {{preferential}} {{flow path}} of groundwaters through limestone aquifers by matrix flow within rock pores or networks of micro fractures and by fast conduit flows in large fissures and openings has important consequences on solute concentration, and poses critical problems {{in terms of}} contaminant transport. In particular, fast conduit flows can transmit contaminants rapidly, and pollutants may arrive earlier to pumping stations for drinkable water supply yielding peaks in concentrations. The slow draining of the resident mass water and diffusion into rock pores produce a continuous source of contamination, even if generally at lower concentration. The detection of the preferential flow paths, residence times and flow dynamics is hence of the uppermost importance in carbonate karst aquifers, with implications on the possible seasonal variations in water quality. Conduit flow and diffuse flow often result in springs with different chemical patterns, temperature and discharge rates, and anthropogenic tracers such as chlorofluorocarbons are effective for tracing groundwater flow. However, {{the usefulness of the}} Sr-isotope systematics has been in many cases demonstrated in the reconstruction of the water-carbonate rock interaction, becoming an important tracer of groundwater movement. In fact, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in groundwaters reflect the water-rock interaction. In this study, surface, cave and spring waters have been collected during high and low-flow conditions in the Classical Karst area (northern Italy and Slovenia), a carbonate plateau that rises above the northern Adriatic Sea and consisting in a thick sequence of limestones and dolostones dated Cretaceous and Tertiary. Waters belong to the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-Mg-HCO 3 hydrofacies. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in surface, cave waters and springs ranges between 0. 70781 ÷ 0. 70838, 0. 70787 ÷ 0. 70824 and 0. 70757 ÷ 0. 70786, respectively, during low flow, and between 0. 70760 ÷ 0. 70843, 0. 70749 ÷ 0. 70810 and 0. 70759 ÷ 0. 70800 during high flow. The data indicate the relative contribution of the Isonzo and Reka rivers, with relatively high Sr isotopic composition, as inputs to the Classical Karst aquifer. Furthermore, cave waters have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio higher with respect to the Sr isotopic composition measured in limestone rock samples (87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 70743 ÷ 0. 70752), while springs range from near-isotopic equilibrium with limestones towards a more radiogenic character, suggesting different water-rock contact times. These data are interpreted in terms {{of the role of the}} processes in the upper, phreatic zone and on the different flow dynamics in the area, which have a different vulnerability towards pollution.
