50|$|Gibb {{presented}} his first collection {{under his own}} name in 1972. His fantastical creations were based on nature, with unexpected combinations of fur, feathers, <b>printed</b> <b>leather,</b> and brightly coloured clinging fabrics. However, his most important work was in knitwear, co-designed with Kaffe Fasset and hand-knitted by Mildred Bolton. Due to massive demand, Gibb found a manufacturer in Leicestershire {{who was willing to}} take on the challenge of machine-knitting Fassett's extraordinarily complicated, multi-coloured woollen designs, although Bolton continued to hand-knit one-off designs. During the 1970s, Gibb did take on other design commissions, including creating a range of shoe designs for the high-end shoe manufacturer Rayne. Later, in the 1980s, Gibb collaborated with another Leicestershire manufacturer, Annette Carol, to produce acrylic knitwear using a jacquard technique.|$|E

The optimum concentration of penetrant is 20 g/L and the PH of pretreatment solution is 3 in the second step of the pre-treatment. The wet and dry rubbing fastness reaches grade 3 and 4 - 5.

40|$|The {{work was}} a result of {{exploring}} techniques in printing onto suede to create large pins and skirt pins which interconnect (various scales). The <b>printed</b> <b>leather</b> collection was inspired by themes of memory and heirloom. The printed imagery (buttons, text, writing, lace), explored these themes and their symbolic connotations. The research process required development of printing techniques applied to unlikely materials including experimentation with soft suedes. This required exploration in terms of scale and wearability by creating skirt pins, which interconnect and work with clothing worn in unexpected places. The pieces also incorporate found objects and silver components and interconnecting chains...|$|E

30|$|Azo dyes {{account for}} about {{one-half}} of all dyes produced and are {{the most commonly used}} synthetic dyes in the textile, food, paper making, color paper <b>printing,</b> <b>leather</b> and cosmetic industries (Chang and Lin 2001). The textile industry accounts for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market and during the dyeing process approximately 10 % of the dyes used are released into the wastewater (Easton 1995). The amount of dye lost in industrial applications depends on the type of dye used and varies from 2 % loss for basic dyes to about 50 % loss for certain reactive sulfonated dyes when used with cellulosic fabrics due to the relatively low levels of dye fiber fixation (Shore 1995; McMullan et al. 2001; Pearce et al. 2003; Hai et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} removal of Malachite Green from aqueous solution by using Corchorus Olitorius. Generally, dyes are used in chemical, textile, paper, <b>printing,</b> <b>leather,</b> plastics and various food industries. The need for the treatment of dye contaminated waste water passed out from the industry. In this study, activated Corchorus Olitorius- L-Leaves was studied for its potential use as an adsorbent for removal of Malachite Green. The various factors affecting adsorption, such as initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose and effect of temperature, were evaluated. The experimental data were fitted into the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The equilibrium of adsorption was modeled by using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The objective of the present work suggests the ACONC may be utilized as a low cost adsorbent for Malachite Green dye removal from aqueous solution...|$|R

30|$|Dyes {{are widely}} used in {{industries}} such as textiles, rubber, plastics, <b>printing,</b> <b>leather,</b> cosmetics, etc., to color their products. As a result, they generate {{a considerable amount of}} colored wastewater. There are more than 10, 000 commercially available dyes with over 7  ×  105 tonnes of dye stuff produced annually. It is estimated that 2  % of dyes produced annually is discharged in effluents from associated industries (Allen and Koumanova 2003). Among various industries, textile industry ranks first in usage of dyes for coloration of fiber. The total dye consumption of the textile industry worldwide is in excess of 107  kg/year and an estimated 90  % of this ends up on fabrics. Consequently, 1, 000  tones/year or more of dyes are discharged into waste streams by the textile industry worldwide (Marc 1996). Discharge of dye-bearing wastewater into natural streams and rivers poses severe problems to the aquatic life, food web and causes damage to the aesthetic nature of the environment.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{polymeric}} adsorbents for {{the removal}} of azo dyes from solution has been reviewed. Adsorption techniques are widely used to remove certain classes of pollutants from waters, especially those which are not easily biodegradable. The removal of azo dyes as pollutants from wastewaters of textile, paper, <b>printing,</b> <b>leather,</b> pharmaceutical and other industries has been addressed by the researchers. The wider use of already available adsorbents is restricted due to their high costs which lead to investigation and development of new materials that can be cheaper, eficient and easy regenerated. The aim {{of this article is to}} present to the readers the widespread investigations in recent years of synthetic and natural polymers as adsorbents and potential replacement of conventional adsorbents. This review presents only the data obtained using raw, hydrogel, grafted and crosslinked forms of synthetic and nature based polymers, and the discussion is limited to these polymer-based materials and their adsorption properties.

50|$|Born in Otsego County, New York, Doubleday {{received}} a limited formal schooling. While living in Coopertown he was apprenticed {{to the village}} printer {{at a very young}} age. Apprentices were legally bound to work for many years with little or no rights but with a chance to learn a useful trade. Ulysses was near the last of 27 Doubleday children. His father Abner Doubleday was a farmer and Revolutionary War soldier. His mother Mercy Freeman was a preacher's daughter.He learned the art of printing and worked as a printer in Cooperstown, Utica, and Albany, New York.He served at Sackets Harbor in the War of 1812.He established the Saratoga Courier at Ballston Spa. He was a book publisher under the name UF Doubleday <b>printing</b> <b>leather</b> bound books starting in 1817. He published Samuel Young's Treatise on Internal Navigation, 1817 (with parts written by Albert Galatin), Gilbert McMaster's An Apology for the Book of Psalms, 1818 and William Ray's Poems on Various Subjects, 1821. He moved to Auburn, New York, where he published and edited the Cayuga Patriot 1819-1839. He ran a book store in Auburn called Doubleday's.

30|$|Many {{industries}}, {{such as the}} textile, <b>printing,</b> and <b>leather</b> industries uses {{different types}} of dyes and discharge colored wastewaters and dyes that remain in the effluents, undergo chemical changes, consume dissolved oxygen, and may cause carcinogenic and genotoxic effects (Crini 2006). Dyes with striking visibility in recipients may significantly affect photosynthetic activity in aquatic environment due to the reduced light penetration (Fu and Virarahavan 2001). It is estimated that over 10 % of dye used in textile processing does not bind to the fibers and is, therefore, released to the environment (Hildenbrand et al. 1999).|$|R
