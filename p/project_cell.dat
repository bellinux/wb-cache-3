40|$|The {{construction}} sector {{plays an important}} role in most economies; therefore, any waste reduction in a building's life cycle will result in a significant benefit to the economy. It is at the building design phase that most costs and wastes are defined for the entire building life cycle. Moreover, many forms of waste are also accumulated during the design phase itself. The objective of this article is to present a new approach for organizing and managing the building design phase in a more effective and efficient way. This approach, called <b>Project</b> <b>Cell,</b> promotes concurrent engineering and lean management principles to achieve better performance during the design of a building. The <b>Project</b> <b>Cell</b> approach was implemented in the design process of a generic kindergarten project for the Brazilian Ministry of Education. This case study determined that approximately 2. 5 % of the total project effort was due to rework and 7. 5 % was due to discarded drawings based on team decisions. Furthermore, after the construction of 16 buildings in several locations across Brazil, no requests for time extensions or additional work expenses were reported based on design errors or execution difficulties. In this case study the implementation of <b>project</b> <b>cell</b> resulted in better productivity in the building design process as well as more effective building designs when compared to the traditional departmentalized approaches. With such evidence in mind, the authors believe that introducing <b>Project</b> <b>Cell</b> may be valuable contribution to CEM Body of Knowledge.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} (AS) allows increased {{diversity and}} orthogonal {{regulation of the}} transcriptional products of mammalian genomes. To assess the distribution and variation of alternative splicing across cell lineages of the immune system, we comprehensively analyzed RNA sequencing and microarray data generated by the Immunological Genome Project Consortium. AS is pervasive: 60 % of genes showed frequent AS isoforms in T or B lymphocytes, with 7, 599 previously unreported isoforms. Distinct cell specificity was observed, with differential exon skipping in 5 % of genes otherwise coexpressed in both B and T cells. The distribution of isoforms was mostly all or none, suggesting on/off switching as a frequent mode of AS regulation in lymphocytes. From the identification of differential exon use in the microarray data, clustering of exon inclusion/exclusion patterns across all Immunological Genome <b>Project</b> <b>cell</b> types showed that ∼ 70 % of AS exons are distributed along a common pattern linked to lineage differentiation and cell cycling. Other AS events distinguished myeloid from lymphoid cells or affected only a small set of exons without clear lineage specificity (e. g., Ptprc). Computational analysis predicted specific associations between AS exons and splicing regulators, which were verified by detection of the hnRPLL/Ptprc connection...|$|E

40|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex is {{an important}} interface of cortical, motor, and limbic networks, and thus is a brain area uniquely situated to affect {{a wide variety of}} higher order functions. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the morphology of two distinct populations of {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC) pyramidal neurons, a dorsal-caudal population projecting to the premotor cortex (PMC) and a ventral-rostral population projecting to the amygdala. Retrograde tracers injected into area 6 DC of the “cognitive” premotor cortex, and into the basolateral nucleus of the “affective” amygdala were used to label distinct projection neurons in the ACC. Whole-cell patch clamp recording and intracellular filling techniques were used to fill the dendritic arbor of these labeled projection neurons. High resolution confocal microscopy and 3 D neuronal reconstructions were used to quantify dendritic morphological parameters. Amygdala projecting neurons were more superficial than premotor projecting neurons, with an average soma-to-pia distance of 498 μm compared to 1, 012 μm, respectively (amygdala projecting: 498 ± 139 μm vs. PMC projecting: 1012 ± 113 μm, p<. 05). Overall, amygdala and PMC projection neurons had very similar average dendritic lengths, branch points, branch densities, and vertical and horizontal extensions in both apical and basal compartments. Amygdala <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> had greater apical tuft branch points than deep PMC <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> (8. 25 vs. 3. 3 apical tuft branch points, p<. 05). Superficial PMC <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> had smaller total vertical and apical vertical extensions than deep PMC <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> (Total vertical: 304. 98 vs. 750. 96 μm, apical vertical: 241. 78 vs 601. 95 μm, p<. 05). Sholl analyses revealed that the distribution of apical dendritic length as a function of distance from the soma of amygdala projections had bimodal peaks, while that of superficial and deep PMC cells had a single peak. Total spine number of amygdala projecting neurons was greater than PMC <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> (~ 17, 000 spines vs. ~ 2, 100 spines). Three major classes of morphology were visualized within the ACC neuron reconstructions dataset: regular-tufted, narrow-tufted, and untufted, with the regular-tufted cells containing more branch points than narrow tufted but less basal branch point density. The work in this study assessing cellular morphological properties of specific amygdala and PMC inputs and outputs within the ACC helps to characterize functional dynamics of both emotional and motor planning networks...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{fundamentally}} different strategies for solving the standard trans-port or continuity equation, corresponding {{to whether it}} is expressed as a partial differential equation or as an integral statement of conservation. The more common approach is to discretize the partial differential equation and to march the solution forward in time. The alternative method is to <b>project</b> <b>cell</b> volumes along Lagrangian trajectories as far forward or backward in time as desired, and then to remap the resulting density distribution onto some target mesh. This latter approach is known as remapping. Remapping has many advantages, {{not the least of}} which is that the time step is limited only by accuracy considerations, but it tends to be expensive and complex. In this paper we show that if the time step is made sufficiently short such that trajectories are confined to the nearest neighbor cells, then the remapping may be written as a flux-form transport algorithm, and it becomes nearly as simple and efficient as standard transport schemes. The resulting method, called incremental remapping, retains most of the advantages of general remapping. These include: (a) geometric basis for transport, (b) compatibility of associated tracer transport wit...|$|E

We present more results in Section 3. 1 Algorithm Details Identifying out of sight, missing depth cell, and occlusion source depth As is dis-cussed in the paper, {{it is important to}} identify cells that are out of sight, occluded by other objects or having vast missing depth, and then set their features to zeros so that they do not bias the overall detection score. The way we identify these cells is the fol-lowing: similar to TSDF feature computation, after each cell is divided into a 6 × 6 × 6 voxel grid, we <b>project</b> <b>cell</b> center’s 3 D location (xc, yc, zc) onto 2 D image plane. If one cell has more than one voxel falls outside the image boundary, it is flagged as out of sight. Otherwise, we round the voxel center positions into pixel coordinate and read the corresponding depth value D from the depth map. If D is missing, the voxel will be treated as missing as well. If more than 90 % voxels of a cell are missing, the whole cel...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of geographic population structure and genetic ancestry {{on the basis}} of a minimal set of genetic markers is desirable for a wide range of applications in medical and forensic sciences. However, the absence of sharp discontinuities in the neutral genetic diversity among human populations implies that, in practice, a large number of neutral markers will be required to identify the genetic ancestry of one individual. We showed that it is possible to reduce the amount of markers required for detecting continental population structure to only 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), by applying a newly developed ascertainment algorithm to Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 10 K SNP array data that we obtained from samples of globally dispersed human individuals (the Y Chromosome Consortium panel). Furthermore, this set of SNPs was able to recover the genetic ancestry of individuals from all four continents represented in the original data set when applied to an independent, much larger, worldwide population data set (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain–Human Genome Diversity <b>Project</b> <b>Cell</b> Line Panel). Finally, we provide evidence that the unusual patterns of genetic variation we observed at the respective genomic regions surrounding the five most informative SNPs is in agreement with local positive selection being the explanation for the striking SNP allele-frequency differences we found between continenta...|$|E

Content for the mHealth project was adapted from a classroom-based health education curriculum called Honoring the Gift of Heart Health (HGHH) and designed to be a standalone mHealth intervention. Short Message Service (SMS; text only) and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS; text with images) were used to deliver health information over a five week period using three types of messages: information, quiz, and homework. Each participant received two informational SMSs, two quizzes, and a single homework message per week. The research questions were: (1.) To what extent is the cell phone, as used in C 2 ̆ 6 T, a feasible dissemination tool to increase knowledge of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in an urban American Indian Alaska Native (AI/AN) population? (2.) In an urban AI/AN population, to what extent, if any, does the inclusion of text with photo elicitation (MMS) increase health knowledge and motivation more than text messaging (SMS) ? (3.)

40|$|The chemokines {{and their}} receptors {{constitute}} many important physiological {{functions in the}} human body. The chemokine receptors belong {{to the family of}} G-protein coupled receptors, characterized by 7 α-helices penetrating the cell membrane, and are coupled to a heterotrimeric G-protein intracellularily. Discovering the phenomenon of oligomerization of the G-protein coupled receptors, increased the complexity in terms of functionality and dynamics significantly, amplifying both challenges and possibilities related to these receptors. The chemokine receptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4 are physiologically diverse and in addition, the two co-receptors for HIV- 1. HIV- 1 infects T cells through an envelope protein called gp 120, which binds to CD 4 on the target cell, in addition to CCR 5, CXCR 4 or both, depending on the strain of the virus in question. M-tropic HIV- 1 gp 120 enters and infects monocytes via CCR 5, while the T-tropic HIV- 1 p 120 enters and infects lymphocytes via CXCR 4. Another dual tropic strain, entering via both chemokine receptors also exists. Evidence has been published, which indicates a possible effect on HIV- 1 infection related to receptor oligomerization dynamics, based on the presence of several receptors capable of forming oligomeric complexes at the cell membrane. In this <b>project,</b> <b>cell</b> functionality and receptor expression pattern of CCR 5 and CXCR 4 fused with a fluorescent protein (CFP or YFP) is demonstrated. In addition to this, homo- and heterodimerization between CCR 5 and CXCR 4 in live cells are demonstrated by the use of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). By the same technique, it is also demonstrated that CCR 5 is able to decrease the apparent affinity of CXCR 4 towards forming homodimers, indicating the conformation dynamics of these receptors. Finally, the importance of CXCR 4 conformations in terms of T-tropic (X 4) HIV- 1 entry is assessed, as it is demonstrated that the presence of CCR 5 at the cell surface decreases T-tropic (X 4) HIV- 1 infection significantly, most likely by interacting with CXCR 4 and altering its conformation...|$|E

40|$|The lateral ventral horn. of {{the upper}} {{cervical}} (C(1 - 3 vl)) cord in rat, cat and monkey contains many <b>cells</b> that <b>project</b> to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Until now {{it was assumed that}} these <b>cells</b> only <b>project</b> to the ventrolateral part of the caudal PAG. Because the ventrolateral caudal PAG is involved in quiescence and hypotension, it was hypothesized that the C(1 - 3 vl) -PAG <b>projecting</b> <b>cells</b> play a role in immobility behavior, possibly activated by neck muscle afferents. However, in the present anterograde and retrograde study in cat we showed that C(1 - 3 vl) cells do not only target the caudal PAG, but terminate even more abundantly in the intermediate and rostral parts of the PAG. There, projections target the ventrolateral column, like in the caudal PAG, but also terminate in the lateral and dorsomedial columns. This finding, combined with the current, albeit limited, physiological data on C(1 - 3 vl) -PAG and C(1 - 3 vl) -thalamic <b>projecting</b> <b>cells,</b> sheds a new light on the possible functions of C(1 - 3 vl) cells. it might be that the C(1 - 3 vl) cells with complex response properties and large receptive fields have a relay function similar to cells in the dorsal column nuclei, lateral cervical or central cervical nucleus. Other C(1 - 3 vl) cells might receive somatic or visceral input that was never tested before, or perhaps other input, like vestibular information. It might also be that these <b>cells</b> <b>project</b> to the more caudal cord to modulate visceral input, with ascending collaterals to more rostrally, located structures, including mesencephalon and thalamus.

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{adapted for}} {{the propagation of}} monolayer cultures from human villous placenta is described. Keratin immunofluorescent localization was utilized to characterize trophoblast cells in sub-cultivated cultures derived from first trimester placentae. The appearance of autofluorescent particles in long-term first trimester placental cultures is reported. The monolayer culture system was employed to study living mitochondria. Using the vital fluorescent dye rhodamine 123, fluorescence microscopy of living first trimester human placental cells and choriocarcinoma cells was carried out. The length and intracellular distribution of mitochondria are described for normal placental cells, somatic hybrids of normal cells, and choriocarcinoma cells. In normal first trimester placental cells, quantitative relationships between the <b>projected</b> <b>cell</b> surface areas and numbers/lengths of their mitochondria are described by regression equations. From the equations, it is deduced that the total (aggregate) length of mitochondria per cell is directly proportional to the 0. 86 +/- 0. 07 power of the <b>cell's</b> <b>projected</b> surface area. The number of mitochondria per cell is also a direct function of the cellular surface area, with an exponent of 0. 82 +/- 0. 07; whilst the total length of mitochondria per unit <b>projected</b> <b>cell</b> surface area is an inverse function (exponent = - 0. 14 + 0. 07) of the cell surface area. The reaction of living mitochondria in cultured first trimester placental cells {{to a number of}} chemical agents including colchicine was investigated. In the presence of colchicine, it appears that the distribution of mitochondria becomes more restricted to the perinuclear cytoplasm and that the mean length of the organelles is reduced.
