5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Congress {{appropriated}} $9.7 {{million for the}} property's further renovation and improvement. Federally appropriated funds were augmented with $5 million in <b>private</b> <b>donations.</b> The Jackson Place properties were internally combined into a single building and then merged with Blair–Lee House {{by way of a}} connecting structure occupying the alleyway that had separated them. The renovation and merger of the four properties resulted in their closure from 1982 through 1988.|$|E

5|$|Keeler was {{responsible}} for the restoration of Baltimore's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, America's first cathedral. The project cost approximately $32 million. The funds were raised entirely from <b>private</b> <b>donations</b> and not from the Archdiocese's treasury. It lasted from 2004 until November 2006, and was finished in time for a celebration honoring the 200th anniversary of the groundbreaking. By the time the restoration was completed, the Basilica had been repaired and restored to its more original appearance.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day 1997, the Commission {{announced}} it would support the Link with £32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost. The Wheel and its associated basin was priced at £17 million, more than {{a fifth of the}} total budget. Another £46 million had to be raised {{in the next two years}} before construction could commence, with contributions from BWB, seven local councils, Scottish Enterprise, and <b>private</b> <b>donations</b> being augmented by £8.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E

5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from <b>private</b> <b>donations.</b> A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Bell {{refers to}} one of two replicas in Portland, Oregon, United States, of the {{original}} Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. The first replica was purchased in 1962, and installed in the rotunda of City Hall in 1964. On November 21, 1970, it was destroyed in a bomb blast that also damaged the building's east portico. The second replica was installed outside of City Hall soon after the blast (c. 1972) with funds from <b>private</b> <b>donations.</b> It was constructed at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore and dedicated on November 6, 1975. The bell is listed as a state veterans memorial by the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs.|$|E
5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia {{in the late}} evening on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} the exhausted Armenian workers who then returned to Yerevan. Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. <b>Private</b> <b>donations</b> from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by <b>private</b> <b>donations</b> and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{residence}} {{is maintained}} by a trust {{managed by the}} Governor's Residence Commission and {{is part of the}} Indiana Public Building Foundation located at 4750 N. Meridian St., Indianapolis. The commission was authorized in 1975, charged with overseeing the renovation and maintenance of the home as well as event planning. In 2008, the commission's members included Linda Goad, Sara Barclay, David Collins, Jim Baker, Mike Bosway, Judy Warren, and Shannon Rezek. The commission is partly funded by <b>private</b> <b>donations.</b> The members are appointed by the Governor and serve at term lengths of his choosing. The commission meets monthly and officially reports to the Office of First Lady. The commission serves without pay, but is reimbursed for expenses.|$|E
5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from <b>private</b> <b>donations.</b> The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Allen {{announced}} {{a gift of}} $26million to build the Paul G. Allen School of Global Animal Health at Washington State University, his alma mater. The gift is the largest <b>private</b> <b>donation</b> in the university's history.|$|R

5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to <b>private</b> <b>donations</b> to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{tensions}} of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help {{within a few}} days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but <b>private</b> <b>donations</b> and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had {{a large part of the}} international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a transport plane from Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support of the relief effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry.|$|E
5|$|Fund-raising for {{the center}} was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton's who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton-Gore {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited <b>private</b> <b>donations,</b> {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E
