40|$|Context: Striae distensae are linear atrophic dermal scars {{covered with}} flat atrophic epidermis. They may cause disfigurement, {{especially}} in females. Many factors may cause striae distensae such as steroids, obesity, and pregnancy. Although {{there is no}} standard treatment for striae; many topical applications, peeling, and light and laser systems have been tried. Aims: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of fractional CO 2 laser with intense <b>pulse</b> <b>light</b> in treating striae distensae. Subjects and Methods: Forty patients with striae distensae were recruited. Twenty of them were treated by fractional CO 2 laser and 20 were treated with intense <b>pulse</b> <b>light.</b> Length and width of the largest striae were measured pre- and post-treatment. Patient satisfaction was also evaluated and graded. Patients were photographed after each treatment session and photos were examined by a blinded physician who had no knowledge about the cases. Results: Both groups showed significant improvement after treatments (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The current study has provided supportive evidence {{to the effectiveness of}} both fractional CO 2 laser and intense <b>pulse</b> <b>light</b> as treatments for striae distensae. Fractional CO 2 laser was found to be more effective in the treatment of striae distensae compared with intense <b>pulse</b> <b>light...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> {{technology}} utilizes {{high powered}} pulses of broad spectrum light to reduce microorganisms {{on food and}} food contact surfaces. While previous research has shown <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> to be effective at reducing various microorganisms {{on a variety of}} substrates, a better understanding of inactivation kinetics, pairing <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> with other antimicrobial treatments, and the cellular effect of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> treatment will provide better insight into potential opportunities for future use of this technology. Inactivation of Listeria innocua in liquid suspensions and on the surface of stainless steel showed pronounced tailing. The utilization of the Weibull model accurately predicted inactivation in clear liquids but overestimated Pulsed Light‟s effectiveness on stainless steel surfaces where complex surface properties as well as inoculum size were of significant influence. The combination of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> with the antimicrobial nisin was able to reach reductions of 4 to 5 log CFU/sausage of Listeria on the surface of sausages, extending storage from 8 day for individual treatments to 28 to 48 days suggesting that <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> in combination with additional antimicrobials can effectively reduce surface contamination of ready-to-eat foods. To evaluate the potential for repeated <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> exposure to lead to changes in growth and resistance behavior of survivors, L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, and E. coli were exposed to both low (1. 1 J/cm 2) and high (10. 1 J/cm 2) levels of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> and survivors were recovered and subsequently treated for 10 cycles of exposure and recovery. Isolates of all three organisms did not show changes in growth kinetics or resistance after multiple exposures when compared to untreated cells at either low or high fluence levels. Reduction levels of 3 - 4 and 5 - 6 log CFU/ml were obtained after exposure to 1. 1 and 10. 1 J/cm 2, respectively, for the untreated control and the repeatedly treated and recovered isolates. Whole genome microarray analysis showed increased transcription levels for stress related proteins, motility, and transcriptional regulators following both <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> and UV light. Removing the UV spectrum of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> lead to no differences between treated and untreated samples and showed a downregulation in motility and cell membrane associated genes as well as no increases in stress response genes following exposure, suggesting that the mechanism of inactivation is related to the UV portion of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> and the visible and NIR spectrum do not play a role in cell inactivation...|$|R

Firmness, colour, phenol, carotenoid, ascorbic acid contents and enzyme activities (Phenylalanineammonialyase, PAL and Polyphenoloxydase, PPO) were analysed. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>light</b> treatment maintained the firmness, the colour and the carotenoid content of fresh-cut mangoes.
