25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a <b>Push</b> <b>To</b> <b>Talk</b> (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has something to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E

The core technology standard for the AT Mobility wireless network is called Global System for Mobile Communications, or GSM.

25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

Alton's friend Cliff remains unimpressed. He notes how unusual the game is - when Trapp plays with Wallace, his other partner with whom he plays once a week, they break a very rare seventy percent game, though argue profusely afterwards. In this time, Alton notes that his uncle is very good at the game, and is almost a Grand Life Master, but he has not yet won a regional tournament, something Gloria advises Alton not to mention. Alton attempts to befriend Trapp, learning that he once had a bridge partner named Annabel King who was the sister of his wife.

This in turn <b>pushed</b> Brazil <b>to</b> accelerate <b>talks</b> with West Germany and France, eventually signing an agreement with the former on 27 June 1975, that established the transfer of operational know-how regarding reactors. The deal represented the largest technology transfer agreement ever signed between an industrialized country and an industrializing one. Bonn committed to export four to eight reactors over a span of 15 years. Likewise, West German firms agreed to construct a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Brazil: uranium prospecting and mining; uranium enrichment (using the jet-nozzle process); manufacturing fuel rods; and reprocessing spent fuel rods. For West Germany’s nuclear industry, this was the most significant contract ever to be established, at an anticipated value of 10 billion marks (roughly US$4 billion). Also, this was the largest single export order in German history.|$|R

40|$|Picture {{a junior}} high dance. Crowds of eighth- and ninth-grade {{adolescents}} pile into the gymnasium which has been decorated with crepe paper streamers. Teachers and parents acting as chaperones stand smiling at the punch bowl {{in the middle of}} the room. As the night unfolds they mingle with the students, <b>pushing</b> them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with each other as well as persons of the opposite gender. For the most part, boys stand on one side of the room, girls on the other. The music plays, the disc jockey talks, and most of the boys and girls stand on their respective sides. Similar to the would-be dancing of junior high adolescents, experienced teachers working with beginning teachers stand poised and ready to dance. Like the crepe paper decorations in the gym, the external conditions supportive to doing the work of mentoring have been put in place. Like the chaperones at the dance lending support to the interaction of boys and girls, mentor trainers give guidance to the interaction of mentors with beginning teachers. And like the boys and girls standing on either side uncertain about how to make that move across the floor and invite a person to dance, the mentor faces similar concerns and anxieties about inviting a beginning teacher <b>to</b> have a <b>talk</b> about teaching. The experienced and beginning teacher pairs whom I discuss in this paper work in junior and senior high schools in a large urban district. Like the adolescents who go to the dance, the experienced teachers who participate in mentoring have certain purposes and expected outcomes. In this paper I explore the work of mentoring and perceptions and enactment of the role. The questions shaping the exploration include, What do mentors do when they work with beginners? What perceptions of the role do mentors have? What purposes do mentors see in their work, and what are the sources? How does the work mentors do with beginning teachers fit with the expectations they have...|$|R
