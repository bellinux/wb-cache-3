40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{observed}} seasonal {{variations in the}} density of decapod larvae as well as changes in density related to diurnal and tidal cycles. Among the decapod larvae collected, <b>portunids</b> and grapsids were the most abundant, especially during nocturnal ebb tides and near the surface. The same results were obtained in late winter (September) and late summer (March). These results demonstrated a flow of decapod larvae from Guanabara Bay to adjacent coastal waters. Luciferid (Lucifer faxoni) was the only group with high densities during flood tides and we suggest this is an evidence of L. faxoni larvae entering Guanabara Bay in late winter. Probably these changes in distribution of Lucifer faxoni among winter and summer were related to reproductive cycle in the bay. For the <b>portunids,</b> grapsids and ocypodids, a similar dispersion strategy was observed towards adjacent coastal waters in the surface during nocturnal ebb tides...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the meat yield for both sexes of the crab Callinectes bocourti in the region of Iguape, Brazil. The carapace width for males was 78. 1 - 114. 0 mm (96. 7 ± 9. 5 mm) and for females 76. 0 - 106. 3 mm (93. 0 ± 7. 8 mm). In males, the total wet weight ranged from 65. 53 to 224. 36 g (134. 04 ± 40. 77 g) and for females from 56. 66 to 164. 74 g (105. 93 ± 26. 88 g). A comparison of morphological structures revealed that the greatest meat yield was in the carapace (55. 1 %), followed by the right chela (16. 9 %), the left chela (15. 9 %), and the legs (12. 1 %). The total yield from the males (28. 5 %) was slightly higher than that from the females (22. 1 %). In general, <b>portunids</b> yield more meat than other crab species.

40|$|The {{utility of}} varying twine {{diameter}} (0. 5 - 0. 8 mm Ø) and/or mesh area (0. 5 : 1) in south-eastern Australian recreational hoop nets was assessed {{in response to}} concerns over (1) impacts to discarded, undersize Scylla serrata L. and Portunus pelagicus Forskål and (2) marine debris (lost meshes). There was a negative relationship between Ø and breakage, with more in the narrowest (16. 16 - 18. 42 meshes deployment- 1) than thickest (8. 79 - 4. 68) twines. Mesh damage was also affected by interactions between netting area and (1) soak time (only S. serrata) and (2) catches, with all nets similarly damaged during 3 ̆c 3. 5 -h soaks, or when only one crab was caught, beyond which the large-area nets incurred more. Irrespective of net, there were consistent positive relationships between mesh damage and water temperature, and more damage overnight. Large crabs took longer to remove, but more so from thicker-twined and large-area nets, and some also sustained the most damage. Twine diameter did not affect S. serrata catches, but was negatively associated with catches of P. pelagicus, while the small-area nets caught proportionally (to area) fewer <b>portunids.</b> The results reflect species- and size-specific behavioural variability, but support using thick twine and limiting deployment durations for hoop nets.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1940 Leene {{published}} Part I of the Snellius <b>portunids,</b> {{with the}} stated intention {{of using the}} remaining material to produce monographs of the genera Thalamita and Neptunus (now Portunus). These monographs did not eventuate and {{at the invitation of}} Dr. L. B. Holthuis the material was made available for study by the author at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden. The original intention was to report upon the collections of the Snellius expedition and upon the accrued specimens from the Indo-West Pacific area in the Leiden Museum which belonged to described species. It was then intended to publish separately upon the undescribed species in these and other collections. Instead these undescribed species are included in the present work. The additional species are basically from the collections of the United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, but specimens have also been loaned from the Zoologisk Museum, Copenhagen, the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, the Australian Museum, Sydney, and the Queensland Museum, Brisbane.

40|$|Lipids {{are crucial}} {{nutrients}} for survival {{and development of}} crustacean larvae. This study investigated the effects of starvation on survival, body weight, and lipid composition of newly hatched larvae of Portunus pelagicus. The results showed that during starvation, average survival time of newly hatched zoea I larvae was 3. 87 days. A significant decreasing trend was detected for individual dry weight (DW) during starvation and was described as DW = 0. 2 x 2 − 1. 462 x + 15. 023, R 2 = 0. 9985, where x is the starvation duration in days. DW and total lipids decreased by 17. 42 and 38. 46 % after 3 days of starvation, respectively. For newly hatched larvae, total lipids were dominated by phospholipids (PL) (75. 55 – 93. 57 %) and 50. 39 % of PL were utilized during the 3 -day starvation period. This indicates that membrane structural lipids of newly hatched P. pelagicus larvae were oxidized as an energy source during continuous starvation. There were concurrent increases in free fatty acids and cholesterol that probably resulted from the decomposition of sterol esters to free fatty acids and cholesterol. Newly hatched P. pelagicus larvae contained substantially higher levels of 20 : 5 n 3 (18. 90 %) and 22 : 6 n 3 (18. 24 %) than other Portunid crabs. During starvation, the highest fatty acid reduction rates were found for 20 : 4 n 6, 20 : 5 n 3, and 22 : 6 n 3 (P < 0. 05), and the preferential depletion of these fatty acids may suggest that the HUFA requirements of early P. pelagicus larvae are {{lower than those of}} the other <b>Portunids...</b>|$|E
40|$|Theory on the {{sequential}} assessment model (SAM) {{has frequently}} been tested by using swimming crabs {{of the family}} Portunidae. Predictions {{on the effect of}} resource value and resource holding power were not met for all species and not even within a single species. They also were not tested simultaneously in a single study. Moreover, alternatives for SAM have been proposed and existing experimental tests fail to discriminate between them. Taken together, this calls for a reassessment of the assessment game in <b>portunids.</b> We staged fights between shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) because this portunid gave rise to the sharpest contrast with the sequential assessment theory. Pairs of shore crabs of different sizes were allowed to feed on mussels (Mytilus edulis) offered in different densities. We tested effects of mussel density, competitor size and absolute body size on contest duration, intensity of fighting, fighting rate (no. of displayed contests per min) and winning frequency. Fighting rate increased with increasing competitor size, and was not affected by mussel density and absolute body size. Winning frequency decreased with increasing competitor size and was not affected by mussel density. Contest duration increased when competitors were size- matched, independent of their absolute body size. Contest duration also increased with decreasing mussel density, suggesting that the value of a mussel item (resource value) increases with decreasing mussel density. Results were tested against predictions from different assessment games and were partly supportive of selfassessment and partly supportive of the mutual assessment game SAM. However, contrary to SAM, crabs engaged in pushing contests where they assessed resource holding power along a continuum, rather than in discrete sequential phases. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Coastal and estuarine systems {{worldwide}} {{suffer from}} a range of anthropogenic influences, such as eutrophication and high fishing pressure. Portunid crabs are abundant in such systems globally and the magnitude of degradation and variations in environmental conditions can influence the dynamics of the fisheries they support. This Thesis investigated two major components relating to portunid crabs: (i) a review and summary of the literature on portunid biology and behaviour and an assessment of how they vary among species and regions (Chapter 2); and (ii) a study of the dietary composition of the Blue Swimmer Crab Portunus armatus and how it varies among two estuaries and a coastal embayment and seasons in temperate south-western Australia (Chapter 3). <b>Portunids</b> are highly fecund, fast growing, short-lived species, with high natural mortalities and are opportunistic predators. These characteristics vary among species, but also between different populations. The dynamics of portunid fisheries are therefore reliant not only on the biology of the fished species but also on the local environmental conditions, through their influence on portunid biology. These factors need to be taken into consideration by fishery managers. The diet of P. armatus is dominated by shelled molluscs, polychaetes and small crustaceans. Dietary composition varied significantly between the Peel-Harvey and Swan-Canning estuaries and three sites (habitats) within Cockburn Sound and this variation was greater in magnitude than the seasonal variation. The diet of crabs in the Peel-Harvey Estuary was distinct from that of crabs in the Swan-Canning Estuary and Cockburn Sound because of greater consumptions of the bivalves A. semen and S. trigonella and fragments of their shells in the former. Differences in the dietary composition follow closely the known variation in the benthic macroinvertebrates assemblages, i. e. the prey availability, between systems and sites. Seasonal variation was greater in the estuaries than Cockburn Sound and is likely caused by greater seasonal changes in the prey availability driven by much greater seasonal fluctuations in salinity in estuaries than in nearby coastal marine waters. Qualitative assessment shows the diet of P. armatus in the Peel-Harvey Estuary has changed since 1994 / 5 and reflects changes in the prey availability driven by anthropogenic modifications to the system. The results from this Thesis provide information on the role of P. armatus in the benthic food webs of these systems and is valuable for the continued Marine Stewardship Council certification of the P. armatus fishery in the Peel-Harvey Estuary and identifying potential functional groups for use in ecosystem models of these three systems...|$|E
40|$|Life {{history and}} {{population}} biology of paddle crabs, Ovalipes catharus were investigated at two South Island localities, Pegasus Bay and Tasman Bay between 1984 and 1986. In Pegasus Bay, crab distributions {{are related to}} moulting and breeding cycles. Males and females aggregate in sheltered bays and harbours during winter and mate {{there at the time}} of the female moult. After moulting, females move to spawning grounds which are probably offshore in deeper water whereas males move to open sandy beaches to feed. Growth rates of captive crabs kept at the Edward Percival Field Station, Kaikoura declined with increasing size as a result of lower moult frequency and percentage moult increment. Three recognizable phases of growth corresponded to juvenile, subadult and adult stages of the life cycle. Variation in individual moult increments resulted in increasing variation around mean instar size in successive juvenile instars. However, after sexual maturity was first attained, variation in instar sizes decreased. A simple population model based on the observed growth patterns of individuals, predicted that 13 instars would be discernible in a natural population. Thirteen post-larval instars were identified by size-frequency analysis of crabs from Pegasus and Tasman Bays. The interpretation of size-frequency data was supported by laboratory growth studies and tag-recapture data. During the first year of life, growth of O. catharus was influenced by the rate of accumulation of day-degrees above 5 °C. Tasman Bay crabs grew faster than those from Pegasus Bay (on average 3 °C cooler) but adults ultimately reached a similar maximum size. Maximum size (130 mm CW for males and 115 mm CW for females) was attained in Pegasus Bay in about 4 years and in Tasman Bay in 3 - 3. 5 years. O. catharus is relatively long-lived and slow growing compared to other warm temperate and tropical <b>portunids</b> but is large and fast growing compared to other species of Ovalipes. In Pegasus Bay, females attained sexual maturity in the year of settlement at a mean size of 65 mm CW as shown by gonad development, evidence of copulation and changes in abdomen shape. The number of eggs per brood was related to female size and ranged between 1 x 105 and 1 x 106 eggs. Two or three broods are likely to be produced per year and up to 9 or 10 in a lifetime. In Tasman Bay, higher water temperature prolonged the breeding season and enhanced growth rates of crabs which in turn resulted in sexual maturity being attained sooner and at a smaller size (mean 50 mm CW). Higher temperature and greater food availability also may have been responsible for enhanced survival of large crabs in Tasman Bay and a predicted increase in number of broods produced annually. The net result of differences in life history traits between the two populations was that reproductive potential of females in Tasman Bay may have been up to three times greater than that in Pegasus Bay...|$|E

40|$|Crabs are {{conspicuous}} {{inhabitants of}} temperate salt marshes and tropical mangroves {{and interact with}} their environment through several processes. However, detailed information on crab community processes is absent for most South African estuaries and nearshore coastal regions. This study evaluated the primary producers supporting crab species in the salt marsh dominated Swartkops estuary and the mangrove Mngazana estuary. Various methods estimating crab abundances were also assessed in different microhabitats and the larval distribution of crabs in the coastal zone was also investigated. Various methods for estimating crab abundance have been employed in the past, each with its inherent biases. The microhabitat of a mangrove forest in Australia was structurally altered by the manipulation of the litter, pneumatophores and the associated algae. These alterations {{did not affect the}} behavioural activity or the numbers of crabs recorded in any of the experimental treatments by either visual counts or pitfall traps. However, the number of crabs caught in the pitfall traps differed between the sites. Species-specific behaviour which was not investigated in this study may bias crab abundance estimates when using pitfall traps and therefore requires further investigation. Benthic consumers inhabiting shallow coastal environments may ultimately have the origin of their nutrition in a number of possible sources. Isotopic and gut content analysis of Thalamita crenata and juvenile Scylla serrata in the Mngazana estuary in South Africa revealed that these two <b>portunids</b> are able to share a habitat by resource partitioning. Differences were noted for species-specific utilization of primary producers not only between seasons within a site, but also between sites. This highlighted the use of locally produced primary producers sustaining food webs in estuaries. Mangrove production in the Mngazana estuary is very important and contributes to most of the carbon in the underlying sediments in the mangrove forest. However, the relatively large number of species and biomass encountered in this estuary may also be attributed {{to the fact that the}} different species are able to exploit of a number of different resources. The variation in stable isotope analysis of the different crab species throughout the estuary indicated that these crabs able to occupy the same habitat by feeding on a number of different resources and may preferentially select for a specific primary producer. A stable isotope of crabs in the salt marsh Swartkops estuary indicated that the dominant primary producer sustaining crab communities may even take place on a relatively smallscale. Sesarma catenata found at the inner marsh site recorded more depleted carbon signatures than those encountered in the other sites approximately 100 m away, and reflected signatures similar to the locally-encountered inner marsh plants. The relatively enriched nitrogen signatures of the anthropogenically-impacted Swartkops estuary is an indication of extensive inputs due to urbanization and industrialization, in contrast to the relatively pristine Mngazana estuary which exhibited low nitrogen signatures. Emphasis has been placed on the abiotic component of the exchange of nutrients and energy, although living organisms may also be transported, both actively and passively, between ecosystems. Little variation in either species composition or abundance was found between seasons for the larval distribution of brachyuran crabs on the east coast of South Africa. Due to the lack of published larval descriptions, larvae could not be identified to species level and it was therefore not possible to identify whether the larvae were hatched or spawned in an estuary or in a marine environment, or whether the larvae originated in the northern tropical regions. Frequent wind-reversals which are common in this region may retain larvae close inshore and supply the southern temperate locations with larvae from the northern locations. In conclusion, this study has shown that in highly productive systems with a number of potential primary producers, the crabs that inhabit the estuary show a marked diversity in resource utilization which could potentially allow a number of closely related species to occupy different trophic levels. This study also highlights the importance of locally produced sources in an estuary, which may occur on very small scales and this needs to be factored in with the design of any future stable isotope studies of this natur...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—New portunoid fossils from {{southern}} Argentina {{and from the}} west coast of North America permit the reevaluation of the generic and family relationships within the Portunoidea Rafinesque, 1815. It has previously been suggested that the Portunidae and the Geryonidae Colosi, 1923, are closely related families (Manning and Holthuis, 1989). The new fossils suggest that the Geryonidae may in fact be derived from a <b>portunid</b> progenitor, Proterocarcinus Feldmann, Casadio, Chirino-Galvez, and Aguirre Urreta, 1995, through a process of peramorphosis in which juveniles of the geryonid species Chaceon peruvianas (d'Orbigny, 1842) resemble adults of Proterocarcinus latus (Glaessner, 1933). Examination of several genera within the <b>portunid</b> subfamily Polybiinae Ortmann, 1893, including Imaizumila Karasawa, 1993; Megokkos new genus; Minohellenus Karasawa, 1990; Pororaria Glaessner, 1980; Portunites Bell, 1858; and Proterocarcinus, suggests that the subfamily had an amphitropical distribution early in its history. New taxa reported here include Megokkos new genus and Portunites nodosus new species. New combinations include Chaceon peruvianus (d'Orbigny...|$|R
40|$|In the Huizache-Caimanero lagoon {{system on}} the Pacific coast of Mexico, data {{concerning}} lagoon hydrography was obtained and qualitative studies were made of the lagoon vegetation, bird fauna, pelagic and benthic fauna. Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei Boone and Penaeus (Litopenaeus stylirostlis Stimpson were the dominant penaeids and, numerically, Lile stolifera (Jordan and Gilbert), Anchoa panamensis (Steindachner) and Mugil curema (Civier and Valenciennes) were the dominant fish species within the lagoon. Two species of <b>portunid</b> crab, Callinectes arcuatus Ordway and Callinectes toxotes Ordway, occurred in the lagoon with the former by far the more abundant. Population densities were generally higher in the "esteros" (estuaries) and canals than in the open lagoons. Postlarval penaeid immigration was maximum in the wet season. Subsequent growth was rapid and estimates of growth rate of up to 0. 4 mm carapace length/day were obtained for P. vannamei. The natural diets of penaeid shrimps and <b>portunid</b> crabs, and the feeding modes of some important fish and bird species are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} egg predators in brood masses of <b>portunid</b> crabs from Pacific Central America {{has not been}} studied yet. This survey reports the finding of a nemertean crab egg predator on the <b>portunid</b> crab, Callinectes arcuatus, from the Golfo de Nicoya, Pacific Costa Rica. Nemerteans {{were found in the}} egg masses of 26 out of the 74 crabs for a prevalence of 35 %. The intensity (mean number of worms/ infected crab) was estimated to be 18 with a variance of 1 – 123 worms/infected crab. No nemerteans were observed either in the 19 C. arcuatus from Golfo Dulce (southern Pacific coast) and the 10 Portunus asper from Herradura-Jaco (central Pacific coast). This nemertean {{is a member of the}} genus Carcinonemertes, which has been reported from the Caribbean coast of Panama. However, the encountered Carcinonemertes sp. is the first published finding and report from Costa Rica and Pacific Central America...|$|R

40|$|A high natural {{mortality}} rate {{has been documented}} for the saucer scallop Amusium balloti, an Australian scallop found on sediment bottoms at 30 – 60 m deep, but {{little is known about}} the causes of mortality. We studied escape responses of A. balloti to five consumers common in the bycatch of the scallop fishery as a means of identifying potential predators. The scallop showed a negligible to weak response when touched with the sea star Pentaceraster regulus and the red <b>portunid</b> crab Portunus rubromarginatus. The response was similar to that observed when the scallop was touched with a plastic object. In contrast, A. balloti showed a consistent and vigorous swimming response to contact with the slipper lobster Thenus orientalis, the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus and the coral crab Charybdis cruciata. This was not a generalized response to crustaceans, given the scallop's weak response to the red <b>portunid</b> crab. This is the first report of a scallop that has a strong swimming escape response to contact with decapod crustacean predators...|$|R
40|$|Gastric mills of 2, 619 {{specimens}} of <b>portunid</b> crabs (Portunus pelagicus, P. sanguinolentus and Charybdis feriatus) in Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong were examined. Of these, 1, 498 contained recognizable food items. A total of 34 food items were identified, 10 of which (29. 4 %) were {{common to the}} three crab species. The principal food items were bivalves, decapods, fish and algae. However, the percent frequency of occurrence of these food items differed significantly (ANOVA, p < 0. 001) among the crabs. In addition to these principal food items, differences were noted in other dietary categories: P. pelagicus and P. sanguinolentus fed on the brittle star Ophiura kinbergi, whereas P sanguinolentus and C. feriatus fed on detritus and gastropods. The diet of P. sanguinolentus {{was found to be}} more similar to C. feriatus than to P. pelagicus. Exploitation of different food items and selective feeding on common prey may reduce inter-specific competition for natural food resources and allow the three <b>portunid</b> crabs to co-exist in the same habitat. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
