40|$|Abstract: Many {{medical and}} assistive devices are {{experienced}} as unpleasant and uncomfortable. On {{top of their}} discomfort, product users may also experience social unease. We label this process “product-related stigma” (PRS). This paper presents two measuring techniques that aim to objectively assess the ‘degree’ of PRS that is ‘attached’ to products. Both experiments focus on the behavioral deviations in the walking path of passers-by during a public and unprepared encounter with a user of a stigma-sensitive <b>product</b> (<b>dust</b> mask). The ‘Dyadic Distance Experiment’ measures exact interpersonal distances, whereas the ‘Stain Dilemma Experiment’ presents the passer-by with a choice in his walking path. Both experimental techniques are predominantly suited as comparison tools, able to compare products on their PRS-eliciting potential. Designers and developers can use these results to justify design decisions with quantitative data, to assess which product properties have influenced certain reactions, {{and to what extent}} subsequent improvements have been successful.

The universal primers specific to cry 1, cry 2, cry 3, and cry 9 genes were used to detect the type of cry gene carried by each environmental isolate of B. thuringiensis strains. In addition, 16 S rRNA based PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was carried out to confirm B. thuringiensis strains. Finally, SDS-PAGE analysis was optimized to detect protein profiles of crystal proteins obtained from B. thuringiensis isolates. It was found that, 136 of 359 isolates showed B. thuringiensis-like colony morphology and subterminal endospore position. One hundred isolates were screened by PCR and 18 of them were found to contain cry genes (5 cry 1, 3 cry 3, and 10 cry 9).

30|$|However, {{the mining}} {{industry}} has been concerned {{about the presence of}} soluble As(III)/As(V) in feed solution, which may affect the chemolithotrophic microorganisms that inhabit the heaps, thereby affecting the overall Cu bioleaching process. Soluble As may be present because it is a “chalcophile element” with a low affinity for oxygen, and preferentially bonding to sulfur to form sulfides (Oremland and Stolz 2003). As-containing MS (e.g., arsenopyrite FeAsS, or enargite Cu 3 AsS 4) are common in Cu-sulfide ore deposits.

This feature {{makes it the}} most widely used biological control agent in agriculture. Since B. thuringiensis strains have great genetic diversity, the toxic behaviours of these strains differ from region to region. Native B. thuringiensis strains are isolated from different habitats and characterized to determine their toxic potential all over the world. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate B. thuringiensis strains from different grain habitats in Central Anatolia and Aegean Regions, and to investigate their phenotypic and genotypic characterizations. Total 96 samples containing soil, grain, stored <b>product</b> <b>dust,</b> straw and various residues were collected from wheat farms, grain silos, haylofts and caves in Ereli/Konya, Takale/Karaman, Nikfer/Denizli, and Bozbük/Söke under aseptic conditions. Seven hundred bacteria were isolated from these samples by sodium acetate selection and heat treatment. For phenotypic characterization, 500 of these isolates were grown for 48 h and crystal protein production was observed by phase contrast microscobe during spore formation. One hundred and sixty three of the bacterial colonies were identified as B. thuringiensis. The isolates were divided into 5 different groups based on the shape of the crystals that they produced. Spherical type crystal morphology was mostly observed type among the others. For genotypic characterization, the cry gene content of the isolates were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. In addition, chromosomal DNA analysis of 34 isolates by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) as well as plasmid DNA profiling for all isolates were also carried out. One hundred and three isolates were positive for 5 different cry genes (cry 1, cry 2, cry 3, cry 4, cry 9) examined by PCR. Among all cry genes examined, cry 1 and cry 9 genes were mostly found in the isolates. Morover, plasmid profiling of the isolates indicated that a 15 kb DNA band was present in all the isolates; however, some of them had more than one DNA band at different sizes. Finally, chromosomal DNA profiling by PFGE showed different DNA patterns for isolates containing the same cry gene which suggest a high level of diversity among the B. thuringiensis strains isolated. Further studies related with extensive genetic characterization and toxic activity of each B. thuringiensis strain will give more comprehensive results on biodiversity of B. thuringiensis strains in Anatolia...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} use of chemical dust suppressants such as water, salts, asphalt emulsion, vegetable oils, molasses, synthetic polymers, mulches, and lignin <b>products.</b> <b>Dust</b> suppressants abate dust by changing the physical properties of the soil surface and are typically used on construction sites, unpaved roads, and mining activities. The use of chemical dust suppressants has increased dramatically due to rapid population growth and increased emphasis on the need to control particulates in the interest of air quality. In the United States, there are over 2, 500, 000 km of public unpaved roads, of which 25 % (625, 000 km) are treated with chemical dust suppressants. A critical problem in the arid southwestern U. S. is dust suppression on land disturbed for residential construction. Recognizing {{that it is important to}} achieve and maintain clean air, the concern that prompted this report is that application of dust suppressants to improve air quality could potentially have other adverse environmental impacts. Times Beach, Missouri is a classic example where the resolution of dust emissions from unpaved roads leads to the creation of a Superfund site. In 1972 and 1973 waste oil contaminated dioxin was sprayed on unpaved roads and vacant lots for dust control in Times Beach. After realizing the adverse situation that had occurred, the costs to relocate the residents and clean up the site was over $ 80 million. Much more stringent regulations are now in place to avoid another Times Beach; however, there is still concern over the use of dust suppressants since most <b>products</b> used as <b>dust</b> suppressants are by-products and their exact composition is unknown.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about {{occupational}} risk factors for meningioma. OBJECTIVES: To study whether risk of meningioma is associated with several occupational exposures, including selected combustion <b>products,</b> <b>dusts</b> and other chemical agents. METHODS: The INTEROCC study was an international case-control study of brain cancer conducted in seven countries. Data collection by interview included lifetime occupational histories. A job exposure matrix was used to derive estimates of exposure for the 12 agents. ORs for ever versus never exposed and for exposure-response using duration of exposure and cumulative exposure were derived using conditional logistic regression stratified by sex, age group, country/region, adjusted for education. RESULTS: These analyses included 1906 cases and 5565 controls. For 11 of the 12 agents, no excess risk was found for ever exposed. For ever exposure to oil mists, an elevated OR of 1. 57 (95 % CI 1. 10 to 2. 22, 51 exposed cases) was found. Statistically significant exposure-response relationships were observed with cumulative exposure (p= 0. 01) and duration of exposure (p= 0. 04). Among women, there were also significant trends for cumulative and duration of exposure to asbestos and excesses in the highest exposure categories for formaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: Most agents examined did not provoke excess risks of meningioma. The main finding from {{this study is that}} it is the first study to identify a statistical association between exposure to oil mists and meningioma. This may be a chance finding or could be due to confounding with iron exposure and further research is required to understand whether the relationship is causal.
