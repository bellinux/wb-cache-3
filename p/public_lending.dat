Stretford's first <b>public</b> <b>lending</b> library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.|$|E

Of the total invested in Argentina between 1912 and 1975, 23% took place during Frondizi's four years. In 1962, Argentina was richer in terms of GDP per capita than Austria, Italy, Japan and its former colonial master Spain.|$|E

WGGB made strong protests when crowd violence halted performances of Behzti by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti at the Birmingham repertory theatre in December 2004, and subsequently revived its Anti-Censorship Committee. WGGB {{makes a point of}} highlighting the importance of writing for children in all media. It co-operates closely with other unions including Equity, the Musicians' Union and the Society of Authors; and is affiliated to the British Copyright Council, Creators' Rights Alliance, Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and other pressure groups.

25|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1959 as the Television and Screen Writers' Guild (commonly known as the Screen Writers' Guild), the {{successor}} to the Screenwriters' Association dating back to 1938. During the 1960s it expanded to cover radio and book writers and adopted its present title in 1966. It sponsored the campaigns of the Writers' Action Group to establish the <b>Public</b> <b>Lending</b> Right and the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society which – starting from a single room in the Writers' Guild premises – has collected and distributed over £100 million in payments to writers for photocopying and overseas retransmission of broadcasts. WGGB also hosts the annual Writers' Guild Awards. In 1997 WGGB merged with the Theatre Writers Union, and membership now stands at around 2,400. Presidents, Chairs and leading activists of WGGB have included: Lord (Ted) Willis, Jimmy Perry, Bryan Forbes, Denis Norden, Maureen Duffy, Alan Plater, Rosemary Anne Sisson, Wally K.

The facility, which is open six days a week, has a <b>public</b> <b>lending</b> library and cafe with free Wi-Fi access, IT suites and conference facilities. The office space is used by Cullompton Adult Community Learning which was previously based at the local secondary school.

2500|$|Blainey {{was invited}} by Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967 {{to sit on}} the {{advisory}} board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, serving until its abolition in 1973 (chairman 1971–73). He then became inaugural chairman of the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts (Later called Australia Council), set up by the Whitlam government. He served on the Council from 1977–1981. Following Whitlam's election promise to introduce a <b>Public</b> <b>Lending</b> Right Scheme for authors, Blainey was appointed chairman of the committee representing authors, publishers and librarians that, in 1973, recommended the scheme adopted by the government a year later. Australia's scheme differed from the pioneering scheme adopted in Denmark in 1946. Blainey represented writers on the small group instructed to find the new national anthem that Whitlam had promised. From that initiative came a public poll supporting the long-standing Australian patriotic song, [...] "Advance Australia Fair".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, the new elect Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said, {{that it was}} {{absolutely}} possible for Bulgaria to join ERM-II before the term of the current government ends in 2018, {{and that he would}} begin talks with the Eurogroup to map what sort of preparations the state should undertake to qualify for membership. The former governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, , in office when the currency board of the state was established, believes the euro should be adopted in January 2018, because this would [...] "trigger a number of positive economic effects": Sufficient money supply (leading to increased lending which is needed to improve economic growth), getting rid of the currency board which prevents the national bank functioning as a lender of last resort to rescue banks in financial troubles, and finally private and <b>public</b> <b>lending</b> would benefit from lower interest rates (at least half as high). The former deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, , agreed with Paramov, stating {{that it was possible to}} adopt the euro already in 2018, and [...] "Bulgaria’s membership in the eurozone will bring only positive effect on the economy" [...] because [...] "since establishing the currency board in 1997, we have been accepting all the negative effects of accession into the eurozone without getting the positive ones (access to the European financial market)".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1940s {{assemblies}} in Egypt {{had been}} extended into Suez, Tanta and Sohag. During this period of growth pioneers went beyond the Middle East to Scotland. A <b>public</b> <b>lending</b> library was established in Cairo to satisfy inquires being made but anti-Bahá'í pamphlets were published and posted in Tanta instigating violence and individuals in other cities were actually attacked. Opposition began to reach out from Egypt in the form of article in an Egyptian Daily newspaper circulated in the United States published a story subtitled [...] "Necessity of a Moslem Cultural Center in America to Inform the Americans of the True Moslem Cult." [...] And attacks in Tanta escalated to the point that a government official publicly addressed the summoned ringleaders saying [...] "Your evil deeds have shown you to be far removed from the teachings of Islám for Islám is a religion of peace" [...] and made them sign a statement of good behavior. In May 1948 Shoghi Effendi announced goals for the Egyptian Bahá'í community evolving increasing the number of assemblies, smaller groups of Bahá'ís, and purchases of lands. A number of events and incidents brought the religion to the awareness of diverse audiences. There were formal representations from the Egyptian Bahá'í community to the government, invitations to Egyptian leaders and random incidents and in the public media. There were specific developments in the community in 1951. An assembly was established in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, and it was announced that the Egyptian Government had given recognition to Bahá'í marriages. At this time women were allowed to be and were elected according to the rules of Bahá'í administration to local assemblies in Cairo, Alexandria, and Port Said, (indeed some were elected officers in 1952.) Also publishing Bahá'í material resumed which had been curtailed for a time. And a wave of pioneers left Egypt in 1951 for North and Central Africa (see Bahá'í Faith in Uganda for a start.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{to which}} extent public banks feature a different pattern in their lending behaviour over macroeconomic fluctuations. Based on a unique dataset from 1990 to 2010, including at most 459 public banks in 93 countries, I can handle ownership change by including records on privatisations {{as well as}} nationalisations during banking crisis, which would otherwise blur the picture. I find that (i) <b>public</b> bank <b>lending</b> is significantly less cyclical than that of private banks, (ii) public banks cut less on their loans during economic downturns, with a positive relation between economic development {{and their ability to}} absorb macro shocks, and (iii) privatised banks switch from a regime of low to high lending cyclicality. Then, the lower co-movement of public bank loans with macroeconomic fluctuations reveals both (a) a less vulnerable balance sheet structure and more stable financing sources, which is consistent with a lending relationship business model, (b) as well as delayed loan deterioration, which is a symptom of forbearance and inefficient loan management; the actual combination of the two is not orthogonal to economic development, with high income countries more likely to feature efficient <b>public</b> bank <b>lending</b> cyclicality, while evidences suggest it may reveal an inefficient credit allocation for less developed countries...|$|R
