40|$|We {{separate}} equity issuance <b>proceeds</b> {{into two}} parts: option <b>proceeds</b> generated by {{employee stock option}} exercises and non-option <b>proceeds</b> engendered by all other forms of equity issues. We document that over the period 1998 - 2013, the aggregate amount of option <b>proceeds</b> exceeds that of non-option <b>proceeds</b> for a large sample of U. S. firms. In particular, firms allocate option <b>proceeds</b> predominantly to cash holdings, followed by investment and equity repurchase, while non-option <b>proceeds</b> are mainly allocated to investment and cash holdings. Further analysis shows that financial constraints affect the allocation of equity issuance <b>proceeds</b> by shifting the use of option <b>proceeds</b> away from stock repurchases to investment and cash savings, while directing non-option <b>proceeds</b> away from investment to cash savings...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Proceeds</b> of Crime Acts were amended {{further by}} the <b>Proceeds</b> of Crime (Amendment) Act, 2016. The <b>Proceeds</b> of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 is {{designed}} to facilitate the seizure of property which is suspected to be the <b>proceeds</b> of crime by expanding {{the powers of the}} Criminal Assets Bureau to seize those <b>proceeds.</b> This act amends the <b>Proceeds</b> of Crime Act 1996 in two key respects. First, it allows the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize property which it suspects to be the <b>proceeds</b> of crime for up to 21 days. Second, it reduces the threshold value of property which can be pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau from €13,000 to €5,000.|$|R
