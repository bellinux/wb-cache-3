Hot stamping tools have significant influence on the final microstructure and properties of <b>the</b> hot stamped <b>parts.</b> <b>In</b> serials production, <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> should be rapidly cooled by cooling water.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of a machine}} <b>tool</b> is <b>the</b> limiting factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{accuracy of}} finished <b>parts.</b> Errors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machine <b>tool</b> motion produce a one-to-one error correspondence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final workpiece. These errors in motion are caused by geometric errors of the structural elements and by thermally-induced errors caused by the machining process itself. It is impossible to completely eliminate errors by design and/or manufacturing modifications. Even a small geometric error of one machine element will be amplified at <b>the</b> cutting <b>tool</b> by <b>the</b> long travel ranges of the slides and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> offsets. Mechanical design cannot eliminate thermally-induced errors because of continuous heat generation by drive motors, friction in slideways, spindle and leadscrew bearings and the cutting tool-workpiece interface. ^ Rather than attempting to eliminate errors, this study provides a methodology for predicting errors and compensating for them in real-time, thus improving the accuracy of machined workpieces. A general mathematical model is developed, determining the total error at <b>the</b> cutting <b>tool</b> tip contributed by the errors of each machine elements and their thermally-induced variations. Homogeneous coordinate transformations for each element of <b>the</b> machine <b>tool</b> are employed. In order to predict each error component, a methodology for <b>the</b> machine <b>tool</b> error calibration is determined.

40|$|For {{some time}} now, the {{learning}} {{community has been}} exited {{at the prospect of}} developing learner-centered solutions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, training methods have used large, monolithic, inflexible training courses, which take up a lot of resources. The solution to this problem is to divide the courses into smaller components that again can be put together to new courses. The idea is that with proper descriptions, these smaller components can be stored, retrieved and reused in new courses. These components are what we call learning objects, and the descriptions of the learning objects are the metadata. Several standards for this metadata have been developed. The current standards and specifications of learning object metadata have been criticized for being too comprehensive and failing to describe the pedagogical content of the learning object. Studies have shown that only 50 %- 67 % of <b>the</b> potential elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standards are populated, and especially the pedagogical elements are not used. When {{only a few of the}} potential elements are used, and many of them not correctly, problems with retrieving and reusing the learning objects arise. This thesis tries to improve the pedagogical descriptions of learning objects by describing them with design patterns. If the learning objects were described with design patterns, the elements will be fewer, they will emphasize on the pedagogical content, and contain the information that most users search for. Describing learning objects with design patterns will probably make the creating of metadata easier for the creator of the learning object, but more difficult for another person. The learning object pattern consists of seven main elements, Name, Learning object type, Context, Problem, Solution, Limitations and Example usage, where the solution is the learning object, and the problem is the problem that the learning object is going to solve. Several learning objects have been described during the work, and one of the findings is that some of the elements should be created before the learning part is created. This is because it is unnatural to construct the problem after the solution, i. e. the learning object, is created. Ideas for an editor for metadata, based on the findings of the work with describing learning objects, are presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third <b>part.</b> It has to be assumed that the creators of the learning objects will continue to create <b>the</b> learning <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same <b>tools</b> as before. Therefore there is a need for an editor to create the metadata belonging to the learning objects. The editor that is described lets the user create <b>the</b> metadata <b>in</b> several steps, and use his own <b>tool</b> to create <b>the</b> learning parts. The work with finding a good way to describe <b>the</b> pedagogical content <b>in</b> learning objects has just started, and if describing learning objects with design patterns should succeed, there are several things that have to be done. More types of learning objects have to be described, and the element set of the learning object should be revised and extended with more elements. It should be developed a method for searching <b>in</b> freetext <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metadata, and an editor that supports the way of creating metadata that design patterns demands needs to be implemented. It also remains a great deal of work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of creating metadata automatically. </p...|$|R

40|$|Human {{standing}} posture {{is inherently}} unstable. The postural control system (PCS), which maintains standing posture, {{is composed of}} the sensory, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems. Together these systems integrate sensory afferents and generate appropriate motor efferents to adjust posture. The PCS maintains the body center of mass (COM) {{with respect to the}} base of support while constantly resisting destabilizing forces from internal and external perturbations. To assess the human PCS, postural sway during quiet standing or in response to external perturbation have frequently been examined descriptively. Minimal work has been done to understand and quantify the robustness of the PCS to perturbations. Further, there have been some previous attempts to assess the dynamical systems aspects of the PCS or time evolutionary properties of postural sway. However those techniques can only provide summary information about the PCS characteristics; they cannot provide specific information about or recreate the actual sway behavior. This dissertation consists of two parts: part I, the development of two novel methods to assess the human PCS and, part II, the application of these methods. In study 1, a systematic method for analyzing the human PCS during perturbed stance was developed. A mild impulsive perturbation that subjects can easily experience in their daily lives was used. A measure of robustness of the PCS, 1 /MaxSens that was based on the inverse of the sensitivity of the system, was introduced. 1 /MaxSens successfully quantified the reduced robustness to external perturbations due to age-related degradation of <b>the</b> PCS. <b>In</b> study 2, a stochastic model was used to better understand <b>the</b> human PCS <b>in</b> terms of dynamical systems aspect. This methodology also has the advantage over previous methods <b>in</b> that <b>the</b> sway behavior is captured in a model {{that can be used to}} recreate the random oscillatory properties of the PCS. The invariant density which describes the long-term stationary behavior of the center of pressure (COP) was computed from a Markov chain model that was applied to postural sway data during quiet stance. In order to validate the Invariant Density Analysis (IDA), we applied the technique to COP data from different age groups. We found that older adults swayed farther from <b>the</b> centroid and <b>in</b> more stochastic and random manner than young adults. <b>In</b> <b>part</b> II, <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> developed <b>in</b> <b>part</b> I were applied to both occupational and clinical situations. In study 3, 1 /MaxSens and IDA were applied to a population of firefighters to investigate the effects of air bottle configuration (weight and size) and vision on the postural stability of firefighters. We found that both air bottle weight and loss of vision, but not size of air bottle, significantly decreased balance performance and increased fall risk. In study 4, IDA was applied to data collected on 444 community-dwelling elderly adults from the MOBILIZE Boston Study. Four out of five IDA parameters were able to successfully differentiate recurrent fallers from non-fallers, while only five out of 30 more common descriptive and stochastic COP measures could distinguish the two groups. Fall history and the IDA parameter of entropy were found to be significant risk factors for falls. This research proposed a new measure for the PCS robustness (1 /MaxSens) and a new technique for quantifying the dynamical systems aspect of the PCS (IDA). These new PCS analysis techniques provide easy and effective ways to assess <b>the</b> PCS <b>in</b> occupational and clinical environments...|$|R
