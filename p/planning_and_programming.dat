2500|$|Historians {{of machine}} tools, {{even before the}} {{numerical}} control era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines {{because they have the}} ability to [...] "reproduce themselves" [...] by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for RepRaps, which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such non-autonomous [...] "self-replication". In contrast, machines that are truly autonomously self-replicating (like biological machines) are the main subject discussed here.|$|E
