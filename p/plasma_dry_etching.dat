These layers are selectively etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized gas, or <b>plasma.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>etching</b> can combine chemical etching with physical etching, or ion bombardment of the material. Surface micromachining can involve as many layers as is needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use dozens of layers, approaching 100. Micromachining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers.
