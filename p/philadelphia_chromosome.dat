In this study, we established a Ph + ALL cell line, DPAL, {{which had the}} wild-type version of BCR/ABL, and a T 315 I mutant Ph + ALL cell line, DPAL/T 315 I, from one clinical course. At diagnosis, this patient had double <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with some additional chromosomal abnormalities, but no point mutation in BCR/ABL. After combination treatment of imatinib with chemotherapy, the T 315 I mutation appeared, and the DPAL/T 315 I cell line also had double <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosomes</b> without additional chromosomal abnormalities. This result suggested that some heterogeneous populations of BCR/ABL mutants exist in Ph + ALL at diagnosis. Imatinib combined treatment might be only select the dominancy of mutant gene. Our established cell line, DPAL/T 315 I had severe resistance to imatinib and 2 nd tyrosine kinase, dasatinib, though, chloroquine combined treatment with imatinib or the HDAC inhibitor, SAHA induced cell death in DPAL/T 315 I cells in vitro.

25|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{defect in}} the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome</b> is a translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to {{a part of the}} BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome,</b> 22q-). In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein.|$|E

40|$|Intracellular {{processing}} {{of the products}} of the bcr-abl junction region in CML <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosomes</b> would generate novel peptides which, if they are capable of binding to HLA-class I molecules, would be potential targets of a cytotoxic T cell response.

Two peptides derived from the b 3 -a 2 junction bound to HLA-A 3 and elicited detectable specific CTL responses in vitro. The binding affinity of one of the two peptides could be increased by appropriate substitutions of the anchor residues with those of the known HLA-A 3 anchor motifs. More important, the modified peptide had increased capacity to prime a specific CTL response in vitro. The interaction with HLA-A 3 of these two peptides and their substitution derivatives seems to be promising for target trials aimed at eliciting a specific CD 8 T cell response against CML...|$|R
25|$|CMML shows {{characteristics}} of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); a disorder that produces abnormal looking blood cells, and a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD); a disorder characterised by the overproduction of blood cells. For this reason CMML was reclassified as a MDS/MPN overlap disorder in 2002. For a diagnosis of CMML, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the blood monocyte count must be >1x109/L, no <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome</b> or mutations in the PDGFRA or PDGFRB gene should be present, the blast count must be <20% and dysplasia {{of at least one}} lineage of myeloid blood cell should be present.|$|E
25|$|CML {{is often}} {{divided into three}} phases based on {{clinical}} characteristics and laboratory findings. In the absence of intervention, CML typically begins in the chronic phase, and {{over the course of}} several years progresses to an accelerated phase and ultimately to a blast crisis. Blast crisis is the terminal phase of CML and clinically behaves like an acute leukemia. Drug treatment will usually stop this progression if started early. One of the drivers of the progression from chronic phase through acceleration and blast crisis is the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (in addition to the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome).</b> Some patients may already be in the accelerated phase or blast crisis by the time they are diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|CML {{is often}} {{suspected}} {{on the basis}} of a complete blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction. A bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML, and CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and the BCR gene in chromosome 22. As a result of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than its homologue chromosome, and this appearance is known as the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome</b> chromosomal abnormality. Thus, this abnormality can be detected by routine cytogenetics, and the involved genes BCR-ABL1 can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization, as well as by PCR.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) {{are the most}} common leukemias of the elderly. However, the sequential occurrence of CML followed by CLL in the same patient is extremely rare.

25|$|The {{presence}} of this translocation is a highly sensitive test for CML, since 95% of people with CML have this abnormality (the remainder have either a cryptic translocation that is invisible on G-banded chromosome preparations, or a variant translocation involving another chromosome or chromosomes {{as well as the}} long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22). However, the {{presence of}} the <b>Philadelphia</b> (Ph) <b>chromosome</b> is not sufficiently specific to diagnose CML, since it is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 2530% in adult and 210% in pediatric cases) and occasionally in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).|$|R

25|$|In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, hydroxyurea), alkylating agents, {{interferon}} alfa 2b, and steroids {{were used as}} treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s {{have been replaced by}} Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase fusion protein caused by the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome</b> translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.|$|E
25|$|Chronic myelogenous (or myeloid or myelocytic) leukemia (CML), {{also known}} as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), is a cancer of the white blood cells. It {{is a form of}} leukemia {{characterized}} by the increased and unregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome.</b> CML is now largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since the introduction of the first such agent in 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15â25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).|$|E
25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome,</b> a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|E

However, the {{presence of}} the <b>Philadelphia</b> (Ph) <b>chromosome</b> is not sufficiently specific to diagnose CML, since it is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 25 - 30% in adult and 2 - 10% in pediatric cases) and occasionally in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).|$|R
25|$|There is {{a diverse}} {{classification}} scheme {{for the various}} genomic changes that {{may contribute to the}} generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>chromosome,</b> or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.|$|E
