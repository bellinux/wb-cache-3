60|$|Godwin and Wulf {{stared at}} the weather-worn sculptures, and {{in the silence of}} that moonlit place there arose in their minds a vision of the mighty armies of {{different}} tongues and peoples who had stood in their <b>pride</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> road and looked upon yonder river and the great stone wolf that guarded it, which wolf, so said the legend, howled at the approach of foes. But now he howled no more, for he lay headless beneath the waters, and there he lies to this day. Well, they were dead, everyone of them, and even their deeds were forgotten; and oh! how small the thought of it made them feel, these two young men bent upon a desperate quest in a strange and dangerous land. Masouda read what was passing in their hearts, and as they came to the brink of the river, pointed to the bubbles that chased each other towards the sea, bursting and forming again before their eyes.|$|E

[...] Phil Leotardo meets with Tony and asks {{what he is doing}} about finding Vito. Tony tells him he will take care of it his own way. This elicits a warning from Phil that he will not swallow his <b>pride</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue like he did when Tony Blundetto killed his brother Billy. Phil tells Tony that if his father [...] "Johnny Boy" [...] Soprano was around, there wouldn't be any discussion about Vito's fate. Phil then reiterates that Vito shamed his family by betraying his wife, Phil's cousin, and his young children. Tony responds by walking away in a huff.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of rural areas, {{as a possibility}} to spend the vacation has increased in recent years, in most countries. Changes in attitudes were parallel with changes in European styles to taking the holidays, but also in preferences to return to nature, and various local products.

5000|$|According to Marshal Richelieu's memoirs, {{published}} by Abbot Soulavie in 1790, {{the daughter of}} Regent Philippe d’Orléans supposedly heard from her father that the prisoner was Louis XIV‘s twin-brother, the legitimate heir to the throne. These revelations were not taken seriously as Soulavie also asserts that to obtain this confidence, this girl {{is thought to have}} given favours to her father, which Pagnol disputes: Soulavie was writing during the Revolution and tried to appeal to the lower classes by denouncing the ignominy of the [...] "tyrants" [...] of the Monarchy. Besides, {{it is hard to believe}} the Regent was guilty of incest, he who had a great number of mistresses, and his daughter would have certainly not have <b>prided</b> herself <b>on</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R

50|$|As a hotel, the Berystede has <b>prided</b> itself <b>on</b> recreating <b>this</b> house-party {{atmosphere}} for its Ascot Week guests, and named two rooms after racing events: the Hyperion Restaurant takes {{its name from}} the famous Derby winner who sired more champions than any horse before him. When he died in 1960, he had sired the winners of 748 races. The bar is named after the Diadem Stakes, a 6 furlong sprint first held at Ascot in October 1946, the first year, incidentally, in which a meeting other than the Royal Meeting had been held.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} mixed {{entities}} were formed, called instituti or enti nazionali, whose purpose {{it was to}} bring together representatives {{of the government and}} of the major businesses. These representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business. The government considered this arrangement to be a success, and Italian Fascists soon began to <b>pride</b> themselves <b>on</b> <b>this</b> outcome, saying they had survived the Great Depression without infringing on private property. In 1934, the Fascist Minister of Agriculture said: [...] "While nearly everywhere else private property was bearing the major burdens and suffering from the hardest blows of the depression, in Italy, thanks to the actions of this Fascist government, private property not only has been saved, but has also been strengthened." ...|$|R

He had proposed the route along the canal because nobody {{would be likely}} to recognize them, and her <b>pride</b> resented <b>this.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, there was the sweet allurement of the adventure she craved, which indeed she had come out to seek and by a strange fatality found--since he had appeared on the bridge almost as soon as she reached it. The sense of fate was strong upon her. Curiosity urged her, and, thanks to the eulogy she had read of him that day, to the added impression of his power conveyed by the trip through the mills, Ditmar loomed larger than ever in her consciousness.|$|R
