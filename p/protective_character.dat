500|$|Both Isis and Nephthys {{were seen}} as protectors of the dead in the afterlife because of their {{protection}} and restoration of Osiris's body. The motif of Isis and Nephthys protecting Osiris or the mummy of the deceased person was very common in funerary art.

As Horus's mother, Isis was also the mother of every king according to royal ideology, and kings {{were said to have}} nursed at her breast as a symbol of their divine legitimacy. Her appeal to the general populace was based in her <b>protective</b> <b>character,</b> as exemplified by the magical healing spells. In the Late Period, she was credited with ever greater magical power, and her maternal devotion was believed to extend to everyone. By Roman times she had become the most important goddess in Egypt. The image of the goddess holding her child was used prominently in her worship—for example, in panel paintings that were used in household shrines dedicated to her. Isis's iconography in these paintings closely resembles and may have influenced the earliest Christian icons of Mary holding Jesus.|$|E
6000|$|Those birds {{which are}} {{inhabitants}} of tropical forests, and which need recognition marks that shall {{be at all}} times visible among the dense foliage, and not solely or chiefly during flight, have usually small but brilliant patches of colour on the head or neck, often not interfering with the generally <b>protective</b> <b>character</b> of their plumage. Such are the bright patches of blue, red, or yellow, by which the usually green Eastern barbets are distinguished; and similar bright patches of colour characterise the separate species of small green fruit-doves. To this necessity for specialisation in colour, by which each bird may easily recognise its kind, is probably due that marvellous variety in the peculiar beauties of some groups of birds. The Duke of Argyll, speaking of the humming birds, made the objection that [...] "A crest of topaz is no better {{in the struggle for}} existence than a crest of sapphire. A frill ending in spangles of the emerald is no better in the battle of life than a frill ending in spangles of the ruby. A tail is not affected for the purposes of flight, whether its marginal or its central feathers are decorated with white;" [...] and he goes on to urge that mere beauty and variety for their own sake are the only causes of these differences. But, on the principles here suggested, the divergence itself is useful, and must have been produced pari passu with the structural differences on which the differentiation of species depends; and thus we have explained the curious fact that prominent differences of colour often distinguish species otherwise very closely allied to each other.|$|E

40|$|Specific {{understanding}} of root anatomy plasticity under salt stress is lacking and requires creation of efficient screening techniques for stress condition s. To fill this gap, this study aimed {{to determine the}} anatomical plasticity in root chracteristics of 31 different rice cultivars (from ‘Best’ to ‘Low’ yielding) grown under real field conditions (saline and non-saline) from planting to harvesting and to reveal detailed root anatomical parameters {{that can be used}} to select and breed salt-tolerant rice. Anatomical and histochemical features of all cultivars and thin structures of the apoplastic barriers were investigated. The amount of silica (Si), 35 different anatomical characteristics, anatomical plasticity characteristics, plasticity rates, plasticity trends and changes and strategies of each group under saline and non-saline conditions were compared. The results showed that <b>protective</b> anatomical <b>characters</b> improved/remained equal to, and worsened/remained equal to those of the controls, in the ‘Best’ and other groups, respectively, from non-saline to saline conditions. Anatomical plasticity is essentially directly related to apoplastic barrier features. High genotypic variation was observed in root anatomy in all cultivars, but foremost traits were as follows: (1) cell size, (2) Si presence, (3) Si accumulation shape, (4) Si distribution towards root stele, (5) xylem arch features, (6) lignification-suberization properties in apoplastic barriers and their degrees, (7) presence/absence of idioblast cells filled with gummic and phenolic substances and (8) moderate anatomical plasticity.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of forest protective function has been {{divided into four}} main branches according to {{the different types of}} instability phenomena (landslide events, erosion, floods, avalanches). This paper presents the first module related to landslide events and will be followed by others. Two opposing factors have been considered: instability tendency of a selected land unit and protective function of the vegetation. While the first factor tends to promote landslide events, the second one opposes their occurrence. An expert {{evaluation of}} these aspects allows us to derive some qualitative indexes. For each territorial unit, these indexes express the protection value of vegetation, the degree of management restrictions and suitable improvements to the forest cover. Both propension and <b>protective</b> functional <b>character</b> are influenced by many and different parameters which require multidisciplinary competences to correctly evaluate them. Such skills are not easily found in technicians in charge of forest management. The present paper aims to provide a decision making support tool; based on neural network models, it should be able to interpret and simulate the expert knowledge, extending to the &# 34;standard&# 34; forest technician the opportunity to perform such a kind of evaluation. The neural network training required the identification and characterization of explanatory variables related to both aspects, and the subsequent expert definition of the respective datasets of real classification examples. The descriptive variables were chosen considering the information availability and its compatibility with GIS techniques as well. Model performances have been validated by testing the whole procedure in two sites situated in Antrona valley (Piemonte) and Acqualagna (Marche). The results are discussed in detail and put in evidence a good accordance with both field survey and general conceptual assumptions. Future developments will involve similar analysis and modelling applied to other instability categories. An overall index for the protective function of the forest cover will also be produced...|$|R

Examination of the paper insulation and copper stress braiding during stripdown of a number of Current Transformers (FMK type 400 kV) has revealed the presence of dark deposits. Copper foils are often interspersed within layers of paper insulation and mineral oil found in transformer windings.

40|$|Many organisms vary {{their level}} of {{investment}} in defensive <b>characters.</b> <b>Protective</b> traits may be induced upon exposure to predators or parasites. In a similar way, humans vaccinate in response to threatening epidemics. When most group members defend themselves, epidemics die out quickly because parasites cannot spread. A high level of group (herd) immunity is therefore beneficial to the group. There is, however, a well-known divergence between the optimum degree of induction for selfish individuals {{and the level of}} induction that maximizes group benefit. I develop two optimality models for the frequency of induction. The first model shows that higher relatedness favours more induction and a smaller difference between selfish and cooperative optima. The second model assumes variation in the vigour of individuals and therefore differences in the relative cost for induction. The model predicts that strong individuals induce more easily than weak individuals. Small differences in vigour cause a large divergence in the optimal levels of induction for strong and weak individuals.

40|$|International audienceSilica-based {{coatings}} {{are well}} known for their high performance in terms of mechanical, tribological, and electrochemical properties. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the <b>protective</b> <b>character</b> of SiOx coatings deposited on M 2 tool steel. Coatings were deposited by r. f. plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition using tetraethoxysilane as precursor. Surface chemical and morphological characterization of coatings was carried out by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Atomic Force and Transmission Electron Microscopies, while emerging porosity was evaluated electrochemically. Intrinsic electrical behaviour of the film was determined by electrochemical measurements performed in Hg-pool. The corrosion protective properties of deposited films were assessed by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy in aerated NaCl solution. Amorphous SiOx films provide excellent corrosion protection of steel, which is explained, on the one hand, by a tiny porosity rate, and on the other hand, by intrinsic insulating properties of the coating. This barrier effect avoids any galvanic coupling deleterious to the uncoated metallic surface, and is correlated with the SiO 2 -like character of the film...|$|E

Thermodynamic analyses, weight changes, and microstructural characterization were correlated with environmental parameters and alloy composition to elucidate the causes of its marked resistance to carburization. The results indicate <b>protective</b> <b>character</b> in both gas mixtures under all exposure conditions except the most aggressive, namely 1100 degrees C in 10 % CH 4 /H- 2 gas mixture. Below 1000 degrees C, the formation of Cr, Al, and Si oxides along with Cr carbides provides the primary means of protection...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is used {{to analyse}} variations during exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) in the chemical composition of the outer surface of organic coatings (lacquers) containing phosphating or chromating reagents applied on galvanised steel, galvanneal and galfan substrates. By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements the <b>protective</b> <b>character</b> of the coatings analysed by XPS is studied and an attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the chemical composition of {{the surface of the}} lacquered substrates after exposure to the UVCON test and their electrochemical characterisation in immersion in a 3 % NaCl solution. In general, the formation of defects or the loss of adhesion of the lacquer film leads to a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance values and, at the same time, an increase in interfacial capacitance values. The special behaviour of the galfan/lacquer >with chromating reagents> system is associated with the presence of a thin insulating film of chromium and aluminium oxides {{at the base of the}} pores in the lacquer. Interfacial capacitance values tend to evolve in close correspondence with the content of some elements on the surface of the materials. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
