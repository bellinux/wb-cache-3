The insertion of the speckle suppressor in an X-ray beam allows {{manipulation of the}} spatial coherence length, thus changing the effective source size and removing the undesirable speckle structure in X-ray imaging experiments almost without beam attenuation. The absorption of the nanoberyllium plate is below 1 % for 1 mm thickness at 12 keV. The speckle suppressor was tested on the ID 06 ESRF beamline with X-rays in the energy range from 9 to 15 keV. It was applied for {{the transformation of the}} <b>phase-amplitude</b> <b>contrast</b> to the pure amplitude contrast in full-field microscop...|$|E
40|$|Accurately {{measuring}} the neural correlates of consciousness {{is a grand}} challenge for neuroscience. Despite theoretical advances, developing reliable brain measures to track the loss of reportable consciousness during sedation is hampered by significant individual variability in susceptibility to anaesthetics. We addressed this challenge using high-density electroencephalography to characterise changes in brain networks during propofol sedation. Assessments of spectral connectivity networks before, during and after sedation were combined with measurements of behavioural responsiveness and drug concentrations in blood. Strikingly, we found that participants who had weaker alpha band networks at baseline {{were more likely to}} become unresponsive during sedation, despite registering similar levels of drug in blood. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>phase-amplitude</b> coupling between slow and alpha oscillations correlated with drug concentrations in blood. Our findings highlight novel markers that prognosticate individual differences in susceptibility to propofol and track drug exposure. These advances could inform accurate drug titration and brain state monitoring during anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It was first {{available}} from PLOS via [URL] data are electroencephalograms of electrical brain activity recorded in 20 healthy participants who were given the sedative propofol. For each participant, there are 4 datasets each with approximately 7 minutes of 91 -channel EEG at rest, recorded at baseline, during mild sedation, moderate sedation, and finally at recovery. The EEG data have been filtered between 0. 5 - 45 Hz, segmented into 10 -second epochs, cleaned and preprocessed to remove artefact, and referenced to the average of all channels. The datasets are in EEGLAB format. For each dataset, there is an entry in the MATLAB table stored in the file datainfo. mat included. This entry specifies, in order: 1) the name of the dataset 2) the level of sedation at which the dataset was acquired (1 = baseline, 2 = mild sedation, 3 = moderate sedation, 4 = recovery) 3) the concentration of propofol measured in blood plasma at that level (in microgram/litre) 4) the average reaction times measured in a speeded two-choice response task administered at that level (in milliseconds) 5) the number of correct responses in that task (out of a max of 40) Accurately measuring the neural correlates of consciousness is a grand challenge for neuroscience.
