5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company.

Schooley developing the first refrigerated <b>packing</b> <b>room.</b> Fruit began to be stored in the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, ice was being used to allow the brewing of the increasingly popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E
