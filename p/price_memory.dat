40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} stability {{conditions for}} wholesale electricity markets under real-time retail pricing and realistic consumption models with memory, which explicitly {{take into account}} previous electricity prices and consumption levels. By passing on the current retail price of electricity from supplier to consumer and feeding the observed consumption back to the supplier, a closed-loop dynamical system for electricity prices and consumption arises whose stability is to be investigated. Under mild assumptions on the generation cost of electricity and consumers' backlog disutility functions, we show that, for consumer models with <b>price</b> <b>memory</b> only, market stability is achieved if the ratio between the consumers' marginal backlog disutility and the suppliers' marginal cost of supply remains below a fixed threshold. Further, consumer models with price and consumption memory can result in greater stability regions and faster convergence to the equilibrium compared to models with <b>price</b> <b>memory</b> alone, if consumption deviations from nominal demand are adequately penalized.

Consumers code and store prices verbally, visually, {{and in terms}} of their magnitude. The encoding used influences immediate recall performance. The memorability of prices depends on their verbal length, usualness and overall magnitude. They find that the performance of consumers recall prices better than what previous digit span studies with simple numbers have suggested. consumer behavior; numerical cognition; <b>price</b> <b>memory...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of the synchronous {{dynamic random access memory}} (SDRAM) has gone beyond the scope of personal computers for quite a long time. It comes into hand whenever a big amount of low price and still high speed memory is needed. Most of the newly developed stand alone embedded devices in the field of image, video and sound processing take more and more use of it. The big amount of low <b>price</b> <b>memory</b> has its trade off – the speed. In order to take use of the full potential of the memory, an efficient controller is needed. Efficient stands for maximum random accesses to the memory both for reading and writing and less area after implementation. This paper proposes a target device independent DDR SDRAM pipelined controller and provides performance comparison with available solutions.

40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{is defined}} as a process of {{contracting}} products, services, and works with the least possible damage to the environment during their life cycle. In order to improve the knowledge about GPP, a study of the use of environmental tendering criteria in the Spanish public construction sector has been performed. The results of this study show that the use of environmental criteria in Spanish public sector construction procurement is low in comparison to a certain group of countries, known as “Green 7 ”, in the European Union. Environmental criteria is the fourth criterion in importance, but its weight in the global of the process is much lower than other criteria such as <b>price,</b> <b>memory</b> of the construction process and the delivery time. National administrations use environmental criteria more frequently because they have more resources and staff training about environmental issues. Environmental criteria are more used in the tendering of civil projects and works whose budget exceeds ten million euro due to the environmental impact of these kind and/or size of projects...|$|E

Pricing is a subject which has received significant academic attention. The topic of B 2 B pricing, however, is less explored. Our aim for this special issue is to gather a series of empirical and conceptual papers which confirm, challenge, and extend our understanding of price management in the B 2 B and industrial areas. Recommended topic areas to consider for inclusion in this special issue include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Pricing strategies and tactics in B 2 B: what is “strategic”, what is “tactical ” in B 2 B price management? 2.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are {{becoming}} a necessity for practicing pharmacists. They offer a time-saving and convenient way to obtain current drug information. Several software companies now offer general drug information databases for use on handheld computers. PDAs priced less than $ 200 often have limited memory capacity; therefore, the user must choose from {{a growing list of}} general drug information database options in order to maximize utility without exceeding memory capacity. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the attributes of available general drug informa-tion software databases for the PDA. It provides information on the content, advantages, limitations, <b>pricing,</b> <b>memory</b> requirements, and accessibility of drug information software databases. SUMMARY: Ten drug information databases were subjectively analyzed and eval-uated based on information from the product’s Web site, vendor Web sites, and from our experience.

We apply our method to a dataset of online <b>prices</b> for <b>memory</b> chips and find that the search cost density is essentially bimodal, such that a large fraction of consumers searches very little, whereas a smaller fraction searches a relatively large number of stores.
