40|$|Bibliography: pages 174 - 182. This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} machine vision grading of flue-cured Virginia tobacco {{by means of}} digital processing of tobacco leaf images. With reference to international grading standards and to modem image processing techniques, two classifiers are designed. The colour classifier uses seven features extracted from each leaf image to grade the leaf into one of five official colour classes. It does this with an expected correct classification rate of 93. 5 %. The plant position classifier identifies the <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> from which a leaf was reaped, using ten size and shape features to classify the leaf into one of six plant position categories. It has a correct classification rate of 70 %. Average colours for each colour class and archetypal shapes for each plant position category are derived from the digital leaf data. These should be of value to tobacco graders as objective representations of typical leaves within each class...|$|E

The morphology of the cement apparatus and of the polymerized cement of this species is almost unknown. The current study aims at filling these gaps in our knowledge using light and electron microscopy as well as x-ray microtomography. The shape of the cement gland cells changes from round to ovoid during barnacle development. The cytoplasm of the gland cells, unlike that of some other barnacles, does not have distinct secretory and storage regions. The cement canals, which transport the cement from the gland cells to the base of <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> end at different positions in juvenile and mature animals. With increasing size of the cement float, the exit of the cement canals shift from the centrally positioned attachment disk of the vestigial antennules to more lateral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> <b>The</b> bubbles enclosed in the foam-like float are most likely filled with CO 2 that diffuses from the hemolymph into the cement canal system and from there into the cement...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{into account}} that Oriental tobacco is of {{national}} importance {{since it is the}} main export agricultural product and may utilize low fertility soils, which are unproductive for other crops, this study was conducted in order to investigate the maturation and senescence of tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum L.) under field conditions and to evaluate the effects of plant growth regulators (ethephon, JA, AOA, AVG and BA) on maturation process and on yield, quality and chemical characteristics of Oriental tobacco, aromatic type, variety BZ 7. The experimentation was carried out in the farm of the Tobacco Institute of Greece (T. I. G.) in 2001 and in Vamvakofyto in Serres, North Greece in 2002 and 2003. The maturation and senescence processes of tobacco leaves were studied in 2002 and 2003. In addition, the effect of ripening degree of leaves at harvest on agronomic, physical and chemical characteristics of cured leaf product was investigated, {{in order to determine the}} optimum harvesting period and the harvest date windows for tobacco leaves. The “harvest window” is that period in days when tobacco leaves should be harvested in order to assure good cured leaf quality and chemical composition after curing. Twelve sequential samplings of leaves at the accurately same age and <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> (stalk position) were carried out every second day throughout the whole period of leaf development, maturing and senescence. All samplings were replicated 4 times. Leaves exhibited a climacteric-like surge in ethylene production before visible symptoms of senescence appear which was accompanied by a similar pattern of respiration rate and can be considered as a crucial and critical stage of senescence. The leaf maturity stage was followed by the stage of senescence that can be divided into two phases: The Stage I, the initial stage or the onset of senescence and the Stage II, in which the climacteric maximum of ethylene production and respiratory rate and the acceleration of senescence processes are occurred. The subsequent rise of ethylene production appears to be associated with the rapid phase of senescence and may indicate the final stage of the senescence processes. The Stage I lasts 4 days and is characterized by an increase of ethylene evolution, reducing sugars, nicotine, ash content and decrease in chlorophyll, total protein, starch and nitrate concentration. The results suggested that changes in nitrate concentration may provide a simple test for the initiation of harvest. The sap nitrate test can be used as an indicator of maturity. Nitrate determined by a commercial available field test. Sap nitrate concentration in the fully expanded bottom leaves should be less than 0, 9 - 1 % at the commencement of harvesting for optimal yield and quality. The effects of plant growth regulators (ethephon, JA, AVG and BA) on the control of maturation and senescence of tobacco leaves were studied in 2002. Six sequential samplings and measurements of leaves at the accurately same age and <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> (stalk position) were carried out every second day throughout the whole period after the application of the above plant growth regulators (leaf development, mature and senescence). All samplings were replicated 4 times. The foliar application of ethephon and JA promoted and the AVG and BA delayed the physiological and biochemical processes of senescence. ...|$|E
