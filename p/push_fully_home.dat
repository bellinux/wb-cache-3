It was subsequently upgraded in stages to 1500 hp (1,150 kW), allowing a designed speed of 41 knots (76 km/h). The 5M-2500 introduced in late 1945 had a larger supercharger, aftercooler, and increased power output of 1850 hp. It could <b>push</b> <b>fully</b> loaded boats at 45 to 50 knots (51-57 mph). However, subsequent additions of weaponry offset this potential increase in top speed.|$|R

Loaded rounds or empty cases from the chamber eject straight up when the lever is <b>pushed</b> <b>fully</b> open (forward). When Connors cycled the action by spinning the rifle to his side, the cartridge in the action could fall out. Therefore, the rifle was modified with a plunger, which would hold the round in place.|$|R

60|$|The {{door was}} <b>pushed</b> <b>fully</b> open now {{and a woman}} entered, {{at the sight of}} whom Arnold forgot all his {{feelings}} of mingled annoyance and amusement. She was of little over the medium height, exceedingly slim--a slimness which was accentuated by the fashion of the gown she wore. Her face was absolutely devoid of color, but her features were almost cameo-like in their sensitive perfection. Her eyes were large and soft and brown, her hair a Titian red, worn low and without ornament. Her dress was of pale blue satin, which somehow had the effect of being made in a single piece, without seam or joining. Her neck and throat, exquisitely white, were bare except for a single necklace of pearls which reached almost to her knees. The look in Arnold's face, as she came slowly into the room, was one of frank and boyish admiration. The woman came towards him with a soft smile about her lips, but she was evidently puzzled. It was Mr. Weatherley who spoke. There was something almost triumphant in his manner.|$|R

500|$|The {{second volume}} of the manga was {{positively}} reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: [...] "With its second volume the title <b>pushes</b> <b>fully</b> {{into the realm of}} romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back." [...] In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, [...] "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." [...] In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, [...] "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little yuri series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking." ...|$|R
