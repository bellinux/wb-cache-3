The mayor's statutory <b>planning</b> <b>strategy</b> is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).|$|E

The hypothesis was that the students that describe a low degree of metacognitive knowledge and <b>planning</b> <b>strategies</b> used in the process of writing, show low levels of academic success. A comparative and descriptive research design was used with 462 students selected intentionally from two psychology programs (231 Colombian and 231 French students with average age of 18. 8 and 20. 1 years old respectively). These students completed a questionnaire composed by two scales: Metacognitive Knowledge and <b>Planning</b> <b>Strategies</b> in Writing. It was found that the students acknowledged their metacognitive knowledge used when developing their written texts.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to great SNAP-Ed implementation, skilled session <b>planning</b> <b>strategies</b> can be used to effectively engage learners in a low-tech, yet highly interactive classroom. Furthermore, content adaptation during implementation was relevant to connect participant immediate needs with program objectives/ goals. Considerations for program planning are explored...|$|R
