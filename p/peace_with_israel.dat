25|$|Fresh {{political}} differences between Libya and Egypt appeared in 1995. Gaddafi criticized Egyptian {{efforts to promote}} economic relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and said that Egypt was {{not doing enough to}} support removal of sanctions against Libya. In the second half of 1995, Libya again expelled Egyptian workers, and also began expelling 30,000 Palestinian workers in retaliation for the P.L.O. making <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Palestinian Authority {{applied for}} {{admission}} as a United Nations non-member state, which requires only a {{vote by the}} United Nations General Assembly. Hamas also backed the motion. The draft resolution was passed on November 29, 2012 {{by a vote of}} 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions. Regardless of the UN recognition, as of this writing, no Palestinian state exists except on a symbolic level. Israel indicated that an actual, real-world Palestinian state can only come into existence if Palestinians succeed in negotiating <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b>|$|E
25|$|From its {{inception}} in 2002, the Initiative deeply divided the organization. As stated before, members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, committed the Passover Massacre on same day as the peace Initiative's adoption. At that time, Hamas rejected not only <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> but even negotiations with it. The official administration of Hamas never recognized the Initiative, which alienated it {{from members of the}} Arab League, especially Jordan and Egypt. One of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' conditions of forming a national coalition government with Hamas after the 2006 election was that Hamas had to recognize the Initiative, but he was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{the leader}} of Egypt, was a {{significant}} player {{in the rise of}} Arab nationalism. Opposed to the British control of the Suez Canal Zone and concerned at Egypt becoming a Cold War battleground Nasser pushed for a collective Arab security pact {{within the framework of the}} Arab League. A key aspect of this was the need for economic aid that was not dependent on <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> and the establishment of U.S. or British military bases within Arab countries. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and directly challenged the dominance of the Western powers in the region. At the same time he opened Egypt up as a Cold War zone by receiving aid and arms shipments from the Soviet bloc countries that were not dependent on treaties, bases and peace accords. However, because of the connotations for Cold War dominance of the region, Egypt also received aid from the U.S.A., who sought to promote the emerging Arab nationalism as a barrier to communism.|$|E
25|$|In September 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter invited President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to {{meet with}} him at Camp David, and on 11 September they agreed on a {{framework}} for peace between Israel and Egypt, and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank–Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy for the Palestinians residing in these territories, and for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was Taba, adjacent to Eilat, returned in 1989. The Arab League reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic fundamentalist members of the Egyptian army who opposed <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b> Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest recipients of U.S. military and financial aid (Iraq and Afghanistan have now overtaken them).|$|E
25|$|A {{second round}} of secret {{diplomacy}} by Anderson in February 1956 was equally unsuccessful. Nasser sometimes suggested during his talks with Anderson that {{he was interested in}} <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> if only the Americans would supply him with unlimited quantities of military and economic aid. In case of Israeli acceptance to the return of the Palestinian refugees to Israel and to Egypt annexing the southern half of Israel, Egypt would not accept a peace settlement. The United States or the United Nations would have to present the Israeli acceptance to all Arabs as a basis for peace settlements. It is not clear if Nasser was sincerely interested in peace, or just merely saying what the Americans wanted to hear in the hope of obtaining American funding for the Aswan high dam and American weapons. The truth will likely never be known as Nasser was an intensely secretive man, who managed to hide his true opinions on most issues from both contemporaries and historians. However, the British historian P. J. Vatikitos noted that Nasser's determination to promote Egypt as the world's foremost anti-Zionist state as a way of reinforcing his claim to Arab leadership meant that peace was unlikely.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, in January 1968, Nasser {{commenced}} the War of Attrition {{to reclaim}} territory captured by Israel, ordering attacks against Israeli positions {{east of the}} then-blockaded Suez Canal. In March, Nasser offered Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement arms and funds after their performance against Israeli forces in the Battle of Karameh that month. He also advised Arafat to think of <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> {{and the establishment of}} a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nasser effectively ceded his leadership of the [...] "Palestine issue" [...] to Arafat.|$|E
500|$|Nasser made secret {{contacts}} with Israel in 1954–55, but determined that <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> would be impossible, considering it an [...] "expansionist state that viewed the Arabs with disdain". On 28 February 1955, Israeli troops attacked the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip with the stated aim of suppressing Palestinian fedayeen raids. Nasser {{did not feel}} that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and did not retaliate militarily. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted a blow to his growing popularity. Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the blockade on Israeli shipping through the Straits of Tiran and restricted the use of airspace over the Gulf of Aqaba by Israeli aircraft in early September. The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September.|$|E
500|$|Following Nasser's {{death in}} 1970, Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar {{as a symbol}} of Egyptian {{leadership}} throughout the Arab world, saying that [...] "the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar." [...] Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions. As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ulema of al-Azhar continued {{to be used as a}} tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including Islamist and other more moderate groups. Shukri Mustafa, an influential Islamist figure, accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience. When Sadat needed support for making <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel,</b> which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.|$|E

When shooting erupted in nearby sectors, they would return to their respective positions. Initially, the Egyptians would fire if it was nighttime, but the Israelis held their fire, and soon the Egyptians stopped firing as well. Soon, the commandos and paratroopers would meet daily, drinking coffee, playing backgammon and soccer, getting to personally know each other, and occasionally holding a kumzits, with the Egyptians slaughtering a sheep and the Israelis presenting food parcels sent from home. The example set by the Egyptians and Israelis here was soon emulated in other sectors, and even Sharon came to see for himself the [...] "local armistice" [...] that had taken place. At one point, two officers came with Ali to meet with Shamir and said they hoped relations between Egypt and Israel would come to match the relations between Shamir's and Ali's men.|$|E

2500|$|The King disliked paperwork, {{and had no}} solid {{view for}} the economy.

He was also seen as too lenient toward some ministers who were alleged to be corrupt. The price of establishing <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> he had to pay domestically, with mounting Jordanian opposition to Israel concentrating its criticism on the King.
