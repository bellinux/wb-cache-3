40|$|Abstract—Digital image tamper {{detection}} {{technology is a}} hot topic in recent decades which has widely applications in image processing. Study of key approach of digital image temper detection has important science and application value. A CFA interpolation based image blur {{tamper detection}} algorithm is proposed in this paper. First we reconstruct the tamper image by CFA interpolation artifacts. Then we filter the reconstructed image by Wiener filter and calculate the related degree between the tampering image and the image to be detected. Finally we classify the degree of correlation feature and locate the tampered area. Experimental result shows that the algorithm can effectively detect and locate tampering area of the image been operated by blur tampering {{and it has a}} good robustness. The algorithm can accurately locate the image of tampering falsification area and the detection accuracy is significantly better than existing algorithms and can be well <b>positioned</b> <b>image</b> tampering area. Keywords- blur tamper detection; reconstructed; Wiener filter; the degree of correlation. I...|$|E
30|$|At present, many indoor mobile robots are {{required}} to deliver objects to designated destinations {{in a variety of}} environments. When indoor mobile robot is positioned autonomously, it requires high real-time visual localization, but the accuracy of image recognition is not high. Therefore, many scholars have carried out a series of research on improving the real-time performance of SUFT algorithm. Document [9] proposed an improved feature descriptor, RIBRIEF, to improve the overall real-time performance of the algorithm by combining descriptor index with descriptor clustering, based on fast stable feature point extraction and logical computation similarity. The experimental results show that compared with descriptor BRIEF and SURF algorithm, the image matching algorithm based on RIBRIEF has obvious advantages in robust real-time performance. At the same time, some researchers put forward that [10] can improve the real-time localization by changing the dimension of feature points and achieved good results. In addition, studies have also shown that [11] <b>positioned</b> <b>image</b> shape and image size have a greater impact on the real-time positioning.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{real-time}} performance of visual positioning of the indoor mobile robot, {{the researchers found that}} the shape and size of the <b>positioned</b> <b>image</b> have a great influence on the real-time performance of the positioning calculation. In order to verify the conclusion and find the appropriate image shape and size to meet the robot’s visual positioning requirements, this paper adopts four different shapes, such as quadrilateral and circular, and uses SURF algorithm to extract and recognize the features of the image. The effect of image shape and size on real-time localization is studied from two aspects: the localization of different shape models under the same size by the visual robot and the localization of the different shape models by the visual robot. It is found that the accuracy and real time of positioning squares and circles are higher than the accuracy and real time of positioning triangles and hexagons under the same size. And when the image size ratio is between 40 and 60 % of the original image, the change of the number of feature points is relatively stable and the number of feature points is moderate. It can improve the real-time performance of mobile robot vision localization under the premise of a certain positioning accuracy.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to prospectively evaluate fast PET/CT imaging protocols using lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) detector technology and 3 -dimensional (3 D) image-acquisition protocols. Methods: Fifty-seven consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age, 58. 6 15. 7 y) {{were enrolled in the}} study. After intra-venous injection of 7. 77 MBq (0. 21 mCi) of 18 F-FDG per kilogram, a standard whole-body CT study (80 – 110 s) and PET emission scan were acquired for 4 min/bed position in 49 patients and 3 min/bed position in 8 patients. One-minute-per-bed-position data were then extracted from the 3 - or 4 -min/bed position scans to reconstruct single-minute/bed position scans for each patient. Pa-tients were subgrouped according to weight as follows: 59 kg (130 lb; n 15), 59 – 81 kg (130 – 179 lb; n 33), and 82 kg (180 lb; n 9). Three experienced observers recorded numbers and locations of lesion by consensus and independently rated image quality as good, moderate, poor, or nondiagnostic. Results: The observers analyzed 220 reconstructed whole-body PET im-ages from 57 patients. They identified 114 lesions ranging in size from 0. 7 to 7. 0 cm on the 3 - (n 8) and 4 -min/bed <b>position</b> <b>images</b> (n 49). Of these, only 4 were missed on the 1 -min/bed position scans, and all lesions were identified on the corresponding 2 -min/ bed <b>position</b> <b>images.</b> One- and 2 -min/bed <b>position</b> <b>image</b> quality differed significantly from the 4 -min/bed <b>position</b> <b>image</b> reference (P 0. 05). Conclusion: LSO PET detector technology permits fast 3 D imaging protocols whereby weight-based emission scan dura-tions ranging from 1 to 3 min/bed position provide similar lesion detectability when compared with 4 -min/bed <b>position</b> <b>images.</b> Key Words: lutetium oxyorthosilicate; PET/CT; molecular imagin...|$|R

40|$|Seismic interferometry(SI) is {{a proven}} {{data-driven}} redatuming method to create virtual sources for better illumination {{of the target}} area. It requires a physical receiver at {{the position of the}} created virtual source. With the development of the itera-tive Marchenko method, one can now use surface data alone to create a virtual source in the subsurface, but an estimate of the direct wavefield from those virtual source positions to the surface is needed, which means an adequately accurate smooth velocity model is nevertherless necessary. We show that when borehole data from a horizontal well is available, one can com-bine the principles of SI and the Marchenko method to formu-late several inversion-based redatuming schemes, such that no prior smooth velocity model is needed at all and that the ex-act forms of retrieving the reflection responses from above and from below can also be obtained. Furthermore, the internal multiples are accounted for using these exact forms. No sur-rounding acquisition geometry is required or multi-component well data is needed. We demonstrate the proposed schemes us-ing a synthetic gas cloud example. We then show the retrieved responses and the migrated images using only a local velocity model. The results show that given the same velocity uncer-tainty, these responses that are redatumed by data produce a better <b>positioned</b> <b>image</b> near the well than a surface seismic image. The proposed schemes can be beneficial for deep bore-holes and complex areas with big velocity uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems with image processing of petrographic thin sections is that the appearance (colour I intensity) of a mineral grain will vary with {{the orientation of the}} crystal lattice to the preferred direction of the polarizing filters on a petrographic microscope. This makes it very difficult to determine grain boundaries, grain orientation and mineral species from a single captured image. To overcome this problem, the Rotating Polarizer Stage was used to replace the fixed polarizer and analyzer on a standard petrographic microscope. The Rotating Polarizer Stage rotates the polarizers while the thin section remains stationary, allowing for better data gathering possibilities. Instead of capturing a single image of a thin section, six composite data sets are created by rotating the polarizers through 900 (or 1800 if quartz c-axes measurements need to be taken) in both plane and cross polarized light. The composite data sets can be viewed as separate images and consist of the average intensity image, the maximum intensity image, the minimum intensity <b>image,</b> the maximum <b>position</b> <b>image,</b> the minimum <b>position</b> <b>image</b> and the gradient image. The overall strategy used by the image processing system is to gather the composite data sets, determine the grain boundaries using the gradient image, classify the different mineral species present using the minimum and maximum intensity images and then perform measurements of grain shape and, where possible, partial crystallographic orientation using the maximum intensity and maximum <b>position</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — There is {{an analogy}} between single-chip color cameras {{and the human}} visual system in that these two systems acquire only one limited {{wavelength}} sensitivity band per spatial location. We have exploited this analogy, defining a model that characterizes a one-color per spatial <b>position</b> <b>image</b> as a coding into luminance and chrominance of the corresponding three-colors per spatial <b>position</b> <b>image.</b> Luminance is defined with full spatial resolution while chrominance contains sub-sampled opponent colors. Moreover, luminance and chrominance follow a particular arrangement in the Fourier domain, allowing for demosaicing by spatial frequency filtering. This model shows that visual artifacts after demosaicing are due to aliasing between luminance and chrominance and could be solved using a pre-processing filter. This approach also gives new insights for the representation of single-color pe r spatial location images and enables formal and controllable procedures to design demosaicing algorithms that perform well compared to concurrent approaches, as demonstrated by experiments...|$|R
