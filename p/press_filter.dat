25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|E
25|$|In the {{compression}} zone of a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter,</b> the filter cake is compressed {{between the two}} belts and passed over rollers to exert pressure on the cake. There is an optimum number of rollers above which a drier product {{is not necessarily the}} result. Drier product is obtained from reduced belt speed rather than increased pressing time.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{developments}} in belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> technology include: cloth developments, using three belts and, the V-fold belt. Cloth {{developments in}}clude the double weave which incorporates different yarn types {{to combine the}} specific advantages of each. A double weave woven wire belt is also available which has a better life span and durability than a conventional wire belt.|$|E
25|$|The {{filter cake}} usually {{has a high}} enough solid {{concentration}} to allow {{for all types of}} disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other dewatering processes.|$|E
25|$|The feed to a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> {{depends on}} the type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids {{concentration}} is typically in the range of 1-10%. The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%. Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.|$|E

50|$|Many debates {{have been}} {{discussed}} {{about whether or not}} <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> are sufficient to compete with modern equipment currently {{as well as in the}} future, since <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> were among one of the oldest machine-driven dewatering devices. Efficiency improvements are possible in many applications where modern <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have the best characteristics for the job, however, despite the fact that many mechanical improvements have been made, <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> still remain to operate on the same concept as when first invented. A lack of progress in efficiency improvement as well as a lack of research on conquering associated issues surrounding <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have suggested a possibility of performance inadequacy. At the same time, many other types of filter could do the same or better job as <b>press</b> <b>filters.</b> In certain cases, it is crucial to compare characteristics and performances.|$|R
25|$|Belt <b>press</b> <b>filters</b> are {{designed}} for solids capacity, by weight or volume, rather than wastewater flow. Solids concentration must be determined based on the concentration of primary solids in the feed and further solids that may precipitate during treatment. Solids concentration for a process will vary, thus the design must {{have the capacity to}} deal with varying feed solids concentration.|$|R
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt <b>press</b> <b>filter,</b> for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{input to}} a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
40|$|Dirt {{collected}} with sugarcane {{is processed}} and {{separated from the}} juice in the sugar factory by filtration equipment for return to the cane fields. New technologies {{over the past decade}} have enabled performance improvements to be obtained for this key unit operation. Filter mud product still contains a reasonable amount of sugar and the transportation of high moisture mud product has considerable cost. Australia’s traditional approach has been to use Rotary Vacuum Filters for processing and separating mud and other impurities from juice, but in recent years there has been interest in reducing sugar losses and transportation costs through utilisation of new technologies such as Horizontal Bed <b>Filters,</b> Vacuum Belt <b>Press</b> <b>Filters,</b> Membrane <b>Press</b> <b>Filters</b> and Centrifuges. Increasingly, these alternative equipment are being installed in new factories.

40|$|Abstract. Hydrometallurgy is {{a popular}} {{metallurgical}} technology. <b>Filter</b> <b>press</b> is common but vital {{to the production of}} hydrometallurgy. Hence, the process monitoring of <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is of great significance for hydrometallurgy. Due to data analysis and related knowledge of <b>filter</b> <b>press,</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to process monitoring of the <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> via two traditional statistics. However, modeling and test data collected from actual production suffers from outliers, missing data, inconsistent sampling period between variables. Based on these practical problems, corresponding data proceeding technique is proposed. The final application simulation illustrates the validity of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>presses</b> offer a {{wide range}} of application, one of its main propositions is the ability to provide a large filter area in a {{relatively}} small footmark. Surface area available {{is one of the most}} important dimensions in any filtering process, since it maximises filter flow rate and capacity. A standard size <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> offers a <b>filter</b> area of 216 m2, whereas a standard belt filter only offers approximately 15 m2.|$|R
2500|$|A belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> {{using three}} belts can achieve {{independent}} speeds and have different belt types for {{the pressure and}} gravity zones. This allows the filter system to accommodate higher hydraulic loadings occurring with dilute feed sludge (feed solid concentration below 1.5%). [...] The three belt system is more efficient with both a higher production rate and cake solid concentration {{at the expense of}} mechanical complexity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> is often assessed {{based on the}} dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt. Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery {{is dependent on the}} filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote dewatering but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> has an effective belt washing section so that blinding does not decrease the permeability of the belt. Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry solids content {{is a measure of the}} degree of dewatering. The degree of dewatering is increased when the belt speed is decreased. Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Belt {{filters are}} very {{versatile}} and {{are made to}} suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, volatile emissions, pathogens and hazardous gases like hydrogen sulphide the belt filter can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing. [...] Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the belt filter process can also be automated. Large filtration areas, additional rollers and a variable belt speed {{can be found in}} advanced belt <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> designs.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} cake handling, batch <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> {{requires}} large discharge tray size {{in order to}} contain large amount of cake and the system is more expensive compared to continuous <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> with the same output.|$|R
2500|$|The {{belt filter}} (sometimes called a belt <b>press</b> <b>filter,</b> or belt filter press) is an {{industrial}} machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the dewatering of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. Belt filter presses {{are also used}} {{in the production of}} apple juice, cider and winemaking. The process of filtration is primarily obtained by passing a pair of filtering cloths and belts through a system of rollers. [...] The system takes a sludge or slurry as a feed, and separates it into a filtrate and a solid cake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Molten {{aluminium}} alloy is so active that it an easily chemically react with O 2 and H 2 O to form Al 2 O 3 inclusions and H during melting practice. However, some other inclusions form by process. Under turbulent flow conditions, the inclusions are distributed unevenly in molten {{aluminium alloy}}. They may associate with crack {{or by the}} location of crack initiation in solidified casting. Castings containing these inclusions will probably exhibit poor ductility or toughness. Therefore, the purification of the molten aluminium alloy {{is one of the}} most important processes for improving the quality of Al-products. The inclusions in molten secondary AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 cast alloy (without refining or modification; grain refined with 55 ppm AlTi 5 B 1 and modified with 20, 40 and 60 ppm AlSr 10) were removed using depth filtration by ceramic foam and <b>pressed</b> <b>filter.</b> The results showed that the mechanical properties through filtration changes. Ductility and UTS of the filtered tensile specimens increases. The better mechanical properties were measured by the using of <b>pressed</b> ceramic <b>filter.</b> Highest UTS and ductility was observed for samples modified with 40 ppm of Sr. Filtration with ceramic filters have very significant influence on the porosity decreasing; in the process the better effect has a <b>pressed</b> <b>filter.</b> In samples modified with 60 ppm of Sr were observed effect of over modification (mechanical properties decreased; porosity increased) ...|$|R
