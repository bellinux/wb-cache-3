50|$|The {{alternative}} is to elect out of the installment method. In that case, the seller reports the fixed amounts (taking original issue discount into account for future fixed payments) plus the fair {{market value of the}} right to contingent payments. The taxpayer pays tax up front in the year of the sale on this total amount realized. The taxpayer then has a basis in the right to contingent payments equal to the amount reported as fair market value. The good news here is that the seller gets <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of the open transaction doctrine, and may fully recover basis in the contingent piece of the sale before reporting any additional contingent payments in future years. Where the profit ratio would have been high anyway and the fair market value of the contingent payments are low, the taxpayer may experience favorable consequences by effectively <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> tax up front and in return getting the first crop of contingent payments tax-free, while eliminating the risk of an unusable future capital loss.|$|R

60|$|I read J. H. A. Macdonald's {{speech with}} interest; his sentiments are quite good, I think. I would support him against M'Laren at once. What has disgusted me most as yet about this {{election}} is the detestable proposal {{to do away with}} the income tax. Is there no shame about the easy classes? Will those who have nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of the advantage of our society, never consent to pay a single tax unless it is to be paid also by those who have to bear the burthen and heat of the day, with almost none of the reward? And the selfishness here is detestable, because it is so deliberate. A man may not feel poverty very keenly and may live a quiet self-pleasing life in pure thoughtlessness; but it is quite another matter when he knows thoroughly what the issues are, and yet wails pitiably because he is asked to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more,</b> even if it does fall hardly sometimes, than those who get almost none of the benefit.

60|$|It {{does not}} matter where you look or what {{examples}} you select, {{you will see that}} every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for himself, and everywhere to-day the man, or the public body, who wishes to put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of wealth and upon every form of industry. A portion, in some cases the whole, of every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket. If there is a rise in wages, rents are able to move forward, because the workers can afford to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more.</b> If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway, or the institution of an improved service of workmen's trains, or a lowering of fares, or a new invention, or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live, and therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, {{one on top of the}} other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.|$|E

A man's minor actions and arrangements ought to be free, flexible, creative; the things that should be unchangeable are his principles, his ideals.

Now, I should like men to have strong and rooted conceptions, but as for their lunch, let them have it sometimes in the garden, sometimes in bed, sometimes on the roof, sometimes {{in the top of}} a tree. Let them argue from the same first principles, but let them do it in a bed, or a boat, or a balloon.

In his first interview after climategate Phil Jones admitted that the early 20 th warming was as large as the late 20 th century warming.

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{external}} costs of transport is widely {{studied in the}} scientific literature and policy makers are showing a growing awareness on this problem. One of the main tools used to control the social costs of transport and reduce welfare losses associated to externalities is that of internalisation via tariffs: road pricing, carbon taxes, dedicated taxes, etc. Actually, many taxes on transport already exist, but seldom have an explicit internalisation purpose. In this paper we compare current road transport perceived marginal costs in Italy with social ones. Starting from {{the literature on the}} topic, in the analytical part of the paper we present the case of Italy and quantify the current level of external costs and taxation. Then we compare unit taxes with marginal transport social costs, with particular respect to different driving contexts. Results show that gasoline passengers cars always perceive the external costs they generate more than any other vehicle category. In urban contexts external costs are still not rightly perceived, with the exception of recent gasoline cars only and excluding congestion. Outside urban contexts, the perceived share is considerably higher. Estimates also suggest that a distortion exists with respect to the gap between highway tolls and infrastructure damage costs in Italy: trucks <b>pay</b> only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than marginal infrastructure costs they generate, so that only cars are actually paying for new investments...|$|R
