40|$|Bradycardia {{and rarely}} cardiac arrest as a {{complication}} of cervical spine injury due to reduced sympathetic activity is well known, which usually settles down in 4 – 6  weeks of injury. There are few case reports in literature of high cervical {{spinal cord injury}} requiring permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> due to this complication, but an injury as low as cervico-dorsal junction requiring permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> has never been reported. A 47 -year-old male suffered traumatic C 7 –D 1 dislocation and continued to have severe bradycardia with multiple episodes of cardiac arrest till 2  months after injury, which finally warranted permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> as a life saving measure. Following permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> no <b>cardiac</b> arrest occurred and the patient was successfully rehabilitated. The case directs our attention to a rare complication of cardiac arrest occurring in an injury as low as cervico-dorsal junction when all other causes are ruled out and shows importance of using permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> to ensure patient safety in community...|$|R

Herein, we report a multicenter experience on the feasibility and safety of acute retrieval (6 weeks) of the leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> in humans. This study included patients enrolled in 3 multicenter trials, who received a leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> implant and who subsequently underwent a device removal attempt. The overall leadless pacemaker retrieval success rate was 94 %: for patients whose leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> had been implanted for 6 months before the retrieval attempt. There were no procedure-related adverse events at 30 days post retrieval procedure. This multicenter experience demonstrated the feasibility and safety of retrieving a chronically implanted single-chamber (right ventricle) active fixation leadless pacemaker.

40|$|SUMMARY As {{pacemaker}} electrode myocardial {{contact area}} is reduced, the energy required {{to stimulate the}} heart decreases; but the effect of surface area on an electrode's ability to transmit R-wave potentials has not been well documented. Endocardial and intramyo-cardial R-wave potentials were measured in ten dogs with seven com-mercially available pacemaker electrodes of different surface area. With a load impedance of 1000 ohms, there was a direct correlation between surface area and the R-wave potentials measured. The WHEN USED with ventricular programmed (ventricular inhibited or triggered) <b>pacemakers,</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> leads serve two equally critical functions. They transmit an elec-trical stimulus from the power source (pacemaker) to the heart in order to initiate muscle contraction, and they transmit ventricular depolarization impulses from the heart to the pacemaker. Research, to date, has been primaril...|$|R

40|$|Batteries used in Implantable cardiac pacemakers-present unique {{challenges}} to their developers and manufacturers {{in terms of}} high levels of safety and reliability. In addition, the batteries must have longevity to avoid frequent replacements. Technological advances in leads/electrodes have reduced energy requirements by two orders of magnitude. Microelectronics advances sharply reduce internal current drain concurrently decreasing size and increasing functionality, reliability, and longevity. It is reported that about 600, 000 pacemakers are implanted each year worldwide and {{the total number of}} people with various types of implanted pacemaker has already crossed 3 million. A <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> uses half of its battery power for cardiac stimulation and the other half for housekeeping tasks such as monitoring and data logging.

Methods: descriptive, exploratory and bibliographic study that used journals nationals listed in LILACS, BDENF, SciELO e CEPEnb - Center of Studies and Researches in Nursing data bases. It was looked for the expression “pacemaker” in the nursing studies titles and “orientations to <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> patients” in the other journals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the possible effect of cellular radio on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in elevators. We previously investigated pacemaker EMI in elevator by examining the E-field distribution of horizontal plane at the height of expected for implanted pacemakers inside elevators. In this paper, we introduce our method for estimating EMI impact to implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> using EMF distributions inside the region of the human body in which pacemakers are implanted. Simulations of a human phantom in an elevator are performed and histograms are derived from the resulting EMF distributions. The computed results of field strengths are compared with a certain reference level determined from experimentally obtained maximum interference distance of implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> This enables us to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the EMI impact to pacemakers by cellular radio transmission. This paper uses a numerical phantom model developed based on an European adult male. The simulations evaluate EMI on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in three frequency bands. As a result, calculated E-field strengths are sufficiently low to cause the pacemaker to malfunction in the region examined...|$|R
40|$|When pluripotency {{factors are}} removed, {{embryonic}} stem cells (ESCs) undergo spontaneous differentiation, which, among other lineages, also gives rise to cardiac sublineages, including chamber cardiomyocytes and pacemaker cells.

We sought to direct ESCs to differentiate specifically into <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> cells by overexpressing a transcription factor critical for embryonic patterning of the native <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> (the sinoatrial node). Overexpression of SHOX 2 during ESC differentiation upregulated the pacemaker gene program, resulting in enhanced automaticity in vitro and induced biological pacing upon transplantation in vivo. The accentuated automaticity is accompanied by temporally evolving changes in the effectors and regulators of Wnt signaling. Our findings provide a strategy for enriching the <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> cell population from ESCs...|$|R
