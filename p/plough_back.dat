His new design {{consisted}} of a steam engine placed {{in a corner of}} the field driving a winch. A rope led from the winch along the side of the field, around a securely anchored pulley and across the field to the mole plough. As the winch drew in the rope the mole plough was drawn across the field digging a drainage channel as it went. The engine also had a second winch with a rope passing round the same anchored pulley and then passing across the field and around a second pulley and back to the plough. This second rope would be used to drag the <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> to its starting point after completing a drainage line. Both pulleys would then be re-anchored at both ends of the next channel to be dug and the ploughing process would be repeated. The steam plough was demonstrated at the Royal Agricultural Society of England meeting at Lincoln in 1854.|$|E

State governments are engaged in managing national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and may put the interests of tourists, and the money they bring into the state, before {{the interests of the}} indigenous peoples that live inside park boundaries. Before independence, the British managed this area for the extraction of timber, building roads and providing forest rest houses. After independence, the state forest department took on this role, regulations increased and timber extraction decreased. Other departments became involved, a motor road was built to Naitwar, schools, administrative buildings and a small hospital were built, immigrants arrived from Nepal and elsewhere and set up stalls, shops and restaurants. By 1988, the road had been extended for 20 km inside the park to Sankiri and 300 visitors arrived that year. The road was further extended and in 1990, over one thousand tourists, mostly Indian, visited. By this time, several state departments were involved. The wildlife division of the forest department wanted to preserve the wildlife, exclude tourists and local people from certain areas, and <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> any funds they accumulated into upkeep of the park. The tourism department wanted to encourage the opening up of the area, the building of new roads and tourist accommodation, and was uninterested in the socio-development of the permanent park residents. Since then eco-tourism has further expanded, and tourists {{from all parts of the}} world now visit the park.|$|E
5000|$|Seabury Stanton {{was born}} on Oct. 9, 1892 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father and {{grandfather}} had been Yankee whaling captains in New Bedford. He attended the local schools, the New Bedford Textile School, and Harvard University, where he graduated {{in the class of}} 1915. The following year he married Jean Kellogg Austin (1892 - 1976) and began work in textile manufacturing as the treasurer for the Hathaway Manufacturing Company. Hathaway Manufacturing eventually became Berkshire Hathaway after merging with Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates in 1955, becoming the largest surviving textile manufacturer in New England with 15 mills. The company was founded in the nineteenth century with Horatio Hathaway's profits from whaling and the China Trade, but the textile industry in New England declined after World War I and didn't recover until after the Great Depression with the outbreak of World War II. In the late 1950s the industry was again in decline, facing low-cost competition from elsewhere in the United States and abroad. Stanton managed the company as president and his son Jack served as treasurer. Jack Stanton was expected to take over as president, but the Stantons were ousted before that took place. Seabury's brother, Otis Stanton, managed sales at the company and often conflicted with his brother, eventually selling his shares to Warren Buffett after a meeting at the Wamsutta Club. [...] Seabury Stanton was a miller and a manager with an overriding aim to keep the business going but he was not a financial expert and he continued to <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> most of the company’s earnings into working capital, despite ever decreasing cotton prices, resulting from increased competition at home and abroad.|$|E

Meaning that the market regulation policies were favourable in both countries. Market regulations such as Open market policies, domestic trade, foreign exchange policies promote entrepreneurial activities. In Nigeria, however, tax (0.968) was the principal factor. This is not surprising because the poor tax administration process in Nigeria (Makinde, 2005; Otusanya, 2010; Adebisi & Gbegi, 2013) has created loopholes for SMEs to evade tax payments. As a result, entrepreneurs worry less about tax payment, {{and as a result}} <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> the income into their business.

She then interviewed 2 learners, one from J. C. Merkin School for quadriplegic learners and one from Dominican Convent High School.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of mining revenue in Zimbabwe {{has attracted a}} lot of attention especially with the discovery of diamonds. The mining sector itself plays a very important {{role in the development of}} any country. In Zimbabwe it has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy since 2009. The overall objective of this paper is to investigate the {{distribution of}} mining revenue in Zimbabwe. The study was conducted through consultative workshops, focus groups and interviews of key informants from different provinces. Secondary document review was also done to support information gathered from the consultations. The study indicated that there should be specific laws and policies on how mining companies give corporate social responsibility (CSR); the operation of community trusts which were stipulated in the Indigenization and Empowerment Act (Chapter 14 : 33) should be clear and transparent; and the needs of small scale miners should be taken into consideration so that they can also effectively contribute to the revenue of the country and the communities they are operating in. Several recommendations came out of these discussions and some of the major recommendations included that corporate social responsibility (CSR) be regulated so that all mining companies are bound by law to <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> into the community. It was also recommended that there be a special fund for mining revenue like in other African countries (Botswana, Nigeria, and South Africa...|$|E

The research includes studying foamed concrete, very high strength concrete, fibre reinforcing and the inclusion of waste materials, such as coal ash from power stations, recycled concrete, glass, etc. The ultimate dream is to provide high strength, affordable lightweight concrete for ease of application in major structures, which would have an economic impact on construction in South Africa. “A current focal point of my research into this technology is its application in the design and production of building materials for affordable housing. The thermal isolation properties of the product are also investigated in view of South Africa’s energy problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nowadays, {{the world}} wind energy {{has had an}} {{important}} development {{in the last years}} in spite of the economic crisis we are going through. Cost reduction has helped to improve the profitability, thanks to economies of scale and the creation of new projects. Currently, our country is in the fourth position leading the electricity generation with wind energy. However, {{it has been estimated that}} this increase will be reduced not only because of the cutbacks, but also due to the elimination of aids. Wind energy has advantages and disadvantages which can be environmental, economic and technical. The main advantages are: - It is a renewable and non-polluting source. - A lot of direct and indirect jobs have been created thanks to this energy. On the other hand, the main disadvantages are: - The visual impact associated with wind turbines. - The power generated in the wind parks cannot be stored so far. Generally speaking, wind energy can be either earthly or marine. In addition, in Spain this sector is divided in: advancement of wind parks and electricity generation, fabrication of wind turbines, fabrication of components and services. The economic and financial analysis carried out deals with companies which work developing wind parks and electricity generation in Spain from 2010 to 2012. This analysis is based in a sample of 180 companies that meet the requirements above mentioned. This sample has been evaluated through nine ratios: liquidity, working capital, solvency, <b>plough</b> <b>back,</b> volume of sales, EBITDA, net profit, ROI, ROE and financial gearing.

40|$|The Niger Delta {{region of}} Nigeria {{contributes}} more than 95 {{percent of the}} country’s export incomes and generates more than 40 percent of the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 85 percent of the nation’s total revenue (Karl and Gray, 2003, p. 26). Although most multinational oil companies (MNOCs) have found the Niger Delta a fertile ground for business, the region remains backward, poor and underdeveloped. The host communities have been frustrated by the effects of oil production on the environment, which include oil spillages, the reduction of arable land, {{and the destruction of}} wild life and fish reserves. As a result of the oil bearing communities’ angry sentiments towards the MNOCs and the Nigerian Government, incessant conflict, and violent crises have enveloped the region. To mitigate the anger, the MNOCs have engaged in some programs and projects intended to benefit the oil- bearing communities in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This thesis is focused on how the CSR strategies of the MNOCs have contributed to the perennial conflict in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The mixed methods descriptive design study employed involves the use of survey instruments and content analysis to interrogate the conflict situation. Findings indicate that the failure of MNOCs operating in the Niger Delta region to provide concrete and sustainable CSR, and the government’s inability to regulate the MNOCs and <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> the taxes paid by the latter to develop the region, has led to the current crises. These supported the thesis that the lack of concrete social responsibility contributes to conflicts in the Niger Delta. Building upon the stakeholders’ theory, the theory of frustration and aggression, and conflict theory, this study discovered that the cause of the conflict in the Niger Delta is not solely an issue of corporate social responsibility and revenue allocation, but it largely depends on the divergences of the different stakeholders’ interests. This study, therefore, recommends a revocation of the 60 / 40 ownership structure {{between the government and the}} oil companies. Instead, host communities should be considered part owners of the oil deposits in their land, which would give them a fair percentage in the ownership structure...|$|E
40|$|Focus on customers? needs CUE: When Sabina Khoza {{began her}} poultry {{business}} in Gauteng Province, South Africa, {{she had just}} ten broiler chicks that she raised and sold for meat. This year she is expecting to sell 190, 000 chickens. Such an expansion has only been possible because of her excellent marketing strategy. Indeed from an early stage, Sabina realised that she would need to train specific staff just to sell her birds. More importantly, she has been thoughtful and innovative, carefully identifying the exact needs of her local communities, and {{finding new ways to}} add value to the produce and service that she offers. The result ? Many satisfied customers, and a thriving poultry business. For this interview, Lesibana Mantshiu visited Sabina at her farm in Gauteng {{to find out more about}} the secrets of her success. She begins by describing the local area where she sells her chickens. IN:		?We sell them in the ? OUT:		? what we have produced?. DUR?N	 3 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sabina Khoza, showing how important it is for farmers to understand the needs of their customers. Transcript Khoza	We sell them in the informal market, as there is a lot of informal settlement in my area. It is a disadvantaged area, whereby people don?t have refrigerators and they need fresh meat. We started being four, myself and three other helpers. We used ourselves as the people who would be selling to the end users. We then decided that we had got to add some more people, agents, who are going to sell to the end users. And those people were invited, were trained on the farm, as to sell our own produce. Mantshiu	How are you delivering your commodity to your customers? Khoza	We started delivering using public transport, until finally there was a need for us to work hard and <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> the profit that we were making by buying a vehicle. Now we have got a vehicle which is helping us on sustaining the project, and making sure that we deliver to our agents, who are then supplying to our end users. And by having that transport it?s cost effective. Everyone knows that on Thursday of each and every week at a certain time they are getting their stock, and we make sure that we deliver the stock that will last for a weekend. If there is a need of the extra orders that will be needed, the end user, if he phones, he is actually going to refunded for the expenditure incurred of phoning for an additional order. That way we enhance the market, and that way we make sure that there is enough good quality chickens that we are delivering to our end users. Mantshiu	Now tell us more about the value adding with your business of selling these birds? Khoza	We are mainly specialising on live birds, but there is a need for value adding whereby we slaughter. We do have our own abattoir, that can process fifty birds per day, and we add value by spicing our chickens, selling the intestines, the feet, the legs, which is an additional money that is also catering for the repairs of whatever we may incur with the abattoir. We do our waste management by fertilising the garden, and from their we grow our own vegetables, whereby we have got a ?One Stop Shop?. A customer comes in to buy only a chicken, and he or she ends up buying four or three commodities from our project. Mantshiu	Specify more about those commodities that are produced in your garden here as well. Khoza	In fact we have identified the type of the community where we are staying, and we have identified the type of the commodity that they will need such as cabbage, spinach, we have also got carrots. But we do specialise in the spinach which is a year round cultivar, that is more profitable as long as it is well maintained. We do our own vegetable packing whereby we will just clean them, make sure that they are kept very clean, healthy, well presented to our end users so that they must come back in order to sustain what we have produced. End of track. A poultry farmer from South Africa explains how she has built up her business as a reliable supplier of poultry products, by focussing on the needs of her customers. This has included recruiting agents to sell her chickens, investing profits from the business in a vehicle to solve transport problems, developing a good system of communication with customers, and adding value to her chicken products...|$|E
