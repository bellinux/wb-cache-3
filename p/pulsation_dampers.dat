5000|$|... (Search words {{used because}} the words {{beginning}} with [...] "damp-" [...] are abused)True DampersThese true dampers {{are available from}} several sources, the purpose of their design is to address the typical approximate acoustic pressure wave velocities in liquids of 3500 mph. The common characteristic is interception by flow-through. They are multi connection devices that intercept and dissipate the over pressure energy of shocks, surges, water hammer, and pressure pulsation. These were called [...] "pressure <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampers</b> and shock wave dampers". They are now [...] "Pulse Filters", [...] "Pulsation Filters", [...] "Acoustic Filters for liquids".|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 120 {{manufacturers}} of <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampers</b> provide items {{which do not}} damp. The authority for saying this is, because the words dampen and dampener have at their root, removing energy.How the word misuse has arisenThe compressibility of a gas, often nitrogen because it is inert at normal temperatures, stores any sudden volume change. Storing sudden volume change enables volume to change against a soft gas cushion, without the need to accelerate all the existing liquid in the system {{out of the way}} of the new volume coming from a pump. Therefore, as all the volume in a system does not have to be suddenly accelerated, the cushion is preventing [...] "acceleration head (force)" [...] having to be generated. The pressure pulse is accordingly not generated in the first place, so it is not damped at all. The gas cushion simply allows volume change to be stored. The manufacturers are providing, are liquid accumulators, not an item which removes energy.|$|E
40|$|Fluid-borne {{vibrations}} in piping systems {{remains a}} serious problem in applications such as marine vessels where mechanical fatigue and radiated noise are critical factors. In the case of pumps or hydraulic engines, {{the main source of}} vibrational energy is in the fluid axisymmetric plane wave associated with the system pressure pulsations. Due to fluid/structure coupling, this wave propagates in both the pipe wall and fluid. For high levels of pressure pulsations, the resulting radial and axial wall motion can then cause mechanical fatigue and unwanted radiated noise. Passive <b>pulsations</b> <b>dampers</b> have been used traditionally to reduce the fluid pressure pulses. The use of such passive devices is limited however in critical applications due to the resulting static pressure loss which decreases the system performance. This report describes the design and testing of a non-intrusive fluid wave actuator for the active control of pressure pulses. The actuator consists of a circumferential ring of PZT stacks acting on the pipe outside wall to generate an axisymmetric plane wave in the fluid through radial motion coupling. After briefly describing a simplified model of the actuator along with predicted performances, experimental results will show the control performance of the actuator applied to the discharge line of an oil driven hydraulic engine...|$|R

A possibility to achieve the pressure differential up to 8 MPa in the screw compressor stage has been substantiated.

40|$|Two large {{identical}} 6 -cylinder Ariel JGB/ 6 reciprocating compressors each of 7. 5 MW, {{are used}} for an underground gas storage system (UGS) plant of RWE Gasspeicher GmbH located in Epe, Germany. The system is in operation since 2005. In 2011 several internals parts (baffle plates and baffle choke tubes) of the <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampers</b> were broken. TNO has carried out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and it was shown that the failures were caused {{by a combination of}} bad manufactured welds, too high thermal (cyclic) stresses caused by heating up and cooling down the system several times a day and by too high dynamic stresses caused by vibrations. The paper will give a detailed overview of the RCA and the proposed measures to avoid these failures...|$|E
40|$|Reciprocating compressors, {{including}} <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampers</b> and the connected pipe system, {{are often}} {{the heart of an}} installation and should therefore operate reliable. Compressor manifold vibrations can contribute to fatigue failure of the system which can lead to unsafe situations, loss of capacity and increase in maintenance as well as repair costs. To avoid these situations a compressor manifold analysis has to be carried out at a very early stage of the design of an installation. A compressor manifold analysis is an optional analysis in the 4 th edition of the API Standard 618. However, in the 5 th edition of the API Standard 618 this analysis is mandatory in a Design Approach 3 analysis. In this paper it will be demonstrated that a compressor manifold analysis can be carried out in an accurate and economic way by means of a finite element substructuring technique, using FE models generated from CAD models. The accuracy of these models has been validated by means of a modal analysis...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of a reciprocating compressor {{is that it}} generates pulsations and vibrations, which, without limitation and proper attention during design, manufacturing, installation and operation, can lead to fatigue failures, inefficiency, capacity limitations and unsafe situations. To judge {{the integrity of the}} compressor system, vibration levels are normally evaluated and for this purpose several international standards (API, ISO and VDI) have been developed the last decade. Besides international standards, there is a wide variety of internal guidelines, which have been developed and are being applied by compressor manufacturers, packagers, engineering offices and operators. Most of these internal guidelines have been derived from international standards. The lack in most of the international standards (and probably also the internal guidelines) is that they do not make a good distinction between recommended vibration levels for different parts of the compressor system, e. g. cylinder, crankcase, foundation, <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampers,</b> piping and/or different types/configurations of compressors e. g. horizontal/vertical, high/low speed, single/double distance piece, high/low power etc. Within the R&D group of the EFRC a project was started to develop an EFRC guideline which takes into account recommended vibration levels for different parts of the reciprocating compressor system. This paper will discuss the different international standards and the results of the EFRC project to develop EFRC Guidelines for vibrations in reciprocating compressor systems...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 141 - 146 Oil-free screw (OFS) {{compressors}} {{are capable}} of producing high-pressure pulsations in the discharge gas stream, over a frequency range of 200 to 3000 Hz. The fundamental pressure pulsation {{is due to the}} opening cycle of the compressor lobes at the discharge porting and {{is referred to as the}} pocket passing frequency (PPF). Fatigue failures have been observed in discharge silencers/pulsation dampers as well as downstream piping components in oil-free screw compressor service where the frequencies were greater than 1000 Hz. A careful review of the pulsation damper design has shown that attenuation effectiveness is limited to frequencies less than 1000 Hz. The principal purpose of the pulsation damper is to reduce the line pressure pulsations in order to lessen the chances of downstream piping failures. The pulsation damper does very little to attenuate high frequency noise levels that are transmitted to the area surrounding the compressor. The principal purpose of this paper is to document failures of silencer/pulsation dampers in OFS compressor service and provide a root cause analysis of these failure modes. <b>Pulsation</b> <b>dampers</b> are not used at the inlet flange in many applications, due to the lowpressure pulsation in the inlet plenum of the compressor. It is not the intent of this paper to present any theoretical background in the design of acoustic dampers, but to provide an overview of the acoustic phenomenon and how it is used in screw compressor applications. The end result of this work will be to provide practical guidelines for specifying silencer/pulsation dampers for OFS compressor applications...|$|E
