50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{electronic}} tension mechanisms: constant pull and lock out. Constant pull, as the name suggests, pulls the string and continues pulling until the desired tension is reached. The tension mechanism will ensure the string tension remains correct at all times, making stringing more consistent and accurate, as string stretching is taking into account. Lock out electronic stringing machines are similar to crank machines as they will pull to your desired tension but no longer monitor any reduction in tension over time. Constant <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> will therefore offer greater levels of string accuracy.|$|E

When using Ziris Edge, the opposite is achieved by using <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> instead.

40|$|World-Wide Web-based search systems (or <b>pull</b> <b>technology)</b> stimulated large {{commercial}} database vendors {{to transfer}} to Web interfaces as well. Various reasons exist why Web-interfacing could be an asset to traditional online search systems, for example, using familiar Web browsers, implementing user-friendly Web sites, or lower search fees because of the unique features of client/server architecture. The differences between the content and retrieval procedures of search engines and database vendors emphasize the fact that vendors have to be extremely cautious when transferring to a Web interface. It seems possible that Web interfacing techniques and database vendors can soon become full partners in the <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> environment.

Medical news, CME, and other information are transferred by modem nightly to the physician's computers where this information can be accessed at a convenient time. A survey was faxed to 195 subscribers to the system. A total of 73 (39 %) responded. The results indicate that prior to implementation of the Medcast system, almost 40 {{percent of the respondents}} did not use their computers for professional activities because of time constraints, costs and computer literacy problems.

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{deals with}} applications that help systems and individuals respond to critical conditions in their environments. The identification of critical conditions requires correlating {{vast amounts of}} data within and outside an enterprise. Conditions that signal opportunities or threats are defined by complex patterns of data over time, space and other attributes. Systems and individuals have models (expectations) of behaviors of their environments, and applications notify them when reality – as determined by measurements and estimates – deviate from their expectations. Components of event systems are also sent information to validate their current models and when specific responses are required. Valuable information is that which supports or contradicts current expectations or that which requires an action {{on the part of}} the receiver. A major problem today is information overload; this problem can be solved by identifying what information is critical, complementing existing <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> with sophisticated push technology, and filtering out non-critical data...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we test {{the effect of}} {{technological}} capabilities (accumulated knowledge andorganization/production routines) on the R&D intensity for a panel of European indus-tries. Our proxy for capabilities is {{the distance from the}} technological frontier. Estimationis carried out with System Generalized Methods of Moments and is robust to variousspecifications. Our identification strategy is limited to the average (reduced form) effect. We find a strong effect of capabilities on the amount invested in R&D, after controllingfor demand <b>pull,</b> <b>technology</b> push, size, and cash constraints. The latter ones are the mainvariables used in the literature on the determinants of innovative expenditure, of which R&Dis one of the components. The elasticity of the distance from the technological frontier is 10 %, of similar magnitude (but opposite sign) with regard to the effect of internal resources. When we allow for heterogeneous impact, clustering the industries according to theirtechnological level, we see that the effect of capabilities is robust, but concentrated inMedium and Low Tech sectors. Moreover, the effect is stronger in the upswings of thebusiness cycle and is concentrated in peripheral countries. These latter stylized facts maysuggest that the divergence induced by lack of capabilities is somehow nonlinear andincreases when a critical mass is missing. JRC. J. 2 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of maize is constrained by parasitic weeds, particularly Striga. A study {{was carried out}} to document farmers’ knowledge, attitude and practices on Striga control among smallholder farmers across three districts: Kisumu West, Busia and Teso South of Western Kenya. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the locations and farmers to be interviewed. A semi structured, open and closed ended questionnaire was administered leading to field experiment. Besides village meetings (39. 2 %), farmers got informed on farming methods under Striga weed farms and its control technologies through neighbours (2. 5 %), workshops and trainings (5. 0 %), field schools (3. 7 %), media (7. 5 %) and extension agents (10. 8 %). The attitudes of farmers towards Striga control varied but frequently cited: long term viability of the Striga seed (12. 5 %), difficult to control sharing of farm tools (10. 8 %), expensive technologies (13. 3 %), lack of adequate information (18. 3 %), labour intensive (15. 0 %), large farms for use of push and <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> (1. 7 %) and time consuming (12. 5 %).

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Research {{shows that a}} large {{proportion}} of the working time of project actors is spent processing, communicating and disseminating information that is not relevant to their tasks. This makes information overload (IO) a liability that adversely affects the performance of project actors and the management of their organisations. Some advances have been achieved in structuring information resources to support the decision making process of engineering project actors. However, it is not always possible to structure and direct the right information to the right actor at the right time. Some engineering companies have taken the initiative of resolving this problem by encouraging actors to employ personal information management systems, information sifting systems, product data management systems and other software applications to help manage the problem of IO. These information systems rely on <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> which contribute towards time delay, inefficiency and cost in actors’ information seeking process. The paper draws on information behaviour (IB) literature of engineering project actors to establish a platform for future studies on how IB can inform how information could be structured and made available to the right actor at the right time to facilitate timely decision making and organisation management. This paper proposes the SMART Push information capturing and delivery framework as a solution to IO. This could aid releasing the actor from the entire problem associated with information seeking process in order to focus on the task at hand...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, when we {{talk about}} {{database}} networking, we have to trace back the origin of it and {{have a look at the}} future, “beyond the outlined horizons”, in order to point out new strategies. The various models of database networking systems refer to different ways of “communication of information”; the old systems are based on static informative systems while the more updated ones are characterized by the modularity of the informative dynamic offer. Not only have the current systems to be equipped with additional functionalities in order to be competitive in this challenge, but also they have to integrate with other tools in order to communicate from the point of view of the interaction with the OPAC and the full-text of the electronic journals. The emergence of new products, which provide additional on-line information services using integrated push and <b>pull</b> <b>technology</b> (for example, SpotLight services, A&I and Awareness), leads to a new dynamicity in the informative interaction. Now, it is the information that reaches the user according to predefined strategies thorough systems that periodically send via e-mail the results of the bibliographic search for a journal or a subject to the subscribed user. Therefore, if we consider database networking systems as organized groups of databases within circumscribed nets, the challenge is still open. If we pay attention to what is “outside”, we can imagine the future winners of this match, yet to be played, where the libraries will play a fundamental role within the communication systems in which the information is conveyed...|$|E
