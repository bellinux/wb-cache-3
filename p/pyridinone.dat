Herein this manuscript, the two main areas of research are described.

Secondly, a rhodium-catalysed pyridine directed C–H bond activation enables the rearrangement of 1, 6 -heptadienes into bicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptanes in good yields. Importantly, three stereogenic centres are created with complete diastereocontrol in this atom-efficient reaction.

Of the 47, 000 compounds screened, 238 (top 0. 5 % hits) of the chemicals increased the luminescent signal more than 14. 4 -fold and were re-tested at eleven concentrations in a range of 0. 01 - 30 µM. Of these 238 compounds, 231 (96 %) increased the luminescence signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Chemical structure relationship analysis of these 231 compounds indicated enrichment of four chemical scaffolds (diaryl amides and diaryl ureas, oxazoles and thiazoles, pyranones and thiapyranones, and <b>pyridinones</b> and pyridazinones).

The hallmark of NNRTI {{has been based on}} their ability to interact with a specific site ('pocket') of HIV- 1 RT. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in addition to HIV- 1, different strains of HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (mac 251, agm 3 and mndGB 1) are sensitive to a selection of NNRTI i. e. delavirdine, the HEPT derivative I-EBU (MKC- 442), 8 -chloro-TIBO (tivirapine), alpha-APA (loviride), nevirapine and the <b>pyridinone</b> derivative L- 697, 661. METHODS AND RESULTS: The NNRTI tested inhibited the replication of the different strains of HIV- 2 and SIV at micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the NNRTI on HIV- 2 -induced cytopathicity correlated well with their inhibitory effects on HIV- 2 RT activity. Drug-resistant HIV- 2 (EHO) variants containing the Ser 102 Leu and/or Glu 219 Asp mutations in their RT were selected after passaging the virus in MT- 4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of delavirdine. The EHO virus mutants were at least 20 -fold less susceptible to the antiviral effects of delavirdine. Some cross-resistance, depending on the mutant strain, was observed with the other NNRTI tested (i. e. MKC- 442, tivirapine, loviride and <b>pyridinone</b> L- 697, 661). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NNRTI are not exclusively specific for HIV- 1 but are also inhibitory to different HIV- 2 and SIV strains. These observations will have important implications for the development of new NNRTI with higher activity against both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Furthermore, in view of their anti-SIV activity, NNRTI could be evaluated further for their in vivo anti-retrovirus efficacy in non-human primate models. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{reactions}} of b,b'-tricarbonyl derivatives with isocyanates are catalysed by 2 mol % transition metal acetylacetonates (e. g., [Co(acac) 2] and [Zn(acac) 2]) at room temperature. 3 -Oxo- 1, 5 -pentanedioic acid dimethylester (1) reacts with RNCO (R=Et, CH 2 CH=CH 2, CH 2 Ph, Ph, 4 -Cl-Ph) to give 1 : 1 adducts involving {{the formation of}} a new C-C bond between the intercarbonylic methylene and the isocyanato group.

40|$|Iron (III) {{chelating}} resins containing 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 (1 H) <b>pyridinone</b> (HMP) groups were prepared from 1 -(β-acrylamidoethyl) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 (1 H) <b>pyridinone</b> (AHMP) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA), using N,N-ethylene-bis-acrylamide (EBAA) as a cross-linking agent. The cross-linked AHMP-DMAA copolymer resins were very stable and exhibited a high hydrophilicity with water {{contents of the}} swollen resins of 85 - 90 %. The iron (III) chelating capacity of the resins was determined at physiological pH, and the chelating efficiency was, in general, higher than 90 %. The iron (III) chelation was about 80 % after 2 h and almost complete in 8 h. The distribution ratio of iron (III) between the resin and iron (III) solutions was quite high (3700 - 25, 000 mL/g) and depended on the initial iron (III) concentration. It was possible to remove iron completely from aqueous solutions by using excess amounts of the resin. The resin also showed a very high selectivity for iron (III), and selectivity coefficients for iron (III) {{in the range of}} 9. 6 × 108 - 1. 4 × 1012 were determined at pH 5. 6 in binary solutions of Fe 3 + with Mg 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ca 2 +, Mn 2 +, and Zn 2 +. The iron (III) {{chelating resins}} could be easily regenerated and used again without any considerable loss of their iron (III) chelating capacities...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyridinone</b> {{derivatives}} are potent {{and specific}} inhibitors of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV- 1 replication in cell culture. However, the potential clinical usefulness of these compounds as monotherapeutic agents may be limited by the selection of inhibitor-resistant viral variants. Resistance in cell culture is due primarily to mutational alterations at RT amino acid residues 103 and 181. A recombinant HIV- 1 RT containing both of these mutations was used to screen a panel of <b>pyridinone</b> analogs for inhibitory activity. L- 696, 229 and L- 697, 661, pyridinones currently undergoing clinical evaluation, were more than 4, 000 -fold weaker against the mutant enzyme than against the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, one derivative of L- 696, 229, L- 702, 019 (3 -[2 -(4, 7 -dichlorobenzoxazol- 2 -yl) ethyl]- 5 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrid in- 2 (1 H) -thione), showed only three-fold different potencies against the two enzymes. L- 702, 019 was also a potent inhibitor of the replication of mutant HIV- 1 containing the individual mutations at amino acid 103 or 181 {{as well as of}} clinical isolates resistant to L- 697, 661 and L- 696, 229. Isolation and analysis of resistant viral variants in cell culture showed that significant resistance to L- 702, 019 could be engendered only by multiple amino acid substitutions in RT. Accordingly, these studies demonstrated the potential of identifying second-generation specific HIV- 1 RT inhibitors that can overcome the viral resistance selected by the first generation of inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 3 -hydroxypyridin- 4 -one {{derivatives}} (HPOs) were synthesized and their partition coefficient values (Kpart) were determined. The cytotoxic {{effects of these}} iron chelators against Hela cancer cells were also evaluated. The IC 50 of HPOs was determined using MTT assay. Among these ligands, compound 4 e (Kpart= 5. 02) with an IC 50 of 30 μM and 4 f (Kpart= 0. 1) with an IC 50 of 700 μM showed the lowest and highest IC 50 s, respectively. In conclusion, {{the introduction of a}} more hydrophobic functional group (such as butyl in compound 4 e) on the nitrogen of <b>pyridinone</b> ring resulted in higher cytotoxic activity of ligands...|$|E
