The tests were carried out with an instrumented single model <b>pile</b> in two configurations: {{in direct contact with}} the raft and separated from the raft by a coarse granular layer. As the model tests show, a granular layer beneath a raft changes the <b>pile</b> shaft behaviour significantly compared to that exhibited by a <b>pile</b> in contact; it allows downward relative raft – <b>pile</b> and soil – <b>pile</b> displacement and the consequent development of negative skin friction around the upper <b>pile</b> shaft perimeter.
