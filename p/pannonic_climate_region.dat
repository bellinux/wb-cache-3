40|$|By {{using the}} {{orthogonal}} transformations between principal components and original variates, a loading correlation model is proposed as a technique for climatic classification derived from synoptic climatology. The criterion for a loading correlation {{model for a}} <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> {{is that all the}} first loading correlations are positive and significant. The <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> includes all the stations chosen in the model. The first positive significant loading correlations and other significant ones in the model, fitted to the <b>climate</b> <b>region,</b> can be identified as the average circulation type and the average circulation features, respectively, by using the decomposition of the original variates. Thus, the regional climate can be described in terms of synoptic climatology. The mathematical structure of the loading correlation model is based on empirical orthogonal functions with two additional parameters, the standard deviation of the principal components and the original variates. 1...|$|R

40|$|Climatologically {{homogeneous}} {{regions in}} the Carolinas were delineated using a multi-step approach integrating in-situ and remotely-sensed data. We adopted a consensus clustering technique that obtains <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> for precipitation and temperature separately. Both average linkage hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were used to create weather station clusters. Using the resulting precipitation and temperature clusters as training data, we performed a machine-learning decision tree classification of remotely-sensed data (i. e., MODIS and TRMM) to map five precipitation classes and seven temperature classes for the Carolinas. These data were intersected to produce 17 consensus clusters for the Carolinas, and 16 <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> when summarized by counties. The resultant <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> showed rational <b>climate</b> regionalization reflecting controls on Carolina climate including topography, latitude, storm tracks, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The use of remotely-sensed data effectively helped the delineation between weather station clusters and even detected consensus clusters that were not identified by intersecting weather station clusters grouped using only in-situ data. We compared the regions with the 15 existing National Climatic Data Center climate divisions using within- and between-cluster standard deviations for both in-situ and remotely-sensed data. <b>Climate</b> <b>regions</b> could improve the existing climate divisions in delineating climatologically homogeneous regions and in separating heterogeneous regions. close 121...|$|R

40|$|Smoothness is an {{important}} characteristic of a spatial process that measures local variability. If climate model outputs are realistic, then not only the values at each grid pixel but also the relative variation over nearby pixels should represent the true climate. We estimate the smoothness of long-term averages for land surface temperature anomalies in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5), and compare them by <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> and seasons. We also compare the estimated smoothness of the climate outputs in CMIP 5 with those of reanalysis data. The estimation is done through the composite likelihood approach for locally self-similar processes. The composite likelihood that we consider {{is a product of}} conditional likelihoods of neighbouring observations. We find that the smoothness of the surface temperature anomalies in CMIP 5 depends primarily on the modelling institution and on the <b>climate</b> <b>region.</b> The seasonal difference in the smoothness is generally small, except for some <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> where the average temperature is extremely high or low...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{article focuses}} on CO 2 {{emissions}} of buildings in China, the drivers of carbon dioxide emissions of buildings performing stage under the different climatic conditions have been studied by using the STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model. Five factors were selected, including per capita floor space of residential buildings, floor space of buildings, household consumption level, output value of tertiary industry and unit building area of carbon dioxide emissions. According to the climatic conditions, the buildings of four <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> are taken into account, which are Severe Cold (SC), Cold (C), Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) and Hot Summer Warm Winter (HSWW), respectively. The factors are quantified through ridge regression. Empirical results indicate that all the factors can cause an increase in CO 2 emissions among the four <b>climate</b> <b>regions,</b> although they have different degree influence on CO 2 emissions from buildings in different <b>climate</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this research, {{the effect}} of phase change {{material}} (PCM) on indoor thermal comfortof a flat building located in five different <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> of China was studied by an angle coefficient method and EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus was used to calculate temperatures of wall surfaces, and the angle coefficient method was used to calculate PMV (predicted mean vote) value located different indoor position. Based on the calculated PMV values for different distant to south wall, it can be known that phase change materials can obviously increase {{the time of the}} indoor PMV value within the range (- 1, 1) in <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> of cold and mild. It can also reduce fluctuations of different location indoor PMV value. In <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> of both hot summer and cold winter and hot summer and warm winter, there is little effect of phase change materials on PMV.   Keywords: Indoor thermal comfort; PCM; PMV; Angle coefficient metho...|$|R

40|$|Purpose / Context – In {{order to}} achieve low energy housing, it is {{important}} to quantitatively and comprehensively determine the effectiveness of energy saving technologies and to evaluate the energy conservation performance of an entire house. Low Energy Housing with Validated Effectiveness (LEHVE) is one of the measures for home energy saving in Japan. The evaluation procedure of LEHVE can quantitatively show the energy saving effect of each technology, such as insulation and equipment, and total energy consumption of a house in the design phase. The LEHVE’s evaluation procedure is not mandatory, however it is widely used in Japan and its outcome has developed into Japan’s Energy Saving Standard. Methodology / Approach – Design data of newly-built houses are investigated using the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure to evaluate the energy conservation performance in both mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> in Shikoku island, Japan. The present situation of energy conservation performance of newly built housing is analysed using the obtained data of the both regions. In the analysis, energy consumption, energy reduction rates and adoption rates of elemental technologies, such as natural energy application technology, heat control technology of building envelopes and energy-efficient equipment technology, have been yielded. Results – 370 cases of design data of newly built timber houses in Japan, which were obtained between FY 2013 and FY 2015, have been analysed based on the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure. 265 cases of design data were obtained in mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and 105 cases were obtained in hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region.</b> As the analysis results, it is suggested that the energy conservation performance of the newly built houses has been improved year by year in the both regions. Key Findings / Implications – The energy conservation performance of the newly built houses in both mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> has been improved year by year. However, some natural energy application technologies, such as wind utilisation or daylight utilisation, have not been widely adopted in the houses even though the both <b>regions</b> have suitable <b>climates</b> for use of natural energy. Originality – Energy conservation performance of housing can be estimated by using the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure. 370 cases of the latest design data of newly built housing have been obtained in Shikoku island where only dozens of data had been available by previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose / Context –The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} indoor environment and energy saving performance of houses, which employ passive ventilation systems, built in mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid region in Japan. Methodology / Approach – In this study, investigation of passive ventilation systems, such as passive stack ventilation systems and solar heating panels, have been conducted by two steps. The first step is real measurement of indoor environment and heating energy in houses employing passive ventilation systems. The second is analysis of total primary energy consumption of heating, cooling and ventilation by using a computational program based on the extended heating degree method. Results – From the measurement results, a passive ventilation system can be used in the regions from the viewpoint of the indoor environment. From the calculations results, a passive stack ventilation system with a self regulating damper yields less energy than typical mechanical ventilation systems. It is confirmed that a solar heating panel have a positive effect on heating energy reduction even in hot humid region. Key Findings / Implications – In mild <b>climate</b> <b>region,</b> indoor environment of the house employing a passive stack ventilation system have almost met the reference values of the Act on Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings in Japan. A solar heating panel works well as an assistant heating system on houses even in hot humid <b>region.</b> In mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid region, a passive stack ventilation system which is generally adopted in cold <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> can be used with less energy by employing a self regulating damper than typical mechanical ventilation systems. Originality - In mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and in hot humid region, where passive ventilation systems are generally not employed in housing, primary energy consumption and indoor environment of houses employing passive ventilation systems are evaluated by real measurement and computational calculations.  Keywords - Passive Ventilation, Domestic Ventilation, Mild Climates, Hot Humid Climate, Primary Energy Consumptio...|$|R
