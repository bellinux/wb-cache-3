40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{comparison}} between five familiar retouching materials (Water colour, Acrylic colour, Gouache colour, <b>Poster</b> <b>colour</b> and Oil colour) were applied on the mural painting of El Sakakeny palace. The artificial aging was used to define suitability of them, while the comparison revealed that the water colour is the most successful material as it isn't turned to yellow, it is reversible and stable, thus it is considered as the most suitable material for retouching the mural painting of El Sakakeny palace which suffers from losing of paint layer...|$|E

50|$|The {{painters}} use {{vegetable and}} mineral colours without going for factory made <b>poster</b> <b>colours.</b> They prepare their own colours. White colour {{is made from}} the conch-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It {{requires a lot of}} patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the hue. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure lamp-black or black prepared from the burning of coconut shells are used. There was no blue either cobalt or ultramarine in the earlier colour schemes. The colours used in the Patta paintings are primarily bright colours, limited to red, yellow, indigo, black and white. The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied {{to the end of a}} bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes.|$|R

5000|$|Pattachitra {{refers to}} the Classical {{painting}} of Odisha, in the eastern region of India.'Patta' in Sanskrit means 'Vastra' or 'clothings' and 'chitra' means paintings.The tradition of Pattachitra is closely linked with the worship of Lord Jagannath. Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of Khandagiri and Udayagiri and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars). The theme of Oriya painting centres round the Vaishnava sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was {{the major source of}} inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and Radha-Krishna, different [...] "Vesas" [...] of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra, temple activities, the ten incarnations of Vishnu basing on the 'Gita Govinda' of Jayadev, Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, Ramayana, Mahabharata. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made <b>poster</b> <b>colours.</b> They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the conch-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the hue.

A bunch of hair tied {{to the end of a}} bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in Puri, Raghurajpur, Paralakhemundi, Chikiti and Sonepur.|$|R
