A sample of 72 Spanish primary education students (boys, n= 39; girls, n= 33; aged 10 - 12) participated in the study. All students were evaluated in the same week during the Physical Education classes. <b>Physical</b> Self-Description Questionnaire <b>and</b> EUROFIT test battery were applied to measure the variables (<b>physical</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> fitness, respectively). Pearson's correlation analysis showed that <b>physical</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> fitness are positively related (r=. 55; p<. 001). <b>Physical</b> self-concept <b>and</b> health-related <b>physical</b> fitness are positively associated in Spanish children...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>physical</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> health indicators in young and middle-aged women under the effect of step aerobics exercises. Material and methods. The grounds for the study were Kharkiv fitness club “Zorianyi”. The participants were 28 women aged 20 - 35. The study used the following methods: theoretical analysis of scientific and methodical literature, pedagogical experiment, methods of mathematical statistics, methods of determining physical performance (Harvard step test) <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> health (anthropometry, pulsometry, tonometry, spirometry, dynamometry). Results: The study assessed the level of <b>physical</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> health; analyzed age-related performance differences; determined {{the level of the}} effect of step aerobics on women’s <b>physical</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> health. Conclusions: Step-aerobics exercises proved to {{have a positive effect on}} the level of <b>physical</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> health of the young and middle-aged women...|$|R

40|$|Background: In most {{countries}} {{the prevalence of}} overweight and obesity among children is increasing. A reduced amount of physical activity could {{play an important role}} in developing overweight. However, the relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> overweight at young age remains unclear. Most previous studies included older children. Few studies report the influence of the physical environment at young age. This study examined the relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> overweight and the association between the <b>physical</b> environment <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> overweight. Method: This was a cross-sectional study in a birth-cohort in the Netherlands. A total of 867 children (3 - 6 years of age) have been included. Physical activity is measured by triaxial accelerometers. Parents filled in a questionnaire about their <b>physical</b> environment. Height <b>and</b> weight have been measured to calculate the Body Mass Index. T-tests and ANOVA’s have been used for the relationship between <b>physical</b> environment <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> BMI. Regression models have been used for the relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> BMI and for the analyses with the categorical BMI. Results: A relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> BMI has not been found. A relationship between the physical environment has also not been found. When there’s a playground within 5 minutes walking from home, children have a lower BMI and a lower chance of being overweight. Conclusion: There’s no relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> overweight or between the <b>physical</b> environment <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity. A playground nearby home reduces the chance of being overweight (5 - 6 years of age). Further research should be done to examine the exact role of the physical environment. ...|$|R
