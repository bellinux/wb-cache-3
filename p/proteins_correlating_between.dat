40|$|The {{supporting}} role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) in migration and invasion is well known. In addition, both factors are key components in cancer cell-related signaling. However, little {{information is available}} for uPA and PAI- 1 -associated signaling pathways in primary cancers and corresponding lymph node metastases. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the expression of uPA and PAI- 1 -associated signaling proteins in 52 primary breast cancers and corresponding metastases. Proteins were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the primary tumors and metastases. Protein lysates were subsequently analyzed by reverse phase protein array for the expression of members of the PI 3 K/AKT (FAK, GSK 3 -β, ILK, pGSK 3 -β, PI 3 K, and ROCK) and the MAPK pathways (pp 38, pSTAT 3, and p 38). A solid correlation of uPA expression existed between primary tumors and metastases, whereas PAI- 1 expression did not significantly <b>correlate</b> <b>between</b> them. The correlations of uPA and PAI- 1 with signaling pathways found in primary tumors did not persist in metastases. Analysis of single molecules revealed that some <b>correlated</b> well <b>between</b> tumors and metastases (FAK, pGSK 3 -β, ILK, Met, PI 3 K, ROCK, uPA, p 38, and pp 38), whereas others did not (PAI- 1 and GSK 3 -β). Whether the expression of a <b>protein</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>between</b> tumor and metastasis or not was independent of the pathway the protein is related to. These findings hint at a complete deregulation of uPA and PAI- 1 -related signaling in metastases, which might be the reason why uPA and PAI- 1 reached clinical relevance only for lymph node-negative breast cancer tissues...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Kidney biopsy {{histology}} {{remains the}} gold standard for diagnosing chronic allograft damage (CAD), with the kidney revealing chronic interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). The aim {{of this study was to}} identify predictive protein biomarkers for the development of CAD. Methods: Urine and sera were collected on 40 kidney transplant recipients and correlated to chronic damage scores. In chapter 2, urine clusterin was measured by ELISA. In chapter 3, predictive urine proteins were identified using 2 D-DIGE. Results: Urine and serum clusterin levels at three and six months were not significantly different in any of the chronic damage groups. From the three month urine, nine <b>proteins</b> <b>correlated</b> to fibrosis at twelve months and two <b>proteins</b> <b>correlated</b> with change in eGFR. The top KEGG pathway in the STRING network was coagulation and complement cascades. Follow up twelve month urine analysis revealed eleven proteins, four identified in the previous three month analysis and seven novel proteins. The top KEGG pathway at twelve months was antigen processing and presentation. Conclusions: Using traditional proteomic techniques, we have identified potential non-invasive biomarkers that are predictive of CAD.

40|$|Synthesis of {{a family}} of {{proteins}} called "heat shock" proteins is induced or enhanced in cells in response to various environmental stresses, suggesting that these proteins may perform functions essential to cell survival. Because a brief, nonlethal heat treatment can dramatically induce a transient resistance to a subsequent lethal heat treatment (thermotolerance), we examined the effect of heat treatment (41 - 46 degrees C) on protein synthesis and cell survival in plateau-phase Chinese hamster fibroblast (HA- 1) cells. After heat treatments that either drastically inhibited total protein synthesis (46 degrees C) or did not suppress it (41 degrees C), the synthesis of heat shock proteins was greatly enhanced over that in unheated cells, and cell survival was increased 10 (2) - to 10 (6) -fold when cells were challenged by a subsequent lethal heat treatment. The synthesis of heat shock <b>proteins</b> <b>correlated</b> well with the development of thermotolerance, and the stability of these <b>proteins</b> <b>correlated</b> well with the persistence of thermotolerance up to 36 hr. Sodium arsenite, hypoxia, and ethanol also induced both the synthesis of heat shock proteins and transient thermotolerance.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{step in the}} folding pathway of globular proteins is {{the formation of a}} tightly packed hydrophobic core. Several mutational studies have addressed the question of whether tight packing interactions are present during the rate-limiting step of folding. In some of these investigations, substituted side chains have been assumed to form native-like interactions in the transition state when the folding rates of mutant <b>proteins</b> <b>correlate</b> with their native-state stabilities. Alternatively, {{it has been argued that}} side chains participate in nonspecific hydrophobic collapse when the folding rates of mutant <b>proteins</b> <b>correlate</b> with side-chain hydrophobicity. In a reanalysis of published data, we have found that folding rates often correlate similarly well, or poorly, with both native-state stability and side-chain hydrophobicity, and it is therefore not possible to select an appropriate transition state model based on these one-parameter correlations. We show that this ambiguity can be resolved using a two-parameter model in which side chain burial and the formation of all other native-like interactions can occur asynchronously. Notably, the model agrees well with experimental data, even for positions where the one-parameter correlations are poor. We find that many side chains experience a previously unrecognized type of transition state environment in which specific, native-like interactions are formed, but hydrophobic burial dominates. Implications of these results to the design and analysis of protein folding studies are discussed...|$|R
