40|$|How do {{the trade}} impacts of a {{safeguard}} measure - which is statutorily designed {{to follow the}} most-favored-nation (MFN) principle - compare to explicitly discriminatory measures such as antidumping? We address this question empirically by examining the trade effects of the 2002 US safeguard on steel imports and comparing this {{with the impact of}} other US trade remedies on steel imports in the 1990 s. We first estimate a fixed-effects model on a dynamic panel of product-level US steel imports over 1991 - 2003 and examine the potential discriminatory impact on foreign-produced steel of the 2002 â€œMFNâ€ safeguard that used relatively new tools in the policymakers’ arsenal: country and <b>product</b> <b>exclusions.</b> A unique data set on the excluded products allows us to document the sizable impact on trade of both forms of preferential treatment. We also exploit higher-frequency data to examine potential differences in the timing of the foreign export response to policies of differential treatment. Using quarterly data, we find that while developed country exporters respond more quickly when granted an exclusion, the developing-country exporters’ response is more persistent. Finally, while we find the full effect of the 2002 safeguard policy with country and <b>product</b> <b>exclusions</b> to be quite discriminatory, our results also highlight an important similarity between safeguards and preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Relative to antidumping measures, country and <b>product</b> <b>exclusions</b> from a safeguard allow the protection-imposing country to target preferential treatment more effectively toward specific foreign countries, much like a PTA, or even more narrowly toward a specific foreign firm. Thus costly trade diversion could be an even greater concern with a safeguard than with explicitly discriminatory protection such as antidumping.

40|$|The author {{investigates the}} effects of {{preferential}} trade agreements (PTAs) on bilateral trade flows using a comprehensive database of PTAs in force and a detailed matrix of world trade. He shows that total trade between PTA partners is a poor proxy for preferential trade (trade in tariff lines where preferences are likely to matter) : while the former amounted to one-third of global trade in 2000 - 02, the latter was between one-sixth and one-tenth of world trade. His gravity model estimates indicate that using total rather than preferential trade {{to assess the impact}} of PTAs leads to a significant downward bias in the PTA coefficient. The author finds that <b>product</b> <b>exclusions</b> and long phase-in periods significantly limit preferential trade, and their removal could more than double trade in tariff lines above 3 percent of most-favored-nation (MFN) duties.

The authors find that, under standard import price and substitution elasticity assumptions, eliminating tariffs on all imports from the European Union would increase ECOWAS'imports from the European Union by 10. 5 - 11. 5 percent for selected ECOWAS countries, namely Cape Verde, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal. This increase in imports would {{be accompanied by a}} 2. 4 - 5. 6 percent decrease in total government revenues, owing mainly to lower fiscal revenues. Tariff revenue losses should represent 1 percent of GDP in Nigeria, 1. 7 percent in Ghana, 2 percent in Senegal, and 3. 6 percent in Cape Verde. However, the revenue losses may be manageable because of several mitigating factors, in particular the likelihood of <b>product</b> <b>exclusions,</b> the length of the agreement's implementation period, and the scope for reform of exemption regimes. The large country-by-country differences in fiscal revenue loss suggest that domestic tax reforms and fiscal transfers within ECOWAS could be important complements to the agreement's implementation.

Although treatment options have been limited, advances in clinical care have doubled the life expectancy of affected boys over the last 2 - 3 decades, but do not address the primary etiology of DMD, the absence of dystrophin. Biological therapeutics are now becoming available, and antisense oligomer-mediated splice manipulation to exclude selected exons can overcome disease-causing mutations and restore dystrophin expression. We show that peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer induced splice-switching {{can also be used}} to alter isoform expression, or induce a frame-shift and prevent translation of functional <b>products.</b> <b>Exclusion</b> of selected exon blocks to yield in- frame transcripts can allow mapping of functional protein domains, based upon exon boundaries, and permits physiological evaluation of dystrophin isoforms to aid in the design of splice - manipulation therapies.

Total suppression of dystrophin gene expression was induced by selected exon removal and maintained for several weeks in vivo, resulting in severe dystrophic pathology in diaphragm within 4 weeks of commencing treatment in wild-type neonatal mice.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} a probiotic and a competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>product</b> injected in ovo on day 18 of incubation together with Marek's disease vaccine in eggs of 56 -week-old broiler breeders. Three experiments were carried out. The first trial evaluated {{the effect of}} treatments on hatchability, cecal colonization of Salmonella Heidelberg (SH), and intestinal mucosa immunity (immunoglobulin A levels in the intestinal fluid). The second trial evaluated {{the viability of the}} microorganisms in the products inoculated in a solution containing diluent and Marek's disease vaccine. The third trial evaluated the colonization of the cecal microbiota in non-challenged chickens during first four days of life by culturing cecal samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Hatchability was not affected by the treatments. SH cecal counts were reduced in three-day-old broilers inoculated in ovo with the competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>product.</b> Liver and spleen pool SH counts were not different among treatments. Broilers inoculated in ovo presented higher intestinal IgA titers 24 hours after SH challenge compared with the controls. When birds were not challenged, lower cecal microbial counts in aerobic culture were determined in the control group than in the probiotic group on day 3, and in the competitive exclusion group on day 2 when cultured in anaerobiosis. The products inoculated and diluted in the vaccine solution were viable at all analyzed periods when cultured in anaerobiosis. The {{results of this study suggest}} in-ovo inoculation is an effective route for the administration of the evaluated products, which effectively enhanced the broilers' immune response to a SH challenge, as shown by the increase in IgA titers, and the reduction in cecal Salmonella Heidelberg colonization with the in-ovo inoculation with the competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R
40|$|The rock-paper-scissor game [...] {{which is}} {{characterized}} by three strategies R,P,S, satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes P, P excludes R, and R excludes S [...] serves as a simple prototype for studying more complex non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems where interactions result in fitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners, classical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a general framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis reveals that coexistence {{is determined by the}} rates at which dominant strategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e. g. rock invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e. g. scissor gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near single strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion rates exceeds the <b>product</b> of the <b>exclusion</b> rates. Provided there is sufficient spatial variation in payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate $d^*$ required for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below $d^*$, the product of the invasion rates exceed the <b>product</b> of the <b>exclusion</b> rates and the rock-paper-scissor metacommunities persist regionally despite being extinction prone locally. For dispersal rates above $d^*$, the <b>product</b> of the <b>exclusion</b> rates exceed the product of the invasion rates and the strategies are extinction prone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vegetarians and vegans exclude certain {{food sources}} of vitamin D from their diet, {{but it is}} not clear to what extent this affects plasma {{concentrations}} of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D). The objective was to investigate differences in vitamin D intake and plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D among meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians and vegans. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: Plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations were measured in 2107 white men and women (1388 meat eaters, 210 fish eaters, 420 vegetarians and eighty-nine vegans) aged 20 - 76 years from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Oxford cohort. RESULTS: Plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations reflected the degree of animal <b>product</b> <b>exclusion</b> and, hence, dietary intake of vitamin D; meat eaters had the highest mean intake of vitamin D (3 · 1 (95 % CI 3 · 0, 3 · 2) μg/d) and mean plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations (77 · 0 (95 % CI 75 · 4, 78 · 8) nmol/l) and vegans the lowest (0 · 7 (95 % CI 0 · 6, 0 · 8) μg/d and 55 · 8 (95 % CI 51 · 0, 61 · 0) nmol/l, respectively). The magnitude of difference in 25 (OH) D concentrations between meat eaters and vegans was smaller (20 %) among those participants who had a blood sample collected during the summer months (July-September) compared with the winter months (38 %; January-March). The prevalence of low plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D (< 25 nmol/l) during the winter and spring ranged from < 1 % to 8 % across the diet groups.

40|$|AbstractThe microhole is an {{important}} basic element in microparts and devices. When ECM is used in electrochemical microdrilling (ECMD), the tool electrode is very small and the flow channel cannot be provided for electrolyte in electrode, so the electrolyte cannot be renewed rapidly. Therefore, the electrolyte cannot rapidly carry away the reaction products, such as gas bubbles, sludge and Joule heat, from the machining zone. The ions that are depleted during pulse-on period cannot easily be replenished by convection and diffusion of the electrolyte. These phenomena cause the resistance to be changed in the inter-electrode gaps. Variation in the resistance affects the machining accuracy and surface quality of microholes. It may sometimes cause short- circuiting, damaging the tool and workpiece during ECMD process because the inter-electrode gaps are small. However, the machining accuracy {{will be affected by}} stray current in ECM. The most effective way to improve is to coat the insulation layer on the electrode sidewall, so that current can only be accurately released from the bottom end. The life of the electrode would be reduced by thin-film cracks if the bonding force between the film and the electrode is too weak to machine a precious microhole. Therefore, this study proposed to use the helical electrode in order to promote the processing of <b>product</b> <b>exclusions.</b> The electrode is made by using the sol-gel method and dip coating method. The innovative ceramic and epoxy double layer films is used to avoid side machining. The study results found that the electrode surface corrosion and adding the surfactants into sol-gel can be used to improve film adhesion on the helical edge. The electrode has voltage resistance up to 19. 4 V by indirectly etching of 10 seconds. Finally, the coated electrode is tested to know the ECMD performance. The process parameter EB 10 C 01 E could obtain effective improvement on average hole diameter from 426. 5 μm to 232. 0 μm. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a low price and high quality of the helical electrodes to achieve high shape accuracy for ECMD process...|$|R
40|$|This paper assembles {{detailed}} information on the market access provisions in trade in goods contained in 192 active regional trade agreements (RTAs) notified to the WTO as of November 2010. Although market access provisions in trade in goods in RTAs have been addressed {{in a number of}} studies, much of this work has been limited to subsets of RTAs, particularly plurilateral RTAs involving three or more parties. The goal of the current study is to expand beyond the more commonly studied RTAs and to include all RTAs notified to the WTO for which data are available. This task has been facilitated by the recent Transparency Mechanism for RTAs (TM), adopted in 2006, that provides the basis for the systematic provision of detailed tariff and trade data by WTO Members engaged in RTAs. This information has been supplemented by other public sources of data, where available. A number of trends are evident. While a majority of RTAs result in a reasonably high degree of liberalization overall (with developing countries often liberalizing as much or more than developed countries), liberalization is not uniform across products or RTA parties. In some RTAs the degree of liberalization appears to be a negotiated outcome, depending on the RTA partner. Agricultural goods continue to be subject to lower levels of liberalization, frequent <b>product</b> <b>exclusions</b> and systematic protection in some RTAs, regardless of the RTA partner's comparative advantage. Nonetheless, a lower level of ambition in some RTAs is tempered by a commitment to negotiate further concessions or expand upon the RTA's scope at some future point: more than half the RTAs analysed contain such a commitment. Much {{has been written about the}} potential for the multilateralization of commitments undertaken in RTAs. While there may be scope for positive externalities in terms of regulatory convergence particularly with regard to services liberalization undertaken in RTAs, there is less evidence in this study to suggest that increased market access in merchandise goods leads to a more favourable trading environment for third parties. Continuing constructive engagement by WTO Members in the Transparency Mechanism through the provision of data, timely notifications, and submission of implementation reports will increase the availability of tariff and trade liberalization data, thus facilitating further examination of the topics highlighted in the study as worthy of future research...|$|R
