5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} <b>proteinuria,</b> the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of <b>proteinuria,</b> some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|In adults, kidney {{involvement}} progresses to end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease. <b>Proteinuria,</b> hypertension at presentation, and pathology features (crescentic changes, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) predicted progression. About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with <b>proteinuria</b> may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|The major {{criteria}} include {{liver disease}} with portal hypertension; kidney failure; {{the absence of}} shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect {{the function of the}} kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of <b>proteinuria</b> (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and <b>proteinuria),</b> but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have <b>proteinuria</b> (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including <b>proteinuria</b> and glucosuria.|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{proteins}} {{were first}} reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into {{the cause of}} <b>proteinuria.</b> They are potent human allergens, and are largely responsible {{for a number of}} animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|E
25|$|Male gender, <b>proteinuria</b> (especially > 2 g/day), hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, older age, {{familial}} disease and elevated creatinine concentrations are markers {{of a poor}} outcome. Frank hematuria has shown discordant results with most studies showing a better prognosis, perhaps related to the early diagnosis, except for one group which reported a poorer prognosis. <b>Proteinuria</b> and hypertension are the most powerful prognostic factors in this group.|$|E
25|$|Examination of {{the urine}} (urinalysis) allows a direct {{assessment}} for possible kidney problems, {{which may be}} suggested by appearance {{of blood in the}} urine (haematuria), protein in the urine (<b>proteinuria),</b> pus cells in the urine (pyuria) or cancer cells in the urine. A 24-hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss (see <b>proteinuria),</b> urine output, creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules.|$|E
25|$|Urinalysis {{may show}} {{white blood cells}} and protein in the urine (pyuria and <b>proteinuria)</b> without {{evidence}} of bacterial growth.|$|E
25|$|Other false {{positive}} of high BAC and also blood reading {{are related to}} Patients with <b>proteinuria</b> and hematuria, due to kidney metabolization and failure.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, <b>proteinuria,</b> hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|Patients are {{referred}} to nephrology specialists after a urinalysis, for various reasons, such as acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, <b>proteinuria,</b> kidney stones, hypertension, and disorders of acid/base or electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Common {{findings}} {{in people with}} analgesic nephropathy include headache, anemia, high blood pressure (hypertension), and white blood cells in the urine (pyuria). Some individuals with analgesic nephropathy may also have protein in their urine (<b>proteinuria).</b>|$|E
25|$|In his 1973 PhD. thesis, On Renal Handling of Serum Proteins, Ravnskov {{introduced}} the albumin/creatinine clearance ratio, {{a more accurate}} way to measure <b>proteinuria.</b> He {{was also the first}} to describe the peritubular uptake of low-molecular-weight proteins.|$|E
25|$|The most {{compelling}} {{evidence for the}} treatment of nephropathy has been found: This combination therapy partially reversed the <b>proteinuria</b> and also exhibited a renoprotective effect in patients afflicted with diabetic nephropathy, and pediatric IgA nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proteinuria</b> ≥ 0.3 grams (300mg) or more {{of protein}} in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to {{creatinine}} ratio ≥ 0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).|$|E
25|$|Membranous {{glomerulonephritis}} is {{a serious}} human disease that can be teated with ACTH, which is a known agonist of MC1R. In a rat model of nephritis {{it was found that}} treatment with a different agonist of MC1R improved aspects of kidney morphology and reduced <b>proteinuria,</b> which may help explain the benefit of ACTH in humans.|$|E
25|$|A smaller {{proportion}} (20-30%), {{usually the}} older population, have microscopic hematuria and <b>proteinuria</b> (less than 2 gram/day). These patients {{may not have}} any symptoms and are only clinically found if a physician decides to take a urine sample. Hence, the disease is more commonly diagnosed in situations where screening of urine is compulsory (e.g., schoolchildren in Japan).|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated <b>proteinuria</b> and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. <b>Proteinuria,</b> usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the {{serine protease}}s: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased {{by the presence}} of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g., in <b>proteinuria)</b> leads to thrombophilia.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia is a {{progressive}} disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction {{are indicative of}} severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or <b>proteinuria</b> >5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting. Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.|$|E
25|$|Dihydropyridine (DHP) {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} {{are derived from}} the molecule dihydropyridine and often used to reduce systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. Sometimes when {{they are used to}} treat angina, the vasodilation and hypotension can lead to reflex tachycardia, which can be detrimental for patients with ischemic symptoms because of the resulting increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen <b>proteinuria</b> in patients with nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis. Symptoms of scleroderma renal crisis are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure {{with evidence of}} acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), azotemia (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and <b>proteinuria</b> (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative.|$|E
25|$|Proximal RTA (pRTA) {{is caused}} by a failure of the {{proximal}} tubular cells to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the alpha intercalated cells can produce H+ to acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called Fanconi syndrome, in which there is also phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, uricosuria, and tubular <b>proteinuria.</b>|$|E
25|$|SS {{can damage}} vital organs {{of the body}} with {{symptoms}} that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to <b>proteinuria</b> (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{clinical}} trial at Massachusetts General Hospital used the cancer drug Bevacizumab (commercial name: Avastin) to treat 10 patients with neurofibromatosis type II. The result {{was published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine. Of the ten patients treated with bevacizumab, tumours shrank in 9 of them, with the median best response rate of 26%. Hearing improved {{in some of the}} patients, but improvements were not strongly correlated with tumour shrinkage. Bevacizumab works by cutting the blood supply to the tumours and thus depriving them of their growth vector. Side effects during the study included alanine aminotransferase, <b>proteinuria,</b> and hypertension (elevated blood pressure) among others. A separate trial, published in The Neuro-oncology Journal, show 40% tumour reduction in the two patients with NF2, along with significant hearing improvement.|$|E
25|$|Bevacizumab {{can also}} be {{combined}} with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes {{high blood pressure and}} <b>proteinuria.</b> The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to fistulae or bowel perforation. Vintafolide, which consists of an antifolate conjugated with vinblastine, is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers. Another potential immunotherapy is trastuzumab, which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. Combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. Trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines, including TroVax.|$|E
25|$|Patients with HUS {{commonly}} {{exhibit the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which can include abdominal pain, low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage) decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells) anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (a protein waste product generated by muscle metabolism and eliminated renally, <b>proteinuria</b> (indicative of kidney injury), confusion, fatigue, edema (swelling), nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Additionally, patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, and coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.|$|E
2500|$|Suspicion for {{pre-eclampsia}} {{should be}} maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, {{even in the}} absence of <b>proteinuria.</b> Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of <b>proteinuria.</b> In the absence of <b>proteinuria,</b> the presence of new-onset hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia: ...|$|E
2500|$|Chronic {{kidney failure}} (no {{previous}} symptoms, presents with anemia, hypertension and other symptoms of kidney failure, [...] {{in people who}} probably had longstanding undetected microscopic hematuria and/or <b>proteinuria)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{subset of}} IgA {{nephropathy}} patients, who have minimal change disease on light microscopy and clinically have nephrotic syndrome, show an exquisite response to steroids, behaving {{more or less}} like minimal change disease. In other patients, the evidence for steroids is not compelling. [...] Short courses of high dose steroids have been proven to lack benefit. [...] However, in patients with preserved renal function and <b>proteinuria</b> (1-3.5 g/day), a recent prospective study has shown that 6 months regimen of steroids may lessen <b>proteinuria</b> and preserve renal function. However, the risks of long-term steroid use have to be weighed in such cases. [...] It {{should be noted that}} the study had 10 years of patient follow-up data, and did show a benefit for steroid therapy; there was a lower chance of reaching end-stage renal disease (renal function so poor that dialysis was required) in the steroid group. [...] Importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in both groups equally.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} {{angiotensin}} II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists, losartan is indicated {{for the treatment}} of hypertension. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with a positive clinical outcome in that regard. It is a suitable pharmacological agent for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria (>30mg/24 hours) or <b>proteinuria</b> (>900mg/24 hours).|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of vitamin D overdose which {{are those of}} hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. [...] These may be followed by polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. [...] Furthermore, <b>proteinuria,</b> urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop. [...] Other {{symptoms of}} vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study from}} Mayo Clinic did show that long term {{treatment}} with {{omega-3 fatty acids}} results in reduction of progression to kidney failure, without, however, reducing <b>proteinuria</b> in a subset of patients with high risk of worsening kidney function. [...] However, these results have not been reproduced by other study groups and in two subsequent meta-analyses. However, fish oil therapy {{does not have the}} drawbacks of immunosuppressive therapy. [...] Also, apart from its unpleasant taste and abdominal discomfort, it is relatively safe to consume.|$|E
