40|$|In the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, {{sentence}} pairs {{are classified}} {{into one of}} three se-mantic relations: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION or UNKNOWN. While we find some sentence pairs hold full entailments or contradictions, {{there are a number}} of pairs that partially entail or contradict one another depending on a specific situation. These <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> sentence pairs contain useful infor-mation for opinion mining and other such tasks, but it is difficult for Internet users to access this knowledge because current frameworks do not differentiate between full contradictions and partial contradictions. In this paper, under current approaches to semantic relation recognition, we define a new semantic relation known as CONFINEMENT in order to recognize this useful information. This information is classified as either CONTRADICTION or ENTAILMENT. We provide a series of semantic templates to recognize CON-FINEMENT relations in Web texts, and then implement a system for recognizing CONFINEMENT between sentence pairs. We show that our proposed system can obtains a F-score of 61 % for recognizing CON-FINEMENT in Japanese-language Web texts, and it outperforms a baseline which does not use a manually compiled list of lexico-syntactic patterns to instantiate the semantic templates. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{structure}} of repetition, asMeir Sternberg (1978) defines it, consists in the repeated {{presentation of a}} fabulaic event along the text continuum. It has three types of component members: (1) forecast (e. g., command, scenario); (2) enactment (represent-ing the forecast’s objective realization, as communicated by an authorized narrator); and (3) report (about an enactment, a forecast, or another report, all delivered by some character). This research examines the repetition structure in cinematic narrative: specifically, in heist, adventure, and military operation films. Throughout, the argu-ment proceeds with special reference to these genres, {{as well as to}} the cinema’smedium, practice, and conventions in general, often citing literary parallels or precedents for comparison. It examines the different elements that serve to (re) compose the repetition structure for certain ends; the types of member brought together within the structure; their size, number, forms of transmission, order of appearance, representational pro-portion, and possible interrelations (overlap, <b>partial</b> overlap, <b>contradiction,</b> expansion or summary of a previous member). Above all, the analysis relates these interplays themselves to the structure’s functions at the level of plot, meaning, and rhetoric, notably including their generic variations, as exemplified by the three focal genres...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The magnitude of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing of climate, in which aerosols can affect the earth’s climate by modifying cloud microphysics and altering cloud albedo and cloud fraction, is the largest unknown in estimating the total anthropogenic forcing that causes climate change. Due to its complex geographic and seasonal variability, aerosol forcing was suggested as a possible fingerprint to {{the response of the}} climate system to human impact. Not much observational evidence of the indirect aerosol effect exists and existing observations present a confusing picture of <b>partial</b> answers and <b>contradictions.</b> Previous studies using AVHRR satellite data in the biomass burning regime of Brazil were successful in identifying the indirect effect on a regional scale and suggesting the intervention of an additional controlling factor- water vapor. Satellite data provide a large statistical sampling of the aerosol effect on clouds, an advantage in sorting between the many factors affecting the properties of individual clouds. We propose a study that would continue in the same spirit as these previous AVHRR studies, using three data sets with different spatial resolutions. The range of spatial resolutions spans the 50 m of the ER- 2 MODIS Airborne Simulator to the 1 and 4 km of AVHRR and later EOS-MODIS which will be launched i...|$|R

We are interested in the average network load and routing latency and how they depend on the number of hosts in the DVE. To this end, we study a prototypical DVE consisting of a simple game scenario and a P 2 P architecture based on Pastry and Scribe as proposed by Knutsson et al. in their important work ”Peer-To-Peer Support for Massively Multiplayer Games”[3]. Both our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the network load as well as the routing latency grow O(log(N)), where N is the number of hosts (c. f. figure 6. 9 and 6. 11). Our results are in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> to those given by Knutsson et al. As shown in Fig. 6. 9, their experimental results of average message rate are constant for 1000 and 4000 hosts, while ours scale with O(log(N)).

However, these directives exist in contradiction to the centralising tendencies inherent in New Labour’s approach to local government, which emphasises top-down management and financial efficiency. New Labour’s drive towards locality-based democratic renewal also sits in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> {{with the interests of}} LGBT people, whose identities are not necessarily defined by where they live. In addition, there are tensions between LGBT interests and those of the faith and BME communities, and a need to examine the ways in which these play out in the democratic arena. Further issues concern {{the way in which the}} democratic processes that are taking place as a result of the local government modernisation agenda may provoke clashes between the representative and formal participative structures found in the statutory sector and the flatter types of organisation that are more typical of community groups. Lastly, there are ongoing debates about universalist, as opposed to particularist, approaches to democratic participation. Do gender and sexual minorities require methods of engagement specific to their sexed/gendered identities, or are mainstreamed approaches that amalgamate groups and emphasise alliances more appropriate? This paper explores the above debates, drawing on two empirical research projects: A completed central government funded project about equality and diversity in local government in England, and an ESRC funded study of LGBT equalities in local government, which is currently in its early stages...|$|E
40|$|We model future {{changes in}} land {{biogeochemistry}} and biogeography across East Africa. East Africa {{is one of}} few tropical regions where general circulation model (GCM) future climate projections exhibit a robust response of strong future warming and general annual-mean rainfall increases. Eighteen future climate projections from nine GCMs participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment were used as input to the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), which predicted vegetation patterns and carbon storage in agreement with satellite observations and forest inventory data under the present-day climate. All simulations showed future increases in tropical woody vegetation over the region {{at the expense of}} grasslands. Regional increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (18 – 36 %) and total carbon storage (3 – 13 %) by 2080 – 2099 compared with the present-day were common to all simulations. Despite decreases in soil carbon after 2050, seven out of nine simulations continued to show an annual net land carbon sink in the final decades of the 21 st century because vegetation biomass continued to increase. The seasonal cycles of rainfall and soil moisture show future increases in wet season rainfall across the GCMs with generally little change in dry season rainfall. Based on the simulated present-day climate and its future trends, the GCMs can be grouped into four broad categories. Overall, our model results suggest that East Africa, a populous and economically poor region, is likely to experience some ecosystem service benefits through increased precipitation, river runoff and fresh water availability. Resulting enhancements in NPP may lead to improved crop yields in some areas. Our results stand in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> to other studies that suggest possible negative consequences for agriculture, biodiversity and other ecosystem services caused by temperature increases...|$|E

40|$|Today {{the state}} of the {{agricultural}} sector in most economies in transition is disappointing and caused by unresolved social and economic contradictions in its development, which in the transformations only worsened. Therefore, to develop effective agricultural policies to address the existing contradictions in the agricultural sector, it is needed to find their nature and causes and development. This is what will resolve current contradictions and predict the natural course of development of agrarian relations in the future. The subject of the investigation – nature and causes of economic and social contradictions of the agrarian sector in transitional economies. To clarify these issues there were used methods such as dialectic, systemic and structural, analysis and synthesis, unity logical and historical approaches, induction and deduction, etc. The aim is to find out the nature of economic and social contradictions of the agricultural sector, their causes and development in transitional economies. Based on these methods, it is found that a contradiction is an internal source of development, and causes of changes and development of the contradictions are inherent within it. That means that the contradiction is a process that is changing, evolving itself, as its domestic activity and through interaction with the struggle of opposites. Accordingly, the economic and social contradictions {{in the development of the}} agricultural sector are of objective nature. Mistakes in the actions of agrarian relations do not generate new conflicts, but only reinforce the negative side of contradictions inhibiting its solution. This is due to the fact that every contradiction has its objective course of development and natural solutions through new quality reproduction with the peculiar contradictions of development. The subjective factor can only help or hinder solving contradictions, lead to a <b>partial</b> solution of <b>contradictions.</b> Errors are mostly subjective and complicate the process of identifying and resolving contradictions. Reasons for contradictions in the agricultural sector can be divided into two groups: objective (generated by the struggle of opposites) leading to the solution of contradictions of the previous system and the emergence of new contradictions inherent in the future system; objective and subjective, which because of the dominance of the subjective factor at the stage of resolving contradictions lead to the preservation of the previous system contradictions, increase their negative side, and to the emergence of problems and difficulties in resolving existing contradictions. The development of the agricultural sector is determined by imperatives (conditions and directions of action of agrarian relations), which can be divided into the following groups: social, economic, national, historical, technological, informational, cultural, international, religious, political. Development of contradictions is inextricably linked with the development of economic systems and elements of the structure. After all elements of the economic system and its structure are the opposite, being in contradiction with itself and with each other. In developing economies, as well as the development of contradictions, stages of development are taken place. There are two common stages in the development of economic systems caused by cyclicity – rising stage of development (from the emergence to the peak) and the descending phase of development (from the peak to its decay). Rising stage of the life cycle stage of the economic system includes the origin, formation stage and stage performance. The downward phase is defined by stages of destruction of an integrated economic system, collapse and disappearance. These stages of development of economic systems are in close contact with the stages, phases of contradictions. Transitions from one state to another economic system are based on the transformation processes that change the internal state of the system. Transformation processes can occur both evolutionary (accumulating changes that are in the process of transformation) and revolutionary (under the influence of subjective factors) through reforms, which are the adjustment of individual elements of the system without changing its foundations...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} CO(2) concentration CO(2) {{and climate}} change {{are expected to have}} a major effect on terrestrial ecosystem hydrological cycles and plant water stress in the coming decades. The present study investigates the potential responses of terrestrial ecosystem hydrological cycles and plant water stress across China to elevated CO(2) {{and climate change}} in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries using the calibrated and validated Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM) and eight climate change scenarios. The spatiotemporal change patterns of estimated evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, runoff, and plant water stress due to climate change and elevated CO(2) are plotted singly and in combination. Positive future trends in ET, soil moisture, and runoff-although differing greatly among regions-are projected. Resultant plant water stress over China's terrestrial ecosystem generally could be eased substantially through the twenty-first century under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider economic concerns. By contrast, under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider environmental concerns, plant water stress could be eased until 2060, then begin to fluctuate until 2100. The net impact of physiological and structural vegetation responses to elevated CO(2) could result in an increasing trend in runoff in southern and northeastern China, and a decreasing trend in runoff in northern and northwestern China in the twentieth century. It is projected to reduce ET by 1. 5 x 10 (9) to 6. 5 x 10 (9) m(3) yr(- 1) on average, and increase runoff by 1. 0 x 10 (9) to 5. 4 x 10 (9) m(3) yr(- 1) during 2001 - 2100 across China's terrestrial ecosystems, although the spatial change pattern could be quite diverse. These findings, in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> to previous results, present an improved understanding of transient responses of China's terrestrial ecosystem hydrological cycles and plant water stress to climate change and elevated CO(2) in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptability}} {{of children}} to the school environment and their potential to succeed there is {{closely linked to the}} development of their cognitive and social skills. These are primarily linked to personal factors -physical maturity as well as mental or emotional maturity and the environment in which those children grow up. This fact is evident in children growing up in disadvantageous socio-economic conditions. In general the school readiness of children from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds is affected by the specific environment, the primary family {{and a number of other}} factors. A significant support of psychosocial development and successful adaptability at the start of the compulsory education is the preschool education, especially for children growing up in disadvantageous socio-economic conditions. The presented study focused on the effect of pre-school education on school readiness in first grade children. 24 children from socially disadvantaged environment were tested twice - for first time shortly after the beginning of their first grade and for the second time before the end of the first grade. The children were then divided into two groups - those who attended pre-school education and those who started school without any pre-school education programme. The attendance thus made the independent variable in the research design. There were three research questions - what is the impact of pre-school education on: Q 1 : general cognitive functioning (tested using the Intelligence Image Scale), Q 2 : on the ability to acquire the reading skills (tested using the Reversal test by Edfeldt) and Q 3 on the social maturity of the children (tested using the Vineland scale of adaptive behaviour) The results of the study suggest that pre-school education has significant effect on social skills and this effect increases during the first year. The reading skills were better in children who attended the pre-school education however this impact decreases over time. There was no statistically significant difference between cognitive functioning in both groups of children. No negative effects of pre-school education were identified. The results are in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> to other research and literature - specifically the outcome in cognitive functioning was unexpected. This can be attributed to limited number of participants. However we suppose that the results support the importance of pre-school education. Its impact could be further studied using longitudinal studies as well as focusing in more detail on the individual aspects of social exclusion and its effects on school readiness...|$|E
40|$|The {{attention}} {{of the scientific community}} has recently been addressed on various aspects of the Messinian endemic vertebrates from the foreland sector of the Abruzzo - Apulian paleobioprovince: several new papers dealing with ruminants, glirids, insectivores, cricetids, as well as with biochronological, palaeographic and biogeographic aspects have been published in the last ten years. New fossils finds enriched the taxonomic composition of the Gargano endemic fauna: a new Cricetodontinae genus, a new Murinae genus representing the direct ancestor of the endemic murid Mikrotia, and a new species of primitive giant moonrat Deinogalerix. The recently published taxonomic description of the smaller moonrat Apulogalerix also contributed to a better knowledge of the endemic Gargano fauna. Although these new data and contributions brought substantial improvement to the taxonomy of the fauna and to the ecology of the moonrats, the debate on the origin and age of dispersal of most of the faunal elements is still open. In this contribution we present some of the open problems regarding the origin of several of the elements of the “Terre Rosse” fauna. The study of the small moonrat Apulogalerix has shown that its most likely continental ancestor should be found in Parasorex socialis – ibericus. Such philogenetic relationship constrains the age of its dispersal on the insular realm to the Late Vallesian (MN 9 - 10). This is in <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> with paleogeographic reconstruction based on geological data, which suggest that the time slice MN 6 -MN 11 is the least favourable time interval for the dispersal of the taxa on the insular domain. The study in progress of the new genus of Cricetodontinae shows that this form is not clearly related to any of the known continental genera. The features of this new genus, however, are more compatible with a possible derivation from some Cricetodon-like genus. This affinity suggests an age of dispersal of Early Miocene-early Middle Miocene (MN 4 - 5) or older and implies that the “Terre Rosse” fauna is the result of different dispersals event scattered in different time slices. A still open problem is represented by the Crocidosoricinae shrew named as Lartetium in the literature. Indeed, the absence of residual a 3, a character considered as diagnostic of the genus, renders the generic attribution very problematic and would require further investigations. The new discovered Murinae genus shares a number of synapormophies with Mikrotia genus. Its description should be completed, however, by the comparison with the smallest and most primitive Mikrotia from the Terre Rosse. The question of the continental ancestor of this taxon is still unresolved and the preliminary comparisons with European Murinae taxa unfortunately did not shed light on its philogenetic relationship and therefore this matter deserves much more efforts. The Apodemus species from the “Terre Rosse” has never been studied in details. Preliminary observations pointed out that this form shows similarities with late Turolian-Ruscinian Apodemus forms from continental Europe. A more detailed analysis, currently under development, seems to confirm this interpretation and, therefore, permits to exclude a derivation of this form from more primitive Apodemus species (referred to as genus “Parapodemus” by several authors) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{electoral system}} {{constitutes}} a crucial {{factor for the}} formation of the party system, the political and the parliamentary systems. Anyway between the electoral and the party systems functions no one-way causal nexus. In view of the first post-war elections (1946), efforts were made for an approach between the Populists and the Liberals, while the controversy between the Regent and the Government about the electoral system ended through the intervention of the British in favor of the latter. The beginning of the post-war era finds the party system in Greece in a state of unstable balance. The electoral system’s problem occupies a central position in the post-civil war conjuncture. The political landscape’s fragmenting, the “transitional” character of the first post-civil war Parliament and the governmental instability that followed characterize the Greek political life after the civil war. Soon (in 1951) political and institutional developments moved towards the introduction of a model of the “reinforced” proportional representation’ s electoral system. The elections results indicated the partial confirmation and the <b>partial</b> <b>contradiction</b> of the pre-electoral calculations, on which the architects of the electoral law of 1951 were based. The enactment of the Constitution of 1952 was followed by a political controversy, which was marked by the “allied factor’s” open interventions and lead to the establishment of the majority electoral system. The outcome of the electoral fight of 1952 meant the transition from “polarized multi-pluralism” to the “dominant party’s system”. The new government adopted (in 1954) an extreme majority electoral system, which, although it remained unapplied, indicated clearly the tendencies of political dominance that certain political forces cherished in that particular conjuncture. The establishment of a complicated mixed electoral system accompanied the appearance of a new leader (K. Karamanlis) in the political landscape (1955 - 1956). Its application contributed to the formation of the unique in Greek history “popular front” and produced a singular election result. In 1958 through an intricate political procedure the “reinforced” proportional representation’s electoral system was established. In spite of the common designation, the institutional profile of the new electoral system presented important differences compared to that of 1951. The electoral fight’s outcome raised EDA (the “United Democratic Left”) to the rank of the opposition’s largest party. In 1961 a persistent demand and a long debate concerning the adoption of a new electoral system characterized the conjuncture. The Government responded to this demand by making certain “concessions”. But the opposition denounced the conditions in which the elections took place as highly irregular. The “reinforced” proportional representation’ s system was once again modified in 1963 during a period of political turmoil, which was marked by crucial political and institutional developments. The limited electoral reform of 1963 however had no essential impact on the party formations’ s parliamentary representation. On the eve of the April’s coup (1967) and in the palace intervention’ s (1965 - 1967) conjuncture an unsuccessful effort was made towards the reintroduction of the proportional representation’ s electoral system. The political and institutional developments concerning the electoral system indicated a group of consensus elements that characterized the political life in Greece during the first post-war decades. ...|$|E
