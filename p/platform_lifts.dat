40|$|During 1998 - 2003 {{fisheries}} production {{tends to}} decrease for Muncar, Banyuwangi, East Java. Growing number of fishing gears (especially the set fishing gear like the bambbo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net) in the Pang Pang bay {{even though its}} presence is not allowed, this is might be the caused of the decreased fisheries production. As for the bamboo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net itself has many factors that affect the catch effort productivity. Some of them were {{examined in this study}} which are the density (unit/ha), water depth (m) and time of hauling (min). From this study, we expected to know how far the influence of each factors as well as the mathematical models of it. This study results shows that the density of the bamboo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net greatly affect the fishing gear productivity, that the higher the density number will lead to further decline in the fishing gear productivity. The water depth also has an effect, in which the deeper the waters of the fishing gear, the more catch result get.

50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift,</b> input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|R

Into the first swing, the gondola immediately begins rotating slowly as each consecutive swing intensifies.

50|$|While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a {{powered lift}} {{to assist the}} {{occupant}} in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans, however, require use of a platform lift. There {{are two types of}} <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted {{in the back of the}} vehicle for rear-entry applications.|$|E

The old platforms were also redeveloped, with the focus on the entrance area with a partially glazed roof. The newly built <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> were boarded up for months due to the lack of a Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approval.

50|$|ASME A17.1 Appendix N {{lists the}} {{recommended}} frequency for conveyance inspections and tests. Each Authority Having Jurisdiction has authority {{to determine the}} frequency for inspection in their jurisdiction. However, the International Code Council, the most commonly adopted national standard for building codes in the US, adopts the recommended frequency of Appendix N in its entirety. In general, a QEI certified elevator inspector is required to perform a periodic inspection on passenger and freight elevators and escalators every six months. Additionally, each conveyance is required to {{have a series of}} safety tests completed annually by qualified elevator maintenance personnel (as defined by ASME A17.1). This test is required to be witnessed by a QEI inspector that does not have a personal financial interest in, or be employed by someone that has a financial interest in the results of the test. (This would be considered an unethical conflict of interest) In summary, most elevators, escalators, <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> and other conveyances that are permitted to carry people, are required to have two periodic inspections and one annual test each year. Additionally, all new and renovated elevators require an acceptance inspection and test to verify that any new or substantially modernized equipment conforms to the latest codes and standards.|$|E
