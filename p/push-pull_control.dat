40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ‘push–pull’ or ‘stimulo-deterrent diversionary’ strategy {{in relation to}} current and potential examples from our own experiences. The push–pull effect is established by exploiting semiochemicals to repel insect pests from the crop (‘push’) and to attract them into trap crops (‘pull’). The systems exemplified here {{have been developed for}} subsistence farming in Africa and delivery of the semiochemicals is entirely by companion cropping, i. e. intercropping for the push and trap cropping for the pull. The main target was a series of lepidopterous pests attacking maize and other cereals. Although the area given to the cereal crop itself is reduced under the push–pull system, higher yields are produced per unit area. An important spin-off from the project is that the companion crops are valuable forage for farm animals. Leguminous intercrops also provide advantages with regard to plant nutrition and some of the trap crops help with water retention and in reducing land erosion. A major benefit is that certain intercrop plants provide dramatic control of the African witchweed (striga). Animal husbandry forms an essential part of intensive subsistence agriculture in Africa and developments using analogous <b>push–pull</b> <b>control</b> strategies for insect pests of cattle are exemplified...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{electronically}} {{controlled slipping}} clutch is gradually increasing for a marine propulsion system. This system can provide a continuous change of propeller revolution even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the slipping clutch itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a <b>push-pull</b> <b>control</b> system using two slipping clutches {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional slipping clutch. For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system. As the result, this push-pull controlled slipping clutch system will be very useful for a marine propulsion system. 第 6 回舶用機関国際シンポジウム ISME (International Symposium on Marine Engineering) Tokyo 2000, 場所：日本都市センター会館, 会期： 10 月 23 日- 27...|$|E

The response of M. aeneus to non-host plant volatiles was investigated in laboratory assays to establish whether they {{have any effect on}} host plant location behaviour. Two approaches were used. First a novel, moving-air bioassay using air funnels was developed to compare the response of M. aeneus to several non-host plant essential oils. The beetles avoided the host plant flowers in the presence of non-host volatiles, suggesting that M. aeneus uses olfactory cues in host location and/or acceptance. The results were expressed as 'repellency values' in order to compare the effects of the different oils tested. Lavender (Lavendula angustifolia Miller) (Lamiaceae) essential oil gave the highest repellency value. In addition, a four-arm olfactometer was used to investigate olfactory responses, as this technique eliminated the influence of host plant visual and contact cues. The attraction to host plant volatiles was reduced by the addition of non-host plant volatiles, but in addition to masking the host plant volatiles, the non-host volatiles were avoided when these were presented alone. This is encouraging for the potential use of non-host plants within a push-pull strategy to reduce the pest colonisation of crops.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of the agricultural sector {{in many developing countries}} has been rated as below average, in particular the staple cereal crops whose productivity is limited by both biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, underperformance by the agricultural sector has in part been attributed to the inability of women to access resources, yet they represent a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy through their roles as farmers and entrepreneurs. These challenges can be overcome by understanding gender roles and perceptions, and aligning innovations to fit the preferences of specific gender. This study evaluated gender specific perceptions and the extent of adoption of a climate-smart <b>push–pull</b> technology for <b>controlling</b> stemborers, African witch weed (Striga spp.), and improving soil fertility in drier agro-ecological zones where these constraints are quickly spreading.

Due to their adaptation to acidic, low-fertility soils, millions of hectares of Brachiaria species have been sown as improved pastures in South and Central America, especially B. brizantha cv. Marandu and B. decumbens cv. Basilisk. Due to B. decumbens' susceptibility to spittlebug insect pests in the Americas, CIAT in Colombia and EMBRAPA in Brazil initiated breeding programmes in the 1980 s. First cultivars released from CIAT's breeding programme – cvs. Mulato and Mulato-II – have also been investigated in African countries. They have been examined for integration in conservation agriculture systems (Madagascar), for drought and acidic soil tolerance (Rwanda) and for intercropping forages in dairy systems (Uganda, Madagascar), among others. Seed sales to African countries suggest that an area of at least 1, 000 ha has been sown so far. The largest adoption of cv. Mulato-II is currently happening in eastern Africa, where it is used by over 20, 000 farmers as a trap plant in the <b>push-pull</b> system for <b>control</b> of maize stem borers and parasitic Striga weed.

40|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} {{is gaining}} importance for studying X-ray space {{sources such as}} single and binary stars, neutron stars, supernovae and black holes. Due to atmospheric absorption, X-ray telescopes must operate in space on satellites. Among the causes limiting the resolution of modern telescopes are distortions in mirrors shape. An innovative approach for X-ray mirrors aims at correcting the shape errors by means of piezo-ceramic actuators glued {{to the back of}} the mirrors, thus creating an “active mirror”. In order to test the viability of shape correction, we fabricated [1] a prototype of a thin glass active mirror, sized 20 cm x 20 cm with a 400 um thickness (Fig. 1). The mirror can allocate up to 25 piezo actuators connected to the external driving electronics by means of conductive paths, created on the back of the mirror by metal evaporation followed by a microlithographic process for selectively etching the metal. We also designed and built [2] a modular multichannel voltage amplifier (Fig. 2), driving up to 16 piezo actuators. At beginning we considered several high voltage monolithic operational amplifiers (OP AMP), capable of managing the specified output voltages (± 70 V). However all of them had to be ruled out due to their high quiescent currents, giving around 0. 35 W power dissipation per channel. So we used a different approach. Each channel consists of two stages (Fig. 3). The first stage is a conventional OP AMP, powered by a ± 12 V dual supply. It drives in <b>push-pull</b> the <b>control</b> LED’s of two high voltage optocouplers (TLP 627 by Toshiba), whose output transistors are connected in series between the ± 70 V dual supply. It recalls a “totem pole” configuration, where the two optocouplers act as pull-up and pull-down devices. As the OP AMP driving stage operates at low voltages, its power consumption is quite low. Moreover, the output stage, based on optocouplers, has a very low bias current (around 0. 1 mA), giving a power consumption of about 15 mW per channel. The voltage feedback, derived from the output voltage, guarantees the desired signal amplification and linearity. The amplifier has an overall voltage amplification of 11 and a bandwidth limited to 100 Hz, adequate to the typical control signals used to drive the piezo actuators, which are generated by an external 16 channels, 16 bit resolution, USB digital to analog converter. The amplifier also includes a “high voltage“ power supply, based on a micropower isolated flyback converter (LT 8300 by Linear Technology). Using a dual output transformer with a 1 : 5 : 5 winding ratio, it produces a ± 70 V dual voltage output starting from a single 12 V supply, with a nominal maximum output current of 4 mA. The whole 16 channels piezo driver thus only needs a ± 12 V supply. Thanks to the adopted strategies, the total power consumption for the 16 channel voltage amplifier has been measured to be within 0. 5 W...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) {{serves as a}} {{neurotransmitter}} and thereby provides a functional vegetative connection between the brain and the ovary. In the present study, magnocellular neurones of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in animals subjected to cold exposure were studied to determine the hypothalamic origin of the TRH involved in this pathway. In situ hybridisation analysis of hypothalamic tissue showed that cold exposure causes a two-fold increase in {{the total number of}} neurones expressing TRH mRNA in the PVN. Immunohistochemical studies showed that TRH peptide is localised to the magnocellular PVN and that the number of TRH immunoreactive cells increases two-fold following 64 h of cold exposure. Double-immunostaining for MAP- 2 and TRH revealed that TRH peptide is localised in the perikarya of the magnocellular neurones. TRH release was measured in vivo from the magnocellular portion of the PVN using <b>push-pull</b> perfusion. Although <b>controls</b> exhibited a very low level of TRH release, animals subjected to cold showed a pulsatile-like TRH release profile with two different patterns of release: (i) low basal level with small bursts of TRH release and (ii) a profile with an up to seven-fold increase in TRH release compared to controls. The colocalisation of TRH with the specific somato-dendritic marker MAP- 2 in processes of the magnocellular neurones suggested a local release of TRH. Additional studies demonstrated a reduction in ovarian noradrenaline content after 48 h of cold exposure, a feature indicative of nerve activation at the terminal organ. After 64 h of cold exposure, the ovarian noradrenaline returned to control values but the noradrenaline content of the coeliac ganglia was increased, suggesting a compensatory effect originating in the cell bodies of the sympathetic neurones that innervate the ovary. The correlation between the local release of TRH from dendrites within the magnocellular PVN in conditions of cold and the activation of the sympathetic nerves supplying the ovary raises the possibility that TRH contributes to the processing regulating sympathetic outflow and may thereby impact on the functional activity of the ovary...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Zoology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this dissertation was to further the implementation of <b>push-pull</b> for <b>control</b> of Eldana saccharina on sugarcane in the Midlands North region, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Eldana saccharina, an indigenous stem borer, is the most damaging pest of sugarcane in South Africa, and sustainable control has still not been achieved. The push-pull strategy, a form of habitat management, has been developed for E. saccharina and is recommended as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. Implementation of this strategy for both large- and small-scale farmers was facilitated through mixed methods social research. It included a novel exploratory network analysis to understand the process of technology adoption by farmers. Surveys showed that large-scale farmers have a good knowledge of E. saccharina, IPM and push-pull but that they needed more practical knowledge for implementation of the strategy. Farmers recommended experiential learning opportunities such as field days and model farms to get to know more about this technology. Despite demonstrating a positive attitude towards push-pull, farmers perceived it to be a ‘hassle’ and this is potentially the biggest barrier to its adoption. However, with suitable learning opportunities for farmers and good support for planting inputs, implementation of push-pull is likely to succeed. Sugarcane was shown {{to play an important role}} in the livelihoods and farming systems of small-scale growers. They did not perceive E. saccharina as a serious production constraint and had poor knowledge of the pest and its control. Extension for small-scale growers in this region should focus primarily on weed management and on reducing input costs, but still raising awareness of the increasing threat of E. saccharina. On-farm push-pull field trials showed a significant reduction of E. saccharina damage on two farms. Mean percentage damaged internodes decreased from 4. 1 % to 2. 7 % and from 1. 7 % to 1. 1 % in the presence of the repellent grass species, Melinis minutiflora. Where farmers did not manage their crops well, push-pull was not effective. It is therefore crucial that push-pull within an IPM framework be implemented together with good crop management practices. Stem borer surveys in wetlands on sugarcane farms revealed a high diversity of indigenous stem borers and parasitoids, including a stem borer species, Pirateolea piscator, which may pose a threat to crops in the future. These findings, together with a literature review on the significance of on-farm biodiversity and ecosystem services, demonstrated the value which wetlands have for pest management on sugarcane farms. Wetland health assessments were used to develop a tool for farmers to assess and utilise the wetlands on their farms for improved management of E. saccharina. This study highlights the importance of a farmer-participatory approach to implementation of knowledge-intensive farming practices such as push-pull. The importance of wetlands for providing pest regulatory services on sugarcane farms has shown that environmental sustainability needs to become a fundamental principle of farming and agricultural research. Participatory implementation of push-pull, as recommended in this dissertation, could act as a driving force for agroecology in the South African sugar industry and move sustainable farming practices off the pages of journals and manuals onto farmers’ fields.

40|$|Subjected to dynamic loading, truck {{components}} {{are exposed to}} variable amplitude fatigue. The fatigue life of components is {{to a large degree}} controlled by the behaviour of the surface zones. Different mechanical surface treatments such as shot peening have been developed to introduce compressive stresses close to the surface, thereby delaying failure of components exposed to fatigue loading. During shot peening the specimen is bombarded by small hard shots leading to plastic deformation of a thin surface zone. The inhomogeneous plastic deformation leads to changes in interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice as well as the density of dislocations in the surface zone. We can express this as development of compressive residual stresses and a change in the work hardening state. The compressive residual stress is thought to improve the fatigue properties by increasing the surface resistance to crack initiation as well as reducing the crack propagation rate. Tie rod arm as a truck component is the subject of present study. This component may be made of two different materials: medium carbon microalloyed steel or quenched and tempered steel. The former is continuously cooled leading to essentially pearlitic microstructure and the latter has a tempered martensite microstructure. Although the pearlitic arms made of microalloyed steel were the main focus of this study, the tempered martensite microstructure was also investigated to a certain extent. Strain as well as stress <b>control</b> <b>push-pull</b> fatigue tests were performed on cylindrical specimens made from the actual components. The tests were conducted in constant amplitude, with occasional overloading as well as variable amplitude conditions. The results showed that the life time of specimens at higher strain amplitudes (higher plastic strain amplitudes) is not effected by shot peening. However at smaller plastic strain amplitudes the peened specimens exhibit a longer life time than unpeened ones. The residual stress relaxation and changes of work hardening state were also monitored at the surface and in depth for different strain and stress amplitudes as well as cycle numbers. The influence of plastic strain amplitude on relaxation of residual stresses was studied in detail as a function of fatigue cycle number. In parallel whole components were also tested in constant and variable amplitude loading fatigue, with and without shot peening. The fatigue behaviour in bending as well as relaxation of the residual stresses were also studied for the tempered martensitic steel with different degrees of decarburisation and subsequent shot peening. Also in this case a positive influence of shot peening is mainly seen at small strain amplitudes...|$|R
