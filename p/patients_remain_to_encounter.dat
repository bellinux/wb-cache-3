Primary renal parenchymal lesions are not commonly reported in these cases. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 138 consecutive patients with MPD to determine the frequency of renal parenchymal complications.

40|$|BackgroundRenal {{failure is}} {{accompanied}} by oxidative stress. An optimum intake of antioxidants {{is thought to be}} important to protect against oxidative damage. This study looked at the effects of dietary supplementation on antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation in hemodialysis patients. MethodsDuring the study period, 34 patients who were undergoing regular hemodialysis consumed a fruit and vegetable diet. The effect of dietary supplementation was assessed by measurement of blood enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, before and after intervention. ResultsA significant increase in the levels of vitamins A and C, and superoxide dismutase activity was observed after 8 weeks of supplementation (p 0. 05). ConclusionThe findings indicate that low intake of antioxidant vitamins in the short term improves the levels of vitamins A and C as well as superoxide dismutase activity, but MDA level as a marker of lipid peroxidation does not change significantly.

Here we investigated fibre-type related NOS expression in vastus lateralis muscle of T 2 D patients compared with healthy individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Cytophotometrical assay and Western blotting did not reveal any quantitative differences between NOS expression in muscles from NGT and T 2 D subjects. Positive NOS immunoreactivity in vastus lateralis of T 2 D patients was found to be associated with fast-oxidative glycolytic (FOG) muscle phenotype. This indicates that NOS expression in T 2 D patients correlates both with skeletal muscle fibre type distribution and the activity of oxidative and glycolytic enzymes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{inherited}} fibrinogen disorders (IFD) {{are primarily}} {{considered to be}} bleeding disorders, they {{are associated with a}} higher thrombotic complication risk than defects in other clotting factors. Managing IFD patients with thrombosis is challenging as anticoagulant treatment may exacerbate the underlying bleeding risk which can be life-threatening. Due to the low prevalence of IFD, there is little information on pathophysiology or optimal treatment of thrombosis in these patients. We searched the literature for cases of thrombosis among IFD patients and identified a total of 128 patient reports. In approximately half of the cases, thromboses were spontaneous, while in the others trauma, surgery, and parturition contributed to the risk. The true mechanism(s) of thrombosis in IFD <b>patients</b> <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be elucidated.

We conducted a prospective {{longitudinal study of}} leptin levels and nutritional parameters to determine whether changes of serum leptin levels modify nutritional status and survival in a cohort of prevalent hemodialysis patients. Methods Leptin, dietary energy and protein intake, biochemical markers of nutrition and body composition (anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis) were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following enrollment, in 101 prevalent hemodialysis patients (37 % women) {{with a mean age}} of 64. 6 ± 11. 5 years. Observation of this cohort was continued over 2 additional years. Changes in repeated measures were evaluated, with adjustment for baseline differences in demographic and clinical parameters. Results Significant reduction of leptin levels with time were observed (linear estimate: - 2. 5010 ± 0. 57 ng/ml/ 2 y; p Conclusions Thus leptin levels reflect fat mass depots, rather than independently contributing to uremic anorexia or modifying nutritional status and/or survival in chronic hemodialysis patients.
