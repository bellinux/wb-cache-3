40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of drag-based <b>paddling</b> <b>propulsion</b> are studied {{with a simple}} mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter {{in the relationship between}} vortex formation and thrust generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden stroke motions, which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. We also explored the role of stopping vortex shedding in efficient thrust generation by determining the relationship between stroke angles and total impulses generated by paddling propulsors...|$|R
50|$|His {{most notable}} {{personal}} achievement was the propeller driven double ended ferry, {{which is the}} most typical vehicle ferry in use today. The significance of his design was a shaft which could control propellers {{at both ends of the}} craft. Among the advantages was superior braking of the vessels, since <b>paddle</b> wheel <b>propulsion</b> systems could not effectively be reversed to slow the craft. Prior to propeller drives, double ended ferries had less usable width because of side wheel propulsion.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped into}} the hollow, lifted {{the side of the}} tent, and there was Ben Gunn's boat--home-made if ever {{anything}} was home-made: a rude, lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double <b>paddle</b> for <b>propulsion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Persia was a British {{passenger}} liner {{operated by the}} Cunard Line that won the Blue Riband in 1856 for the fastest westbound transatlantic voyage. She was the first Atlantic record breaker constructed of iron and was the largest ship {{in the world at}} the time of her launch. [...] However, the inefficiencies of <b>paddle</b> wheel <b>propulsion</b> rendered Persia obsolete and she was taken out of service in 1868 after only twelve years. Attempts to convert Persia to sail were unsuccessful and the former pride of the British merchant marine was scrapped in 1872.|$|R
50|$|Paddle {{wheels are}} used on some older {{watercraft}} and their reconstructions. These ships {{were known as}} paddle steamers. Because paddle wheels simply push against the water, their design and construction is very simple. The oldest such ship in scheduled service is the Skibladner. Many pedalo boats also use <b>paddle</b> wheels for <b>propulsion.</b>|$|R
50|$|She had sail, <b>paddle</b> {{and screw}} <b>propulsion.</b> The paddle-wheels were 17 m (56 ft) in {{diameter}} and the four-bladed screw-propeller was 7.3 m (24 ft) across. The power came from four steam engines for the paddles and an additional engine for the propeller. Total power was estimated at 6 MW (8,000 hp).|$|R
50|$|The British Admiralty used {{diesel-electric}} paddle tugs {{in recent}} times. Each paddle wheel {{was driven by}} an individual electric motor, giving outstanding maneuverability. Paddle tugs were able to more easily {{make use of the}} inherent advantage of side wheel <b>paddle</b> <b>propulsion,</b> having the option to disconnect the clutches that connected the paddle drive shafts as one. This enabled them to turn one paddle ahead and one astern to turn and maneuver quickly.|$|E
5000|$|The larger pirogue is {{more famous}} {{on the lower}} Mississippi River. The earlier ones were carved from cypress and sycamore. Some of these were nearly 50 ft long and 5 ft wide. These French pirogues often had a small sail which could relieve them of their pole and <b>paddle</b> <b>propulsion.</b> As their {{carpenters}} came onto the frontier, they made them with planks and a flat bottom.

50|$|Alligators were scow-shaped, shallow draft boats, {{fitted with}} side mounted paddle wheels, {{powered by a}} 20-horsepower steam engine and {{provided}} with a cable winch and large anchor. By using the winch Alligators could pull themselves over land, around portages and {{up as much as}} a 20 degree incline at the rate of 1 to 2½ miles per day. They could haul a boom of some 60,000 logs across water against all but the strongest winds. They were heavily but simply built, making rebuilding and repair easy.

2500|$|Temnodontosaursus forefins and hindfins {{are roughly}} the same length and are rather narrow and elongate. The fins have strong hyperphalangy. This is unlike other post Triassic Ichthyosaurs like Thunnosauria which has forefins are at least twice {{the length of the}} hindfins. The pelvic girdle too with Temnodontosaurus is not reduced unlike post-Triassic Ichthyosaurs. Temnodontosaurus species reduced their digits to 3 primary digits {{compared}} to Ichthyosaurus which had 6 to 7 digits. They also have one postaxial accessory digit. The proximal elements of the fin make a mosaic pattern while the more distal elements are relatively rounder. There are two notches on the fin’s anterior margin.

50|$|Screw {{propulsion}} {{had some}} obvious potential advantages for warships over <b>paddle</b> <b>propulsion.</b> Firstly, paddlewheels {{were exposed to}} enemy fire in combat, whereas a propeller and its machinery were tucked away safely well below deck. Secondly, the space taken up by paddlewheels restricted the number of guns a warship could carry, thus reducing its broadside. These potential advantages were well understood by the British Admiralty, {{but it was not}} convinced that the propeller was an effective propulsion system. It was only in 1840, when the world's first propeller-driven steamship, , successfully completed a series of trials against fast paddle-wheelers, that the Navy decided to conduct further tests of the technology. For this purpose, the Navy built Rattler.|$|E

50|$|Seeandbee, {{intended}} for overnight service between Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, {{was designed by}} naval architect Frank E.

The company's experience led it to require two basic design features {{directly related to the}} intended use in overnight, luxury passenger service for passengers wanting a good night's sleep. First was <b>paddle</b> <b>propulsion</b> for the deck room gained by the side wheel type with the great width over paddle guards and thus more space for cabins and decks and an increased maneuvering capability and stability in rough weather over screw types. Second, the more expensive and much heavier compound inclined steam engine was chosen due to its ability to develop 12,000 horsepower at low revolutions without the vibration associated with the higher revolutions required by lighter vertical types for similar power.|$|E
50|$|The Okeehumkee {{measured}} 84.4 ft long by 21.4 ft wide, and {{consisted of}} a flat-bottom hull, a lower cargo deck and two upper passenger decks. A recessed stern <b>paddle</b> wheel provided <b>propulsion,</b> powered by a wood-burning steam boiler engine. The boat was outfitted with shutters on the windows to keep tree branches out and a livestock pen {{at the rear of}} the boat, on the upper deck. The Okeehumkee was alternately called Okeehumkee II, Okahumka, Okahumpka, and Okeehumpkee.|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a <b>paddle</b> used for <b>propulsion,</b> and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|R
40|$|AQUA is an {{underwater}} hexapod robot which uses its paddles to propel itself and to control its orientation. The use of oscillating <b>paddles</b> for <b>propulsion</b> and control represented a novel and challenging problem, which motivated {{the need for}} a simulation of the motion of the robot based on its paddle oscillations. The most difficult aspect of this simulation was the characterization of the forces generated by the paddles oscillating in the water. In this work, a model predicting the forces produced by an oscillating rigid paddle was developed and validated experimentally. Also, the forces produced by a flexible fin were determined experimentally and were compared to those generated by the rigid paddle. Rigid paddle and flexible fin experiments were performed on an experimental setup, which was designed and built to measure the forces and torques produced by a paddle oscillating in a water tank. Finally, a simulation of the AQUA robot was developed, based on the validated rigid paddle model...|$|R
5000|$|Helveticosaurus {{is known}} from a nearly {{complete}} holotype {{which includes the}} premaxilla, maxilla, prefrontal, postfrontal, postorbital, squamosal, dentary and a postcranial skeleton. Several disarticulated elements are also known including teeth, portions of the snout and poscranial elements. Helveticosaurus is about 2 meters long from snout to tail. It possessed many features that were adaptations to a marine lifestyle in the shallow-sea environment that existed in Europe {{at the time when}} much of the continent was part of the Tethys Ocean. The long, flexible tail is similar to what can be seen in other extinct marine reptiles such as thalattosaurs, and it probably propelled itself through the water by means of lateral undulation. However, Helveticosaurus also possessed a robust pectoral girdle and forelimbs that were well adapted for <b>paddle</b> like <b>propulsion</b> as a supplementary method of locomotion, as seen in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. This unique combination of undulation and paddling is highly unusual for an aquatic reptile.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional vortex {{formation}} and propulsive performance were studied experimentally to identify {{some of the}} main characteristic mechanisms of flapping locomotion. Mechanical models with thin plates were used to simulate flapping and translating motions of animal propulsors. Three-dimensional flow fields were mapped quantitatively using defocusing digital particle image velocimetry. First, vortex structures made by impulsively translating low aspect-ratio plates were studied. The investigation of translating plates with a 90 degree angle of attack is important since it is a fundamental model for a better understanding of drag-based propulsion systems. Rectangular flat-rigid, flexible, and curved-rigid thin plastic plates with the same aspect ratio were used to compare their vortex structures and hydrodynamic forces. The interaction of the tip flow and the nearby vortex is a critical flow phenomenon to distinguish vortex patterns among these three cases. In the flexible plate case, slow development of the vortex structure causes a small initial peak in hydrodynamic force during the acceleration phase. However, after the initial peak, the flexible plate generates large force magnitude comparable to that of the flat-rigid plate case. Drag-based <b>paddling</b> <b>propulsion</b> was also studied to explain some of the fundamental differences in vortex formation of lift-based and drag-based propulsions. While the temporal change of the inner area enclosed by the vortex loop {{is an important factor in}} thrust generation of lift-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength becomes more important in drag-based propulsion. Spanwise flow behind the paddling plate plays an important role in tip vortex motion and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow depends on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared to a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, the spanwise flow is not as strong as that of the high Reynolds number case. The flexible propulsor can smooth out force peaks during impulsive motions without sacrificing total impulse, which is advantageous in avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. The role of the stopping vortex was addressed in optimizing a stroke angle of paddling animals. In addition, vortex formation of clapping propulsion was investigated by varying aspect ratio and stroke angle. A low aspect-ratio propulsor produces larger total impulse than a high aspect-ratio propulsor. As the aspect ratio increases, circulation of the vortex is strengthened, and the inner area enclosed by the vortex structure tends to enlarge. Moreover, in terms of thrust, the advantage of a single plate over double clapping plates is larger for the lower aspect-ratio case. These results offer information to better understand the benefit of low aspect-ratio wings in force generation under specific locomotion modes. When a pair of plates claps, a vortex loop forms from two counter-rotating tip vortices by a reconnection process. The dynamics of wake structures are dependent on the aspect ratio and the stroke angle. Vortex {{formation and}} vorticity transport processes of translating and rotating plates with a 45 degree angle of attack were investigated as well. In both translating and rotating cases, the spanwise flow over the plate and the vorticity tilting process inside the leading-edge vortex were observed. The distribution of spanwise flow is a prominent distinction between the vortex structures of these two cases. While spanwise flow is confined inside the leading-edge vortex for the translating case, it is widely present over the plate and the wake region of the rotating case. As the Reynolds number decreases, due to the increase in viscosity, leading-edge and tip vortices tend to spread inside the area swept by the rotating plate, which results in lower lift force generation. Lastly, for translating motion, the dynamics of the vortex in corner regions was compared among three different corner shapes. For a large corner angle, the forward movement of the vortex tends to be uniform along the plate edges. However, for a small corner angle, the vortex close to the corner moves forward following the plate while the vortex away from the corner retards its forward movement...|$|R

Despite the enormous size of their eyes, species of Temnodontosaurus had blind spots directly above their head due to the angle at which their eyes were pointed. The eyes of Temnodontosaurus had sclerotic rings. According to Ryosuke Motani, the sclerotic rings of T. platyodon are at least 25 cm in diameter. It is assumed that Temnodontosaurus had high visual capacity. McGowan hypothesized that Ichthyosaurs have a sclerotic ring to give the eye rigidity. According to McGowan Ichthyosaurs, and so Temnodontosaurus, used vision as their main sense {{and it would have been}} unlikely that they could do echolocation to sense out prey. The typical head of Temnodontosaurus had a robust long snout with an antorbital constriction. They also had an elongated maxilla, a long cheek region and a long post orbital segment. The carotid foramina in the basisphenoid in the skull is paired and is separated by the parasphenoid. Also, the parasphenoid has a processus cultriformis. The largest T. platyodon skulls can range from 1m to 1.5m long.|$|R
