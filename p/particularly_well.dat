5|$|Cafés {{are found}} {{everywhere}} {{in urban areas}} and function as meeting places for socializing and conducting business. Almost all serve baked goods and sandwiches and many also serve light meals. There are both chains and locally owned neighborhood cafés. Most have outdoor seating {{to take advantage of}} Israel's Mediterranean climate. Tel Aviv is <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> known for its café culture.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
50|$|T26s {{were often}} used on {{passenger}} trains to the Norfolk Coast, <b>particularly</b> <b>Wells</b> and Cromer. After the grouping of 1923 Claud Hamilton 4-4-0s took over most passenger traffic to Wells.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all well}} kills are deliberate. Sometimes, the {{unintended}} buildup of fluids, either from injection of chemicals like methanol from surface, or from liquids produced from the reservoir, can {{be enough to}} kill the <b>well,</b> <b>particularly</b> gas <b>wells,</b> which are notoriously easy to kill required.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, the Mérens was {{introduced}} to the island of Réunion, where its breeding is now part of the local economy. It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling. The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island, where it is <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> suited for the steep terrain and climate, taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of September and October McCudden added five {{victories}} including a LVG C.V on 26 September, raising his tally from 13 to 18. On 6 October {{he was awarded the}} Bar to his Military Cross. Another five in November brought his tally to 23. His method of diving behind and under the enemy machines before firing was working <b>particularly</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
5|$|Point Loma {{is noted}} for {{neighborhood}} Christmas decorations. Several blocks of Garrison Street near Chatsworth are <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> known for elaborate decorations. There {{is also a}} neighborhood-wide lighting of luminarias on Christmas Eve in the Plumosa Park area. On two Sundays in December there is a Parade of Lights, with brightly decorated boats sailing on the Bay to be viewed from the shoreline.|$|E

5|$|There {{were wide}} {{variations}} in these histories. Six of the 1937–38 batches led a quiet life, being situated at Polmadie {{for the whole}} of their lives, apart from their initial spell at Camden. Others were moved from shed to shed for most of their lives, Nos. 6251 and 6252 being <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> travelled.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Charles Lethbridge (23 March 1901 – 30 September 1971), {{better known}} as T.C. Lethbridge, was an English archaeologist, parapsychologist, and explorer. A {{specialist}} in Anglo-Saxon archaeology, he served as honorary Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology from 1923 to 1957, and {{over the course of}} his lifetime wrote twenty-four books on various subjects, becoming <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> known for his advocacy of dowsing.|$|E
5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include unimproved calcareous grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> represented. There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E

50|$|Monazite geochronology is {{a dating}} {{technique}} to study geological history using the mineral monazite. It {{is a powerful}} tool in studying the complex history of metamorphic rocks <b>particularly,</b> as <b>well</b> as igneous, sedimentary and hydrothermal rocks. The dating uses the radioactive processes in monazite as a clock.|$|R
5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} FX Super Glide {{was released}} in 1971 to a lukewarm reception. <b>Particularly</b> not <b>well</b> received was the [...] "boattail", which also proved to be unpopular on the Sportsters that had it. Sales of both models improved when less radical rear styling was made available.|$|R
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of forcing {{is another important}} factor determining the transient response to radiative perturbation. The current understanding of the forcing efficacy is very limited, and its time variation is <b>particularly</b> not <b>well</b> understood. Nevertheless, its inconstancy is presumed {{to be in the}} latitudinal distribution of forcing that varies with time.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous protests, <b>particularly</b> from <b>well</b> {{connected}} wine growers of the Rhône Valley, made President Mitterrand force alterations to the route; {{the original}} path {{would have kept}} to the left bank of the river, while the final route skirts the river and crosses it four times, at a significantly higher cost.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, the DPMA withdrew its {{opposition}} to the standard, citing the responsiveness of the committee to public concerns. In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards study concluded that the proposed standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{additional}} styles developed from the already eclectic base of industrial music. These offshoots include fusions with noise music, ambient music, folk music, post-punk and electronic dance music, {{as well as other}} mutations and developments. The scene has spread worldwide, and is <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Post-industrial subgenres include dark ambient, power electronics, Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, power noise, and witch house.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of King of Pop, Jackson issued the double-disc album Thriller 25, a 25th anniversary edition of Thriller. It was a {{commercial}} success, having done <b>particularly</b> <b>well</b> as a re-issue, peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe. It reached number two in the US, number three in the UK and top10 on over 30 national charts. In the US, Thriller25 was just 14,000 copies short of reaching the peak position, selling 166,000copies. It was ineligible for the Billboard200 chart as a re-release, but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart, where it stayed for 10 non-consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{material}} options for downhole tubing in water injection <b>wells,</b> <b>particularly</b> subsea <b>wells</b> where the cost of workover is prohibitive, have received considerable attention. A great deal of test and field experience demonstrates that the internal tubing coatings currently available do not have sufficient mechanical robustness to survive mechanical damage occurring downhole. The mechanical damage aries from impact tool strike and wireline wear by the supporting wire. This communication reports {{the results of a}} study of wireline wear on various coatings under laboratory conditions. Wireline wear was investigated bytwo means: (1) Reciprocating a loaded wire against the coating; (2) Rotating a wire beneath a loaded-coated pin, using a modified pin-on-disk apparatus...|$|R

25|$|Its body is round, <b>particularly</b> when <b>well</b> fed, and tapers less {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} than the tail. The sudden tapering {{to the base of}} its neck gives it the appearance of shoulders, unique among cetaceans. The tailfin grows and becomes increasingly and ornately curved as the animal ages. The flippers are broad and short—making them almost square-shaped.|$|R
