5|$|In the 17th century, toy spaniels {{began to}} feature in {{paintings}} by Dutch {{artists such as}} Caspar Netscher and <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens.</b> Spanish artists, including Juan de Valdés Leal and Diego Velázquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, the dogs were tricolour, black and white or entirely white.

5|$|German {{painters}} {{have influenced}} western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German {{artists of the}} Renaissance, <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens</b> and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer, Franz Iffland, and Julius Schmidt-Felling made important contributions to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Ruben</b> and Jan Brueghel {{depicted}} the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also {{appear in the}} Rococo period in another painting titled Battle of the Amazons by Johann Georg Platzer. As {{a part of the}} Romantic period revival, German artist Anselm Feuerbach painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.” ...|$|R

5|$|The Cummer Museum’s art {{collection}} has expanded {{from the group}} of more than 60 works of Ninah Cummer's collection to over 5,000 works of art.

5|$|Two of {{the rooms}} have large {{tapestries}} on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those {{in the drawing room}} contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens,</b> who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.|$|E

The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much {{as they would have}} been in the grand rooms for which they were intended rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1870s the Marlboroughs were {{in severe}} {{financial}} trouble, and in 1875 the 7th Duke sold the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche, {{together with the}} famed Marlborough gems, at auction for £10,000. However this {{was not enough to}} save the family. In 1880 the 7th Duke was forced to petition Parliament to break the protective entail on the Palace and its contents. This was achieved under the Blenheim Settled Estates Act of 1880, and the door was now open for wholesale dispersal of Blenheim and its contents. The first victim was the great Sunderland Library which was sold in 1882, including such volumes as The Epistles of Horace, printed at Caen in 1480, and the works of Josephus, printed at Verona in 1648. The 18,000 volumes raised almost £60,000. The sales continued to denude the palace: Raphael's Ansidei Madonna was sold for £70,000; Van Dyck's equestrian painting of Charles I realised £17,500; and finally the [...] "piece de resistance" [...] of the collection, <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> Rubens' <b>Rubens,</b> His Wife Helena Fourment, and Their Son <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul,</b> which had been given by the city of Brussels to the 1st Duke in 1704, was also sold, and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.|$|R

5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens,</b> and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|William John Bankes {{collected}} {{most of the}} house's antiquities. He travelled {{extensively in}} the Middle East and Asia, amassing the world's largest individual collection of Ancient Egyptian antiques.

When in Genoa he acquired the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra, by Sir <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens,</b> painted on the occasion of her marriage to Duke Nicolò Pallavicini in 1606. In 1841, after being caught in a homosexual scandal that could have resulted in a trial and his execution, William John fled the country for Italy. His art collection was left at Kingston Lacy, where his notes and drawings remained for many years in a cabinet, unpublished and forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Busch {{studied for}} nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial {{difficulties}} in understanding the subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents {{to believe that the}} Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study old masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens,</b> Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.|$|E
5|$|Église Notre-Dame is {{a cathedral}} which was {{originally}} {{built in the}} late 13th century and its tower was added in the late 14th or early 15th century. Like the town hall {{it is one of}} the city's most prominent landmarks. It was arguably the only church in the English perpendicular style in France. Much of the current 1400 capacity church dates to 1631–1635. It contains elements of Flemish, Gothic, Anglo-Norman and Tudor architecture. In 1691, an 1800 cubic metre cistern was added to the church under orders by Vauban. The church is dedicated to the Virgin, and built in the form of a cross, consisting of a nave and four aisles— The old grand altar dated to 1628 and was built from Carrara marble wrecked on the coast, during its transit from Genoa to Antwerp. It contained eighteen figures, the two standing on either side of the altar-piece—representing St. Louis and Charlemagne. The organ—of a deep and mellow tone, and highly ornamented by figures in relief—was built at Canterbury sometime around 1700. The pulpit and reading-desk, richly sculptured in oak, is another well-executed piece of ecclesiastical workmanship from St. Omers. The altar-piece, the Assumption, was often attributed to Anthony van Dyck, though in reality it is by Van Sulden; whilst the painting over the side altar, believed to be by <b>Peter</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>Rubens.</b> A high and strongly built wall, partaking more of the fortress than a cathedral in its aspect, flanks the building, and protects it from the street where formerly ran the old river, in its course through Calais to the sea.|$|E
