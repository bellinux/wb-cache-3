40|$|Summary. This Report gives {{a method}} for calculating the {{aerodynamic}} forces and moments acting on unstalled vibrating cascade blades. The forces and moments due to both bending and torsional vibration are calculated, and also due to wakes from periodic obstructions far upstream which move relative to the cascade in question. The calculation has been programmed for EDSAC II, the electronic computer at the Cambridge University Mathematical Laboratory, and the essential formulae are summarized in an Appendix, {{in order to facilitate}} the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> for other machines. The Report includes skeleton tables of the force and moment coefficients for two space/chord ratios. The coefficients can be used to predict the occurrence of pure torsional or coupled flutter and the vibration induced by periodic disturbance in the flow. 1. Introduction. Blad...|$|E

Particular of such impoverishments include; landlessness, joblessness, and social disarticulation. This thus threatens the sustainable and human-centered development the world seeks to attain. However, policy documents and researchers such as the World Bank’s Involuntary Resettlement Sourcebook (2004) and Sonnenberg and Münster (2001) propose the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> resettlement <b>programmes</b> as an intervention for the mitigation of the adverse effects of resettlement. Despite the introduction <b>of</b> resettlement <b>programmes,</b> relocation and resettlement continues to impoverish the livelihoods of affected population.

40|$|Many {{schools in}} South Africa {{suffer from the}} {{consequences}} of bad leadership and management practices. A contributing factor to this problem is the inadequate <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> school leaders for the wide variety of challenges facing them. This study formed part of a three-year project to develop a preparation programme for school leaders in the Southern Cape area of South Africa. Its aims focussed on the identification of principles for the design <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>programmes</b> leading to improvements in practice. Twelve teachers and principals participated in the project. They enrolled for a programme in school leadership designed and offered by the University of Port Elizabeth in consultation and cooperation with the Southern Cape Learning Resource Unit in George. Five sources were utilized for the provision of data: - The existing literature on the development <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> programmes; - The group of twelve participants of the programme; - The four school principals in the group who acted as a focus group; - The staff and certain documents from the schools where these four principals are employed; - Local stakeholders with an interest in the success <b>of</b> the <b>programme.</b> Research methods typical of the interpretive tradition were utilized in orderto arrive at {{a better understanding of the}} needs of participants and of those elements <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> which have the greatest impact on practice. Among the insights to have emerged from the study are the following: - The fact that the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> school leaders is a complex and multifaceted process which is enhanced by variety, continuous interaction between presenters and participants, flexibilityt o respond to changing needs and contexts, and an ongoing implementation in and feedback from practice; - The central role played in the professional and academic growth of participants by individuals and groups around them; - The importance of action research as a tool in the accomplishment of a variety of goals in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> school leaders.

The first paper explored the current UK policy context {{and the way in}} which district nursing and community nursing services within each country are changing to meet the challenges posed.

This article explores the current challenges for DN education within the UK. The underpinning educational <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> DN <b>programmes</b> is examined and key issues such as safeguarding the public are discussed.

The effectiveness of combined analgesics, early administration of saturating doses and analgesia supplemented or based on methods of block anaesthesia – particularly on peripheral and local blocks, less appreciated in children, have been highlighted.
