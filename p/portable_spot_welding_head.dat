40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} how advanced ultrasonic imaging methods can improve non-destructive quality evaluation of automotive <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> It {{is well known}} that standard ultrasonic inspection may not produce accurate results for certain types of stick and undersized welds. The increased usage of high strength steel in automotive industry limits the scope of other inspection methods. For example, pry chisel testing of high strength steel is often times not allowed according to the existing standards. Therefore improvements in <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> quality evaluation are extremely beneficial for the industrial application of ultrasound.

40|$|Steel {{has been}} the {{material}} of choice for automobile manufacturers. In the recent years material such as aluminium and its alloys are taking over the market because of their light weight. The use of aluminium, in automobile manufacturing can result in overall fuel efficiency. <b>Spot</b> <b>welding</b> aluminium alloys require higher electric power and less welding time as compared to steel. Welding guns that can produce an electric current which is approximately 2 to 3 times higher, as compared to steel are required for <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> aluminium. An efficient method of <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> Aluminium alloys with the preheating process has been proposed in this paper.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the finite element {{simulation}} of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint in crash analysis. <b>Spot</b> <b>welding</b> is a very common joining process in the automotive industry. It is cost effective and it provides a very fast production rate of automotive body components. Despite this advantage, <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> are very susceptible to various types of loading conditions. Therefore they are prone to failure, if not designed properly, during their service life time. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the behaviour of <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> and their failure characteristics. Generally, before the manufacturing stage, most of the automotive structural components are designed and tested in a virtual design environment. It is important to examine the crashworthiness of these body-in-white structures. To asses the crashworthiness of these structures they need to be represented correctly in virtual simulations, which necessitate the development of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint models to be included in crash analysis. Usually the models for the body-in-white structures are complicated and huge, which contains thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints. Therefore a simple model for <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints is desirable. Six different <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint models were developed in this thesis to serve the above mentioned purpose. At the same time the simplicity issue of these developed <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> models were also addressed, so that they can be integrated easily in a large assembly system, which consists of thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints. Moreover for an effective modelling strategy, the computational costs incurred by the adopted <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> models need also to be taken into consideration. Therefore the approach undertaken in this thesis was to study the characteristics of only one <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint on a test coupon with the developed suitable <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> nugget modelling configurations...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of other joining methods such as laser beam welding, bolted, riveted, and adhesive bonding, resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> (RSW) remains the primary method to join panels especially in automotive, railroad, and airplane structures, which contain hundreds, even thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> In service, mechanical components usually experience cyclic loading. This makes fatigue failure prevention the foremost design requirement. Considering that <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> provide localized connection, they lead to stress concentration and consequently to initiation of fatigue cracks. The designer should {{then be able to}} predict the fatigue life of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints and determine the impact of design changes on fatigue resistance.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} applications require sheet to sheet or sheet to tube joints. The electromagnetic pulse technology is capable to produce {{these kinds of}} joints. In literature many examples of sheet to sheet solid state welding between similar and dissimilar metals are presented and analyzed in detail. However, {{the most of the}} presented welding applications, which are very focussed on the academic level, are simple specimens for example for tensile test. These specimens are usually very small in their dimensions and therewith capable to be welded with the help of stationary EMPT coils.

A designer should have concentration {{on the strength of}} component by introducing the changes in its geometry and weld patterns that will reduce the vibration and noise of the structural models. Also increases the strength of the structures. The optimum design of geometry and weld patterns will give optimal performance i. e. good strength to the composed structures. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the effect of <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> parameters on the strength of <b>spot</b> <b>weld.</b> The effect factors of multiple spot-welded joints strength are analyzed including <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> arrangement, distance between two <b>spot</b> <b>welds,</b> <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> diameter and thickness based on finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results. The study shows that weld diameter and thickness are primary factors affecting the strength of the joints for a given material. On the basis of effect factor analysis the optimized parameters are also discussed to improve the strength of structure...|$|R

The testing fixture are designed to impose the combined axial and shear load on the <b>spot</b> <b>weld.</b> Using the proposed testing fixtures and specimens, quasi-static and dynamic failure tests of the <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> are conducted with seven different combined loading conditions. The failure load and failure behavior of the <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> are investigated with different loading conditions. Dynamic effects on the failure load of the <b>spot</b> <b>weld,</b> which is critical for structural crashworthiness, are also examined based on the experimental data. In order to evaluate the effect of the strain rate on the failure contour of the <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> under combined axial and shear loads, the failure loads measured from the experiment are decomposed into the two components along the axial and shear directions. Experimental results indicate that the failure contour is expanded with increasing strain rates according to the rate sensitivity of the ultimate stress for welded material...|$|R

System hardware, which {{are made up of}} PLC 1800 high speed data acquisition card current sensor voltage sensor signal adjust circuit and IPC, is mainly responsible for A/D conversion and data acquisition; software system are mostly made up of data acquisition and memory module wavelet filtering of digit signal module U-I image and energy analyze module in electric signal of <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> which realize the data acquisition and processing base on welding current electrode voltage welding cycle. The experimental result showed that U-I image shape of different material are markedly dissimilar in <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> according to U-I image we can check if welding current and electrode voltage are normal in welding process or not, and through U-I image we can read the input energy of every U-I curve half-cycle and judge <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> quality. Therefore, we can take U-I image monitoring method in <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> quality monitoring of different material...|$|R
