40|$|We {{offer an}} {{introduction}} to the logic of using multiple systems estimation (MSE) in the context of estimating casualties in armed conflict. We demonstrate how this estimation technique relies on four strong assumptions, which are typically explored and adjusted for with the generalization to three or more systems and a variety of MSE methods and estimators. We find that the implications of violating these four classic assumptions, in particular the homogeneity and independence assumptions, do not translate clearly to the more-than-three-systems case. We use case studies from human rights research to present the subtle ways that misunderstanding these assumptions can lead to misapplication and misinterpretation of MSE methods.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} geometry of spiral inclusion trails from the Canton Schist were measured {{to determine whether}} the spirals were a product of porphyroblast rotation within a shear zone, or porphyroblast growth during a series of overprinting fold events. The spiral inclusion trails are composed of three separate, sub-planar inclusion trail surfaces occupying texturally distinct parts of the porphyroblasts. These surfaces are correlated across a > 10 km 2 area using textural criteria and relative timing. Measured <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> trail orientation and asymmetry suggest they did not form by porphyroblast rotation within a non-coaxial shear zone. Rather, the porphyroblasts grew during three successive overprinting fold events (F 2 –F 4), and the spiral inclusion trails represent the accumulated curvature associated with folding of successive axial plane foliations. The data show that spiral garnets are not peculiar to shear zones, and can form by overprinting crenulations and folds. This is consistent with the common occurrence of spiral garnets in multiply-deformed, regionally metamorphosed fold belts...|$|E

The distribution <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> neuronal intra-nuclear <b>inclusions</b> (NIIs) was irregular in several brain regions including the striatum, cortex and hippocampus. A greater number of NIIs were found in the ventral striatum than in the dorsal striatum. In the globus pallidus, cerebellum and thalamus the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> formation was relatively consistent over time. At 4 and 6 months of age, the R 6 / 1 mice showed increased glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in the cortex compared to their wildtype littermates, yet no difference was found in the striatum. Analysis by electron microscopy found that neurons from the R 6 / 1 carriers contained a densely packed cytoplasm at 1. 5 months of age, with some neurons displaying structural abnormalities including vacuolization and nuclear membrane folding. No NIIs were detected at this age, but by 7 months of age, NIIs were present with severe cellular vacuolization.

The dialogues on Common Agricultural Policy reforms in which the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture is engaged {{with a range of}} interested parties mark a new departure. This article analyses these debates in order to understand why opening up closed agricultural communities is so difficult. Whereas most current explanations of changing policy communities rely on exogenous factors, this article focuses on the beliefs and practices of the actors involved.

Results from a sample of supermarket departments (N 348) yielded general support for the study hypotheses. We also found evidence for a 3 -way interaction involving demographic diversity, LMX mean, and LMX differentiation such that the interaction between demographic diversity and LMX differentiation was only significant when LMX mean was high.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{concepts}} of "inclusion" held by policy drivers (PD), policy makers (PM) and policy implementers (PI) from various national organizations, state agencies and school districts.

A Likert-type questionnaire was developed, grounded in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> language used in interviews and documents. Descriptive and inferential statistics identified variance between and within groups. Of 430 questionnaires sent, 266 were returned. Factor analysis of 29 items yielded 5 factors (definition <b>of</b> <b>inclusion,</b> training and support, receptivity, benefits/barriers, and prerequisites). One way analysis of variance, tests for homogeneity and multiple range tests were performed. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> were clarified, and interpretations and conclusions were drawn. Significant variance was found among PD, PM, and PI on 3 of 5 factors (benefits/barriers, prerequisites, receptivity) with the greatest variance being between PD and PI. The most significant variance among 8 school districts occurred with factor 1 (benefits/barriers <b>of</b> <b>inclusion).</b> Informants' degree <b>of</b> support for <b>inclusion</b> was frequently not reflective of the organizations they represented.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of woodfuel studies focuses on the political dynamics behind access to the woodfuel trade, providing better insights into <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> and exclusion and options for resource management. Institutional mechanisms that govern access are difficult to untangle {{in the context of}} informal trade. This paper analyzes institutions and how they regulate access to commercialize woodfuel in two areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A review of empirical data (surveys and interviews) and secondary data on wood energy value chains in the DRC is used to examine the ways that woodfuel institutions affect access to resources and to markets. The main findings are that existing formal mechanisms regulating access to the woodfuel trade are hardly enforced. Informal, socially embedded institutions generally govern access, and the trade is open to less privileged and rural actors. People who benefit from these informal arrangements have many vested interests, and current production patterns are unsustainable and not sufficiently mitigated by these institutions. New strategies are required that promote the positive aspects of informality, while supporting initiatives that contribute to long-term resource sustainability and meet the high levels of urban demand, given the lack of alternative energy sources...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{political}} {{integration of}} migrants has frequently been assessed {{at the individual}} level. In this article we explore the notion of political integration {{and apply it to}} the organisational or collective level. With data coming from a survey to 67 migrant associations in Madrid we analyse whether the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> of migrant groups in this city conforms to the multicultural model of political integration. Our results show that, whereas migrant organisations are given relatively equal rights of access to decision-making processes as autochtonous associations, their capacity to effectively engage in the public arena is seriously curtailed. We also show that this limited involvement in the host polity is primarily due to a generalised lack of resources and to a limited interoganisational connectivity within the migrant camp. Thus, our study supports past research on the relevance of organisational resources and social capital for political involvement. However, our results provide little evidence to claim that political integration in Madrid substantially differs according to the ethnic or regional origin of migrants.

40|$|The {{link between}} public {{administration}} {{and conflict resolution}} is traditionally understood through the 'democratic peace' thesis, which holds that war is less likely in democracies than in non-democracies. Limited success with post-conflict democratisation missions has opened space for renewed research on three strands of 'deeper democracy': decentralisation, participation and deliberation. This article reports {{on the study of}} deliberative democratic practices in emerging governance networks in Prishtina. Through an investigation of three contentious issues in Prishtina's public spaces, research combines documentary sources with field interviews with governance actors to identify factors that enable and constrain the scope for deliberative decision-making in governance networks. Case studies point to six main influences: 'securitisation', trust building, 'mandate parallelism', structural <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> and exclusion, network structures and the properties of governed public spaces. In addition, two frames are found to be particularly resistant to deliberative engagement: Kosovo's status and ethnic identities. We formulate a tentative conclusion to be further investigated: in contexts where distrust is high, deliberative governance requires a rigid adherence to an overarching reference framework that can create discursive space within which relative deliberation can take place...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The purpose {{this paper}} is to deploy the concept of the “glass slipper” to unpack the {{construction}} of systematic <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> and exclusion along the lines of gender, age and class in the emerging, female-dominated profession of psychological counselling in Russia. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on an analysis of 26 in-depth qualitative interviews with practising counsellors in Russia. Findings – Drawing on the glass slipper concept, the article demonstrates how seemingly neutral discursive “rules” of professional conduct articulated by counsellors create an association between a collective professional identity and the social identities of typical practitioners, making this profession appear most suitable for middle-aged, middle-class women. The author’s findings also show how certain embodied identities – in this case masculinity – may be able to “fit” into a slipper that was not made for them. Originality/value – The paper extends the understanding of the dynamics of inequality patterns in a feminized profession in the Russian context by unveiling previously underexplored patterns of marginalization along the lines of class and age. It also strengthens the collective-associative view of occupational identity and extends the glass slipper concept by exposing the mechanisms of body-work association in this profession and demonstrating that certain identity characteristics may be more universally privileged in the construction of professional identities...|$|E
40|$|This article, synthesizing the {{available}} (published and unpublished) evi-dence, describes <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> of African-Americans, women, and working-class youth {{into the system}} of higher education from 1960 to 1986. Focusing not only on whether access has increased, but on whether these subordinate groups have gained access to elite institutions, {{this article examines the}} three groups in and across two periods (1960 - 76; 1976 - 86) to highlight differential patterns of access and to suggest a plausible explanation involving political mobilization to account for the observed trends. Although the general expansion of the system of higher education since 1960 has led to reduced differentials in access between dominant and subordinate groups, women and blacks-who mobilized-were able to gain access even to elite institutions. Working-class youth did not experience such gains. A key factor that mediates these benefits of political mobilization is the recognition of the group as an official category in the society's system of classification. Using a variety of data sources, this article shows that, during times of both mobilization and countermobilization, access to particular levels of the higher education hierarchy generally follows the hypothesized directions. Further research that focuses on the precise mechanisms by which political mnobilization produces the observed results is called for. I...|$|E
40|$|Chinas {{accession}} to the World Trade Organisation has significantly accelerated the countrys integration with global capitalism through its bureaucratically-controlled and market-driven communication industries. The speci-fic {{terms and conditions}} of this integration has meant that a newly reconstituted power bloc consisting of the bureaucratic capitalists of a reformed Party state, trans-national corporate capital, and an emerging urban middle class, whose members are the favoured consumers of both domestic and transnational capital has assumed hegemonic dominance of the communicative processes {{both in and out}} of China. At the same time, this process has been highly contentious, and continues to be medi-ated by both nationalistic and leftist ideological legacies of the Chinese state and emerging forms of social and cultural contestation. This paper examines this integrati-on from a transnational and transcultural political econo-mic perspective. It begins with a critique of the Chinese nationalist and democracy frameworks in analyzing this integration, and then moves on to analyze the structural and ideological dimensions of Chinas semi-integrated communication industries and markets and identify new <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> and exclusion in the distribution of communicative power.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Garnet porphyroblasts in metasediments from Mageroy {{crystallized}} uring static metamorphism. They display three optical zones, each having character-istic inclusions and chemistry. The compositional zoning {{is related}} to prograde metamorphism (an inner zone, 1, and a graphite-bearing zone) and retrogression (the outer zone, 2). <b>Inclusions</b> <b>of</b> two types are present in zone 1 : type 1 are equidimensional remnants of the matrix, preferen-tially included along planes of rapid growth; type 2 are tubular and represent recrystallized quartz grains concen-trated along defects in the garnet lattice. The defects are lineage boundaries between growth segments related to screw dislocations on crystal faces. Crystal growth developed at relatively high degrees of supersaturation, but below the supersaturation required for the develop-ment <b>of</b> dendrites. The <b>inclusions</b> uggest rapid growth of zone 1, caused by heat flow from an adjacent interkine-matic mafic/ultramafic intrusive complex. The graphite-bearing zone crystallized at the metamorphic peak, while the inclusion-free idioblasfic rim probably developed during retrograde metamorphism. G A R N E T S from Mageroy display similar chemical zonation to that documented {{in a number of}} recent papers. In addition, they are optically zoned and contain a complex <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Chemical zoning in garnet porphyroblasts has been extensively studied and the fractionation-depletion model suggested by Harte and Henley (1966), furthered by Hollister (1966), is widely accepted. Alternative and additional models to explain the common bell-shaped chemical profiles as well as irregular patterns have, however, been suggested, involving continuous and discontinuous reactions and diffusion (Anderson and Buckley, 1973; Tracy et al., 1976; Yardley, 1977).
