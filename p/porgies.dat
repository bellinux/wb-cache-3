5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, croakers, <b>porgies,</b> anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, <b>porgies,</b> grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, <b>porgies,</b> sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E

40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} whitebone <b>porgy.</b> Calamus leucosteus. were {{investigated}} by examining stomachs of specimens collected from hard bottom reef habitat on the southeastern continental shelf and by comparing stomach samples with benthic samples and with stomach samples from four other sparids {{collected from the}} same habitat. Whitebone <b>porgy</b> were found to feed mainly on small hard-shelled species of gastropods. pagurid decapods. and sipunculids. Polychaetes. pelecypods. barnacles, and fishes were also eaten. Fishes and echinoderms were consumed by larger individuals. Whitebone <b>porgy</b> selected invertebrate species that were not abundant in benthic samples from the reef. suggesting that these fish forage on sand bottom fauna. Patterns of diet overlap with other reef-associated sparids appeared {{to be related to}} feeding morphology and feeding habitat. Overlap in diet between whiteuone <b>porgy</b> and southern <b>porgy.</b> Sfenotomus aculeatus. was low. although both species forage on sand bottom organisms. Pinfish. Lagodon rhomboides. fed mainly on a sessile reef amphipod that was rarely consumed by whitebone <b>porgy.</b> Whitebone <b>porgy</b> had a higher diet over·lap with sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus, and with red <b>porgy.</b> Pagrus pagrus, because all three species fed on barnacles not consumed by other sparids examined...|$|R
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, <b>porgies,</b> mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican hogfish (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos <b>porgies</b> (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, <b>porgies,</b> dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E

25|$|<b>Porgies</b> {{sometimes}} called sea breams, {{are any of}} about 100 species belonging to the family Sparidae. <b>Porgies</b> usually have high backs and a single dorsal fin, like snapper or grunt fishes (grunts are named for the sound they make grinding their teeth). They are bottom feeding pelagic fishes, with small mouths equipped with strong teeth adapted for handling small fishes and invertebrates with hard shells. Most do not exceed a size of about , but some may grow to four times that length. They often school, and will migrate between reefs. Larger fish enter estuaries and harbours.|$|E
25|$|Predatory pelagic fishes {{found on}} {{continental}} shelves worldwide in both tropical and temperate waters include <b>porgies,</b> barracuda, amberjacks and cutlassfishes. They {{tend to be}} larger fish, and are carnivorous, feeding on the smaller, silvery forage fish that eat plankton (see section above). Some species also feed on crabs and other invertebrates, foraged from the sea floor.|$|E
500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and <b>porgies),</b> and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|E

50|$|The Pluma <b>porgy</b> {{is similar}} to its relative, the Jolthead <b>porgy</b> (C. bajonado). However, it has fewer rays on its Pectoral fins than the Jolthead. The Pluma <b>porgy</b> has both 12 spines and 12 soft rays on its dorsal fin, while it has only 3 spines and 10 rays on its anal fin. Their heads are {{somewhat}} steep when viewed in profile, and have poorly developed prefrontal tubercles.
