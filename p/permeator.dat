The influence of Ca 2 + (0. 2 - 3. 7 millimolar) and Al 3 + (0 - 3. 7 millimolar) on the permeability of root cortical cells of Quercus rubra was measured using three nonelectrolytes (urea, methyl urea, and ethyl urea) as <b>permeators</b> of progressively increasing lipid solubility. Water permeability was also measured. Al 3 + (a) increased membrane permeability to the nonelectrolytes, (b) decreased the membrane's partiality for lipid <b>permeators,</b> and (c) decreased membrane permeability to water.

40|$|It is {{frequent}} within tritium {{processing systems}} {{that a small}} amount of hydrogen isotopes (Q{sub 2 }) must be separated from an inert gas such as He, Ar and N{sub 2 }. Thus, a study of presently available technologies for effecting such a separation was performed. A base case and seven technology alternatives were identified and a simple design of each was prepared. These technologies included oxidation-adsorption-metal bed reduction, oxidation-adsorption-palladium membrane reactor, cryogenic adsorption, cryogenic trapping, cryogenic distillation, hollow fiber membranes, gettering and <b>permeators.</b> It was found that all but the last two methods were unattractive for recovering Q{sub 2 } from N{sub 2 }. Reasons for technology rejection included (1) the method unnecessarily turns the hydrogen isotopes into water, resulting in a cumbersome and more hazardous operation, (2) the method would not work without further processing, and (3) while the method would work, it would only do so in an impractical way. On the other hand, getters and <b>permeators</b> were found to be attractive methods for this application. Both of these methods would perform the separation in a straightforward, essentially zero-waste, single step operation. The only drawback for <b>permeators</b> was that limited low-partial Q{sub 2 } pressure data is available. The drawbacks for getters are their susceptibility to irreversible and exothermic reaction with common species such as oxygen and water, and the lack of long-term operation of such beds.

40|$|The HFF and SW {{membrane}} <b>permeators</b> {{were installed}} in parallel units of a reverse osmosis (RO) pilot plant. Brackish feed {{water to the}} two units was treated with identical scale control treatment consisting of 6 ppm of sodium-hexa-meta phosphate (SHMP) and about 46 ppm (98 % basis) of sulfuric acid. The pH of the acidified feed was about 6. 4. Unit # 1, employing the HFF membrane, was operated at feed pressure of 27. 6 bar (400 psig) and unit # 2, employing the SW membrane, was operated at 15. 2 bar (220 psig). The water recovery in both units was 70 %. The pilot plant trial lasted for 7, 500 h. The techno-economic evaluation showed that performance of the SW membrane was far superior; its product TDS in 7500 h was 86 - 98 ppm whereas that of the HFF membrane increased from 80 ppm to 468 ppm. Water output of both membranes declined appreciably, but output of the SW membrane declined 12 % less. The average electrical energy consumed by high pressure pump of the SW membrane was nearly half the energy consumed by the HFF membrane (0. 70 kWh/m(3) product vs. 1. 51 for HFF).

For the effective {{production of}} oxygen with a high space-time yield, a two-step process is proposed. In a first step, O- 2 -enriched air with an oxygen concentration of 30 - 50 vol % is produced in a flow-through <b>permeator</b> from I bar of air as feed applying a vacuum pump to {{keep the pressure on}} the O- 2 -enriched air side at about 0. 12 bar. In a second step, pure oxygen is produced in a dead-end <b>permeator</b> using the O- 2 -enriched air from step 1 as pressurized feed and using again a vacuum pump to establish a reduced oxygen pressure of about 0. 05 bar on the permeate side.

40|$|Biofouling is {{the major}} problem of reverse osmosis (RO) {{membranes}} used for desalting seawater (SW). The use of chlorine is a conventional and common practice to control/prevent biofouling. Unlike polyamide RO membranes, cellulose triacetate (CTA) RO membranes display a high chlorine tolerance. Due to this characteristic, CTA membranes are used {{in most of the}} RO plants located in the Middle East region where the elevated seawater temperature and water quality promote the risk of membrane biofouling. However, there is no detailed study on the investigation/characterization of CTA-RO membrane fouling. In this investigation, the fouling profile of a full–scale SWRO desalination plant operating with not only continuous chlorination of raw seawater but also intermittent chlorination of CTA-RO membranes was studied. Detailed water quality and membrane fouling analyses were conducted. Profiles of microbiological, inorganic, and organic constituents of analysed fouling layers were extensively discussed. Our results clearly identified biofilm development on these membranes. The incapability of chlorination on preventing biofilm formation on SWRO membranes could be assigned to its failure in effectively reaching throughout the different regions of the <b>permeators.</b> This failure could have occurred due to three main factors: plugging of membrane fibers, chlorine consumption by organics accumulated on the front side fibers, or chlorine adaptation of certain bacterial populations...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{for the design}} and synthesis of membrane separation systems has been developed. The theory is shown to be applicable to both batch and continuous membrane operations, and has been formulated {{in such a way}} that it is valid for any type of membrane. In this thesis, however, only vapour permeation and pervaporation membranes are incorporated for illustration purposes. The method, which employs a graphical technique, allows one to calculate and visualise the change in composition of the retentate. An integral part of the approach was the derivation of the Membrane Residue Curve Map (M-RCM), and the related differential material balance which describes it. By definition, this plot shows the change, in time, of the retentate composition in a batch still. However, it has been shown that the M-RCM is applicable to conventional continuously-operated membrane units, as well as infinite reflux membrane columns. Finite reflux columns and cascades have been examined by using column sections (CS) : any column, or arrangement, no matter how complex, can be broken down into smaller units, namely CS. The development of the Difference Point Equation (DPE) for non-constant flow allowed one to generate, and interpret, profiles for individual CS’s, which can ultimately be connected to form a membrane column arrangement. The profiles, which are more complex than those obtained in the M-RCM, exhibit a unique behavior. Since there is varying flow, the reflux is continually changing, orientating the profile so as to seek a stable node that is “mobile”. Thus, the movement of CS profile is dictated by the location and direction of the pinch point locus. Finally, having membrane <b>permeators</b> examined in an analogous manner to other separation methods, allows for easy synthesis and design of combinations of different processes. Hybrid distillation-membrane systems are analyzed by incorporating CS’s and the appropriate DPE’s which describe each. Investigating the arrangement as a thermally-coupled column introduces a novel way of synthesizing hybrids. Regions of feasibility, which are dictated by the relevant pinch point loci of each separation method, are ultimately sought...|$|R
40|$|These Phase III {{experiments}} successfully addressed {{several issues}} needed to characterize a <b>permeator</b> system for application to a pulverized coal (PC) burning furnace/boiler assuming typical post-combustion cleanup devices in place. We completed key laboratory stage optimization and modeling efforts {{needed to move}} towards larger scale testing. The SOPO addressed six areas. Task 1 [...] Post-Combustion Particle Cleanup [...] The first object {{was to determine if}} the Carbozyme <b>permeator</b> performance was likely to be reduced by particles (materials) in the flue gas stream that would either obstruct the mouth of the hollow fibers (HF) or stick to the HF bore wall surface. The second, based on the Acceptance Standards (see below), was to determine whether it would be preferable to clean the inlet gas stream (removing acid gases and particulates) or to develop methods to clean the Carbozyme <b>permeator</b> if performance declined due to HF block. We concluded that condensation of particle and particulate emissions, in the heat exchanger, could result in the formation of very sticky sulfate aerosols with a strong likelihood of obtruding the HF. These must be managed carefully and minimized to near-zero status before entering the <b>permeator</b> inlet stream. More extensive post-combustion cleanup {{is expected to be a}} necessary expense, independent of CO{sub 2 } capture technology This finding is in agreement with views now emerging in the literature for a variety of CO{sub 2 } capture methods. Task 2 [...] Water Condensation [...] The key goal was to monitor and control temperature distributions within the <b>permeator</b> and between the <b>permeator</b> and its surroundings to determine whether water condensation in the pores or the HF bore would block flow, decreasing performance. A heat transfer fluid and delivery system were developed and employed. The result was near isothermal performance that avoided all instances of flow block. Direct thermocouple measurements provided the basis for developing a heat transfer model that supports prediction of heat transfer profiles for larger permeators Tasks 3. 4. 1, 4. 2 [...] Temperature Range of Enzymes [...] The goal was to determine if the enzyme operating temperature would limit the range of thermal conditions available to the capture system. We demonstrated the ability of various isozymes (enzyme variants) to operate from 4 - 85 C. Consequently, the operating characteristics of the enzyme are not a controlling factor. Further, any isozyme whose upper temperature bound is at least 10 C greater than that of the planned inlet temperature will be stable under unanticipated, uncontrolled 'hiccups' in power plant operation. Task 4. 4, 4. 4 [...] Examination of the Effects of SOx and NOx on Enzyme Activity (Development of Flue Gas Composition Acceptance Standards) [...] The purpose was to define the inlet gas profile boundaries. We examined the potential adverse effects of flue gas constituents including different acids from to develop an acceptance standard and compared these values to actual PC flue gas composition. Potential issues include changes in pH, accumulation of specific inhibitory anions and cations. A model was developed and validated by test with a SO{sub 2 }-laden stream. The predicted and actual data very largely coincided. The model predicted feed stream requirements to allow continuous operation in excess of 2500 hours. We developed operational (physical and chemical) strategies to avoid or ameliorate these effects. Avoidance, the preferred strategy (noted above), is accomplished by more extensive cleanup of the flue gas stream. Task 5 [...] Process Engineering Model [...] We developed a process-engineering model for two purposes. The first was to predict the physical and chemical status at each test point in the design as a basis for scale-up. The second was to model the capital and operating cost of the apparatus. These were accomplished and used to predict capex, opex and cost of energy. Task 6 [...] Preliminary Commercialization Plan [...] We carried out analyses of the market and the competition by a variety of parameters. The conclusion was that there is a large and rapidly growing market that will support good business growth...|$|E

40|$|Thin wall <b>permeator</b> tubes {{have been}} {{produced}} by diffusion welding of Pd-Ag foils. These dense metal membranes are proposed for separating and producing ultra-pure hydrogen {{as a result of}} their complete hydrogen selectivity. Furthermore, they present high hydrogen permeation fluxes as well as reduced costs on account of their reduced metal thickness. The reliability of these membrane tubes has been continuously tested during over 12 months of experimental campaign in presence of thermal and hydrogenation cycles. The permeability tests have been carried out measuring the hydrogen fluxes under controlled conditions of temperature and trans-membrane differential pressure. In particular, the behaviour of the membrane tube has been investigated in a wide range of temperatures (150 - 400 °C) and pressures (100 - 200 kPa) in order to simulate the use within permeators and membrane reactors where processes for producing hydrogen from hydrocarbons takes place. At temperature of 350 - 400 °C hydrogen permeability values around 1. 0 × 10 - 8 mol m- 1 s- 1 Pa- 0. 5 have been measured and they are comparable with the literature data.

40|$|Deux types de {{membranes}} peuvent être utilisés pour la séparation des gaz. Les unes sont poreuses et séparent les gaz sur la base de leur masse moléculaire selon un mécanisme de diffusion de Knudsen dans des micropores. Les facteurs de séparation obtenus sont généralement trop faibles pour présenter un intérêt industriel. Les autres, appelées membranes non poreuses, mettent en oeuvre un mécanisme de dissolution-diffusion des gaz dans une fine couche de polymère dénuée de toute porosité. C'est de ces dernières que nous allons parler. Commencé il y a une vingtaine d'années, le développement de ce type de membranes {{a conduit}} aux premières applications industrielles en 1979 avec l'introduction par Monsanto des séparateurs PRISM pour la récupération d'hydrogène à partir de différents gaz de raffinerie et de pétrochimie. Après des débuts modestes par suite de la compétition avec des technologies éprouvées comme la cryogénie, l'adsorption et l'absorption, la perméation gazeuse est en train de conquérir sa place parmi les techniques de séparation de gaz. Elle est aujourd'hui l'une des techniques membranaires présentant le plus fort taux de progression (30 % par an). Après un rappel des principes de base de la perméation gazeuse on abordera successivement les points suivants : - le choix du polymère constituant la couche séparatrice, - l'élaboration des membranes à structure asymétrique présentant une peau dense et fine, - les principales applications industrielles. Cela permettra de mettre en évidence les avantages et les limitations actuelles de la perméation gazeuse et de souligner les différents domaines où les efforts de R et D peuvent amener des progrès significatifs. Principle of Gas permeation - Gas permeation {{is a technique}} for fractionating gas mixtures by using nonporous polymer membranes having a selective permeability to gas according to a dissolution-diffusion mechanism. Gas is made {{to pass through the}} membrane by applying a pressure difference {{on either side of the}} membrane. This pressure difference causes a difference in dissolved gas concentration between the two faces of the membrane and hence a diffusional gas flow through the membrane. Choice of Polymer - The gas sorption capacity of the polymer depends on its free volume and its physical affinity for the gas. For a gas mixture, differences in affinity are selectivity factors. The mobility of sorbed molecules depends on the free volume of the polymer and on the degree of rigidity of the chains. Vitreous polymers are more selective in this respect than rubbery polymers. This is why they are generally chosen for manufacturing gas permeation membranes. Permeability and selectivity are somewhat antinomic properties, especially when the selectivity is of a diffusional type, i. e. when the polymer acts as a molecular sieve. The definition of new polymers providing a better compromise between permeability and selectivity thus goes via research on the relationships between structure and the permeability to the gas to be separated. In polymers in a vitreous state, the chains are fixed overall, but small local movements, for example such as the rotation of an aromatic nucleus around bonds in the para position, remain possible. It seems that such small movements are beneficial for permeability, while not detracting very much from the selectivity. Structures of chains that are unfavorable for compact piling increase permeability in general to the detriment of selectivity. This is true for chains having non-coplanar aromatic nuclei or ones having bulky groups. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give some structural and permeability data for various polyimides. Figures 4 and 5 show the performances for hydrogen/ methane and carbon-dioxide/methane separations of various polyimides synthesized in our laboratories. Asymmetric MembranesThe membranes used in practice have a particular structure that is called asymmetric, which combines high permeability and good mechanical strength. This structure has a thin dense and selective skin (0. 1 to 1 µm thick) supported by a thick microporous substructure (50 to 200 µm). Such membranes come either in a flat shape or in the form of hollow fibers with their skin outside. The asymmetric structure is obtained by the so-called phase inversiontechnique, which consists in transforming a homogeneous polymer solution into a two-phase medium made up of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-poor phase. The continuous rich phase prefigures the pore walls of the substructure. Once the poor phase becomes continuous, it will make up a network of communicating pores. Phase inversion can be caused in several ways: (a) solvent departure by evaporation (dry process) (b) introduction of a nonsolvent (wet process) (c) dry-wet process (d) temperature reduction (thermal process). The dense skin is formed on the side where evaporation takes place or where contact is made with the nonsolvent, or again on the cooled side (with the other side being in contact with the support for a flat membrane and a more or less coagulating liquid with a hollow fiber). A dense skin is formed by the superficial polymer overconcentration resulting from solvent evaporation or from its extraction by the nonsolvent before phase inversion. Figure 6 shows a ternary polymer-solvent-nonsolvent isothermal phase diagram on which arrows indicate how the homogeneous polymer solution (I) evolves toward a liquidliquid phase separation (II) or toward a gel structure (III). Industrial Development -Industrial <b>permeators</b> have large membrane surface areas in a compact form. These areas can be up to 500 m²/m³ for the flat version and up to 8000 m²/m³ for the hollow-fiber version. This compactness is obtained by the spiral winding of flat membranes or by the grouping of hollow fibers in bundles. Fig. 7 shows both types of <b>permeators.</b> The advantages of gas permeation lie in the small investment required, low energy consumption, great flexibility of implementation because of the modular nature and the possibility of the great automation of <b>permeators,</b> and the moderate size and weight of the installation. Limitations are linked to the difficulty in obtaining both good purity and high yield for a product with a membrane surface area that is economically acceptable. Likewise, the pressure drop undergone by the permeate may be a disadvantage. Gas permeation can be associated with other separation techniques such as pressure swing adsorption, freeze drying or absorption. The principal applications of gas permeation at present are as follows: (a) Hydrogen recovery from drain effluents from ammonia synthesis units in which hydrogen has to be separated from nitrogen, methane and argon. (b) Hydrogen recovery from refinery gas in which the hydrogen is mixed with hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and water vapor. (c) Adjustment of the hydrogen/carbon-monoxide ratio of alcohol synthesis gas. (d) Air fractionating from the production of blanketing nitrogen. (e) Natural-gas dehydration and sweetening with a view to its transportation by pipeline, especially in offshore production.

Two basic approaches are considered with respect to hyperfiltration of wash water recovery. The initial approach involves the use of a hollow fiber <b>permeator</b> and a tubular module, operating at ambient temperature. In this system, relatively large doses of biocides are used to control microbial activity. Since biocides require a long contact time, and many have adverse dematological effects as well as many interact with membrane material, a second approach is considered which involves operating at pasturization temperature...|$|E

40|$|Deaeration via gas {{permeation}} {{was investigated}} {{as a means}} of protection for oxygen sensitive pharmaceuticals and the optimum operating pressure for deaeration determined. The theory of permeation and selected parameters governing permeation were discussed. Gas permeation has been suggested as a viable alternative to currently accepted methods for reduction of dis solved oxygen levels. If this system is to be accepted as a method of protecting sensitive drug moieties, acceptable flow rates with analogous reduction of dis solved oxygen levels must be attained. The applicability of protection must be broad to include systems of interest in pharmaceutics. The intent {{of this study was to}} determine dissolved oxygen levels at various pressures and subsequent flow rates of effluent which would produce efficient dissolved oxygen removal at flow rates acceptable for pharmaceutical processes. The acceptibility of the protection afforded a model dru 2 ̆ 7 system (pyrogallol) was also determined. Dissolved oxygen levels were reduced from approximately 9 ppm to less than 1 ppm with a single pass through the <b>permeator</b> and to trace levels (3 ̆c 0. 05 ppm) with a second pass. The effluent flow rate was shown to be proportional to the pressure with which the solvent was forced through the <b>permeator.</b> Water with lower dissolved oxygen levels proved to lessen the rate of degradation of pyrogallol. With both single and double pass systems, the protection afforded was significant. The investigation also suggests that pyrogallol will degradate by non-oxidative means if oxidative degradation processes are not viable...|$|E

Mathematical models of perfectly mixed dual permeators with permeate recycles, operating with zero reject flow rate and zero permeate pressures (γ' = γ" = 0), have been developed. The equations for determination of the permeate compositions, the membrane area requirements and the separation factors have been derived, taking into consideration two different cases, one permeate recycle and two simultaneous permeate recycle streams. The simulation results have been presented for the separation of a CO 2 /H 2 mixture in a <b>permeator</b> enclosing both silicone rubber and cellulose acetate membranes.

40|$|Model-based {{optimisation}} {{is demonstrated}} {{for the design}} and analysis of two generalised membrane systems: a single stage <b>permeator</b> {{in which there is}} the recycle of both retentate and permeate gases, and a continuous membrane column in which there is the additional recycle of the retentate stream to the feed line. Multitubular shell-and-tube arrangements are considered with the counter-current flow of tube and shell-side gases; attention is given to the separation of air over several commercial polymeric membranes. A finite element technique is used for the solution of the model equations, and optimisation achieved through standard successive reduced quadratic programming methods. In specific, the maximisation of the Rony separation index is considered at various user-specified product oxygen purities. On this basis, a membrane column is shown to out-perform a single-stage <b>permeator.</b> Optimisation of the Rony index also leads to favourable composition profiles in the enricher and stripper sections of the membrane column, in which, for example, reverse permeation is avoided, and the extent of mixing (dilution) of feed minimised. Furthermore, the optimisation strategy is found to be approximately analogous to the maximisation of the equivalent pure oxygen and nitrogen production rates. Optimisation results for the membrane column indicate the benefits of a relatively small degree of retentate reflux, but negligible benefit of any retentate recycle to the feed line. For a given membrane column size and feed processing rate, membranes of low selectivity (but high permeability) are also shown to yield more favourable molar splits of oxygen and nitrogen than membranes of high selectivity, but at the expense of compressor power requirements. Issues of membrane column scale-up and intensification are also addressed by application of scaling ratio theory to the optimal designs. The theory indicates that for a membrane column designed for the maximum molar split of oxygen and nitrogen, a reduction in compressor power, whilst maintaining this split, can only be achieved at the expense of reduced feed throughput.
