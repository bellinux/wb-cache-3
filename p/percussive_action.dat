50|$|There {{are many}} types of drills: some are powered manually, others use {{electricity}} (electric drill) or compressed air (pneumatic drill) as the motive power, and a minority are driven by an internal combustion engine (for example, earth drilling augers). Drills with a <b>percussive</b> <b>action</b> (hammer drills) are mostly used in hard materials such as masonry (brick, concrete and stone) or rock. Drilling rigs are used to bore holes in the earth to obtain water or oil. Oil wells, water wells, or holes for geothermal heating are created with large drilling rigs. Some types of hand-held drills are also used to drive screws and other fasteners. Some small appliances that have no motor of their own may be drill-powered, such as small pumps, grinders, etc.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{research}} study, concerning an effort to investigate the specific steps {{during the process of}} forming electroacoustic sound identities through the performer's interaction with degrees of noisy spectrums through the use of philosophical concepts like fragmentation and abstraction. Before starting, I think is useful to clarify some aspects of the main concepts that I am willing to approach in order to create some useful tools for our discussion. When experiencing music for instrumental live and electronics with signal processing, I have the feeling that the actual part, that means the act of instrumental performing is there to 'justify', to remind us in a way the existence of the human element with sonic hints of virtuosic, idiomatic gestural patterns, like flute trills or pompous <b>percussive</b> <b>action,</b> showing rather a guilt attitude towards the presence and involvement of electronic means to the creative process...|$|E

To address these objectives, a wireline deep rotary-percussive corer called Auto-Gopher was developed. The <b>percussive</b> <b>action</b> provides effective material fracturing and the rotation provides effective cuttings removal. To increase the drill's penetration rate, the percussive and rotary motions are operated simultaneously. Initially, the corer {{was designed as a}} percussive mechanism for sampling ice and was demonstrated in 2005 in Antarctica reaching about 2 m deep. The lessons learned suggested the need to use a combination of rotation and hammering to maximize the penetration rate. This lesson was implemented into the Auto-Gopher-I deep drill which was demonstrated to reach 3 -meter deep in gypsum. The average drilling power that was used has been in the range of 100 - 150 Watt, while the penetration rate was approximately 2. 4 m/hr. Recently, a task has started with the goal to develop Auto-Gopher-II that is equipped to execute all the necessary functions in a single drilling unit. These functions also include core breaking, retention and ejection in addition drilling. In this manuscript, the Auto-Gopher-II, its predecessors and their capability are described and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Orcas, Orcinus orca, {{also known}} as 2 ̆ 2 killer whales, 2 ̆ 2 are a species {{that have been the}} subject of {{long-term}} research. The aim of this study was to quantify percussive behaviors of a population of orcas, identify which individuals in a pod were displaying such behaviors, determine the context in which these behaviors occurred, and offer suggestions to the purpose, if any, that percussive activity may serve in this community. The study was conducted in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia, Canada during the summer months of 1992 - 1993. Observations were made during daylight hours. Whales were encountered either opportunistically, or by reports from other whale-watchers and researchers. A total of 542 hours of observational data were collected from 86 individual whales. Behavioral categories were defined as feeding, socializing, traveling, and resting. The most often observed percussive behaviors were tailslaps; they were therefore analyzed in the greatest detail. The number of tail slaps produced during feeding, socializing, aggregation, directional changes, and in the presence of boats were statistically compared. It has been suggested that calves and juveniles engage in percussive activity as a form of play during socializing, and that percussive behavior may aid in building physical strength and motor training. Adolescents and adults may engage in <b>percussive</b> <b>actions</b> to convey information about a direction change to other animals, strengthen social ties, express sociosexual behavior, and assist in social development, all of which could establish and strengthen social skills and social bonds among other individuals in the community. Other hypotheses for percussive behavior in this community include: forms of aggression; a type of warning signal; incidental occurrences due to elevated activity levels; a form of greeting among individuals; an expression of courtship behavior; a way to establish or re-establish dominant-subordinate relationships; an aid in the capture of prey during feeding; and a type of energy release either before or after resting behavior. It appears that each age class may have its own agenda for displaying percussive activity, depending on the context in which it was performed. The reason why each individual engages in <b>percussive</b> <b>actions</b> may be multifaceted for various situations, and each reason may not be bound to a particular context. The high level of occurrence of percussive behaviors implies that they are relevant to the daily activities of the northern resident community of orcas that inhabit the region of Johnstone Strait, British Columbia, Canada...|$|R
40|$|Cassowaries (Casuarius) {{possess a}} cranial casque, {{sheathed}} by keratin and composed of modified cranial bones. We combine data and hypotheses on three areas of cassowary research. First, we present novel observations on casque anatomy. The bony core is fragile, incorporating {{a mass of}} trabeculae anteriorly and an empty space posteriorly. Secondly, we use these observations to evaluate hypotheses of casque function. Implications that the casque evolved {{within the context of}} activities involving <b>percussive</b> <b>actions</b> are unlikely and observations that might support these hypotheses are absent. It is most likely that the casque serves a sociosexual role and functions in visual and acoustic display. The similarity in casque form between males and females, combined with male parental investment, makes it plausible that the extravagant structures present in cassowaries evolved within the context of mutual sexual selection. Thirdly, we combine morphological, molecular and geological evidence to provide a new phylogenetic history for cassowaries. We suggest that cassowaries invaded New Guinea in at least two waves and provisionally regard crown–cassowaries as a geologically young, post-Pliocene clade. We provide these hypotheses as areas requiring discussion and urge other workers to test our ideas with new data on cassowary anatomy, behaviour and genetics...|$|R
40|$|How do {{capuchin}} monkeys {{learn to}} use stones to crack open nuts? Perception-action theory posits that individuals explore producing varying spatial and force relations among objects and surfaces, thereby learning about affordances of such relations and how to produce them. Such learning supports the discovery of tool use. We present longitudinal developmental data from semifree-ranging tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) to evaluate predictions arising from Perception-action theory linking manipulative development and the onset of tool-using. Percussive actions bringing an object into contact with a surface appeared within {{the first year of}} life. Most infants readily struck nuts and other objects against stones or other surfaces from 6 months of age, but percussive actions alone were not sufficient to produce nut-cracking sequences. Placing the nut on the anvil surface and then releasing it, so that it could be struck with a stone, was the last element necessary for nut-cracking to appear in capuchins. Young chimpanzees may face a different challenge in learning to crack nuts: they readily place objects on surfaces and release them, but rarely vigorously strike objects against surfaces or other objects. Thus the challenges facing the two species in developing the same behavior (nut-cracking using a stone hammer and an anvil) may be quite different. Capuchins must inhibit a strong bias to hold nuts so that they can release them; chimpanzees must generate a <b>percussive</b> <b>action</b> rather than a gentle placing action. Generating the right actions may be as challenging as achieving the right sequence of actions in both species. Our analysis suggests a new direction for studies of social influence on young primates learning sequences of actions involving manipulation of objects in relation to surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary percussive drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using rotary percussive drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The <b>percussive</b> <b>action</b> fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|E
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} and cutting {{is essential in}} the mining industry. Rock characterisation and classification methods have been proposed to assess drilling or cutting performance. However, a unique method to relate rock characteristics to rock cutting performance {{has not yet been}} developed. This is due to the complexity of interactions among the variables involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties, but also the nature of drilling. Cost-effective drilling is achievable by allocating the available gross energy towards the drilling action and, at the same time, reducing systematically that energy consumed in frictional processes inherent to tool-rock interactions. Several {{attempts have been made to}} assess drilling performance by correlating different rock properties with the drilling rate. For instance, rock texture, grain size, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Mohs hardness and rock mass structural parameters, and others have been used to build a number of drillability indices. However, not only rock properties, but also different sets of drilling parameters and drilling techniques have an impact on the drilling performance and efficiency of the process. On one hand, to predict rock drilling performance and optimisation of drilling operation, tool-rock interaction laws, i. e. the relations between forces acting on the tool in contact with rock, are essential. For instance, through tool-rock interaction laws, it was found that during rotary drilling, the energy consumed in pure cutting action of rock is measured by the intrinsic specific energy. In the case of percussive drilling, tool-rock interactions are focused mostly in the prediction of the penetration rate and the optimum thrust. On the other hand, rock failure characterised by rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated as there is not a unique criterion able to describe rock brittleness quantitatively nor consensus about the most suitable and reliable brittleness index to apply to different rock engineering works encountered in the field. A new brittleness index upon fracture strain-energy quantities extracted from the area under complete stress-strain curve of rocks in uniaxial compressive tests is proposed herein to study drilling performance by rock brittleness capacity. This brittleness index takes into account post-peak instability in uniaxial compression as post-peak instability of rock during compression can be treated as a manifestation of rock brittleness. That is, an increase in the post-peak energy indicates an increase of stability (i. e. a decrease in brittleness or increase in ductility). In the same manner, a dramatic decrease of post-peak energy indicates less stability of the failure process (i. e. an increase in brittleness). In this view, advanced laboratory experiments on strength and deformability of soft-to-hard rock types (UCS is ranging from 7 to 215 MPa) were carried out. The compressive tests complied with the application of a prescribed constant lateral strain-rate as a feedback signal to control the axial load which was found to be a suitable loading rate to measure the complete stress-strain response for the rocks. The new brittleness index developed herein describes a monotonic and unambiguous scale of brittleness with increasing pre-peak strength parameters such as crack damage stress and peak stress as well as deformation parameters such as the tangent Young’s modulus of rock. This outcome becomes relevant in order to better understand material brittleness associated with the progressive fracture process characterised by the typical threshold damage stresses, peak stress and the elasticity parameters. The brittleness index scale indicates that a higher brittleness index means that rock is more brittle which corresponds to higher strength rocks. In order to reliably estimate drilling performance both tool-rock interaction laws along with a proper rock brittleness index are required to be implemented. In this study the performance of a single PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) cutter cutting and different drilling methods including PDC rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary {{drilling and}} percussive drilling were investigated. To investigate drilling performance by rock strength properties, laboratory PDC cutting tests were performed on soft-to-hard rocks to obtain cutting parameters. In addition, results of laboratory and field drilling on different rocks found elsewhere in literature were used. Laboratory and field cutting and drilling test results were coupled with values of a new rock brittleness index proposed herein and developed upon energy dissipation extracted from the complete stress-strain curve in uniaxial compression. To quantify cutting and drilling performance, the intrinsic specific energy in rotary-cutting action, i. e. the energy consumed in pure cutting action, and drilling penetration rate values in <b>percussive</b> <b>action</b> were used. The results show that the new energy-based brittleness index successfully describes the performance of the studied cutting and drilling methods. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This {{innovation}} comprises {{a compact}} drill that uses low-axial preload, via vibrations, that fractures the rock under the bit kerf, and rotates the bit {{to remove the}} powdered cuttings while augmenting the rock fracture via shear forces. The vibrations fluidize the powered cuttings inside the flutes around the bit, reducing the friction with the auger surface. These combined actions reduce the consumed power and the heating of the drilled medium, helping to preserve the pristine content of the produced samples. The drill consists of an actuator that simultaneously impacts and rotates the bit by applying force and torque via a single piezoelectric stack actuator {{without the need for}} a gearbox or lever mechanism. This reduces the development/fabrication cost and complexity. The piezoelectric actuator impacts the surface and generates shear forces, fragmenting the drilled medium directly under the bit kerf by exceeding the tensile and/or shear strength of the struck surface. The <b>percussive</b> impact <b>action</b> of the actuator leads to penetration of the medium by producing a zone of finely crushed rock directly underneath the struck location. This fracturing process is highly enhanced by the shear forces from the rotation and twisting action. To remove the formed cuttings, the bit is constructed with an auger on its internal or external surface. One of the problems with pure hammering is that, as the teeth become embedded in the sample, the drilling efficiency drops unless the teeth are moved away from the specific footprint location. By rotating the teeth, they are moved to areas that were not fragmented, and thus the rock fracturing is enhanced via shear forces. The shear motion creates ripping or chiseling action to produce larger fragments to increase the drilling efficiency, and to reduce the required power. The actuator of the drill consists of a piezoelectric stack that vibrates the horn. The stack is compressed by a bolt between the backing and the horn in order to prevent it from being subjected to tensile stress that will cause it to fail. The backing is intended to transfer the generated mechanical vibrations towards the horn. In order to cause rotation, the horn is configured asymmetrically with helical segments and, upon impacting the bit, it introduces longitudinal along the axis of the actuator and tangential force causing twisting action that rotates the bit. The longitudinal component of the vibrations of the stack introduces percussion impulses between the bit and the rock to fracture it when the ultimate strain is exceeded under the bit...|$|R
