40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. On the one hand it aims at {{extending}} King-Fullerton methodology to a larger scope of liabilities and primarily, in the empirical section of the paper, to statutory charges associated to labour costs, basically employers' contributions to social security. Thus it proposes substituting MESC or Marginal Effective Statutory Charge, for King-Fullerton METR, and enlarging the <b>p-statistics</b> to requirements in terms of labour cost coverage, then reinterpreting it in terms of marginal value added. A further extension to environmental levies as well as a generalisation to any market failure inefficiency loss are also presented. On the other hand the paper intends to emphasize the key role of factor supply elasticities or relative mobility and market rigidities in determining the impact of the - or part of the - MESC statistics on the location decision of an MNE, a Multinational Enterprise. Indeed, in a setting where no rigidities are at work on the market for the immobile factor, like labour, levies on the compensation of that factor don't matter for MNE decision. Unlike that, in a setting where such rigidities are present, they do matter since they refrain the possibility to pass the burden of the tax on the holder of the rather immobile factor. The ultimate goal of the paper is, through the topics mentioned above, to cope with issues especially relevant for interjurisdictional behaviour of multinational entreprises without the framework of a nex Federation like the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether introduction of item-response theory (IRT) analysis, in {{parallel to the}} 'traditional' statistical analysis methods available for performance evaluation of multiple T/F items as used in the European Board of Ophthalmology Diploma (EBOD) examination, has proved beneficial, and secondly, to study whether the overall assessment performance of the current written part of EBOD is sufficiently high (KR- 20 ≥ 0. 90) to be kept as examination format in future EBOD editions. Methods: 'Traditional' analysis methods for individual MCQ item performance comprise <b>P-statistics,</b> Rit-statistics and item discrimination, while overall reliability is evaluated through KR- 20 for multiple T/F items. The additional set of statistical analysis methods {{for the evaluation of}} EBOD comprises mainly IRT analysis. These analysis techniques are used to monitor whether the introduction of negative marking for incorrect answers (since EBOD 2010) has a positive influence on the statistical performance of EBOD as a whole and its individual test items in particular. Results: Item-response theory analysis demonstrated that item performance parameters should not be evaluated individually, but should be related to one another. Before the introduction of negative marking, the overall EBOD reliability (KR- 20) was good though with room for improvement (EBOD 2008 : 0. 81; EBOD 2009 : 0. 78). After the introduction of negative marking, the overall reliability of EBOD improved significantly (EBOD 2010 : 0. 92; EBOD 2011 : 0. 91; EBOD 2012 : 0. 91). Conclusion: Although many statistical performance parameters are available to evaluate individual items, our study demonstrates that the overall reliability assessment remains the only crucial parameter to be evaluated allowing comparison. While individual item performance analysis is worthwhile to undertake as secondary analysis, drawing final conclusions seems to be more difficult. Performance parameters need to be related, as shown by IRT analysis. Therefore, IRT analysis has proved beneficial for the statistical analysis of EBOD. Introduction of negative marking has led to {{a significant increase in the}} reliability (KR- 20 > 0. 90), indicating that the current examination format can be kept for future EBOD examinations. © 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.
