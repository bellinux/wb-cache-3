40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} synthetic fluorspar as {{a substitute}} for natural fluorspar flux in basic cupola ironmaking. The synthetic fluor-spars tested were prepared from waste fluosilicic acid generated during the processing of fluorapatite ore. The cupola trials showed the synthetic products to be the equivalent of natural fluorspar from an operational standpoint. However, wet scrubber sampling showed that substantial losses of volatilized fluorine occurred from the cupola during operation. The losses during synthetic fluorspar trials considerably exceeded those from natural fluorspar trials. Laboratory viscosity testing, using a high-temperature rotational viscometer, confirmed this finding and indicated that fluorspar volatility in slags is related to slag basicity. Synthetic fluorspar is accordingly recommended more for highly basic cupola operation (> 1. 3 basicity) than for neutral or acid operation, because of the increased <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> and baghouse filter detezioration...|$|E

Consequently, site selection and design methods for uranium tailings have undergone considerable change and development in recent years.

We consider two different administrative structures that govern the trade of emission permits: one-for-one trading (the number of permits required for each unit of emission is the same for every WWTP) and trading ratios (the number of permits required for each unit of emissions varies across WWTP). Results show that water quality regulators should allow trading to occur at the river basin scale as an appropriate first-step policy, as is being done in a limited number of cases via compliance associations. Larger spatial scales may be needed under conditions of increased abatement costs.

The polar regions provide important services to global ecosystems and humankind, ranging from food and energy to freshwater and biodiversity.

Coastal Arctic communities are impacted by climate change through coastal erosion, sea level rise, ice loss, and altered marine food webs, threatening the future of their subsistence lifestyle. Climate change has dramatically increased the melt rate of ice sheets and glaciers at both poles and has the potential to significantly raise sea level worldwide.

These latrines are suitable as a means of isolating human waste, however, conditions within pits often lead to nitrification of the contained waste. In areas with a near-surface aquifer, the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> nitrate <b>pollution</b> arising from pit latrines cannot be ignored. In this study, site visits were made to three densely populated, peri-urban areas near three West African cities (Dakar, Abidjan, Abomey-Calavi) to gather relevant information about the latrines in use and the soil and groundwater underneath the sites. Modelling was then conducted to demonstrate the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> nitrate <b>pollution</b> of the groundwater from the latrines in such settings. The depth from the bottom of the pits to the water table was considered as 5, 10 or 30 m, to represent the range of aquifer depths at the study sites. Nitrate half-lives ranging from 500 to 1500 days were considered, and time scales from 6 months to several years were modelled. The results highlighted the high likelihood of nitrate pollution of groundwater reaching levels exceeding the World Health Organization guideline value for nitrate in drinking water of 50 mg/L after as short a period as two years for the aquifer situated 5 m below the pits, when considering moderate to long nitrate half-lives in the subsurface. Careful siting of latrines away from high water table areas, more frequent pit emptying, or switching to urine diversion toilets may be effective solutions to reduce nitrate passage from pit latrines into groundwater, although these solutions may not always be applicable, because of social, technical and economic constraints.
