We generate surface acoustic <b>waves</b> with <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> using a line-focused pulsed-laser to study scattering of SAWs on surface microcracks. A homogenized behavior of the randomly scattered and interferometrically detected field, i. e. the coherent waveform, is gained by spatially averaging the measurements. The data is studied in the time and frequency domain. The experimental results show the attenuation of the coherent SAWs due to scattering and the strongly distorted shape indicates the presence of dispersion.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{transducer}} modeling {{is important}} and fundamental research for nondestructive testing of materials. Traditionally, in most nondestructive evaluation applications, the ultrasonic transducers are modeled as point sources generating spherical <b>wave</b> <b>fronts,</b> line sources generating cylindrical <b>wave</b> <b>fronts,</b> or planar surfaces generating <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> <b>fronts.</b> In reality, the transducer front face has finite dimensions; it is neither point source nor planar source. This study shows how the ultrasonic field {{in the neighborhood of}} a transducer with finite dimension varies in homogeneous and nonhomogeneous media. In this thesis, the pressure variation in front of a transducer face is computed for the following three situations: (1) the transducer is immersed in a homogeneous fluid; (2) the transducer is near a fluid-fluid interface; and (3) the transducer is near a fluid-solid interface using Distributed Point Source Method For the nonhomogeneous fluid medium, both normal incidence and oblique incidence cases have been studied...|$|R

40|$|An efficient, {{lightweight}} and stable, Fourier transform spectrometer was developed. The mechanical slide mechanism {{needed to create}} a path difference was eliminated {{by the use of}} retro-reflecting mirrors in a monolithic interferometer assembly in which the mirrors are not at 90 degrees to the propagation vector of the radiation, but rather at a small angle. The resulting <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> create a double-sided inteferogram of the source irradiance distribution which is detected by a charge-coupled device image sensor array. The position of each CCD pixel in the array is an indication of the path difference between the two retro-reflecting mirrors in the monolithic optical structure. The Fourier transform of the signals generated by the image sensor provide the spectral irradiance distribution of the source. For imaging, the interferometer assembly scans the source of irradiation by moving the entire instrument, such as would occur if it was fixedly mounted to a moving platform, i. e., a spacecraft. During scanning, the entrace slot to the monolithic optical structure sends different pixels to corresponding interferograms detected by adjacent columns of pixels of the image sensor...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{ultrasonic}} transducers is {{an important}} aspect of research in nondestructive evaluation and testing. In most nondestructive evaluation applications, the ultrasonic transducers are traditionally modeled as: (1) point sources generating spherical <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> (2) line sources generating cylindrical <b>wave</b> <b>fronts,</b> or (3) planar surfaces generating <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> <b>fronts.</b> In reality, the transducer front face has finite dimensions; it is neither point source nor planar source because the ultrasound that emits from a piezoelectric transducer does not originate from a point or an infinite plane, but instead originates from the finite surface of the piezoelectric element with flat or curved front face. Analytically modeling the fields radiated by ultrasonic transducers is a very difficult task because of the large number of possible transducer types, sizes and configurations that are used in practice. In this study, a semi analytical technique the Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is adapted to model ultrasonic transducers. The DPSM discretizes the transducer surface into a finite number of elemental surfaces. As a result, the complexity associated with the discretization of the three-dimensional problem geometry as done in the finite element technique is reduced. In the DPSM technique, the fundamental governing equations for elastic wave propagation in a fluid and in a solid are solved. For this reason, the DPSM technique is called a semi-analytical technique. In this research, computer codes for computing the ultrasonic field in a three dimensional inhomogeneous medium in front of a transducer of finite dimension have been written in MatLab. Two different cases are considered in this study, nonhomogeneous fluid and fluid-solid interface. Both normal and inclined incidence cases are investigated. This investigation shows that DPSM is an efficient technique for modeling ultrasonic transducers in nonhomogeneous media...|$|R

This is so when a lensless Fourier hologram of an empty pupil is recorded. If between two such exposures the holographic plate is rotated or translated inplane, the two overlapping interference patterns will produce low-frequency moire patterns.

40|$|I report {{observations}} of unusually strong photospheric and chromospheric velocity oscillations in {{and near the}} leading sunspot of NOAA 10781 on 03 July 2005. I investigate an impinging wave as a possible origin of the velocity pattern, and the changes of the wave after the passage through the magnetic fields of the sunspot. The wave pattern found consists of a wave with about 3 Mm apparent wavelength that propagates towards the sunspot. This wave seems to trigger oscillations inside the sunspot's umbra, which originate from a location inside the penumbra {{on the side of}} the impinging wave. The wavelength decreases and the velocity amplitude increases by an order of magnitude in the chromospheric layers inside the sunspot. On the side of the sunspot opposite to the impinging <b>plane</b> <b>wave,</b> circular <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> centered on the umbra are seen propagating away from the sunspot outside its outer white-light boundary. They lead to a peculiar ring structure around the sunspot, which is visible in both velocity and intensity maps.
