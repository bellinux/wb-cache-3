40|$|This paper {{presents}} the cavitation characteristics for circular cylinder when <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> is supplied from {{surface of the}} cylinder to main flow around it. I reported already the cavitation characteristics of hydro-foils with <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> supply. But I couldnit get good results at that time, because cavitation on the foils developed more suddenly by the <b>pressure</b> <b>water.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> is led from a water pipe directly to the testing cylinder. The cylinder has fourteen small holes on its surface, and they are located at some angle ± θ from the stagnation point of upstream side on the circular cylinder surface. Seven holes are located at+θ, the others are at -θ. <b>Pressure</b> <b>water</b> is supplied through these holes to main flow. The angle θ are 70 °, 90 °, 110 °, and 130 °. Experimental results show as follows; 1. When θ equals 70 ° drag coefficients are much larger than one of no <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> supply. Cavitation inception coefficient varies from 5. 0 to 4. 2 while relative volume of <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> increases from μ ＝ 7. 02 × 10 ^- 3 to 2. 92 × 10 ^- 2. These values are very large compared with 2. 0 for no water supply. 2. When θ takes 90 °. drag coefficents are also larger, but they are somewhat smaller than ones for 70 °. The inception coefficient takes from 4. 0 to 2. 6, decreasing with increasing relative volume of supplied water which is changed the same range to the former. 3. Drag coefficients almost equal to one of no <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> When θ takes 110 °. Coefficients of cavitation inception varies from 3. 7 to 3. 2 with changing supplied water volume. 4. When θ equals 130 °, drag coefficients are much smaller than one of no water supply. The former is about a half of the later {{within the range of}} none cavitation. Cavitation inception coefficient takes from 2. 5 to 3. 5, but on this time, the value increases with supplied water volume. All of them, cavitation inception coefficients are larger than one of no water supply. But when θ equal 110 °and 130 °, cavitation scarcely develops within some ranges of cavitation coefficients. At 110 °for θ, the limiting cavitation coefficient for no development of cavitation varies from 2. 7 to 1. 8, and it decreases with increasing supplied water volume. At 130 °, it varies from 1. 8 to 1. 6. As previously described, cavitation inception coefficient for no <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> supply is about 2. 0, and cavitation develops gradually with decreasing cavitation coefficient.

The observations revealed that intergranular attack proceeded by the development of a zone of polycrystalline chromia along the boundary plane intersecting either the free surface or a blunted, open crack in contact with the free surface. Ni-rich metal particles were interspersed within the chromia. Conversely, open cracks were filled with nanocrystalline NiO and large compound particles of spinel and NiO, indicating a difference in potential between closed, attacked boundaries and open cracks. Open cracks appeared to have initiated by fracture of the chromia zones, such fracture being strongly dependent on boundary geometry with respect to loading direction. The observations suggest that stress corrosion crack initiation and propagation is dependent on diffusion of oxygen through the porous oxides. Dislocations and stress could enhance diffusion as chromia was observed along slip planes at the arrested tips of blunt cracks...|$|E

In 2003, China's first experimental modulized pebble bed high temperature gas-cooled reactor plant was designed, built by Tsinghua University {{and began to}} operate and achieved full capacity operating and supplying power with 10, 000 -kilowatt to the grid. In terms of its safety, the fourth generation is obviously superior to the former generations’ technology, because it uses helium coolant's natural convection to control the reactor even in high temperatures (NGNP Industry Alliance 2012). The <b>pressured</b> <b>water</b> reactors units we see today are massive. However, the actual reactor itself is only about one thousandth {{the size of the}} total unit in reality. With the reactor made sufficiently large, it can radiate heat more easily, meaning no power and no water or other cooling fluid is required for high temperate gas-cooled reactor. If normal heat transport systems are not available, heat removal from the reactor occurs naturally and directly to the earth. Even if normal cooling systems are not functional, it takes days to reach limited temperatures (still under temperatures that could melt reactor core) with low energy density of the reactor core and the large heat capacity of the graphite structure. Therefore, reactors can be built and operated independent of water source.|$|E

A lot of {{research has been done}} since 1940 s to develop design philosophies against blast forces. As a result, a number of methods have been introduced to estimate design parameters and procedures have been developed to carry out blast resistant designs.

Therefore, developing design guidelines which can be easily used for designing blast resistant structures is important.

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} solve the problem of water {{shortage}} in agriculture, it’s necessary to develop water-saving irrigation. Drip Irrigation is a method of applying uniform and precise amount of water directly to the root zone of the plants as per the requirement, through emitters at frequent intervals over a long period of time, via pressure pipe network. As the key device in drip irrigation systems, the emitter is to drip the <b>pressured</b> <b>water</b> in the pipeline to the root of the crops evenly and steadily, so as to guarantee the water demand for crop growth. The quality of the emitter has an important effect on the reliability, life span of the drip irrigation system and irrigation quality. Usually, the structure of the emitter channel is very complex with a dimension. Emitter’s intricate inner channel makes the flow of water have turbulent behavior. In the design of emitter structure, we use 3 D parametric CAD software SolidWorks 2012 to design labyrinth emitter. According to emitter’s hydraulic performance and its requirement for anti-clogging, we can design new channel structures by changing those dimensions. The irrigation quality of drip irrigation system is verified by emitter’s hydraulic performance. In the high-pressure pipeline, the water energy may dissipate after flowing through the labyrinth channel and the flow rate can be controlled to meet the water need of the crops. To ensure the emitter’s hydraulic performance, before the fabrication of emitter, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to predict emitter’s flow rate and analyze its hydraulic performance under various water pressures...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of lignocellulosic polysaccharides {{has been studied}} {{as an alternative to}} petroleum for producing fuels and chemical products, such as those in plastics. However, biomass lignin has been shown to inhibit polysaccharide conversion. Lignin, an organic polymer, surrounds biomass polysaccharides, hemicellulose and cellulose, making the biomass resistant to deconstruction and limiting polysaccharide conversion yields. Increases in polysaccharide conversion yields are seen when using physical or chemical pretreatment methods that increase convertible cellulose, remove lignin, and restructure biomass. A physical pretreatment, liquid hot water (LHW), solubilizes hemicellulose and melts lignin using hot, <b>pressured</b> <b>water.</b> A chemical treatment, sodium-chlorite acetic acid (SCAA), uses a strong oxidizing agent coupled with acid to chemically remove the lignin. This study analyzed LHW and SCAA pretreatments, each at two levels of severity, for aiding in deconstruction of wild type poplar biomass and poplar genetically modified for increased lignin digestibility. Following pretreatments, biomass composition was analyzed via a standard method using a combination of acid hydrolysis deconstruction and biomass fractionation. We report that increasing length of SCAA treatments shows sequential reduction in total lignin (11. 8 %, 8. 0 %) when compared to untreated biomass (23. 1 %) and provides an average 27. 3 % increase in the portion of total lignin that is acid digestible. LHW pretreatments increase the proportion of available glucan for conversion while minimally changing biomass structure in contrast to the SCAA treatment which largely alters biomass composition.

The largest rise occurred just before the 2001 Geiyo earthquake of M 0. 1, which indicated a possible precursor for the shock. A chemical analysis of ion concentrations of the hot water suggested that the temperature anomalies arise from contamination by intruding external deep water; 2) Gushing of groundwater at the sea bottom was considered to have occurred at the Akashi Strait 2 days before the 1335 Kobe earthquake of M 1. 3, based on an interpretation of the appearance of brownish-black seawater found by the captain of a passenger boat; 3) Upwelling of deep hot groundwater was occurred at Inagawa Town, Hyogo Prefecture, southwest Japan, which was {{associated with}} the 1335 Kobe earthquake. The well water temperature rose 3 - 4 ℃. {{at the time of the}} shock, and decayed with a time constant of 1 - 2 years; 4) Heating of ground rocks by upwelling hot water intruding into the fracture zone of an active fault, which is considered to be a precursor for the April 1, 1335 Niigata-ken Hokubu earthquake of M 5. 5, was confirmed by a LANDSAT infrared image in the northern Niigata area, central Japan, on a summer night in 133 [...] All of the above transient phenomena can be reasonably understood in the light of the hypothesis of pressured hot water upwelling from deep underground in response to crustal movements around seismically active regions...|$|E
