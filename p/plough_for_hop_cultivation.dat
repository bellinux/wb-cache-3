5000|$|So the Royal Bavarian State Government decided, in the {{supplement}} to the draft of the Lokalbahn ('local line') law of 12 December 1895, that a Lokalbahn from Landshut to Pfeffenhausen with an extension to Rottenburg {{would be the most}} appropriate course. The option of extending it to Ingolstadt was left open. Land required for the construction of the line was transferred to the Bavarian state at no cost. On 17 June 1896 the [...] "Landshut-Rottenburg Localbahn project" [...] was approved under a Lokalbahn law. It was promised that this would deliver advantages, especially for local farmers, not just for the growing of cereals and farming of cattle but also <b>for</b> <b>hop</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the Hallertau.|$|R

The local hop {{industry}} in the area is much reduced and many old hop yards stand empty or have been demolished, whilst some oast houses have been converted into dwellings. The countryside of the parish does however still have a sizeable acreage of orchards and hop vines, and there has in recent years been a revival of apple, pear and <b>hop</b> <b>cultivation</b> corresponding with increased popularity and consumption in Britain of traditional cider, perry and ale.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hop</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{was begun}} in the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers. Before {{national}} alcohol prohibition, cultivation was mainly centered around New York, California, Oregon, and Washington. Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York's production by the 1920s, and California only produces hops on a small scale.|$|R
40|$|Hop {{differs from}} other {{agricultural}} plants {{in view of}} the fact that it is a perennial plant. It can grow at one site up to 20 years. There are three recognized hop production areas in the Czech Republic such as Žatecko, Úštecko and Tršice. The quality of the cones is high mainly due to the range of plant variety and also due to the favourable environmental conditions. <b>Hop</b> <b>cultivation</b> technology was already explored a long time ago, and therefore the new resources are rarely available and also widely scattered. The aim of this thesis is to describe the <b>hops</b> <b>cultivation</b> technology and its food and non-food utilization. This work includes botanical characteristics, farming techniques, fertilization, and protection against pests, harvest and post-harvest treatment. Furthermore there is description of the influence of agricultural engineering or fertilization on quality of hops. This bachelors thesis also depicts food and non-food use of hops...|$|R

The vineyards were mainly in the localities Herrlesberg, Österberg and Neuhalde. They were replaced by <b>hops</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.

40|$|This master's {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the hop house as it exists within Otsego County, New York. A hop house is an outbuilding type used in the drying and processing of hops. Research is based on a survey of fifty two hop houses within Otsego County, supplemented primarily by archival research conducted at the New York State Historical Association. There are five subjects covered within this thesis. The first is a history of <b>hops</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Upstate New York. The second part reviews the forms and functions of the hop house. The three main forms are common, step-up common, and draft pyramidal. The third examines the distribution and patters of hop houses within Otsego County by utilizing profiles from the survey. The concentration of hop houses is found to be highest in the fertile valleys that have easy access to the former location of the Great Western Turnpike. It is also found that the conservative nature of hop houses in Otsego County can be attributed to small scale farms and production peaking before major technological change occurred. The fourth covers folklore and material culture associated with <b>hops</b> <b>cultivation.</b> This includes crop prediction lore, courting customs, and the various specialized tools used during picking and processing. The final subject examines and proposes solutions for the subject of hop house deterioration. The specialized use of hop houses makes them prone to neglect. This thesis recommends that a new or current organization take advantage of the current craft beer boom to bring attention to hop houses. It also proposes forming a closer relationship with owners in preserving hop houses...|$|R
