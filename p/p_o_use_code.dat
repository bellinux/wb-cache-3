40|$|Background: Pashanbhed is {{a commercially}} {{available}} diuretic and lithotropic drug, {{used to treat}} renal problems. It is a controversial name as it is assigned to various plants such as Bergenia ligulata, Kalanchoe pinnata, Coleus aromaticus and Rotula aquatica. Objective: To perform the comparative preliminary phytochemical screening, diuretic activity, and thin layer chromatography (TLC) finger printing profile of three plants (B. ligulata, C. aromaticus, and K. pinnata), most commonly used as Pashanbhed. Materials and Methods: Diuretic potential of methanolic extract (ME) of three plants were evaluated at two dose levels (500 and 1, 000 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> <b>using</b> normal Wistar rats (Lipschitz method). Furosemide (20 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> was <b>used</b> as a standard drug. The effect on urine output and electrolyte changes were measured for 24 h and compared. All MEs were screened preliminarily for their constituents and their TLC finger printing profiles were prepared. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni′s multiple comparison test. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The MEs of all three plants have shown diuresis in normal rats. However, in intercomparison of the ME C. aromaticus (1, 000 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> produced more significant diuresis (P < 0. 05) and electrolyte excretion compared to other test groups, the effect was at par with furosemide. The ME of these plants showed presence of alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, etc. Conclusion: The ME of C. aromaticus (1, 000 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> has showed highest diuretic action (4. 2) among the tested extracts. This suggests the use of C. aromaticus leaves as "Pashanbhed"; the most effective diuretic drug...|$|R

40|$|Dysregulation of prefrontal {{cortical}} glutamatergic signalling via NMDA receptor hypofunction {{has been}} implicated in cognitive dysfunction and impaired inhibitory control in such neuropsychiatric disorders as schizophrenia, {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and drug addiction. Although NMDA receptors functionally interact with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5), the consequence of this interaction for glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of positive and negative allosteric mGluR 5 modulation on changes in extracellular glutamate efflux in the medial PFC (mPFC) induced by systemic administration of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (or MK 801) in rats. Extracellular glutamate efflux was measured following systemic administration of the positive allosteric mGluR 5 modulator [S-(4 -Fluoro-phenyl) -{ 3 -[3 -(4 -fluoro-phenyl) -[1, 2, 4]-oxadiazol- 5 -yl]-piperidin- 1 -yl}-methanone] (ADX 47273; 100 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> and negative allosteric mGluR 5 modulator [2 -chloro- 4 -{[1 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 2, 5 -dimethyl- 1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl]ethynyl}pyridine] (RO 4917523; 0. 3 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> <b>using</b> a wireless glutamate biosensor in awake, freely-moving rats. The effect of MK 801 (0. 03 - 0. 06 mg/kg, s. c.) on mPFC glutamate efflux was also investigated in addition to the effects of MK 801 (0. 03 mg/kg, s. c.) following ADX 47273 (100 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> pre-treatment. ADX 47273 produced a sustained increase in glutamate efflux and increased the effect of NMDA receptor antagonism on glutamate efflux in the mPFC. By contrast, negative allosteric mGluR 5 modulation with RO 4917523 decreased glutamate efflux in the mPFC. These findings indicate that positive and negative allosteric mGluR 5 modulators produce long lasting and opposing actions on extracellular glutamate efflux in the mPFC. Positive and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR 5 may therefore be viable therapeutic agents to correct abnormalities in glutamatergic signalling present in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|R

Materials and Methods: The antihypercholesterolaemic mechanism of Lipovedic (180 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> was studied {{by measuring the}} serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), Faecal cholesterol (FC) and bile acid excretion in triton induced hyperlipidaemic rats at 0 h, 18 h, 24 h, 40 h, and 48 h and in high cholesterol diet (HCD) induced hypercholesterolaemic rats on day 7, 14, 21 and 28. Hydroxy- 3 -Methyl Glutaryl Co-Enzyme A (HMG CoA) /mevalonate ratio was measured in the liver homogenate for the HMG-CoA reductase activity. Atorvastatin (7. 2 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> was <b>used</b> as reference standard. One-way ANOVA, Post-hock analysis by Tukey′s multiple comparison tests was done using GraphPad Prism 5. Results: Lipovedic (180 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> reduced the serum TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and increased the serum HDL-C in triton treated and HCD fed rats. Lipovedic increased FC excretion. HMG CoA/Mevalonate ratio was significantly higher compared to vehicle control rats {{and the result was}} comparable with Atorvastatin (7. 2 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o).</b> Conclusion: Lipovedic acts as an anti-hypercholesterolaemic drug by: inhibition of HMG CoA reductase, increasing FC excretion and reducing dietary cholesterol absorption, increasing hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor expression and by activation of Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase and Lipoprotein lipase...|$|R

Crinum macowanii {{has been found to}} contain alkaloids that have activity against acetylcholinesterase enzyme in vitro. The present study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo ability of hydroethanolic crude extract of Crinum macowanii to ameliorate memory impairment induced by scopolamine. Thirty-six male Balb/c mice weighing around 25 – 35 g were employed in the present investigation. Y-maze and novel object recognition apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioural models, and scopolamine-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioural model. C. macowanii (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> was administered in single doses to the mice. Donepezil (3 mg/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> was <b>used</b> as a positive control agent.

In this work, we evaluate the antinociceptive effect of P. bleo leaf extracts and isolated compounds in central antinociceptive model. Ethanol extract (E), hexane (H), ethyl acetate (EA), or butanol (B) fractions (30, 50, or 100 [*]mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> sitosterol (from hexane) and vitexin (from ethyl acetate), were administered to mice. Antinociceptive effect was evaluated in the hot plate and capsaicin- or glutamate-induced licking models. Morphine (1 [*]mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> was <b>used</b> as reference drug. Naloxone (1 [*]mg/kg, i. p.), atropine (1 [*]mg/kg, i. p.), and L-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 3 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) were administered 30 [*]min earlier (100 [*]mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> in order to evaluate the mechanism of the antinociceptive action. Higher dose of B developed an effect significantly superior to morphine-treated group. Naloxone prevented the antinociceptive effect of all fractions. L-NAME demonstrated effect against E, EA, and B. In all fractions, sitosterol and vitexin reduced the licking time after capsaicin injection. Glutamate-induced licking response was blocked by H, EA, and B. Our results indicate that Pereskia bleo fractions, sitosterol and vitexin, possessed a central antinociceptive effect. Part of this effect is mediated by opioid receptors and nitrergic pathway...|$|R

40|$|Amaranthus tricolor whole {{plants are}} used by folk {{medicinal}} practitioners of Bangladesh for treatment of pain, anaemia, dysentery, skin diseases, diabetes, and as a blood purifier. Thus far, no scientific studies have evaluated the antihyperglycaemic and antinociceptive effects of the plant. The present study was carried out to evaluate the possible glucose tolerance efficacy of methanolic extracts of A. tricolour whole plants using glucose-induced hyperglycaemic mice, and antinociceptive effects with acetic acid-induced gastric pain models in mice. In antihyperglycaemic activity tests, the extract at different doses was administered one hour prior to glucose administration and blood glucose level was measured after two hours of glucose administration (<b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> <b>using</b> glucose oxidase method. The statistical data indicated the significant oral hypoglycaemic activity on glucose-loaded mice at all doses of the extracts tested. Maximum antihyperglycaemic activity was shown at 400 mg extract per kg body weight, which was {{comparable to that of}} a standard drug, glibenclamide (10 mg/kg body weight). In antinociceptive activity tests, the extract also demonstrated a dose-dependent significant {{reduction in the number of}} writhings induced in mice through intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid. Maximum antinociceptive activity was observed at a dose of 400 mg extract per kg body weight, which compared favourably with that of a standard antinociceptive drug, aspirin, when administered at a dose of 200 mg per kg body weight. The results validate the folk medicinal use of the plant for reduction of blood sugar in diabetic patients as well as the folk medicinal use for alleviation of pain. The results suggest that this plant ma...|$|R
40|$|Doxorubicin (DOX) is an {{anthracycline}} antibiotic {{with broad}} spectrum anti-tumour activity. Its effectiveness {{has been limited}} by the occurrence of dose-related myocardial and bone marrow toxicity. As oxidative stress is the main factor in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, we presumed that agents which enhance endogenous antioxidants can prevent DOX induced cardiotoxicity. Animals received either DOX (3 mg/kg, i. p.) every other day or combination of Ephedra nebrodensis (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> and DOX or Ephedra nebrodensis (200 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> extract alone for 2 weeks. Vitamin E (25 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> was <b>used</b> as a positive standard. Cardiotoxicity was assessed by recording changes in ECG (increased QT interval), measuring the levels of cardiac marker enzymes such as lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and the antioxidant defence enzyme such as reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipid peroxidative value (LPO) {{at the end of}} treatment schedule. Changes in heart rate were also measured in all groups. Treatment with Ephedra nebrodensis (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased the levels of LPO and cardiac marker enzymes, increased the levels of other antioxidant defence enzymes, GSH and SOD, reversed the changes in ECG and prevented the decrease in heart weight in DOX-treated group. The results suggest that Ephedra nebrodensis has the potential in preventing the cardiotoxic effects induced by Doxorubicin...|$|R
