40|$|This high-fidelity driving {{simulator}} study used a paired comparison design {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of 12 potential eco-driving interfaces. Previous work has demonstrated fuel economy improvements through the provision of in-vehicle eco-driving guidance using a visual or haptic interface. This study uses an eco-driving assistance system that advises {{the driver of the}} most fuel efficient accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>angle,</b> in real time. Assistance was provided to drivers through a visual dashboard display, a multimodal visual dashboard and auditory tone combination, or a haptic accelerator pedal. The style of advice delivery was varied within each modality. The effectiveness of the eco-driving guidance was assessed via subjective feedback, and objectively through the <b>pedal</b> <b>angle</b> error between system-requested and participant-selected accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>angle.</b> Comparisons amongst the six haptic systems suggest that drivers are guided best by a force feedback system, where a driver experiences a step change in force applied against their foot when they accelerate inefficiently. Subjective impressions also identified this system as more effective than a stiffness feedback system involving a more gradual change in pedal feedback. For interfaces with a visual component, drivers produced smaller pedal errors with an in-vehicle visual display containing second order information on the required rate of change of <b>pedal</b> <b>angle,</b> in addition to current fuel economy information. This was supported by subjective feedback. The presence of complementary audio alerts improved eco-driving performance and reduced visual distraction from the roadway. The results of this study can inform the further development of an in-vehicle assistance system that supports ‘green’ driving...|$|E

The dynamic model of shift process is built up, the dynamic characteristics of each phase of downshift process are analyzed, and linear quadratic optimal control is used to optimize the shift process. As a result, the optimal trajectories of the motor torque and oil pressure of the combined clutch are obtained. Compared to the clutch control only, the simulation results indicate that shift quality is improved remarkably by employing the proposed coordinated control. Specifically, the shift jerk and sliding friction work are decreased by 43 % and 44 %, respectively, with accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>angle</b> 50 %.

50|$|The stator {{element of}} the torque {{converter}} has two blade positions, controlled by the driver via the accelerator pedal to offer a 'passing gear' and extra response at any speed from heavy throttle application. In normal driving the stator blades are arranged at 'cruise' angle which offers improved efficiency and response at light throttle. Flooring the accelerator <b>pedal</b> changes the <b>angle</b> of the stator vanes hydraulically to 'performance angle' which permits the converter to achieve stall about 1000 rpm higher than in 'cruise' as well as redirecting oil to strike the next-lowest drive turbine which effectively lowers the drive ratio of the transmission and allows engine speed to flare to a speed where output is greatest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Controlling {{rotary wing}} platforms, {{especially}} on helicopters, {{is a difficult}} task because of the nonlinearity of the structure and strong coupled motion dynamics. In this paper, a linear, quadratic regulator method is used to control the trajectory and mission paths of the autonomous helicopter. Nonlinear motion dynamics is linearized at certain operating points and linear model is obtained by Taylor’s series expansion. This model is integrated into MATLAB ® program. By using LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) methodology, the attitude of 1 the autonomous Puma helicopter is controlled and two simulations are realized. The results show that this approach can effectively be applied to control rotary wing platforms on helicopters. Cyclic controller enables pilots to change the angle of attack so longitudinal and lateral motion can be performed. By tail <b>pedals</b> the <b>angle</b> of attack of the tail rotor is changed so yaw motion is performed. Any small mistake can cause collapse of the platform.

40|$|Quantitative {{prediction}} {{and understanding}} of driver speed control is important to prevent speeding behavior and design vehicle systems. Speed control is a complex behavior of driver longitudinal vehicle control, involving speed perception, decision making (setting a target speed), motor control (foot movement for pedal control), and vehicle mechanics. However, few of existing models is able to cover all of these important aspects together. To address this problem, the current work built a new mathematical driver speed control model with analytical solutions based on rigorous understanding of human cognitive mechanisms in driving, integrated Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP, which already modeled driver lateral control) structure and Rule-Based Decision Field Theory (RDFT), and offered a relatively complete picture of driver speed control in free-flow driving settings.

The conference proceedings are available from: [URL] the importance of vehicle brake systems, it is surprising how {{little is known about the}} way that people operate them. Previous ergonomic studies have attempted to define the maximum acceptable resistance to depression in the pedal (Diffrient, Tilley, & Harman, 1993; Eaton & Dittmeier, 1970). Accordingly, they focussed on the responses of weak (5 percentile muscle strength) female drivers and little is known about the full range of braking response. A re-examination of this basic control mechanism is necessitated by the evolution of vehicle systems. The present paper offers an overview of a study measuring driver “pedipulation” in a naturalistic environment. Fifty-eight fully-licensed drivers drove a car for a day. The types of trip analysed included commuting to work, shopping, and picking up children from school.

This system {{consists of the}} visualization of pedaling effectiveness and pedaling force vectors. Pedaling effectiveness {{is defined as the}} ratio of the tangential to total force applied to the pedals. New biaxial load cells were also developed to attach to the bottom of cycling shoes in place of plastic cleats. These load cells can be connected to the bicycle pedals to measure the magnitude and direction of pedaling forces of both pedals, respectively. The size of load cells is comparable with detachable plastic cleats (Shimano Corp). Therefore, cyclists were permitted to use their own bicycles for performance tests. For visualization of pedaling effectiveness, each force measured by the load cell was converted to coordinates respective to the tangential and radial directions of each crank. The crank angle was calculated from the signal of a magnetic transducer. The <b>pedal</b> <b>angle</b> was calculated using a link mechanism with the lower limbs: the length of the lower limbs, the length of the crank and the position of the greater trochanter were used as constant parameters for computational calculations. For visualization, the relationship between crank angle and force vectors was plotted on a computer, just after the performance tests. This information would be provided for coaches and cyclists in order to identify improvement points for pedaling technique...|$|E

Seven competitive cyclists performed an incremental test to exhaustion on a stationary cycle ergometer equipped with an SRM® torque analysis system and a strain gauge instrumented pedals system (SGI pedals). The SRM® torque analysis system measured net torque while the SGI pedals measured the normal and anterior-posterior force applied on the pedal surface. Forces on the pedal surface were resolved into forces on the cranks (tangential and radial). Crank torque {{was measured by the}} pedals using the tangential force on the cranks and crank length. Power output was calculated from crank torque and angular velocity of the crank (calculated from pedalling cadence). All data were acquired between the 20 th and the 40 th seconds of each stage of the incremental test. Magnitudes of differences between outputs from the SGI pedals and the SRM® torque analysis system were assessed by effect sizes. Power output was higher for the SRM® torque analysis system than the SGI pedals. Peak torques were lower for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI <b>pedals.</b> The <b>angle</b> of the right and left peak torque increased for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals.

40|$|AbstractTo {{optimize}} training {{relating to}} the coordinative skills of athletes, a special cycle ergometer ARES with decoupled cranks was developed. The system {{is equipped with a}} measurement system to measure radial and tangential forces on the pedals, additionally to the acquisition of angle velocities of the two crank wheels. Due to the decoupled cranks, every leg performs its own revolution, and has to be active even at the pulling phase, without direct support of the opposite legs downstroke. To explore the unique possibilities of ARES, 4 subjects were tested on the ergometer in a first trial. After a short acclimatization phase to get familiar with the characteristics of the bike, the following tests were performed: (1) normal biking at different numbers of revolution with the challenge to keep a 180 ° phase angle, and (2) special coordination tasks: a) biking with 0 ° phase angle, b) Stop-and-go procedures with re-synchronization of the movement, c) counter-movement with both legs moving into opposite direction, and d) a lower half circle swing. During the exercises, forces on the pedals, the crank positions and current cadence were acquired. Out of this data, torque, power, angle velocities and an efficiency parameter were determined for the left and right leg. Variations in cadence, forces and torque as a function of <b>pedal</b> <b>angle</b> are clearly visible. A dependency on number of revolutions seems to be evident, caused by the higher coordinative challenge at high velocities...|$|E

We determined whether muscle recruitment timing could {{be inferred from}} MRI-measured transverse relaxation time constant (T 2) changes and a cycle ergometer modified to vary power {{as a function of}} <b>pedal</b> <b>angle.</b> Six subjects performed 6 min of single-leg cycling under two conditions (E 0 °- 230 ° and E 90 °- 230 °), which increased the power from 0 °- 230 ° and 90 – 230 ° of the pedal cycle, respectively. The difference condition produced a virtual power output from 0 – 180 ° (V 0 °- 180 °). Recruitment was assessed by integrating EMG over the pedal cycle (IEMG) and as the (post-pre) exercise T 2 change (ΔT 2). For E 0 °- 230 °, the mean IEMG for vastus medialis and lateralis (VM/VL; 49. 3 ± 3. 9 mV·s; mean ± SE) was greater (P 0. 05); the corresponding ΔT 2 values were 0. 9 ± 0. 9 and 1. 5 ± 0. 9 ms (P > 0. 05). MRI data indicated activation of the semitendinosus and BF/short head for E 0 °- 230 ° and E 90 °- 230 °. For V 0 °- 180 °, ΔT 2 was 7. 2 ± 0. 9 ms for VM/VL and − 0. 6 ± 0. 6 ms for BFL; IEMG was 31. 5 ± 3. 7 mV·s for VM/VL and 10. 6 ± 7. 0 mV·s for BFL.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the design of a control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic to minimize automobile fuel consumption and exhaust emissions while maximizing battery state of charge (SOC) for hybrid vehicles. The advantages the hybrid vehicle has over the conventional vehicle are very low emission of pollutants, and more efficient fuel consumption if controlled properly. The principal components of the drive train are an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Since there are two devices, it becomes impossible for the driver to individually control both components while driving along, and {{it will be necessary to}} automate the use of these elements so that the vehicle is driven in the same way as a conventional vehicle. In the parallel configuration, both devices apply torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the hybrid vehicle is modeled, and throttle angle, motor current and brake torque command are chosen as the control inputs. Another input considered is the driver behavior. This input is obtained from an Artificial Neural Network that classifies the behavior based on the <b>pedal</b> <b>angle</b> characteristics over a period of time. The problem in question is how to distribute the energy demands for each component of the hybrid vehicle so that the objectives, maximizing the battery SOC and minimizing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, are met. Because these objectives depend on different components, we must decide how to demand energy from them to fulfill the driver request and at the same time meeting the objectives. A Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed to meet the driver demand so that the engine, motor and battery are as little exposed as possible to abrupt transitions. Smooth transitions are desired in the engine in order to decrease fuel consumption and emission of pollutants. Smooth transitions in the battery will lead to extended battery life. Simulation results verify that the controller achieves the design objectives. Because the design procedure is based on trial and error, optimality is not guaranteed. Also stability is hard to prove, since there is not much information on this particular issue of Fuzzy Logic...|$|E

40|$|Professional {{truck drivers}} are highly exposed to fatigue and work related injuries. Truck drivers are common victims of {{musculoskeletal}} disorders, frequently suffering from pain symptoms {{particularly in the}} neck, shoulder and lower back. This situation {{is believed to be}} a contributor to the high absenteeism in this job category. A high percentage of this problem is due to the adoption of an unhealthy driving posture resulting from inappropriate seat design. This incorrect and poor design is owing to the insufficient and obsolete anthropometrical data which has been used for decades for arranging and positioning components in the driver environment. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to create and construct a mathematical model which clarifies and predicts the drivers’ comfortable sitting posture and position. It was hypothesized that the length and height characteristics of some body segments as well as the body weight and waist circumference of the driver have a great impact on the selection of a specific sitting posture. The steering wheel positions as well as the pedal/floor locations were hypothesized to be highly correlated to the driver’s selected posture and the corresponding comfort. The effect of the seat position on posture selection and related comfort assessments constituted the other hypothesis of the study which received extra attention. A laboratory experiment on a Scania truck cab mock-up was conducted. The seat track travel along a vertical as well as horizontal forward-backward path was obtained by mounting the seat on the motorized rigid frame which allowed unrestricted vertical and fore-aft travel. The seat cushion angle and backrest angle were adjusted by pivoting the entire seat and backrest around a lateral axis and independently. The pedal components were mounted on a motorized platform, thus allowing unrestricted fore-aft and height travel without any changes in the <b>pedal</b> <b>angles.</b> The steering wheel was mounted on the instrument panel by two independent pneumatic axes which allowed a wide range of adjustments including tilting and moving along the sagittal plane for adjusting the height and distance. The test plan called for 55 international highly experienced heavy truck drivers. The drivers were recruited to span a large range of body weight and stature, in particular to ensure adequate representation of both the extreme as well as the normal group of drivers. The drivers filled in a general information questionnaire before undergoing the anthropometrical measurements and thereafter the test trials. The experiment contained a subset of test conditions with five different trials using random selection sampling procedure. Drivers were asked to adjust the components in a wide range of trajectory according to a written protocol. A sparse set of threedimensional body landmark locations and the corresponding comfort assessments were recorded. As the main part of the result, the mathematical models using multiple regression analyses on selected body landmarks as well as anthropometrical measures were developed which proposed a linear correlation between parameters. The differences between the observed data and the corresponding predicted data using the model were found to be minimal and almost dispensable. Additionally, the drivers preferred to sit in the rearmost position and at a rather high level relative to the rest of the available and adjustable area. Considering the normal adjustable seat area of the cab, only a very small part of the observed Hpoint data lies within this area while a large remaining amount of data lies outside of it. Moreover, the difference between the observation (plotted H-point data) and the neutral H-point was found to be significant. Furthermore, and since some of the data lies almost on the border of the adjustable area, it may indicate a reasonable tendency for even more seat adjustment in the backward direction. A conceptual model consisting of four different parameters was developed and presented in the end. These parameters of the model suggest being as key factors which play a central role on process of decision making regarding the selection of a desirable sitting posture. Any eventual modifications and adjustments for elimination or minimizing discrepancies, biases or obscured factors affecting the quality of the mathematical model would be a case for future study. The investigation of a complete assessment of comfort should be supplemented with an analysis of how many truck drivers are satisfied with the comfort in the end. QC 2010082...|$|R

METHOD: We assessed the reliability of pedal force measures during two incremental cycling tests to exhaustion separated by two to seven days. The number of competitive cyclists completing each workload increment varied (n= 10 for 100 W to 250 W; n= 8 for 300 W; n= 6 for 350 W).

Experimental fighter aircraft such as the NASA High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) {{have the capability to}} maneuver at very high angles of attack where nonlinear aerodynamics often predominate. HARV is an experimental F/A- 18, configured with thrust vectoring and conformal actuated nose strakes. Identifying closed-loop models for this type of aircraft can be made difficult by nonlinearities and high-order characteristics of the system. In this paper only lateral-directional axes are considered since the lateral-directional control law was specifically designed to produce classical airplane responses normally expected with low-order, rigid-body systems. Evaluation of the control design methodology was made using loworder equivalent systems determined from flight and simulation. This allowed comparison of the closed-loop rigid-body dynamics achieved in flight with that designed in simulation. In flight, the On Board Excitation System was used to apply optimal inputs to lateral stick and <b>pedals</b> at five <b>angles</b> of attack: 5, 20, 30, 45, and 60 degrees.

40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation leg cycle ergometry (FES-LCE) {{is an effective}} treatment in the maintenance of bone and muscle health in spinal cord injured (SCI) people. However, the 2 ̆ 2 one-size-fits-all 2 ̆ 2 stimulation paradigm currently used {{does not account for}} the level, degree and complexity of SCI that varies from person to person and may actually promote the onset of premature fatigue. Refining the presently used paradigm, or developing a new one, could prevent premature fatigue and possibly extending a rider 2 ̆ 7 s cycling time. Purpose. to investigate leg joint biomechanics during progressive resistance and submaximal FES-LCE cycling protocols in order to identify parameters indicative of muscle fatigue. Specific aims were (a) develop an index which quantifies and predicts fatigue as a function of knee power output during progressive resistance cycling, and (b) identify mechanical and physiological parameters that can be utilized for determining the comparative effectiveness of progressive resistance and submaximal cycling protocols. Methodology. Six spinal cord injured subjects participated in the study. A motion capture software system was used to measure the displacement of the crank tip, hip, knee, and ankle joints during cycling. A piezo-electric force transducer, mounted underneath the right ergometer pedal, recorded pedal forces. Free body diagrams were constructed to calculate the forces and torques produced at the ankle, knee, and hip joints, respectively. <b>Pedal</b> force, crank <b>angle,</b> segment mass, joint kinematics and anthropometric data were used to calculate resultant joint forces and joint moments. Results. An index of fatigue was successfully developed, comparing knee power capacity during cycling with a predetermined value of fatigue during progressive resistance cycling. Also, subjects displayed a more favorable cycling performance during the submaximal cycling protocol than during progressive resistance cycling. Conclusions. A rapid increase in stimulation intensity and subsequent decrease in cadence and power output observed during progressive cycling suggest that the one-size-fits-all stimulation protocol may be one root cause of premature fatigue. Likewise, the use of a progressive resistance cycling therapy further contributes to fatigue onset. While submaximal cycling was more effective for SCI riders, a hybrid protocol incorporating both strength and endurance training may be the most successful. ...|$|R
