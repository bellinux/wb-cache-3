5|$|The {{increasing}} {{taxes and}} the new burdens stirred up the commoners. The Transylvanian Saxons could only overcome their rebellious serfs {{with the assistance of}} the vice-voivode, Roland Lépes, in 1417. The united armies of the counties and the Saxon seats crushed the Székely commoners' uprising in 1433. In early 1434, the burghers of Kronstadt had to seek the assistance of the count of the Székelys against the Vlachs who had risen up in Fogaras County. Hussite ideas, especially their egalitarian Taborite version, began to spread among the peasantry in the 1430s. In May 1436, George Lépes urged the inquisitor James of the Marches to come to Transylvania, because Hussite preachers had converted many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> faith in his diocese.|$|E
5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E

25|$|The First Atlantic {{system was}} {{the trade of}} enslaved Africans to, primarily, South American colonies of the Portuguese and Spanish empires; it {{accounted}} for slightly more than 3% of all Atlantic slave trade. It started (on a significant scale) in about 1502 and lasted until 1580 when Portugal was temporarily united with Spain. While the Portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples, the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants (mostly from other countries) the license to trade enslaved <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> colonies. During the first Atlantic system, most of these traders were Portuguese, giving them a near-monopoly during the era. Some Dutch, English, and French traders also participated in the slave trade. After the union, Portugal came under Spanish legislation that prohibited it from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier. It became a target for the traditional enemies of Spain, losing {{a large share of}} the trade to the Dutch, English, and French.|$|E

25|$|Migration to Oman has {{increased}} rapidly since 2000 due to economic growth, which further {{has resulted in}} development of infrastructure. After the economic crisis in 2008 the numbers of migrants continued to increase, consequently diverging from the general trend in other GCC countries where the numbers of migrants were decreasing. In 1993, the population constituted 2.017.643 people, of which 26,5% were foreign residents. In 2015, 44,2% (1.849.412 people) of the total Omani population (4.187.516 people) were non-Omanis. This constituted an upsurge of migrants since the second Omani census in 2003, when foreign residents were estimated to account for about 24% of the total populace. In 2013, the majority of migrant workers came from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (87%). 82% of all migrant workers were employed in the private sector. However, in 2013 the Shura Council of Oman established that the inflow of migrant workers should not surpass 33% of the total populace. Further, the Omani leadership carried out extensive deportations of undocumented migrants in 2010, resulting in the return of approximately 70.000 <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> respective countries of origin. At {{the time of the}} deportations, Omani authorities estimated that there were approximately 200.000 undocumented migrants in the country.|$|E
25|$|American {{occupation}} {{troops in}} Nuristan would find themselves directly {{in opposition to}} the HIG forces prepared by the CIA to resist the Soviets. Colonel Pat Donahue, the former commander of the 3rd BCT, had believed that Nuristani population was essentially neutral, hostile to any outside groups, and so isolated that resources allocated to the region would be wasted. These resources were limited by the fact that only 5,000 American troops were available to occupy a rugged area the size of Virginia that had very {{little in the way of}} Infrastructure. A new Counter-insurgency strategy seemed to offer a way around these problems. Known as COIN and refined by General Petraeus, Commander of US forces in Afghanistan, the Army and Marine Counter-insurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 would convert the population of Nuristan to American goals in the region. Unlike Donahue, Nicholson was a supporter of COIN in addition to seeing Kamdesh as a decisive control point in the region. The basic approach to victory by the PRT would involve three steps: 1. Separate the enemy from the people. 2. Link the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> government. 3. Transform Afghanistan by economic development and the creation of a national infrastructure. Nicholson hoped the PRT would seed a process that would be developed by the local Nuristanis rather than completely imposed from the outside. Lieutenant Keating, first commander of the Kamdesh PRT, was determined to make COIN a success in the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} King Æthelred the Unready {{witnessed}} {{the resumption of}} Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s, but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> knees in 1009–12, when {{a large part of}} the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall. It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013–14, and (after Æthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015–16. The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right, and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Æthelred's reign. It is this evidence which is the basis for Simon Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew. It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Æthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.|$|E

500|$|In 2004 Josephson criticized an {{experiment}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina {{that she could}} see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E
500|$|On January 29, 1891, in the {{presence}} of the cabinet ministers and the supreme court justices, Liliʻuokalani took the oath of office to uphold the constitution, and became the first and only queen of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The first few weeks of her reign were obscured by the funeral of her brother. After the end of the period of mourning, one of her first acts was to request the formal resignation of the holdover cabinet from her brother's reign. These ministers refused, and asked for a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court. The justices (except for one dissenting opinion) ruled in favor of the Queen's decision, and the ministers resigned. Liliʻuokalani appointed Samuel Parker, Hermann A. Widemann, and William A. Whiting, and reappointed Charles N. Spencer (from the hold-over cabinet) as her new cabinet ministers. On March 9, with the approval of the House of Nobles, as required by the Hawaiian constitution, she named her niece Kaʻiulani, the only daughter of Archibald Scott Cleghorn and her sister Princess Likelike who died in 1887, as her successor. From April to July, Liliʻuokalani paid the customary visits to the main Hawaiian Islands including a revisit to the leper settlement of Kalaupapa. Historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall noted, [...] "Everywhere she was accorded the homage traditionally paid by the Hawaiian <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> alii." ...|$|E

[...] He had been invited to join them on 4 November. [...] The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies, something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create [...] "a great uproar" [...] in the country, and later arrived at Huddington Court, where they met Thomas. [...] Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. [...] They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for [...] "God and country", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". [...] Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. [...] Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. [...] He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. [...] Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was [...] "as much as his life was worth". [...] While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. [...] Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. [...] While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.|$|E
