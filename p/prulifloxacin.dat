40|$|International audiencePrulifloxacin is a {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotic {{that has}} been approved in several European countries {{for the treatment of}} lower urinary tract infections and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In this review, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for potential uses of <b>prulifloxacin</b> beyond respiratory and urinary tract infections. Nine individual articles (eight randomised controlled trials and one cohort study) were regarded as eligible for inclusion in the review. Three of the studies were double-blinded, whilst six were open-label trials. Three studies referred to the treatment of patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP), one to prophylaxis of patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy, one to prophylaxis of women undergoing surgical abortion, two to patients with traveller's diarrhoea, one to diabetic patients with soft tissue infections or osteomyelitis, and one to improving tolerance of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations in patients with bladder cancer. Regarding CBP, <b>prulifloxacin</b> was non-inferior to its comparators, with a trend towards better microbiological outcomes at follow-up. Regarding traveller's diarrhoea, <b>prulifloxacin</b> resulted in better clinical and microbiological outcomes compared with placebo.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} aimed {{to compare the}} in vitro antimicrobial activity of <b>prulifloxacin</b> to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently urinary pathogens. From our large bacterial collection, 978 non-duplicated clinical isolates, derived from patients urinary infections, maintained with minimal sub-culture deep frozen at - 70 degrees C in a matrix of Brain Heart Infusion broth + 20 % glycerol were tested to determine MICs of <b>prulifloxacin,</b> levolfoxacin and ciprofloxacin by means of broth microdilution technique. For Gram negartive bacteria, no significant diffrences was observed between all three antibiotics. Enterobacteria showed a resistance rate ranging between 6 % (Enterobacter spp) and approximately 20 % (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance of Pseudomas spp was higher (30. 3 %). For Gram positive, all methicillin-susceptible Stalphylococcus aureus strains were sensitive whereas 30 % of methicillin-resistant and enterococci were resistant to all three antibiotics. Purification exerts its antibacterial activity at lower concentrations than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin.

40|$|Minimum {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MICs) and mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) of <b>prulifloxacin</b> against 30 {{strains of}} Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections {{as well as}} the 'biological cost' related to acquisition of resistance to the same drug in 10 uropathogenic E. coli were assessed. In terms of MIC(90), <b>prulifloxacin</b> was more potent than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. <b>Prulifloxacin</b> produced lower or equal MPC values than the other two fluoroquinolones (93. 3 % and 73. 3 % compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively). Compared with susceptible strains, prulifloxacin-resistant mutants showed a reduced rate of growth (ranging from 20. 0 % to 98. 0 % in different culture media and incubation conditions) and a decreased fitness index (ranging from 0. 959 to 0. 999). They were also impaired in their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and urinary catheters (11. 7 - 66. 4 % and 16. 3 - 78. 3 % reduction, respectively) and showed a lower surface hydrophobicity (51. 2 - 76. 0 %). They were more susceptible to ultraviolet irradiation (30. 6 - 93. 8 % excess mortality), showed increased resistance to colicins and diminished transfer of plasmids (< 1 - 8. 5 x 10 (- 8) vs. 3. 3 x 10 (- 7) - 2. 4 x 10 (- 4)).

40|$|Abstract Background Fluoroquinolones are potent {{antimicrobial}} agents {{used for the}} treatment {{of a wide variety of}} community- and nosocomial- infections. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones in Enterobacteriaceae is increasingly reported. Studies assessing the ability of fluoroquinolones to select for resistance have often used antimicrobial concentrations quite different from those actually acquired at the site of infection. The present study compared the ability to select for resistance of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and <b>prulifloxacin</b> at concentrations observed in vivo in twenty strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. isolated from patients with respiratory and urinary infections. The frequencies of spontaneous single-step mutations at plasma peak and trough antibiotic concentrations were calculated. Multi-step selection of resistance was evaluated by performing 10 serial cultures on agar plates containing a linear gradient from trough to peak antimicrobial concentrations, followed by 10 subcultures on antibiotic-free agar. E. coli resistant strains selected after multi-step selection were characterized for DNA mutations by sequencing gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Results Frequencies of mutations for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were less than 10 - 11 at peak concentration, while for <b>prulifloxacin</b> they ranged from - 11 to 10 - 5. The lowest number of resistant mutants after multistep selection was selected by levofloxacin followed by ciprofloxacin and <b>prulifloxacin.</b> Both ciprofloxacin- and prulifloxacin-resistant mutants presented mutations in gyrA and parC, while levofloxacin resistance was found associated only to mutations in gyrA.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{prostatitis}} {{displays a}} variety of symptoms (mainly local pain exhibiting variability in origin and intensity). The {{purpose of this article}} is to briefly present the preliminary results of our study examining the role of phytotherapeutic agents in the treatment of chronic prostatitis patients. Materials and methods: The study included in total fifty-six consecutive patients who visited the outpatient department. Subjects were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the first group (28 patients) received <b>prulifloxacin</b> 600 mg for 15 days, while subjects in the second group (28 patients) received <b>prulifloxacin</b> 600 mg for 15 days and Serenoa repens extract for 8 weeks. The response was tested using laboratory and clinical criteria. Results: We found statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding pain regression and no statistically significant regarding bacterial eradication. Moreover however while sexual dysfunction improvement was equally achieved in both groups, improvement of urinary symptoms was more evident in the 2 nd group especially after the completion of the antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: Serenoa repens extract for 8 weeks seems to improve prostatitis related pain. Further randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to substantiate safer conclusions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{concentration}} of ulifloxacin, the active metabolite of <b>prulifloxacin,</b> in sinuses mucosa and plasma of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, requiring sinus elective endoscopic surgery. Thirty-nine patients (30 males, 9 females; age range 22 - 77 years) with chronic sinusitis were enrolled, 35 were treated with the investigational medication. Samples from four untreated patients were used to validate the analytical method, while four treated patients dropped out before surgery. One 600 mg <b>prulifloxacin</b> tablet once daily was administered for 5 days before surgery. The last dosing was scheduled from 2 to 12 hours from tissue and plasma sampling. In each patient, two samples of paranasal sinus mucosa (from ethmoid and turbinate, respectively) and one blood sample were collected. Concentrations of ulifloxacin in plasma and sinuses mucosa were measured using validated bioanalytical LC/MS/MS methods. Individual and mean ulifloxacin concentrations in tissues were always higher than the relevant plasma levels. The highest concentrations were observed between 2 · 5 and 4 · 5 hours after the last dosing in all districts. The mean tissue/plasma ratios were 2 · 5 and 3 · 0 for ethmoid and turbinate, respectively. Data expressed as Area Under the Curves (AUC±SD) showed that ulifloxacin concentrations in the ethmoid were slightly higher (18 · 68 ± 6 · 48 μg/g*h) than in turbinate (15 · 00 ± 2 · 89 μg/g*h), and definitely higher than in plasma (6 · 32 ± 1 · 14 μg/ml*h). The AUC ratios between tissues and plasma were 3 · 0 for ethmoides and 2 · 4 for turbinates. One patient reported two treatment-related episodes of diarrhea, which spontaneously resolved after the drug suspension.
