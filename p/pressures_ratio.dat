The refrigerants with zero Ozone depletion potential only are selected in this study. The performance of selected refrigerants viz, R 22, R 134 a, R 404 A, R 407 C, R 410 A, R 507 A, R 290 and R 600 a is considered in the present analysis. The thermodynamic analysis of these refrigerants {{has been carried out}} on these selected refrigerants using COOLPACK software. The analysis mainly focuses on obtaining results of parameters with fixed condenser temperature but with variable evaporator temperatures. The parameters like heat rejection rate, mass flow rate of refrigerant, displacement volume, power input, discharge temperature, cop, saturation pressure and <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> are analyzed.

40|$|Estimation of the {{relationship}} between carbon isotope discrimination (Δ 13 C) in perennial fodder plants and various factors such as climate, fertilization and soil could contribute to a better selection and/or improvement of genotype of fodder species. Theoretical models of carbon isotope discrimination in plants indicate a linear relationship between Δ 13 C and CO 2 partial <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> (pi/pa) from the intercellular spaces (pi) of CO 2 in leaves and from the atmosphere (pa). It is also known that between pi parameter and water-use efficiency (WUE) there is a negative correlation. Eight perennial fodder legume and grass mixtures were cultivated on three levels of fertilization in order to assess mixtures for pastures that can provide sustainable quantitative and qualitative yields. The species, which composed the mixtures, were also cultivated as pure crops on the same fertilization conditions. The results of this study indicated that in five of the six species, which composed the mixture with the highest yield, pi/pa values decreased while fertilization doses increased, most likely as a result of variation in water-use efficiency. <br /...|$|E

For that, the characterization of the actual pumping speed of the NEG coating is a key issue. It is carried out {{by means of the}} dynamic sorption method according to ASTM F 798 - 82 standard, conducted “offline ” on a sample (coupon), suitably positioned inside the chamber to be coated and recovered after the process. To evaluate in-situ the sorption characteristics of getter coated chambers, a different measurement technique (Trasmission Factor Method) is here described. It is based on the measurement of <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> at the inlet and the outlet of a coated pipe, under a flow of test gas. A calibration curve permits to evaluate sticking probability of the coated surface from the pressure ratio. The use of reference samples to calibrate the method is quite difficult. A better approach is a modellistic one, finding the dependency of pressure ratio on the average sticking probability, the pipe length, the section geometry and dimensions. Preliminary experimental results will be shown...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSemi-closed oxyfuel-combustion {{combined}} cycle plants are one possibility to realise CCS technologies with natural gas-fired power plants. Due to the recirculation of exhaust gas the working fluid {{in the gas}} turbine consists mainly of CO 2. This leads to the necessity for an increased <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> to achieve the efficiency and the exhaust gas temperatures of conventional gas turbines. In this work a conventional natural gas-fired {{combined cycle}} plant with a reheat gas turbine modified for oxyfuel operation will be presented. As {{it is assumed that}} the necessary <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is not realisable with axial compressors two different scenarios are considered. On the one hand the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is the same as in the conventional process {{and on the other hand}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is set to an assumed maximum of 60. The exhaust gas temperature lies significantly above the values of the conventional plant. Generally the higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> results in a higher net efficiency of the plant. An unchanged heat recovery process results in a loss of efficiency of at least 9. 3 to 10. 8 %-pts. depending on the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio.</b> Increasing the steam parameters can achieve a reduction of this loss ranging from 0. 5 %-pts for the high <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> to 1. 0 %-pts for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio.</b> An alternative approach for the heat recovery is the application of an internal recuperator in the gas turbine. When the achievable <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is far from the optimum value, as in the low <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> case, this approach can lead to significantly lower losses of 9. 1 %-pts. With a higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> the effects of the optimisation options are similar...|$|R
40|$|Early after acute {{myocardial}} infarction, {{the relation}} between plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and extent of myocardial scar formation and diastolic dysfunction remains unclear. In 32 consecutive patients early (5 +/- 3 days) after a first acute myocardial infarction, delayed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to define myocardial scar. Diastolic function was assessed using phase-contrast MR measurements of mitral flow and septal tissue velocities (tissue MR imaging) to estimate left ventricular (LV) filling pressures. MR study was immediately followed by BNP measurement. BNP related to LV ejection fraction (r = - 0. 52, p = 0. 002), extent of myocardial scar (percent delayed hyperenhancement of LV mass, r = 0. 49, p = 0. 005; transmural index, r = 0. 58, p < 0. 001), and estimated LV filling <b>pressures</b> (<b>ratio</b> of early diastolic mitral flow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity, r = 0. 51, p = 0. 003). In multivariate analysis, transmural index and early diastolic mitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity were independent predictors of BNP levels (p < 0. 05, power of 0. 99 at alpha = 0. 05). In conclusion, among patients with recent myocardial infarction, high BNP levels are independently associated with extent of myocardial scar tissue and estimated LV filling pressure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{patients}} with tetralogy of Fallot, infants less than 12 months old and children {{between one and}} four years old were compared after total repair surgery for determination of outcome of surgery, risk factors influencing mortality and morbidity. Methods: Fifty- two {{patients with}} tetralogy of Fallot between five months and four years of ages were included into the study. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups depending on their ages; Group 1; one year old and younger (n= 21) whereas, group 2; one and four years old (n= 31). Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square or where appropriate Fisher’s exact tests and logistic regression analysis was applied for determination of predictors of mortality. Results: The parameters that were different between two groups include; age (Group 1; 10. 00 ± 1. 67 months and Group 2; 2. 39 ± 0. 77 years, p< 0. 001), weight (Group 1; 9. 74 ± 2. 23 kg, Group 2; 11. 97 ± 1. 78 kg, p< 0. 001), McGoon ratio (Group 1; 1. 94 ± 0. 29, Group 2; 2. 19 ± 0. 27, p= 0. 001). Mortality is found in 3 patients in group 1 (14. 2 %) whereas, in five patients in group 2 (16 %) and the difference was not statistically significant. In group 2 in only one patient (0. 03 %) had complete atrioventricular block and required permanent pacemaker implantation. When patients were compared according to groups with and without mortality, the significant differences were found in following variables: peritoneal dialysis (p= 0. 001), pleural effusion (p= 0. 02), right ventricular pressure (p= 0. 001) and right ventricle/aorta <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> (p= 0. 001). However, none of these risk factors had significant value in prediction of mortality. Conclusion: Depending on these results, in patients under one year of age with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot, if there are no other pathologies that have potential to increase risk of mortality, the complete repair surgery can be performed with same amount of risks and similar morbidity and mortality ratios...|$|E

Although enzyme replacement therapy decreases glycosphingolipids storage in tissues, we have described a continuous vascular hypertrophy whereas the aortic stiffness was paradoxically decreasing under long-term enzyme therapy. Preliminary results reported that Fabry's aorta diameters under treatment were more dilated in comparison to control group. The objective {{of this study is}} to determined parallelism between presumed aorta dilatation, aortic stiffness and arterial remodeling in treated Fabry patients. Methods 41 treated patients were enrolled (38 ± 12 yrs) with arterial measurements of a) radial and carotid intima-media thickness, diameter, local pulse pressure and distensibility obtained with echotracking device; b) aortic stiffness obtained through carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity with tonometry and c) aorta diameters (sinus, ascending and descending tubule, arch aortic) assessed by magnetic resonance imaging examinations. ResultsPulse wave velocity was positively correlated with ascending and descending aorta tubules diameters in univariate analysis (respectively R 2 = 0. 13, P< 0. 05; R 2 = 0. 11, P< 0. 05) and after adjustment on body surface area, pulse <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> and hypertension (respectively P< 0. 05 and P= 0. 01).

40|$|IntroductionPercutaneous {{pulmonary}} valve insertion {{has been}} recently introduced in clinical setting. Patient selection is widely accepted. These candidates are however heterogeneous, in regard of heart defects, {{and type of}} surgical right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction. It is presently unclear in the literature if type of surgical reconstruction matters {{for the success of}} the pulmonary valve insertion. Our goal was to compare the hemodynamic results of percutaneous pulmonary valve in patients with homografts, prosthetic conduit or RVOT reconstructed with patch. Patients and methodsWe reviewed patients included over the last 6 months in the prospective study (REVALV) for patients undergoing RVOT intervention for severe stenosis and/or insufficiency. Only valved stent group is analyzed here. All patients undergoing valved stent implantation are previously pre-stented with a bare metal stent according to present recommendations. Thirty-seven patients were included, distributed in three groups according to type of RVOT reconstruction (homograft REVALV is a multicentric prospective study for patients undergoing RVOT intervention for severe stenosis and/or insufficiency. Patients are distributed in three groups according to type of RVOT reconstruction (homograft, n = 10; prosthetic conduit, n = 20; RVOT enlargement by patch, n = 7). ResultsOverall, all groups were similar in RV to AP gradient improvement (after pre-stenting mean 30, 79 vs 28 p = NS; final result mean 23, 71 vs 28, 17, p = NS), RV to aorta <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> (after pre-stenting 0, 187 vs 0, 3117 p = NS; final result man 0, 315 vs 0, 317, p = NS). If considering non-extensible synthetic tubes we observe that RV-to-AP improvement is significantly worst {{to the rest of the}} group (mean 7, 07 vs 0, 17, p = 0, 005). When focusing on outflow tract diameter, results did not differ in homograft group and patch group. In contrast, diameter did play a role in those patients having a synthetic tube, with a cut-off at 20 mm diameter. Below 20 mm, relieve of outflow tract gradient was significantly worse than for bigger conduits. DiscussionPulmonary valve insertion is efficient in all type of RVOT reconstruction at least in the short term. The diameter of the conduits did not play a role in RVOT obstruction relief as long as surgical substrates are homografts or patch enlargement. In patients with prosthetic conduits, size matters. In non-extensible synthetic tubes results are worst. Reduced distensibility and progressive diameter reduction may lead to not consider these patients as good candidates for this procedure...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Física, apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa através da Faculdade de Ciências, 2008 Magnetic {{materials}} exhibiting a {{high degree}} of spin polarization are being actively investigated for their potential use in spintronic devices. Among them, CrO 2 is very attractive because it is a half-metal fully spin polarized at the Fermi level with a magnetic moment of 2 µB/f. u. and Curie temperature well above room temperature (RT). Therefore, much effort has been put into developing efficient and controlled methods for preparing CrO 2 films which nevertherless has been a difficult task due to the CrO 2 metastability. Results on the deposition of CrO 2 thin films by laser-assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (LCVD) and by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) are presented in this thesis. The LCVD experiments were carried out in a high vacuum chamber at working pressures of 10 - 5 - 10 - 1 mbar and using different geometries. Films were mainly grown at RT onto sapphire substrates by photodissociation of Cr(CO) 6 using a KrF excimer laser, in dynamic atmospheres containing oxygen and Argon. The structural characterization showed that some CrO 2 was deposited at RT in a narrow window of experimental parameters at 0. 5 mbar, although together with a significant amount of Cr 2 O 3. Precursors partial <b>pressures</b> <b>ratio</b> and laser fluence are the prominent parameters that have to be accurately controlled in order to co-deposit both phases. A highly reproducible CVD setup consisting of a single-zone furnace with independent control of the substrate temperature was developed. CrO 3 powder was used as precursor and oxygen as carrier gas. Films were grown within a broad range of deposition temperatures from 320 to 410 ºC, and O 2 carrier gas flow ratesof 50 500 sccm, showing that it is viable to grow highly oriented a-axis CrO 2 films at temperatures as low as 330 ºC, i. e. ~ 70 ºC lower than in published data for the same chemical system. Deposition parameters were correlated with the structure and microstructure, deposition kinetics, magnetic and electrical transport properties, and spin polarization of the deposited material. The growth of a Cr 2 O 3 interfacial layer as an intrinsic feature of the deposition process is studied and discussed. Films synthesised at 330 ºC keep the high quality magnetic and transport properties as those deposited at higher temperatures. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), (BD 16567 / 2004...|$|E

Therefore the variation in performance (air flow and thrust) of several nozzles, selected for the same performance at a particular design condition, was proportional to the ratio of their flow coefficients...|$|R

50|$|Although large flow {{compressors}} {{are usually}} all-axial, the rear stages on smaller units {{are too small}} to be robust. Consequently, these stages are often replaced by a single centrifugal unit. Very small flow compressors often employ two centrifugal compressors, connected in series. Although in isolation centrifugal compressors are capable of running at quite high <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> (e.g. 10:1), impeller stress considerations limit the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> that can be employed in high overall <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> engine cycles.|$|R

Due to boundary layer transition the convex Mach disk is temporary tilted and redirects the flow towards the nozzle wall. Accompanying numerical simulations compare well with the experiments...|$|R
