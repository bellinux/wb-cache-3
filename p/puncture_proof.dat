50|$|Semi-pneumatic tires have {{a hollow}} center, {{but they are}} not pressurized. They are light-weight, low-cost, <b>puncture</b> <b>proof,</b> and provide cushioning. These tires often come as a {{complete}} assembly with the wheel and even integral ball bearings. They are used on lawn mowers, wheelchairs, and wheelbarrows. They can also be rugged, typically used in industrial applications, and are designed to not pull off their rim under use.|$|E
40|$|Pathology, microbiology, {{blood bank}} and other {{diagnostic}} laboratories generate sizable amount of biomedical waste (BMW). The {{audit of the}} BMW is required for planning proper strategies. The audit in our laboratory revealed 8 kgs anatomical waste, 600 kgs microbiology waste, 220 kgs waste sharps, 15 kgs soiled waste, 111 kgs solid waste, 480 litres liquid waste along with 33000 litres per month liquid waste generated from labware washing and laboratory cleaning and 162 litres of chemical waste per month. Section wise details are described in the text. Needle sharps are collected in <b>puncture</b> <b>proof</b> containers and the needles autoclaved before sending to needle pit. The glass forms the major sharp category and is disinfected with hypochlorite before washing/ recycling. All microbiology waste along with containers/plates/tubes are autoclaved before recycling/disposal. The problem of formalin fixed anatomical waste as histology specimens is pointed out. The formalin containing tissues cannot be sent for incineration for the fear of toxic gas release and the guidelines by the Biomedical waste rule makers need to be amended for the issue. The discarded/infected blood units in blood bank need to be autoclaved before disposal since chemical treatments are difficult or inefficient. The liquid waste management needs more attention and effluent treatment facility needs to be viewed seriously for hospital in general. The segregation of waste at source is the key step and reduction, reuse and recycling {{should be considered in}} proper perspectives...|$|E

40|$|This cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the knowledge and practice of preventive measures in occupational exposure to blood and body fluids among nurses in a university hospital in the UAE. A pre-tested tructured self administered questionnaire was used for data collection. The mean age of the respondents as 29. 59 ± 5. 96 years and the median duration of clinical experience was 63 months ranging from 10 months o 264 months. Of the total, 25. 7 % reported having had exposure to splashes of blood and body fluids into he eyes or mouth. 98 % of nurses reported that if there had been any splash of blood or body fluids it is mportant to rinse with plenty of running water. 98 % knew that the ideal method of disposal of sharp waste e. g. hypodermic needles) was to put it in a <b>puncture</b> <b>proof</b> container immediately after use. 93. 1 % of the urses reported that the needle pricks, cuts or scratches should be bled by squeezing. 93 % habitually used asks always during surgery and 80. 4 % always wore goggles during surgery. With regard to recapping of eedles, 44. 6 % were aware that needles should be recapped by single hand technique after use and among hem 93. 3 % practiced this method; there was a statistically ignificant association (p&lt; 0. 001) between the wareness and practice, but not between years of experience and needle recapping technique after use. The nowledge among nurses about preventive measures in occupational exposure to blood and body fluids is adequate but in practice it is inadequate...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Needle stick {{injuries}} {{are an important}} occupational hazard for nursing personnel as they form an important mechanism for transmission of blood borne pathogens. Hence the knowledge of nurses about the prevention and management of needle stick injuries and practicing standard precautions is critical. Methodology: This was a hospital based cross sectional study conducted among nursing staff {{during the month of}} December, 2011. A semi structured questionnaire was administered to 320 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital of New Delhi by adopting systematic random sampling methodology. Data was entered and analysed using SPSS version 12. Percentages of categorical variables were computed. Results: Only 31. 1 % nurses had adequate knowledge about steps for prevention of needle stick injuries. 259 (88. 4 %) nurses had adequate knowledge about the authority to whom they should report needle stick injuries while almost three fourth i. e. 73. 4 % had adequate knowledge about management of needle stick injuries. Majority of nurses (69. 6 %) reported the use of gloves very often before venipuncture, 80. 2 % never recapped needles while 77. 5 % disposed sharps in <b>puncture</b> <b>proof</b> containers very often. Only one fourth (24. 6 %) nurses always used personal protective equipment in case of emergencies. 85. 7 % of nurses had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. 51 (17. 4 %) had a history of needle stick injury in the last one year out of which 49 (96. 1 %) took adequate measures immediately after the injury and 37 (72. 5 %) reported the incidence to the concerned authority. Conclusion:   The knowledge and practices of nurses regarding prevention and management of needle stick injuries were found to be unsatisfactory</p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to clarify the nature of {{combinatorial}} structures associated with maps on closed compact surfaces. We prove that maps give rise to Lagrangian matroids representable in a setting provided by cohomology of the surface with <b>punctured</b> points. Our <b>proof</b> is very elementary. We further observe that the greedy algorithm has a natural interpretation in this setting, as a `peeling' procedure which cuts the (connected) surface into a closed ring-shaped peel, and that this procedure is local. Comment: 12 pages. A rather more technical version of this paper, with the main proof reformulated in cohomological terms by David Stone, appeared as "Lagrangian Matroids and Cohomology" in Annals of Comb. 4 (2000), pp 171 - 18...|$|R
