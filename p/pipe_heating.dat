40|$|Abstract — The triple {{concentric}} <b>pipes</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is {{an improved}} version of double <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Most {{of the previous}} study on the heat exchanger is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric <b>pipes</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric <b>pipes</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Length of triple <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent double <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger are {{compared with that of}} the triple <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an intermediate pipe to the double <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger reduces effective length of heat exchanger, which results in savings in material and space. The triple concentric <b>pipes</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger provides large heat transfer area per unit heat exchanger length and better heat transfer efficiencies compared to double <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> {{exchangers}} {{are often}} used for large-scale heat exchanging. The arrangement of such a heat exchanger conveniently allows heat input to and output from the heat exchanger at remote locations. The traditional method of designing an ordinary HPHE (<b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger) is commonly applied in the separate type exchanger design, but the calculations have {{to be carried out}} separately, which makes it very complicated. In this work, the ε-NTU (effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units) method was applied for optimization analysis of single- or multi-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. An optimizing formula for single-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers was obtained. The optimizing principles of effec-tiveness-NTU and heat transfer rate by the equal distribution method for multi-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger are presented.

They can be cylindrical or planar in structure. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> can be {{embedded in a}} metal cooling plate, which {{is attached to the}} heat source, and can also be assembled with fin stack for fluid heat transfer. Due to the high heat transport capacity, heat exchangers with <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> have become much smaller than traditional heat exchangers in handling high heat fluxes. With the working fluid in a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> <b>heat</b> can be absorbed on the evaporator region and transported to the condenser region where the vapour condenses releasing the heat to the cooling media. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipe</b> technology has found its increasing applications in enhancing the thermal performance of heat exchangers in microelectronics, energy and other industrial sectors.

40|$|To {{properly}} {{design a}} <b>pipe</b> <b>heating</b> system, {{the basic principles}} of heat transfer from an insulated pipe must be understood. The three methods of heat flow are conduction, convection (both forced and natural) and radiation. The total heat loss from a pipe must be determined first, since this is the heat which must be replaced to maintain a pipe at a given temperature. A steam heating system requires an analysis of the heat loss from the pipe as well as an analysis of the capacity of the heating system. The economics of steam heat include the accessories as well as the inefficiencies of steam heat. The design of an electric heating system normally involves far fewer components and engineering complexities than does a comparable steam system. The basic system is comprised of the heater, controls and connection accessories. Today there are several economic trade-offs to be made in selecting a <b>pipe</b> <b>heating</b> system.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{modification}} of parameters of a single columnar vortex or a swirling flow in a pipe due to energy release from the internal degrees of freedom in nonequilibrium medium. The problem is addressed using direct numerical simulations by first- and second-order Godunov methods.

The process of vortex evolution includes relaxation of the initial excitation, propagation of the wave, which takes away extra mass, and (in non-axisymmetric case) formation of a spiral and falling of the hot gas region towards the vortex centre.
