Participants (N= 2, 964, 82 % female, 94 % White, BMI= 24. 8 ± 4. 4) were divided into two age groups (18 – 35 vs. 36 – 50) and {{compared}} on motivations, strategies for weight loss, diet, physical activity (PA), and the TFEQ. YA were 28. 6 % of the sample (n= 848). YA and OA achieved similar weight losses (p=. 38) but duration of maintenance was less in YA (43 vs. 58 months, p< 001). YA were more likely to cite appearance and social motivations for weight loss, were less motivated by health, and were less likely to report a medical trigger for weight loss (p's<. 001). YA were more likely to use exercise classes and to lose weight on their own, and less likely to use a commercial program (p's<. 001). YA reported engaging in more high intensity PA (p=. 001). There were no group differences in total calories consumed (p=. 47), or <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> (p=. 97), alcohol (p=. 52) or sugar sweetened beverages (p=. 26).

40|$|Rates of {{overweight}} and obesity {{continue to rise}} each year with serious associated health risks. This {{study was conducted to}} explore gender differences between behavior change variables for both dietary fat reduction and exercise behaviors in a weight loss population. This research also investigated relationships between these psychosocial behavior change variables. Over 300 overweight and obese men and women enrolled in weight loss programs in the greater Boston area completed self-administered surveys. The behavior change variables surveyed included validated Transtheoretical Model (TTM) measures of stage of change for dietary fat reduction, situational confidence and temptation for dietary fat reduction, as well as the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire restraint scale (TFEQ-R). Exercise variables included stage of change and situational confidence. Although significant gender differences were detected by multivariate analysis of variance (p 3 ̆c. 05), weak effect sizes suggest that gender differences for dietary confidence, temptations, or restraint were not clinically relevant. Gender was not found to {{have a significant effect on}} exercise confidence (p 3 ̆e. 05). Stage of change was found to have a significant and strong effect on each of the dietary and exercise behavioral variables under investigation (p 3 ̆c. 05). Through structural equation modeling methods, dietary restraint was found to mediate the effect between the self-efficacy variables of dietary confidence and temptations and <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Restraint, however, was not found to be a moderator or have an interaction effect with self-efficacy variables affecting <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Dietary restraint was not found to be a moderating or mediating variable for the exercise behavior models under investigation. Dietary restraint has not been previously studied with regard to constructs of the TTM. Stage of change was found to have a strong and significant effect on predicting dietary restraint (p 3 ̆c. 001). Results of this study suggests that while men have higher confidence scores and lower scores for temptations and restraint, weight reduction programs do not need to change intervention techniques based on gender. Results also indicate that weight loss programs would benefit from first targeting self-efficacy behaviors which could thereby influence dietary restraint leading to behavior change such as dietary fat reduction. ...|$|R

A personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary software can provide an alternative to a paper record. The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or PDA for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n= 192) was 84 % female and 78 % white, {{with a mean age}} of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m 2) of 34. 1. At baseline, the groups did not differ in energy intake, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat,</b> and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and percent calories from total fat and saturated fatty acids (P < 0. 001); no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the PDA group significantly increased consumption of fruit (P= 0. 02) and vegetables (P= 0. 04) and decreased consumption of refined grains (P= 0. 02). Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in percent calories from total fat (P= 0. 02), monounsaturated fatty acids (P= 0. 002), and trans-fatty acids (P= 0. 04). Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar (P= 0. 02) and added sugar (P= 0. 01) intake in both groups.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: A {{full time}} {{child-care}} program {{is expected to}} provide at least one-half to two-thirds of a child's daily nutrient requirements. As such, child-care settings have been acknowledged as an important setting for the assurance of children's nutrition and {{for the prevention of}} childhood obesity. It has been suggested that an increase in the use of in-house food preparation in child-care settings could improve the nutrient profile of menus and decrease food costs. However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of meal preparation time on nutritional quality and food expenditure in the general population, and no studies have assessed this relationship in child-care settings. Objective: To investigate the association between meal preparation time and food expenditure and nutritional quality of menus in family child-care homes. Methods: Fifty-nine family child-care providers participated in this study. Participants recorded time spent in meal preparation and menus served over a period of five consecutive days of operation, and collected receipts for food items purchased. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of breakfast and lunch preparation time with each - food expenditure, and nutritional quality of the menu adjusting for covariates. Nutritional quality of the menu was quantified using mean adequacy ratio (MAR), sodium Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) ratio, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sugar, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> trans <b>fat.</b> Results: There was no observed relationship between breakfast preparation time and food expenditure (p = 0. 499), although there was an inverse trend between lunch preparation time and lunch food expenditure (p = 0. 110). There was no statistically significant relationship between breakfast or lunch preparation time and indicators of nutritional quality of the menus. There was a direct trend between breakfast preparation time and <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> trans <b>fat</b> (p = 0. 073) and a direct trend between lunch preparation time and MAR (p = 0. 073). Conclusion: In this sample, there is insufficient evidence to posit that there is a relationship between time spent in food preparation and food expenditure or measures of the nutritional quality of menus. Future research is needed to understand the role of time spent in food preparation in determining food expenditure and nutritional quality of the menus served at family child-care homes...|$|R

We used data on medication use, energy intake, diet composition, and physical activity for 3073 eligible adults from the 2005 – 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Potential confounding variables, including depression symptoms, were included in the models assessing energy intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Antidepressant users reported consuming an additional (mean ± S. E.) 215 ± 73 kcal/day compared to non-users (p = 0. 01). There were no differences in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sugar, <b>fat,</b> or alcohol between the two groups.

Our aim was to explore the differential effects of changing income, assets, maternal education, and urbanicity on dietary behaviors of mothers and offspring that may affect overweight risk. Methods The study included a cohort of Filipino offspring and their mothers participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey at four time points from 1994 (n = 1, 885 pairs) to 2005 (n = 1, 349 pairs). The effect of socioeconomic factors and urbanicity, on dietary behaviors including energy adequacy, percent fat and carbohydrates were examined using longitudinal random-effects regression models.

At the same time, nutrition-related health conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, are increasing in Mexican-origin youth. Risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes are more common in Mexican-origin children and include increased intakes of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods. This study assessed the relationship between children's experience of food insecurity and nutrient intake from food and beverages among Mexican-origin children (age 6 - 11 y) who resided in Texas border colonias. Methods Baseline data from 50 Mexican-origin children were collected in the home by trained promotora -researchers. All survey (demographics and nine-item child food security measure) and 24 -hour dietary recall data were collected in Spanish. Dietary data were collected in person on three occasions using a multiple-pass approach; nutrient intakes were calculated with NDS-R software. Separate multiple regression models were individually fitted for total energy, protein, dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, potassium, sodium, Vitamin C, and percentage of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> and added sugars. Results Thirty-two children (64 %) reported low or very low food security. Few children met the recommendations for calcium, dietary fiber, and sodium; and none for potassium or vitamin D.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore potential biomarkers, including various hormones and neuropeptides, which regulate appetite and metabolism, and dietary components that could potentially differentiate obesity with and without FA. Of the 737 adults recruited from the general Newfoundland population, 58 food-addicted and non-food-addicted overweight/obese individuals (FAO, NFO) matched for age, sex, BMI and physical activity were selected. A total of 34 neuropeptides, gut hormones, pituitary polypeptide hormones and adipokines were measured in fasting serum. We found that the FAO group had lower levels of TSH, TNF-α and amylin, but higher levels of prolactin, as compared to NFO group. The total calorie intake (per kg body weight), the dietary intake of fat (per g/kg body weight, per BMI and per percentage of trunk fat) and the <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> intake <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> and carbohydrates (g/kg) was higher in the FAO group compared to the NFO group.

Little {{research has been}} published to document changes in mental health in women {{as a result of}} fat and cholesterol lowering interventions to prevent chronic disease. This paper examines the relationships among changes in dietary fat consumption and mental health in the Women’s Health Trial, a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether lowering fat consumption to 20 % of daily calories could reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women ages 45 - 69 years. Assessments were made at baseline and at the 12 -month follow-up of several aspects of quality of life, including negative and positive affect and past, present, and future perceptions of health. Mental health variables were measured by the Mental Health Inventory, a standardized scale used in the Medical Outcomes study. Dietary intake was assessed for all subjects with the use of semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. The change in mental health values (follow-up minus baseline) was significantly different between intervention and control groups for three of the four psychological variables: (a) anxiety; (b) depression; and (c) vigor. In all three cases, the direction of the change for intervention women was positive. Neither randomization assignment nor <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> at the follow-up visit were significant predictors of mental health at the 1 -year follow-up. Cholesterol changes were not related to levels of mental health variables in a sample of the women.

These findings are encouraging, because lowering dietary fat is a national priority and will receive more research and public health attention in future years...|$|R

The subjects were 60 women {{ranging in age from}} 24 to 74 and were of varying degrees of adiposity. These subjects had participated in the Women's Nutrition Project each year and were not pregnant and/or lactating between the first year and the fourth year. Factors selected for this study included age, waist/hip ratio, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), caloric intake, <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> intake, Eating Anxiety Index, Eating Restraint, report of dieting, reproductive history, activity patterns, exercise fluctuation, Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Food Intake Index, Holmes and Rahe Life Events Scale, Outlook Index, Importance of Slenderness Index, Husband Involvement Index, and Husband Pressure Index. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify correlations between the dependent variables and independent variables in order to aid in determining the appropriate model for subsequent multiple regression determinations. Two sets of multiple regression with and without anthropometric factors were calculated to predict the value of a dependent variable - BMI in year 4, threeyear weight fluctuation, and three-year net weight change - from a group of independent variables. The multiple regression equation revealed that four variables, initial TSF, MAC, waist/hip ratio, and caloric intake in year 1 accounted for 71. 7 {{percent of the variance in}} the final BMI. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index were predictive factors for weight fluctuation and accounted for 27. 8 percent of the variance in weight fluctuation over three years. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index entered the multiple regression equation and accounted for 26. 3 percent of the variance in three-year net weight change. When anthropometric variables were removed from the group of the independent variables, caloric intake in year 1 and Eating Anxiety Index accounted for 29. 7 percent of the variance in the final BMI. Eating Restraint accounted for 14. 5 percent of the variance in three-year weight fluctuation.

40|$|During {{a time of}} {{national}} and local debate over welfare reform, {{research is needed to}} determine the effectiveness of specific welfare programs and the impact on the lives of households participating in these programs. The objective of this study was to determine the effect housing and food expenditures have on the diet quality of low-income families. Participants for the study were drawn from government-subsidized housing rolls and housing assistance waiting lists. Diet quality was measured by 16 variables: percent RDA protein, fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium consumed; <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> protein, carbohydrates, <b>fat,</b> and alcohol; and the number of servings from each food group: bread and cereal, fruit, vegetable, meat and protein, dairy, and fats and sweets food groups. Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between the percent poverty level of the household and the percent of income spent on housing and food with each diet quality variable. No statistically significant correlations were found. Mann-Whitney U tests and t tests were used to determine if diet quality of participants who received housing assistance was different from participants who did not receive assistance. No statistical significance was found. Participant 2 ̆ 7 s diets who received food assistance and diets of participants who do not receive food assistance were also analyzed to determine any differences in diet quality. Again, no statistical significance was found between the two groups. The diets of the sample population were found to be fairly average in comparison to overall food consumption patterns of the United States. Consumption of fiber, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was low. Increased consumer education programs are recommended to improve overall diet...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} study, eleven healthy human adults were fed a {{constant}} laboratory-controlled diet providing 30 <b>percent</b> of the <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b> Two-thirds {{of the fat}} (20 {{percent of the total}} dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the four test oils: palm oil, soybean oil, palm olein oil and palm stearin oil. All treatments resulted in a low level of T-chol, LDL, VLDL, HDL, triglyceride and phospholipid compared to normal recommended upper values of 200, 40, 130, 65, 250 and 250 mg/dl, respectively. The different types of palm oil showed higher fecal fat excretion in comparison to soybean oil treatment. Results of this study indicated significant differences in blood serum lipid concentrations and in fecal fatty acid excretions due to alterations in dietary fats. However the alterations in total fecal fat and in fatty acid excretions were too small to account for the lower blood serum lipid values observed in study. ^ In the second study, ten healthy adult human subjects were fed a constant laboratory-controlled diet providing 30 <b>percent</b> of the <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat; however, two-thirds of the fat (20 percent of the total dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the four test oils: palm oil, soybean oil plus palm olein oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm stearin oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm oil (1 : 1). The addition of soybean oil to the different types of palm oil did not show any significant increase in the mean blood cholesterol and lipoprotein levels of subjects. ^ In the third study, four different test oils were employed: palm oil, palm stearin oil, palm olein oil, and soybean oil to evaluate acceptability of fried chin chin. The three types of palm oil were shown by the evaluators to be more acceptable in flavor/odor and overall acceptability when compared to soybean oil. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many adult Latinos are {{not meeting}} {{guidelines}} for healthy eating. Theory posits {{the important role}} of family and family members on individual’s health behaviors (e. g., diet). However, few studies examine how children impact their parents’ diet. Furthermore, empirical evidence shows that acculturation is an important predictor of diet among Latino adults. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the role of children, families, and acculturation on mothers’ dietary intake and related behaviors. Methods: Chapters 1 and 2 used secondary data from mother-child dyads enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and Chapter 3 used primary data collected from mother-child dyads. Chapter 1 used baseline survey data from 314 Latino mother-child dyads to test how children’s acculturation and the mother-child acculturation gap was associated with mothers’ dietary intake and related behaviors. Building on the results from Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, longitudinal data from 162 dyads enrolled in delayed treatment group of the RCT were used to test the temporal relations of the family environment on traditional mothers’ dietary intake and behaviors, and whether these relations differed between mothers of assimilated versus bicultural children. Finally, Chapter 3 used qualitative interview data from mothers and their bicultural (n= 11) or assimilated (n= 10) children and quantitative data from mothers to explore how children influenced their mothers’ dietary intake and behaviors. Results: Chapter 1 provided evidence that accounting for mothers’ acculturation, having an assimilated versus a bicultural child was negatively associated with mothers’ vegetable intake and positively associated with mothers’ sugary beverage intake, <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat,</b> and frequency of away-from-home eating. The most at-risk dyads for lower quality diet among mothers were traditional mothers of assimilated children. Chapter 2 found that less positive family interactions around food at baseline predicted more frequent away-from-home eating four months later among mothers of assimilated children. Additionally, more family expressiveness at four months predicted more dollars spent on fruits and vegetables at ten months among mothers of bicultural children. In Chapter 3, participants described how mothers’ feeding styles shaped children’s food preferences and in return, children’s food preferences influenced mothers’ dietary intake and behaviors. Discussion: This dissertation found evidence for {{the important role of}} children and families on mothers’ dietary intake and related behaviors. The findings presented here support the theoretical notion that individuals’ health behaviors are directly and indirectly influenced by family-level factors. Further, this dissertation extends previous research on the important role of mothers on their children’s dietary outcomes by building evidence for the reciprocating influence of children on their mothers’ dietary intake and behaviors...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} pregnant women who developed GDM {{as compared to}} those who did not. Maternal nutrient consumption, plasma phospholipid (PL) fatty acids (FA), and infant sleep states, as a determinant of maturity of the central nervous system (CNS), were assessed. Maternal plasma insulin and glucose levels, measures of short- and long-term glucose control, and infant glucose levels were examined. ^ In Study 1 the relationship of plasma PL LC-PUFA with infant sleep patterns was determined. Women with and without GDM were recruited at approximately 26 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery. Infant sleep-wake patterns were recorded in the first 48 postnatal hours. Sleep-wake patterns of infants born to women with GDM were typical of a less well developed CNS, while those infants born to women with uncomplicated pregnancies exhibited patterns typical of a more well developed CNS. ^ Study 2 addressed the efficacy of MNT in the treatment of GDM by assessing the dietary intake of women with GDM as compared with that of control subjects using repeated 24 -hour recalls. Women with GDM received dietary education and guidance from Registered Dietitians. Women with GDM had more appropriate energy intake, lower fat intake and a higher <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> polyunsaturated <b>fats</b> than did controls, suggesting MNT was effective. ^ Study 3 was an assessment of dietary intake of EFA and LC-PUFA in pregnant women with and without GDM to determine whether diets have changed in the last decade with respect to dietary FA. Dietary intake was assessed using repeated 24 -hour recalls. Results were consistent with those reported by Wijendren et al. (1) a decade ago, indicating a need to educate pregnant women about the importance and sources of LC-PUFA, especially DHA. ^ Clearly, maternal dietary LC-PUFA, especially DHA, is important to fetal development. Additionally, nutrition education provided by Registered Dietitians positively impacts dietary intake of macronutrients. It appears that limited progress has been made vis-à-vis increasing intake of n- 3 as compared to n- 6 fatty acids. Finally, it is clear nutrition education should be expanded to all pregnant women to assure the most favorable outcome for all infants. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [45]- 50) The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine if the nutrient composition of noon meals prepared according to the American Heart Association guidelines for restaurants (heart-healthy meals) were significantly different in calories, cholesterol, total fat, saturated fat, sodium, polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (P/S) ratio and <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> (kcal) <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> the noon meal of the average American. The study compared mean values of 126 heart-healthy meals obtained from the American Heart Association Cookbook and four restaurants from the Chicagoland area to reported noon intakes of male and female participants between the ages of 18 to 74 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II, 1976 - 80). Noted nutritional composition of noon meals of participants were compared by sex and age catagories, and food sources. The heart-healthy meals contained significantly less calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium than contained in the meals consumed by male NHANES II participants no matter whether the meal was obtained from home, school, restaurant or other source. Female NHANES II participants consumed significantly less calories and cholesterol than contained in the heart-healthy meals but significantly more fat and sodium regardless of the food source. For males the caloric and cholesterol content of meals were associated with age. Younger men consumed more calories and cholesterol than older men. P/S ratio was significantly lower and percent of kcal <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> were significantly higher for the self-selected noon meal from NHANES II than heart-healthy meals for all groups compared. To reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, younger American males could reduce intake of total calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium by substituting a self-selected noon meal with a heart-healthy meal. If females from NHANES II substituted a heart-healthy meal for a self-selected noon meal they would increase calories and cholesterol but fat and sodium would be decreased. Overall the fat-related and sodium content of the heart-healthy meals were more conducive to reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Therefore, heart-healthy meals served at some restaurants should be brought to the attention of the public. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

Using data from the study "Vida Sana, Hoy y Ma??ana," this paper examined gender differences in fruit and vegetable consumption and percentage of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> among Latino immigrants in North Carolina. The {{differences between men and women}} were analyzed using t-test. Multi linear regression was used to examine factors associated with fruit and vegetable consumption and percentage of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b> The six variables examined were gender, age, income, public assistance, health status, and acculturation. Men consumed one more serving of fruits and vegetables than women and consumed more percentage of their <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b> Although this was a small study, n{{one of the}} variables examined showed significance. Age was the only factor that approached significance with older adults consuming more fruits and vegetables than younger participants. Age was statistically significant with young adults consuming more percentage of their <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> than older participants. Although Latino immigrants migrate to this country with favorable health behaviors, over time research has shown that their behaviors tend to assimilate to the host country. Tailoring interventions to address these factors will provide ideas for health professionals to increase consumption and reduce <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> among the Latino population...|$|R
