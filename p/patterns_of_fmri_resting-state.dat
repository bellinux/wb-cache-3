40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is regarded}} as a brain disease with globally disrupted neuronal networks. Even though fMRI studies have revealed abnormal functional connectivity in ASD, they have not reached a consensus <b>of</b> the disrupted <b>patterns.</b> Here, a deep learning-based feature extraction method identifies multivariate and nonlinear functional connectivity <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> ASD. <b>Resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> data <b>of</b> 972 subjects (465 ASD 507 normal controls) acquired from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange were used. A functional connectivity matrix of each subject was generated using 90 predefined brain regions. As a data-driven feature extraction method without prior knowledge such as subjects diagnosis, variational autoencoder (VAE) summarized the functional connectivity matrix into 2 features. Those feature values of ASD patients were statistically compared with those of controls. A feature was significantly different between ASD and normal controls. The extracted features were visualized by VAE-based generator which can produce virtual functional connectivity matrices. The ASD-related feature was associated with frontoparietal connections, interconnections of the dorsal medial frontal cortex and corticostriatal connections. It also showed a trend of negative correlation with full-scale IQ. A data-driven feature extraction based on deep learning could identify complex <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> functional connectivity of ASD. This approach will help discover complex <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> abnormalities in brain connectivity in various brain disorders. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research {{into the}} neural basis of social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) suggests alterations in prefrontal networks, which may in turn disrupt regulation of the limbic system. Better understanding of the disturbed interface between these networks may improve current pathogenic models of this disorder. Methods: Applying group independent component analysis (ICA) to recordings <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> <b>resting-state,</b> connectivity in the executive control network was studied in 18 patients with SAD and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: Results revealed a dissociation within the left executive control network, with SAD patients showing decreased connectivity of the orbitofrontal gyrus and increased connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus compared to healthy controls. In a subsequent seed-based functional connectivity analysis, patients with SAD displayed increased connectivity between the left orbitofrontal gyrus and the left amygdala. Conclusions: Findings suggest that hypo-connectivity in the executive control network and hyper-connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala may reflect a disturbance in the balance between top-down and bottom-up control processes, potentially contributing {{to the development of}} SAD...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} identified electroencephalography (EEG) microstates as the electrophysiological correlates <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> <b>resting-state</b> networks. Microstates {{are defined}} as short periods (100 ms) during which the EEG scalp topography remains quasi-stable; that is, the global topography is fixed but strength might vary and polarity invert. Microstates represent the subsecond coherent activation within global functional brain networks. Surprisingly, these rapidly changing EEG microstates correlate significantly with activity in <b>fMRI</b> <b>resting-state</b> networks after convolution with the hemodynamic response function that constitutes a strong temporal smoothing filter. We postulate here that microstate sequences should reveal scale-free, self-similar dynamics to explain this remarkable effect and thus that microstate time series show dependencies over long time ranges. To that aim, we deploy wavelet-based fractal analysis that allows determining scale-free behavior. We find strong statistical evidence that microstate sequences are scale free over six dyadic scales covering the 256 -ms to 16 -s range. The degree of long-range dependency is maintained when shuffling the local microstate labels but becomes indistinguishable from white noise when equalizing microstate durations, which indicates that temporal dynamics are their key characteristic. These results advance the understanding of temporal dynamics of brain-scale neuronal network models such as the global workspace model. Whereas microstates can be considered the "atoms of thoughts," the shortest constituting elements of cognition, they carry a dynamic signature that is reminiscent at characteristic timescales up to multiple seconds. The scale-free dynamics of the microstates might {{be the basis for}} the rapid reorganization and adaptation of the functional networks of the brain...|$|R

40|$|Specific {{regions of}} the human occipito-temporal cortex are {{consistently}} activated in functional imaging studies of face processing. To understand the contribution of these regions to face processing, we examined the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activation in four congenital prosopagnosic (CP) individuals who are markedly impaired at face processing despite normal vision and intelligence, and with no evidence of brain damage. These individuals evinced a normal <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activation in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) and in other ventral occipito-temporal areas, in response to faces, buildings, and other objects, shown both as line drawings in detection and discrimination tasks and under more naturalistic testing conditions when no task was required. CP individuals also showed normal adaptation levels in a blockdesign adaptation experiment and, like control subjects, exhibited evidence of global face representation in the FFA. The absence of a BOLD–behavioral correlation (profound behavioral deficit, normal face-related activation in the ventral occipito- temporal cortex) challenges existing accounts of face representation, and suggests that activation in these cortical regions per se {{is not sufficient to}} ensure intact face processing...|$|R
40|$|The goal of resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) is to investigate the brain's functional connections by using the temporal similarity between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in different regions of the brain “at rest” as an indicator of synchronous neural activity. Since this measure relies on the temporal correlation <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> signal changes between different parts of the brain, any non-neural activity-related process that affects the signals will influence the measure of functional connectivity, yielding spurious results. To understand the sources <b>of</b> these <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> confounds, this article describes the origins of the BOLD signal in terms of MR physics and cerebral physiology. Potential confounds arising from motion, cardiac and respiratory cycles, arterial CO 2 concentration, blood pressure/cerebral autoregulation, and vasomotion are discussed. Two classes of techniques to remove confounds from resting-state BOLD time series are reviewed: 1) those utilising external recordings of physiology and 2) data-based cleanup methods that only use the <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> data itself. Further methods that remove noise from functional connectivity measures at a group level are also discussed. For successful interpretation <b>of</b> <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> comparisons and results, noise cleanup is an often over-looked but essential step in the analysis pipeline...|$|R

Distributed codes can represent a larger number of alternative items than sparse codes [1 - 3] but produce ambiguities when multiple items are represented simultaneously (the "superposition" problem) [1, 4]. Recent studies found category information in the distributed <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> response across the ventral visual pathway, including in regions that do not "prefer" the object in question [5 - 8].

We report that information in the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> response about standard object categories is severely disrupted by clutter and eliminated when attention is diverted. However, information about preferred categories in category-specific regions is undiminished by clutter and partly preserved under diverted attention.

In the present {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study, we performed multiple-regression interaction analysis to investigate whether hypnotic susceptibility (HS), a cognitive trait referring to the responsiveness to suggestions, explains interindividual differences in the neural mechanisms related to conditioned placebo analgesia in healthy volunteers. HS was not related to the overall strength of placebo analgesia. However, we found several HS-related differences in the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity and seed-based functional connectivity that accompanied placebo analgesia. Specifically, in subjects with higher HS, the placebo response was related to increased anticipatory activity in a right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex focus, and to reduced functional connectivity of that focus with brain regions related to emotional and evaluative pain processing (anterior mid-cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex); an opposite <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity and functional connectivity was found in subjects with lower HS. During pain perception, activity in the regions reflecting attention/arousal (bilateral anterior thalamus/left caudate) and self-related processing (left precuneus and bilateral posterior temporal foci) was negatively related to the strength of the analgesic placebo response in subjects with higher HS, but not in subjects with lower HS. These findings highlight HS influences on brain circuits related to the placebo analgesic effects. More generally, they demonstrate that different neural mechanisms can be involved in placebo responsiveness, depending on individual cognitive traits...|$|R

Reports of reliable orientation-selective modulations in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity have demonstrated the potential for investigating the representation of orien-tation in the human visual cortex. Orientation-selective voxel responses could arise from anisotropies in the preferred orientations of pooled neurons due to the random sampling of the cortical surface. However, {{it is unclear whether}} orientation-selective voxel re-sponses reflect biases in the underlying distribution of neuronal orientation preference, such as the demonstrated over-representation of radial orientations (those collinear with fixation). Here, we investigated whether stimuli balanced in their radial components could evoke orientation-selective biases in voxel activity. We attempted to discriminate the sense <b>of</b> spiral Glass <b>patterns</b> (opening anti-clockwise or clockwise), in which the local orientation structure was defined by the placement of paired dots at an orientation offset from the radial. We found that information within the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> responses in each of V 1, V 2, V 3, and V 3 A/B allowed discrimination of the spiral sense with accuracies significantly above chance.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique used for the investigation of brain function, which has found numerous applications within basic neuroscience. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> as a clinical tool for presurgical mapping of pertinent cortical regions in patients with tumour or epilepsy has facilitated neurosurgical planning, and most likely reduced the risk of severe postoperative deficits. However, {{there is a fundamental}} difference between the application <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> in experimental research and in the clinical setting. While inference is often drawn from data on group level in neuroscientific applications <b>of</b> <b>fMRI,</b> the clinical use of the method demands that reliable results be obtained in individual patients. The aims of the methodological studies presented in this thesis were to increase the reliability and extend the usefulness <b>of</b> clinical <b>fMRI.</b> In one study, gradient-echo field maps were utilized to assess the sensitivity of echo-planar imaging to the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Theoretical expressions for the calculation of the BOLD sensitivity were verified and improved. The BOLD sensitivity was investigated in a group of healthy volunteers using a clinical {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) system, and it was concluded that the field map method accurately predicts BOLD sensitivity. In another study, a flexible model was introduced in order to increase the confidence <b>of</b> clinical <b>fMRI</b> examinations <b>of</b> patients unable to fully comply with a typical clinical fMRI experiment. The method was applied to experimental and simulated data, and then used to retrospectively analyse patient data. The conclusion drawn from this study was that the proposed flexible model improves the detection of activation in partially non-compliant subjects. In the third study included in this thesis, the model-free algorithm locally linear embedding was applied to fMRI data analysis. The proposed data-driven algorithm was optimized and investigated with respect to reliability and possible benefits in a clinical setting. The algorithm was found to compare well to the traditionally used method of principal component analysis, and showed benefits when applied to simulated fMRI data exhibiting non-linear characteristics. Finally, the test-retest reliability <b>of</b> <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> was compared with the reliability <b>of</b> traditional task-based <b>fMRI.</b> <b>Resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> compared well with task-based fMRI experiments, thus possibly extending the use <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> to patient groups that have hitherto not been able to benefit from fMRI examinations...|$|R

40|$|The {{human brain}} is a {{large-scale}} system of functionally connected brain regions. This {{system can be}} modeled as a network, or graph, by dividing the brain into a set of regions, or “nodes,” and quantifying {{the strength of the}} connections between nodes, or “edges,” as the temporal correlation in their <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> activity. Network analysis, a part of graph theory, provides a set of summary statistics {{that can be used to}} describe complex brain networks in a meaningful way. The large-scale organization of the brain has features of complex networks that can be quantified using network measures from graph theory. The adaptation of both bivariate (mutual information) and multivariate (Granger causality) connectivity estimators to quantify the synchronization between multichannel recordings yields a fully connected, weighted, (a) symmetric functional connectivity graph (FCG), representing the associations among all brain areas. The aforementioned procedure leads to an extremely dense network of tens up to a few hundreds of weights. Therefore, this FCG must be filtered out so that the “true” connectivity pattern can emerge. Here, we compared a large number of well-known topological thresholding techniques with the novel proposed data-driven scheme based on orthogonal minimal spanning trees (OMSTs). OMSTs filter brain connectivity networks based on the optimization between the global efficiency of the network and the cost preserving its wiring. We demonstrated the proposed method in a large EEG database (N = 101 subjects) with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) tasks by adopting a time-varying approach with the main goal to extract features that can totally distinguish each subject from the rest of the set. Additionally, the reliability of the proposed scheme was estimated in a second case study <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> <b>resting-state</b> activity with multiple scans.

Across a range of realistic simulations, we find that in most situations, both methods are more accurate than current popular approaches for analysis <b>of</b> multi-subject <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> studies. The group-PCA output can be used to feed into a range of further analyses that are then rendered practical, such as the estimation of group-averaged voxelwise connectivity, group-level parcellation, and group-ICA.

40|$|In statistics, signal {{processing}} and mathematical finance, a time series is {{a sequence of}} data points, measured typically at successive times spaced at uniform time intervals. Here, I only focus on the discrete time series. The motivation of writing this methodology note is to clarify {{the relationship between the}} measures to quantify activity of an observed timeseries. Particularly, focus one several measures used in recently emerged field <b>of</b> <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> studies. Although all these measures have been extensively developed in EEG or other timeseries studies, many researchers focusing on various applications in or new comers to this new field need to know existed measures and the relationships among these measures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the value <b>of</b> <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> in {{detecting}} the acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brains. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were studied by conventional MR imaging and <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> prior to and 0. 5 hours after initiation of acute alcohol administration. The fMRI data, acquired during the resting state, were correlated with different breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC). We use the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus as a seed for the default mode network (DMN) analysis. ALFF and ReHo were also used to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the resting state. Conventional MR imaging showed no abnormalities on all subjects. Compared with the prior alcohol administration, the ALFF and ReHo also indicated some specific brain regions which are affected by alcohol, including the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampal gyrus, left basal ganglia, and right internal capsule. Functional connectivity of the DMN was affected by alcohol. This <b>resting-state</b> <b>fMRI</b> indicates that brain regions implicated are affected by alcohol and might provide a neural basis for alcohol’s effects on behavioral performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMulti-voxel pattern {{analysis}} (MVPA), or ‘decoding’, <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity has gained {{popularity in the}} neuroimaging community in recent years. MVPA differs from standard fMRI analyses by focusing on whether information relating to specific stimuli is encoded in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> activity across multiple voxels. If a stimulus can be predicted, or decoded, solely from the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity, it must mean there is information about that stimulus represented in the brain region where the pattern across voxels was identified. This ability to examine the representation of information relating to specific stimuli (e. g., memories) in particular brain areas makes MVPA an especially suitable method for investigating memory representations in brain structures such as the hippocampus. This approach could open up new opportunities to examine hippocampal representations {{in terms of their}} content, and how they might change over time, with aging, and pathology. Here we consider published MVPA studies that specifically focused on the hippocampus, and use them to illustrate the kinds of novel questions that can be addressed using MVPA. We then discuss some of the conceptual and methodological challenges that can arise when implementing MVPA in this context. Overall, we hope to highlight the potential utility of MVPA, when appropriately deployed, and provide some initial guidance to those considering MVPA as a means to investigate the hippocampus...|$|R
