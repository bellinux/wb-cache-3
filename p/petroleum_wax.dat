50|$|Each mast of the Viaduct is {{equipped}} with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile steel cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against corrosion (galvanisation, a coating of <b>petroleum</b> <b>wax,</b> and an extruded polyethylene sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical weatherstrip. The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.|$|E

The production of <b>petroleum</b> <b>wax</b> {{in the world}} about 3. 6 x 109 ton per year, valued at nearly $ 2 billion.

Although the availability of Sudan petroleum crude oil which contain large amount of paraffin wax and availability of refineries for crude oil, there are no units in these refineries for production of wax.

The application of a wax inhibitor was introduced in this study to reduce the wax.

A total of 10 ml of the inhibitor with different ratio was injected into the crude sample where the temperature of cold finger and water bath were setting at 10 ºC and 50 ºC respectively.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a descriptive and illustrative account of phase {{behavior in the}} seven naturally occurring petroleum fluids and ties all the known eleven phase-transition concepts in a unified narrative. The figures and tables contained in this report are designed {{so that they could}} effectively support the discussion about molecular make-up of petroleum fluids, P- and T-effects on phase behavior and phase transition points. Seven naturally occurring hydrocarbon fluids are known as petroleum fluids. They include, in the order of their fluidity, natural gas, gas-condensate (NGL), light crude, intermediate crude, heavy oil, tar sand and oil shale. In this report we present a generalized description of the various phase transitions, which may occur in petroleum fluids with emphasis on heavy organics deposition. At first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. Their constituents including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy fractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of constituents are presented including <b>petroleum</b> <b>wax,</b> diamondoids, asphaltenes and petroleum resins. Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of variations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of petroleum fluids are introduced. Finally eleven distinct phase-transition points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state variables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. This report is to generalize and relate phase behaviors of all the seven naturally occurring petroleum fluids into a unified perspective. This work is the basis to develop a comprehensive computational model for phase behavior prediction of all the petroleum fluids, which is of major interest in the petroleum industry.

30|$|Waxes and {{asphaltenes}} are {{the most}} important constituents of crude oils because they have a great influence on crude oil properties. Waxes are a complex mixture of solid (at ambient temperature) hydrocarbons which consist mainly of paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a small amount of}} naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as polar compounds. There are two general classes of <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes.</b> Waxes that are composed primarily of normal alkanes (n-alkanes) with a chain length of C 18 –C 30 and crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) with a melting point of 40 – 60  °C are referred to as paraffin waxes (Jowett 1984). Waxes, which consist primarily of the higher molecular weight n-alkanes within C 30 –C 60, with a high share of iso-paraffins and naphthenes, and have much higher melting point ranges (above 60 – 90  °C), are referred to as microcrystalline waxes. According to Musser and Kilpatrick (1998), paraffinic and microcrystalline waxes have molecular weight ranges of 350 – 600 and 300 – 2500, respectively.|$|R

Although {{the composition of}} these alkanes strongly resembles <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes,</b> it has been proposed that they are biosynthetic products of human skin. To investigate this question, skin surface lipids from 15 normal subjects were analyzed for the amount and composition of alkanes, using quantitative thin-layer chromatography and quarts capillary gas chromatography. The alkanes were found to constitute 0. 5 % to 1. 7 % of the skin lipids. Subjects differed greatly in the chain length distribution of their alkanes between 15 and 35 carbon atoms, and in the relative amounts of normal alkanes (like those in <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes)</b> and branched chain alkanes (like those in petroleum lubricating oils). In 6 subjects, the alkane content of cerumen from each ear was examined to investigate whether alkanes arrive at the skin surface by a systemic route or by direct contract with environmental surfaces. No trace of alkanes was found in 11 of the 12 cerumen samples. Using a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer for carbon- 14 dating, a combined sample of the skin surface alkanes {{was found to have}} a theoretical age of 30, 950 years, similar to that of a sample of petrolatum.

The principal nonpolar components were cholesterol, free fatty acids and cholesteryl esters. Small and variable amounts of paraffin hydrocarbons, triglycerides, and an unidentified lipid were noted. In a series of time – course experiments, epidermal lipids were labeled by intradermal injection of [1 - 14 C] acetate at varying times up to 21 days before removal of the epidermis. The hydrocarbons never acquired radioactivity, while the triglycerides retained label only for about 1 day after injection.

40|$|Surfaces {{submerged}} in marine environments rapidly get colonized by marine organisms, {{a process known}} as biofouling. Fouling costs maritime industries billions of dollars annually. The most common methods of combating marine biofouling are toxin containing antifouling coatings which often have detrimental non-target environmental effects. These effects and proposed bans on harmful substances in antifouling coatings, mandates development of more environmentally friendly antifouling technologies. Of these, foul-release coatings, which minimize attachment and adhesion of fouling organisms (rather than killing them) are promising alternatives. Here I explored the utility of <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes</b> as novel antifouling/foul-release coatings. I first investigated the responses of propagules (larvae or spores) of six common fouling organisms to wax coatings in the laboratory. A wide variation in the response of these different organisms, and in the different types of response (settlement, adhesion, etc.) by the same organism, was observed, but the most inhibitory coatings were those made from microcrystalline wax and silicone oil. However, in field trials in Sydney Harbour, paraffin waxes had the strongest antifouling performance, with activity up to one year (the trial duration). These waxes also had strong foul-release effects, with fouling that did attach mostly removed by a low pressure water jet. Composition of fouling communities on paraffin waxes differed significantly from other waxes or controls, with little or no hard fouling organisms (barnacles, bivalves) on paraffin. The mechanisms of antifouling and foul-release actions of paraffin waxes appear to be due to changes in surface properties. The surfaces of the paraffin waxes changed noticeably after 4 - 8 weeks immersion in the sea or in seawater aquaria. Antibiotic treatments showed that this change in surface appearance was due to biological (microbial) activity. Bacteria appear to remove the amorphous phase {{from the surface of the}} paraffin waxes, revealing an underlying crystalline phase, which is less affected by bacterial action. I suggest that these crystals form a microstructured ?bed of nails? of crystals of varying shapes and sizes which inhibit settlement and reduce adhesion strength of those organisms which do settle...|$|R

40|$|Films and {{coatings}} {{can improve}} the quality and shelf-life of food products by acting as barriers to e. g. water vapour and oxygen. Many edible biopolymer films, based on polysaccharides and proteins, form excellent oxygen barriers but most often provide only poor water vapour barriers. Lipids {{on the other hand}} are hydrophobic and can provide better water vapour barrier properties. Films with enhanced and tailored properties can be produced by combining the good gas barrier properties of hydrophilic biopolymers with the moisture resistance of more hydrophobic components. This work focused mainly on the water vapour barrier and release properties of films and coatings to gain a deeper understanding of how material properties can affect such properties. The effect on water vapour permeability and mechanical properties of starch films was evaluated after addition of an acetoglyceride and the effect on phase separation was determined after film formation at different temperatures. The water vapour permeability of starch films was decreased by addition of the acetoglyceride and by using higher drying temperature. Addition of the acetoglyceride had a weakening effect on the films, whereas the drying temperature showed no great effect on the mechanical properties. Mixed film-forming systems most often phase separate during film formation. The phase separation behaviour of a mixture of an acetylated high amylose maize starch and the maize protein zein was studied in real-time during cooling and during solvent evaporation. It was concluded that solvent evaporation had a greater impact than cooling on the phase separation, but both the solution temperature during cooling and the solution composition during solvent evaporation affected the phase separation. The concentrations of the two biopolymers in the solution had impact on the formed microstructures. Active components can be incorporated in biopolymer or lipid films and be used in release applications. The release of two preservatives and four sugars from films made from the protein kafirin into model foods with different water activity was evaluated. It was concluded that the water activity of the model food had a great impact on the release from the film and diffusion of released substances in the model food. Two hydrophobic <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes,</b> a petrolatum and a microcrystalline wax, with different water vapour barrier properties were investigated to gain a deeper understanding of inherent material properties that can affect the barrier properties.

40|$|Development of a {{profitable}} titanium industry for New Zealand {{will not come}} about without innovative technologies. Plastic injection moulding has long held a place in NZ manufacturing to produce large quantities of complex parts and holds the key to such innovation. Titanium metal parts were fabricated by injection moulding titanium based metal powder feedstock followed by a debinding process and subsequent sintering. The fabrication process in its entirety was investigated in four distinct steps. Feedstock formulation involved combining the metal powders with various carrier components. Injection moulding enabled the shaping of the feedstock into geometries approximating the final part. Debinding being the process whereby the carrier/binder system {{is removed from the}} part to create a powder compact retaining the required geometry. Sintering being the final step where the metal powders are consolidated into a fully dense metal part of net shape. The feedstock binder consisted of water soluble polyethylene glycol that reduced feedstock viscosity, improved particle wetting, aided greenpart shape retention and eliminated toxic solvents in debinding. Carnauba wax and bees wax aided dispersion, lubricated particles, were safe to handle and better for the environment (than <b>petroleum</b> <b>waxes).</b> Their low melt temperatures aided removal during thermal debinding and supported residue elimination. By optimising the ratio of water soluble, wax and polyolefin binder components (3 : 2 : 1 respectively) for melt flow and pellet formation, greenparts defect free with uniform particle distribution were made. The optimal binder system proved suitable for titanium alloy and irregular shape pure titanium powders (hydride-de-hydride). Increasing powder loading (wP = (0. 60 to 0. 65)) had no appreciable effect on viscosity while enabling feedstock with good uniformity and pellet formation. Dimensional change was not affected by uniformity of the feedstock however molecular weight, volume and dispersion of binder components affected interparticular distances. Low processing temperatures reduced disruption to part geometry, benefitted particle bonding and helped retain handling strength. The use of low temperatures for thermal debinding (t = 250 °C) enabled removal of the binder below the temperatures that facilitate interstitial diffusion and oxide/carbide formation, although part thickness, mass and overall volume effected the processing time. A strong correlation was seen between handling strength of the greenparts and defects, such as non-uniform density distribution and cracking after sintering. Sintering was essential to produce the final part and showed that a binder free brownpart was not the only criteria for eliminating impurities. The furnace atmosphere must remain free from contamination to eliminate transfer back to the parts. This was addressed using an argon sweep gas, however, the design and efficacy of the system was considered inadequate. Decomposition products need to be removed quickly from the furnace as they evolve before impurities from the sweep gas diffuse back into the parts during the extended duration at sinter temperatures (t = 1300 °C). The combination of an optimised titanium feedstock and the use of a low temperature thermal debinding technique produced a consolidated MIM part of relatively large dimensions. The parts were seen to have uniform microstructure throughout the cross-section with density comparable to that of MIM standards. In difference to the literature, a high powder loading (φp = 0. 65) of HDH powders was used and shown to be readily mouldable. The higher powder loading also eliminate separation defects and shape distortions evident using lower amounts of powder...|$|R
