Without wanting to put down all the <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E

Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many <b>people.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the {{south-west}} of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded {{meeting of}} white people in South Africa up to that time. [...] "I stand here before you", Kruger declared, [...] "called by the people. In {{the voice of the}} <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!" [...] He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the Vice-President of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.|$|E
500|$|Gagnon's {{fascination with}} Peru and the Asháninka [...] began after World War II, {{when he heard}} a bishop give a talk about them. He then worked for three years in a shoe factory and {{restaurant}} in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of the people that he served, [...] "They are the most virtuous <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever met. They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa." [...] He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.|$|E
500|$|Observing {{similarities}} between the character and herself, Rashad described Clair as [...] "a warm, loving mother"; the actress is also similar in both appearance and personality to Camille. Rashad's acting had always been more straight-faced to counter Cosby's humor, typically playing straight woman to Cosby's comedic antics. In preparation for the second season, Cosby decided to provide Rashad with more comedic material upon learning that the actress is [...] "capable of handling comedy on her own–without Cliff." [...] Jets Robert E. Johnson observed that Rashad portrays her character using [...] "soft, sophisticated humor". The sixth season episode [...] "Off to See the Wretched", in which Clair scolds Vanessa for traveling to Baltimore to see a rock concert against her parents' orders, features Rashad's most [...] "uncontrolled" [...] performance as the character. Speaking fondly of his co-star, Cosby said [...] "There's nobody whom I can be more thankful about than Phylicia." [...] In {{the aftermath of a}} highly publicized article originally published in TV Guide before the series premiered that labeled Cosby [...] "one of the most arrogant celebrities", Rashad took over the majority of the show's promotional appearances herself. Rashad also defended Cosby against the accusations, calling him [...] "one of the most intelligent <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever known. In addition to being a few years younger than Clair was originally intended to be, Rashad is only 10 years older than actress Sabrina LeBeauf, who portrays eldest child Sondra. Meanwhile, actress Ethel Ayler, who portrays Clair's mother Carrie, is only 14 years her senior. Originally, actress Clarice Taylor auditioned for the role of Carrie, deliberately making herself over in attempt to look young enough to play Rashad's mother before Cosby ultimately cast her as his own character's.|$|E

The ceremony was an amalgam of Hmong animist and Lao Buddhist beliefs. Air Attache Colonel Robert Tyrrell laid an American Distinguished Flying Cross on Lee Lue's coffin before his interment. Raven FACs stationed at Long Tieng also joined the ceremony. Karl Polifka stated, [...] "Lee Lue was one of only two <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shed tears over in my Air Force career."

2500|$|While {{religious}} and secular socialism gained some acceptance among Mormons, the church was more circumspect about Marxist Communism, because of its acceptance of violence {{as a means to}} achieve revolution.

2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong.

2500|$|In July 2004, an {{inventory}} of classified weapons data revealed that four hard disk drives were missing: [...] two of the drives were subsequently found to have been improperly moved to a different building, but another two remained unaccounted for. [...] In response, director Peter Nanos shut down {{large parts of the}} laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, [...] "This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to fire to make it stop". Nanos is also quoted as saying, [...] "If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared on a master list. Thus, auditors wrongly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, [...] "The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred". This incident is widely reported as contributing to continuing distrust of management at the lab. In May 2005, Nanos stepped down as director.|$|E

[...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone.
