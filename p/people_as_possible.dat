5|$|Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, expressing anxiety to {{his staff}} about the {{referendum}} the week before, was told about a small rally planned in Place du Canada in Montreal for businesspersons on October 27.

Tobin then encouraged fellow caucus members to send as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

50|$|Paintings of the Great West, many {{of which}} {{emphasized}} {{the sheer size of}} the land and the cultures of the native people living on it, became a distinct genre as well. George Catlin depicted the West and its <b>people</b> <b>as</b> honestly <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> George Caleb Bingham, and later Frederick Remington, Charles M. Russell, the photographer Edward S. Curtis, and others recorded the American Western heritage and the Old American West through their art.|$|R
60|$|The {{proceedings}} of Lord Howe soon showed {{the policy of}} these precautions. His lordship had prepared a declaration, addressed to the people at large, informing them of the powers vested in his brother and himself as commissioners for restoring peace. He sent a flag on shore, bearing a circular letter, written in his civil and military capacity, to the colonial governor, requesting him to publish his address to the <b>people</b> <b>as</b> widely <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|R
5|$|The local Norman {{population}} {{sought refuge}} in the castle {{to escape from the}} French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing {{the number of people in}} the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E

This operation constituted the fledgling airline's first major engagement. Initially, the repatriation airlift was undertaken by four Dakotas. On short journeys, the authorities granted Silver City dispensation to raise the limit on the maximum number of passengers it could carry from 28 to 52 to airlift <b>as</b> many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> quickly <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|R

50|$|The leiðangr was {{a system}} organising a coastal fleet {{with the aim}} of defence, coerced trade, plunderings, and {{aggressive}} wars. Normally, the fleet levy was on expeditions for two or three summer months. All free men were obliged to take part in or contribute to the leiðangr. All of the leiðangr was called to arms when invading forces threatened the land. In the expeditions, {{only a fraction of the}} ships were taking part, but as expeditions often were profitable, many magnates and chieftains tried to join with their <b>people</b> <b>as</b> often <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|R

[...] In subsequent years, other blended methods of payment have been proposed such as [...] "comprehensive care payment", [...] "comprehensive payment for comprehensive care", and [...] "complete chronic care" [...] which incorporate payment for keeping <b>people</b> <b>as</b> healthy <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in addition to payment for episodes of illness.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of the missionaries was to convert as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> They used education and medical missionary work to assist them. But they also published ridiculing and insulting material on native religion and practices. The popular deity Lord Murugan was specifically targeted. This started the backlash against Christian missionaries. Many early converts like C. W. Thamotharampillai and Carol Visvanathapillai came back to Hinduism. This also resulted in formation of many Hindu Schools and more political awareness for native Tamils. Today around 10% are Christians with Catholics forming 90% of the Christians in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|In response, the Republicans {{appealed to}} {{democratic}} principles. Samuel Smith of Maryland {{argued that the}} presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because {{it is possible to}} have the fifth best candidate become President otherwise. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the house, and the President is then {{much more likely to be}} the people’s choice. Another of Smith’s arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.|$|E

Their main objective is to obtain the best possible results and also to educate young people. They try to engage as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in various sporting activities.

25|$|Originally, WXP {{planned for}} The Fellowship {{to be an}} RPG, but they soon came to feel this might {{alienate}} potential players, and as they wanted to attract as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to the title, including people who had never read the books, they decided to develop the game as a third-person action-adventure instead. At the time, Frodo was the only controllable character, with {{the other members of}} the fellowship featuring as NPCs, although the player was to have the choice as to which character(s) to fight alongside at each point in the game. The developers were also working closely with Tolkien Enterprises to ensure any action sequences or enemies that moved beyond the immediate events of the novel kept with the general tone of the narrative and were true to the spirit of Tolkien's legendarium.|$|E

Welfare Centres and support networks were established throughout the city. Government Departments, such as WINZ and Housing New Zealand established contact with as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and provided grants and assistance. Many church and community-led projects also became established. The scale of the disaster meant many people went some days without official contact, so neighbourhoods and streets were encouraged to attend to those around them. Official visitation teams were organised by Civil Defence, with aim of visiting every household; the teams, which assessed homes and welfare needs, and passed on official information, included structural engineers or assessors from EQC. The primarily wilderness all-volunteer search and rescue organisation, LandSAR, deployed 530 people {{to the city to}} perform welfare checks.

25|$|Though Kurt Weill {{was not a}} vocal {{proponent of}} the Gebrauchsmusik {{movement}} in Germany, many of his works, including the music for Mahagonny, share many of its characteristics. Loosely defined, Gebrauchsmusik {{is the idea that}} music can be more than just pure music. For example, music that accompanies a silent film is perfectly respectable, so long as it is done well. Also, simple music to be performed by amateurs is also acceptable. Weill's musical setting of Mahagonny exemplifies many of these characteristics. In the first place, this is music composed for the stage and not for the concert hall, and Weill intentionally chose that so. He wished to make his music speak out to as many <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> so throughout his career his mostly wrote music for the stage, and all the while in Europe he was considered a real composer and not just some hack pandering to the playwright to make a living.|$|E
