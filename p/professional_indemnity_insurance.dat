40|$|Women {{entering}} the maternity arena in Australia and other Western regimes have suffered incidentally {{from what is}} known as the 2 ̆ 7 silo effect 2 ̆ 7. This refers to a clash between the training regimes of the 2 ̆ 7 old 2 ̆ 7 professionalism and the 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 professionalism. Under the 2 ̆ 7 old 2 ̆ 7 professionalism, hierarchies were erected between medicine and the so-called semi-professions such as nursing and social work (Tully and Mortlock 2004) resulting in what Degeling et al (1998; 2000) have documented as oppositional modes of decision-making, styles of working, roles and accountabilities. Within the last decade, a 2 ̆ 7 new professionalism 2 ̆ 7 has emerged in many Western regimes, including Canada, NZ, the UK and The Netherlands. (Romanow Report 2002; Street, Gannon and Holt 1991; Victorian Department of Human Services, Australia 2004) depicted by a flatter more egalitarian structure of multidisciplinarity [...] An example in Australia is the Future Directions in Maternity Care document released in mid 2004 by the Bracks Victorian Labor government. In Australia, the move towards the 2 ̆ 7 new professionalism 2 ̆ 7 can be attributed to a confluence of macro economic factors including the swing away from hospital-based training and towards university-based training for nurses and midwives, the ripple effects of three decades of feminism, the professionalisation of midwifery, the attrition of midwives from the workforce, the rise of health consumerism from the late 1980 s and the crippling costs of <b>professional</b> <b>indemnity</b> health <b>insurance</b> for obstetricians leading to a crisis in recruitment. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the consequences of}} parallel trade on health care systems in a two-country model with a vertical distributor relationship. In particular, two cost-sharing systems - coinsurance and <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> - are compared with respect to changes in copayments and public health expenditure. Under both cost-sharing systems, parallel trade generates a price-decreasing competition effect in the destination country and a price-increasing double marginalization effect in the source country. In the destination country, copayments for patients decrease to a larger extent under <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance,</b> whereas reductions of public health expenditure occur only under coinsurance. In the source country, copayments increase less under coinsurance, whereas health expenditure is reduced more under <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance.</b> This illustrates that a harmonization of health care systems would not make sense...|$|R
