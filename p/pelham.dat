5|$|The Battle of Pell's Point (October 18, 1776), {{also known}} as the Battle of <b>Pelham,</b> was a {{skirmish}} fought between British and American troops during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War. The conflict took place in what is now part of <b>Pelham</b> Bay Park in the Bronx, New York City the golf courses of Split Rock Golf Course & <b>Pelham</b> Bay Golf Course in The Bronx, New York City and the towns of <b>Pelham</b> Manor and <b>Pelham</b> in Westchester County, NY.|$|E
5|$|The Brook Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line would be reconstructed to allow a {{cross-platform}} interchange. Further north, {{there would be a}} connection with the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to <b>Pelham</b> Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the <b>Pelham</b> Line would terminate at Hunts Point Avenue one stop south.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{additional}} trains {{per hour}} {{would be able}} to operate on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line if the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line was connected to the Second Avenue Subway. Service would have been tripled on the <b>Pelham</b> Line.|$|E

5|$|The {{demands of}} {{managing}} the ranch consume all of Chetwin's time, leaving Wilton to feel neglected and unloved. One day, a traveler is injured near the ranch, whom she recognizes as <b>Pelham.</b> <b>Pelham</b> courts her, taking advantage of her loneliness. Although she admits she does not love him, he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him. As she is preparing to depart, she is confronted by Starlight, an Indian woman {{who works as a}} servant on the ranch, who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child. She spurns <b>Pelham</b> and returns to her family. Eventually, Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her. <b>Pelham</b> may have been killed by Starlight, although his ultimate fate is left unclear.|$|E
5|$|To provide {{service in}} the Bronx, the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line and IRT Dyre Avenue Line, served by Lexington Avenue trains, would be {{converted}} to B Division standards and connected to the Second Avenue line. IND Second Avenue Line trains would run east under 138th Street, then along the right-of-way of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor from 138th Street to a point near the Bruckner Expressway and Westchester Avenue as an express bypass of the <b>Pelham</b> line, after which the line would split into a <b>Pelham</b> branch and a Dyre Avenue branch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pelham's</b> premiership was {{relatively}} uneventful {{in terms of}} domestic affairs. In foreign affairs, Great Britain fought in several wars. Upon <b>Pelham's</b> death, his brother Newcastle took full control of the ministry.|$|R
50|$|During {{and after}} the Civil War <b>Pelham's</b> 1858 photograph, taken in the Mathew Brady studio, was {{well known in the}} South. While many copies were made, the {{original}} was long thought lost. It was held by <b>Pelham's</b> sister, Betty, and kept by her descendants at home in a fireproof safe. In 2010 <b>Pelham's</b> great-great grand-nephew consigned the piece for auction. It sold for $41,825.|$|R

5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the <b>Pelham</b> Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the <b>Pelham</b> Line. It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains via the line and it would also be possible to operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, {{which was}} now a popular hiking trail, started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and <b>Pelham</b> Parkway between Jerome Avenue and <b>Pelham</b> Bay Park.|$|E

5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} <b>Pelham</b> {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, <b>Pelham</b> and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. <b>Pelham</b> returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The Board of Estimate {{requested}} that the Board of Transportation evaluate a spur of the IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line to Throggs Neck in the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|The IRT <b>Pelham</b> Line {{would be}} rebuilt to {{accommodate}} the wider BMT-IND cars to operate via the Second Avenue Line. The connection would provide the <b>Pelham</b> Line with direct service to Sixth Avenue, Second Avenue and Brooklyn. The station platforms, and third rail {{would have had to}} be adjusted as they were put in place for the narrower IRT trains. However, the line was built with this conversion in mind. Westchester Yard would have been expanded {{to accommodate the}} additional trains added to the line. Since trains to the <b>Pelham</b> Line would no longer use the Lexington Avenue Line, there would be additional capacity for trains to run via the IRT White Plains Road Line and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Improved service on the <b>Pelham</b> Line was project to stimulate growth in the East Bronx areas served by the line. This area of the East Bronx was seen to have great potential for industrial growth and other areas suitable for development as residential and recreational areas.|$|E

5|$|As Highway58 {{had largely}} been {{replaced}} by Highway406, the central segment through Welland and <b>Pelham</b> was deemed to no longer serve long-distance traffic, and was downloaded to the Regional Municipality of Niagara on April1, 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} the Third Avenue El in the Bronx would be {{demolished}} and replaced with a new subway line under Park Avenue, parallel to the New Haven Line Metro-North tracks. The Park Avenue Subway would connect with the Second Avenue trunk line in the South Bronx, where trains from Park Avenue would merge onto the same tracks as trains from the Dyre Avenue and <b>Pelham</b> spurs. In the same borough, the MCTA would also extend the then now-IND <b>Pelham</b> Line to Co-op City. It would also lengthen the IND Concourse Line to White Plains Road, with {{a connection to the}} IRT White Plains Road Line at either Burke Avenue or Gun Hill Road.|$|E
50|$|Uses: Most {{commonly}} found on snaffles, quite rare on <b>pelhams</b> and gags. Usually seen in English disciplines. Not permitted in dressage competition.|$|R

5|$|Aware of Simonsohn's {{critical}} {{analyses of}} their earlier methods, <b>Pelham</b> and Mauricio published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, <b>Pelham,</b> Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Transport for London {{published}} outline proposals {{prepared by}} architects BuckleyGrayYeoman for a redevelopment {{of the buildings}} {{to the west of}} the station arcade and in Thurloe Street and space to the south of the station cutting on <b>Pelham</b> Street. The proposal includes bringing the disused northern platform back into use for eastbound trains, a new entrance to Thurloe Street, a reconfigured ticket hall and provision of step-free access throughout the station.|$|E
