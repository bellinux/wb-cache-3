5000|$|The LCD is 120×32 pixels and is {{controlled}} by six µPD7227 LCD controller ICs each responsible for 40×16 pixels of the LCD. The µPD7227 uses a serial protocol and has two memory banks for switching between rows 0-7 and 8-15. It features multiple modes, including [...] "Write", [...] "Read", [...] "AND", [...] "OR" [...] and [...] "Character". The [...] "character" [...] mode draws characters from a built-in character map.Each bank is 40 bytes with bit 6 of the address determining the bank {{and even though the}} address can be up to 127, nothing will happen when trying to access data outside the banks. If the <b>pointer</b> <b>action</b> in a command is set to decrement and the pointer is at 0, the pointer will wrap to 127.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system that}} enables the user to directly control the presentation in a more natural manner, either {{at a distance from}} the screen (using a laser pointer or shadow gestures), or at a distance from the computer (using a telescoping pointer). Figure 1 {{presents a}}n overview of the camera-projector system. The camera may be placed anywhere in the room such that its field of view contains the presentation area. The system first calibrates itself by exploiting knowledge of the projected image. Subsequently, computer-vision algorithms determine where the user is pointing on the presentation surface, and this provides a correspondence between the user's actions (as seen by the camera), and active regions in the image being displayed on the screen as illustrated in Figure 1. The presentation software performs programmed actions in response to the location and characteristics of the user's <b>pointer</b> <b>actions.</b> This enables users to activate "virtual buttons" on the projection screen simply by pointing, and also to "draw" directly on the presentation surface...|$|R

This series of research briefings is aimed at those practitioners. It addresses the need for practitioners to understand complex core concepts in ways that they can relate directly to their own practice and so use to improve the service they provide and their inter-professional practice. These combine short, concise and practical summaries of research and theory with <b>pointers</b> for <b>action.</b> Each briefing has links to useful resources that will inform practice and give practitioners more confidence in exercising their professional judgement...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} Geoff Tennant and Dave Harries {{report on the}} early stages of a {{research}} project looking to examine the transition from Key Stage (KS) 2 to 3 of children deemed Gifted and Talented (G&T) in mathematics. An examination of relevant literature points towards variation in definition of key terms and underlying rationale for activities. Preliminary fieldwork points towards a lack of meaningful communication between schools, with primary school teachers in particular left to themselves to decide how to work with children deemed G&T. Some <b>pointers</b> for <b>action</b> are given, along with ideas for future research and a request for colleagues interested in working with us to get in touch...|$|R

40|$|The {{teaching}} of computing, like all subjects, requires {{a range of}} strategies to take the curriculum content (skills, knowledge, understanding and attitudes) {{and put it in}} a form that is more easily digested by learners. Metaphor has a particular rôle in the world of computing in that: it is embedded in the design of computer hardware and software; it is part of human computer interface and it underpins important facilities such as icons, <b>pointer</b> <b>actions</b> and window displays. It is proposed that metaphor plays an important rôle in the pedagogic content knowledge (PCK) of computing teachers. The research adopts a grounded theory approach using text analysis software to record and process a range of documents, statements, interview transcripts and text book analyses. The study is underpinned by consideration of pedagogic content knowledge. The major data source are reflections and reports of experienced and successful computer teachers working at post- 16 level (grades 12 - 13) in 20 south-of-England schools and colleges. It is proposed that metaphor usage can be divided into many distinct forms. The most easily recognised metaphor is the narrative theme where an object, function or system is described in the clothes of another, more familiar object, function or system. The other approaches with a metaphoric nature identified are algorithm, model, rôle play and diagram. In contrast to metaphoric, it has been identified that approaches are also based upon literal teaching. The outcomes of the research reveal a new perspective upon the pedagogic content knowledge with respect to the {{teaching of}} computing in post-compulsory education. A model of approaches that identifies the key areas and emphasises the rôle metaphor plays in both the teaching strategies and the subject knowledge of computing, is presented. Different practices are described, compared and presented in a form that will help practising and pre-service teachers identify their own preferred approach or approaches. Future research is proposed to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of particular metaphoric strategies. In particular, the rôle non-literal teaching approaches can make in enabling younger pupils to understand the principles of computing and how non-literal approaches can be used to ensure students are more motivated in their studies will be made.

5000|$|The {{variety of}} values that can be encoded within a control table is largely {{dependent}} upon the computer language used. Assembly language provides the widest scope for data types including (for the actions), the option of directly executable machine code. Typically a control table will contain values for each possible matching class of input together with a corresponding <b>pointer</b> to an <b>action</b> subroutine. Some languages claim not to support pointers (directly) but nevertheless can instead support an index {{which can be used}} to represent a 'relative subroutine number' to perform conditional execution, controlled by the value in the table entry (e.g. for use in an optimized SWITCH statement - designed with zero gaps (i.e. a multiway branch) [...] ).|$|R
40|$|Neurophysiological data {{indicate}} that the reachable peripersonal space and the unreachable extrapersonal space are represented in segregated parieto-frontal circuits and that when the unreachable space becomes reachable because of tool use, it is automatically coded by the network selective for peripersonal space. Here we directly tested the role of action’s consequences in space coding. Thirty-eight participants bisected lines at either a reachable distance (60 cms) or unreachable distance (120 cms) using either a laser pointer or laser cutter. The laser cutter but not the laser <b>pointer</b> had an <b>action</b> consequence; the line broke into two pieces. The results showed that distance moderated the effect of action. At an unreachable distance, the mean bisection point was closer to the center when participants used the laser cutter compared to when they used the laser pointer. There were no differences at a reachable distance (60 cms). This result suggests that the space {{in which the individual}} may determine a physical consequence is categorized as peripersonal space, independently from its actual distance from the individual’s bod...|$|R
