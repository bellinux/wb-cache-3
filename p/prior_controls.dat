40|$|Abstract This study investigates variational image segmen-tation with an {{original}} data term, {{referred to as}} statistical overlap prior, which measures the conformity of overlap be-tween the nonparametric distributions of image data within the segmentation regions to a learned statistical description. This leads to image segmentation and distribution track-ing algorithms that relax the assumption of minimal over-lap and, as such, are more widely applicable than existing algorithms. We propose to minimize active curve function-als containing the proposed overlap prior, compute the cor-responding Euler-Lagrange curve evolution equations, and give an interpretation of how the overlap <b>prior</b> <b>controls</b> such evolution. We model the overlap, measured via the Bhat-tacharyya coefficient, with a Gaussian prior whose parame-ters are estimated from a set of relevant training images. Quantitative and comparative performance evaluations of the proposed algorithms over several experiments demon-strate {{the positive effects of}} the overlap prior in regard to segmentation accuracy and convergence speed...|$|E
40|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} complex (PDHC) deficiency is an {{inborn error}} of metabolism that occurs most commonly due to mutations in the X-linked E 1 α subunit gene (PDHA 1). We report a novel duplication of PDHA 1 {{associated with a}} mild phenotype in a 15 -year-old boy who was diagnosed with PDHC deficiency at 4 years of age following a history of seizures and lactic acidosis. The novel c. 1087 - 1119 mutation in exon 11 resulted in an in-frame duplication of 11 amino acids. Measurements of PDHC activity in cultured skin fibroblasts were low, corresponding to 18. 6 and 11. 6 % of the mean with respect to <b>prior</b> <b>controls,</b> whereas the E 1 PDH component was absent. He has borderline intellectual functioning and maintains normal lactate levels on a ketogenic diet in between relapses due to illness. Review of the literature reveals wide variation of clinical phenotype in patients with mutations of the E 1 α subunit gene (PDHA 1). There {{appears to be a}} higher incidence of normal or borderline intellectual ability in individuals who have insertions or deletions that are in-frame versus those that are out-of-frame. Furthermore, there is no correlation between mean residual PDH activity and phenotype in these patients. © 2014 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the philosophy, {{design and implementation}} of a graduate-level course entitled "Bio-Systems Modeling and Control", taught {{for the first time}} at FAU in Spring 2004. The course, unlike similar courses in some Biomedical Engineering programs, is aimed at engineering students who may have no <b>prior</b> <b>Controls</b> or Biology background. The majority of biological and physiological control systems are nonlinear and the control is often accomplished parametrically. Therefore topics selection for the course and their order of delivery pose an educational challenge. The course strongly emphasizes dynamic simulations, initially in Matlab ® and Simulink ® environments, and later on, a case is made for supplementing it with Dymola ® and Modelica ® environments. There is a need to synchronize the simulation activities and tutorial examples with the evolving theory contents of the course, which has an impact on the topics order. Via focusing, in more depth, on the various course topics, the paper outlines specific new concepts that were delivered. These are substantiated by selected homework project assignments. The course started with the Population Dynamics models. These basic intuitive models formed a good start to convey what Modeling in general is. It also served as a starting point for introduction of the simulation software tools and some of their basic principles.

40|$|Bayesian {{modelling}} is {{a natural}} fit for tasks in computational linguistics, since it can provide interpretable structures, useful <b>prior</b> <b>controls,</b> and coherent management of uncertainty. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable for many models of practical interest. Developing both accurate and efficient approximate Bayesian inference algorithms remains a fundamental challenge, especially for the field of computational linguistics where datasets are large and growing and models consist of complex latent structures. Collapsed variational inference (CVI) is an important milestone that combines the efficiency of variational inference (VI) and the accuracy of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Teh et al., 2006). However, its previous applications were limited to bag-of-words models whose hidden variables are conditionally independent given the parameters, whereas in computational linguistics, the hidden variable dependencies are crucial for modelling the underlying syntactic and semantic relations. To enlarge the application domain of CVI {{as well as to}} address the above Bayesian inference challenge, we investigate the applications of collapsed variational inference to computational linguistics. In this thesis, our contributions are three-fold. First, we solve a number of inference challenges arising from the hidden variable dependencies and derive a set of new CVI algorithms for the two ubiquitous and foundational models in computational linguistics, namely hidden Markov models (HMMs) and probabilistic context free grammars. We also propose CVI for hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) HMMs that are Bayesian nonparametric extensions of HMMs. Second, along the way we propose a set of novel algorithmic techniques, which are generally applicable {{to a wide variety of}} probabilistic graphical models in the conjugate exponential family and computational linguistic models using non-conjugate HDP constructions. Therefore, our work represents one step in bridging the gap between increasingly richer Bayesian models in computational linguistics and recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference. Third, we empirically evaluate our proposed CVI algorithms and their stochastic versions in a range of computational linguistic tasks, such as part-of-speech induction, grammar induction and many others. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that, using our techniques for handling the hidden variable dependencies, the empirical advantages of both VI and MCMC can be combined in a much larger domain of CVI applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is an optimization technique for applications like control or scheduling problems. It {{is used in}} learning situations, where success and failure of the system are the only training information. Unfortunately, {{we have to pay}} a price for this powerful ability: long training times and the instability of the learning process are not tolerable for industrial applications with large continuous state spaces. From our point of view, the integration of prior knowledge is a key mechanism for making autonomous learning practicable for industrial applications. The learning control architecture Fynesse provides a uni ed view onto the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge in the reinforcement learning framework. In this way, other approaches in this area can be interpreted as special cases of Fynesse. The key features of Fynesse are (1) the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge like linear controllers, control characteristics or fuzzy controllers, (2) autonomous learning of control strategies and (3) the interpretation of learned strategies in terms of fuzzy control rules.

This increase subsequently reverses on cessation of steroid dosage.

These phenomena appeared to be common to many corticosteroids (Collins et a!., 1963). These reports were consistent with the fact that adrenal steroids not only inhibit the entry of endogenous calcium into the bone, enhance calcium secretion into the gastrointestinal tract but also promote the resorption of recently in-corporated calcium from bone. They confirmed the conclusions (Milhaud et at., 1960) in the rat that cortisone slowed the rates of calcium fixation in bone, diminished intestinal absorption and in-creased secretion. In previous studies (Garrett et at., 1963) the analog computer was used to fit a basic model to the Ca 47 blood level data.

The other limitation was related to the general propensity of Iranian students towards text-based materials which may affect the way they interact with the task-based materials. Besides, if videotaping was used as an instrument for data collection, a better tacking of behavioral level of engagement could be achieved. Task engagement and individual regulation of the tasks in educational setting are potentially interesting for further research.|$|R

In experiments it is shown that the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge reduces the number of interactions with the process dramatically.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess safety and {{efficacy}} of thrombolysis in the setting of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control as it compares to standard BP control or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) between 2004 - 2011. We compared the outcomes of patients treated with tPA for AIS who required aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis to those requiring standard or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. The primary outcome of interest was safety, defined by all grades of hemorrhagic transformation and neurologic deterioration. The secondary outcome was efficacy, determined by functional status at discharge, and in-hospital deaths. Results: Of 427 patients included in the analysis, 89 received aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis, 65 received standard BP control, and 273 required no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Patients requiring BP control had more severe strokes, with median arrival National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 10 (IQR [6 - 17]) in patients not requiring BP control versus 11 (IQR [5 - 16]) and 13 (IQR [7 - 20]) in patients requiring standard and aggressive BP lowering therapies, respectively (p= 0. 048). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusting for baseline differences, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between the three groups (P> 0. 10). Conclusion: We observed no association between BP control and adverse outcomes in ischemic stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis. However, additional study is necessary to confirm or refute the safety of aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis...|$|R
