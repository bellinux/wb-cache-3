40|$|This study aims {{to find a}} new {{perspective}} for interpretation in cases where the judgments of the international courts (in particular the European Court of Human Rights) are contradictory or create uncertainty, so that they cannot be effectively considered when judging. It is known that the national judge must take into account the judgments of the Strasbourg Court to prevent a possible condemnation of the Romanian state, but when the conventional block is not unitary, we need to find a benchmark that helps us correctly solve the case. We believe that, in these circumstances, relying on the principles of law is necessary, and the principle of trust in justice can be a new, determining factor, in choosing a concrete legal solution. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness this interpretation, a practical case will also be analysed, on the basis of which the implications of such a method can be highlighted. Moreover, the principle of trust in judgments could be used in other cases similar to the practical situation presented and could become a concrete way of interpretation in <b>cases</b> of <b>case</b> <b>law</b> <b>overruling</b> or <b>case</b> <b>law</b> uncertainties, so that the individual’s rights are not injured...|$|R

40|$|The <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of European Union <b>law.</b> However, <b>case</b> <b>law’s</b> role in EU law is not uniform. By empirically studying how the Court uses its own <b>case</b> <b>law</b> as a source of law, we explore the correlation between, on the one hand, the characteristics of a CJEU case— type of action, actors involved, and area of law—and, on the other hand, the judgment’s “embeddedness” in <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and value as a precedent in subsequent cases. Using this approach, we test, confirm, and debunk existing scholarship concerning the role of CJEU <b>case</b> <b>law</b> as a source of EU law. We offer the following conclusions: that CJEU <b>case</b> <b>law</b> cannot be treated as a single entity; that only a limited number of factors reliably affect a judgment’s persuasive or precedential power; that the Court’s use of its own <b>case</b> <b>law</b> as a source of law is particularly limited in successful infringement proceedings; that <b>case</b> <b>law</b> is particularly important in preliminary references—especially those concerning fundamental freedoms and competition law; and that initiating Member State and the number of observations affects the behavior of the Court. ...|$|R
40|$|The ne bis in idem-principle {{was founded}} in 1984 and is found in article 4 of the seventh {{additional}} protocol of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The interpretation of the principle has been uncertain, {{which resulted in a}} harmonization of all <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> on the subject in the Zolotukhin case. The case concerns a Russian citizen who brought his girlfriend onto a Russian military base while being drunk. This action resulted in an administrative proceeding and a criminal proceeding. The Swedish and Norwegian tax systems concerning tax surcharge and tax fraud are very alike and both countries adapt a dual court system. The differences concerning the interpretation are found in four cases from 2009 and 2010, two from the Norwegian Supreme Court, one from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court and one from the Swedish Supreme Court. Even though there are similarities in the argumentations in the cases there are also different approaches concerning how to interpret the principle. The Norwegian Supreme Court bases its judgements, especially in the second one after the Zolotukhin case, on the prerequisites established by the European Court of Human Rights and the purpose of the principle. The Swedish Supreme Court and the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court bases the judgements on <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and refers to the uncertain judicial area and affirms that there is room for interpretation for the national courts.

40|$|This Comment critiques the D. C.

In order to address this legal conflict, the United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on two separate questions regarding equal protection and the right of marriage: 1) are states that have same-sex marriage bans required to recognize legal marriage licenses from other states; and 2) is marriage a fundamental right that should be extended to same-sex couples?
