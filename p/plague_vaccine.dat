25|$|For a time, the {{black-footed ferret}} was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s. During {{the early years of}} predator control, black-footed ferret carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with <b>plague</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Inbreeding depression may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation. Canine distemper devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A live virus vaccine originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{infection}} by Yersinia pestis causes pneumonic plague, {{a rapidly}} progressing and often fatal disease. To aid {{the development of}} safe and effective pneumonic <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines,</b> we are deciphering mechanisms used by the immune system to protect against lethal pulmonary Y. pestis infection. In murine pneumonic plague models, passive transfer of convalescent-phase sera confers protection, as does active vaccination with live Y. pestis. Here, we demonstrate that protection by either protocol relies upon both gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokines classically associated with type 1 cellular immunity. In both protocols, abrogating IFN-γ or TNF-α activity significantly decreases survival and increases the bacterial burden in pulmonary, splenic, and hepatic tissues. Neutralization of either cytokine also counteracts challenge-induced, vaccination-dependent upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS 2). Moreover, genetic depletion of NOS 2 suppresses protection conferred by serotherapy. We conclude that IFN-γ, TNF-α, and NOS 2, key elements of cellular immunity, perform critical protective functions during humoral defense against lethal pulmonary Y. pestis challenge. These observations strongly suggest that <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines</b> should strive to maximally prime both cellular and humoral immunity...|$|R

40|$|Plague is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} gram-negative bacteria Yersinia pestis, which, as a rule, is transmitted to humans from septicemic rodents by the bites of infected fleas. This microbe killed {{more people than}} all of the wars in the human history. Y. pestis circulation in the natural plague foci is ensured by the whole number of pathogenicity factors with differing functional orientation. This review is devoted to one of them, Y. pestis capsular antigen (F 1 or Caf 1). The history of its discovery and studying of its genetic control, biosynthesis, isolation and purification, and physicochemical properties are reviewed. Its roles in plague pathogenesis and its application as a main component of <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines</b> are also discussed. Y. pestis capsule under light microscopy is visually amorphous, while high-resolution electron microscopy displays the structure formed from separate fimbria-like cords up to 200 nm long, diverging from the bacterial surface in different directions. At 37 ° C Y. pestis produce 800 – 1000 times more capsular antigen than at 28 ° C. Genes coding for 17. 6 -kD Caf 1 protein, which contains 170 amino acids, are located in caf 1 operon of pFra plasmid. Analysis of caf 1 operon nucleotide sequence testified its close phylogenetic relationship with the gene clusters coding for pilus adhesins that were secreted with the help of chaperone/usher systems in enterobacteria including six additional adhesins in Y. pestis. Y. pestis multiplication within macrophages is the obligatory stage of plague pathogenesis, and the plague pathogen virulence correlates not with resistance to phagocyte ingesting but with bacterial ability to survive and multiply within phagolysosomes of phagocytes due to neutralization of antibacterial functions of eukaryotic cells. The capsule formed out of the Caf 1 aggregates protects Y. pestis from ingestion by na ï ve host’s phagocytes and prevents from initiation of the alternative pathway of the complement system. Molecular usher Caf 1 A responsible for capsular antigen anchoring on the surface of bacterial cell has a high affinity to human interleukin 1 β. Caf 1 can compete with interleukins 1 α, 1 β, and 1 ra in binding to receptors on lymphoid cells preventing development of adequate immune response. Immunodiagnosis of plague is based on detection of Caf 1 or anti-Caf 1 antibodies since this Y. pestis antigen is species specific. Covering bacterial surfaces capsular antigen is also the paramount component of all modern <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Its leading role in induction of intense immunity in mice, rats, monkeys, and men was shown clearly. However, non-capsulated (Caf 1 –) variants of Y. pestis keeping their virulence {{at the level of the}} wild-type strains might be selected and accumulated in immune animals.

50|$|The {{disease is}} caused by a {{bacterium}} usually transmitted by the bite of fleas from an infected host, often a black rat. The bacteria are transferred from the blood of infected rats to the rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopsis). The bacillus multiplies in the stomach of the flea, blocking it. When the flea next bites a mammal, the consumed blood is regurgitated along with the bacillus into the bloodstream of the bitten animal. Any serious outbreak of plague in humans is preceded by an outbreak in the rodent population. During the outbreak, infected fleas that have lost their normal rodent hosts seek other sources of blood. The bacterium that causes this disease, Yersinia pestis, was named after Yersin. His discoveries led in time to modern treatment methods, including insecticides, the use of antibiotics and eventually <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines.</b>|$|R

A significant advance of the past decade has been the elucidation of the genomes, proteomes and transcriptomes of many pathogens. This information provides the foundation for new 21 st Century approaches to identify target antigens for the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests.

The Bombay plague has been seen as a watershed in the history of epidemics in modern India.

In September 1896, plague broke out in the Mandvi region of Bombay and soon spread to other parts, killing thousands of people.

40|$|LcrV of Yersinia pestis {{is a major}} {{protective}} antigen {{proposed for}} inclusion in subunit <b>plague</b> <b>vaccines.</b> One way that anti-LcrV antibody is thought to protect is by inhibiting the delivery of toxins called Yops to host cells. The present study characterizes the relation between this inhibition and the phagocytosis of the bacteria. J 774 A. 1 cells were infected with Y. pestis KIM 5 {{in the presence of}} a protective polyclonal anti-LcrV antibody or a nonprotective polyclonal anti-YopM antibody, and delivery of YopH and YopE into the cytoplasm was assayed by immunoblotting. The ability to inhibit the delivery of these Yops depended upon having antibody bound to the cell surface; blocking conditions that prevented the binding of antibody to Fc receptors prevented the inhibition of Yop delivery. Anti-LcrV antibody also promoted phagocytosis of the yersiniae, whereas F(ab′) 2 fragments did not. Further, anti-LcrV antibody could not inhibit the delivery of Yops into cells that were unable to phagocytose due to the presence of cytochalasin D. However, Yops were produced only by extracellular yersiniae. We hypothesize that anti-LcrV antibody does not directly inhibit Yop delivery but instead causes phagocytosis, with consequent inhibition of Yop protein production in the intracellular yersiniae. The prophagocytic effect of anti-LcrV antibody extended to mouse polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in vitro, and PMNs were shown to be critical for protection: when PMNs in mice were ablated, the mice lost all ability to be protected by anti-LcrV antibody...|$|R

The NH 2 -terminal b-strand of F 1 was transplanted to the COOH-terminus and the sequence flanking the b-strand was duplicated to eliminate polymerization but to retain the T cell epitopes.

Earlier work reported that antibodies against Y. pestis LcrV cannot block type III injection by Yersinia enterocolitica strains and suggested that lcrV polymorphisms may provide for escape from LcrV-mediated plague immunity. We show here that polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies raised against Y. pestis KIM D 27 LcrV (LcrVD 27) bind LcrV from Y. enterocolitica O: 9 strain W 22703 (LcrVW 22703) or O: 8 strain WA- 314 (LcrVWA- 314) but are otherwise unable to block type III injection by Y. enterocolitica strains. Replacing the lcrV gene on the pCD 1 virulence plasmid of Y. pestis KIM D 27 with either lcrVW 22703 or lcrVWA- 314 does not affect the ability of plague bacteria to secrete proteins via the type III pathway, to inject Yops into macrophages, or to cause lethal plague infections in mice.
