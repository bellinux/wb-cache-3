50|$|On 1 March 2001, the Tevatron <b>Proton-antiproton</b> (p) <b>collider</b> at Fermilab near Chicago {{commenced}} its run 2. After run 1 (1992-1996), {{in which}} the collider had discovered the top quark, Tevatron had shut down for significant upgrades focused on improving the potential for finding the Higgs boson; the energies of the protons and antiprotons was bumped up to , {{and the number of}} collisions per second was increased by an order of magnitude (with further increases planned as the run continued). Even with the upgrades Tevatron was not guaranteed to find the Higgs. If the Higgs were too heavy (>), then the collisions would not have enough energy to produce a Higgs boson. If it were too light (<), then the Higgs would predominantly decay to pairs of bottom quarks—a signal that would be swamped by background events, and the Tevatron would not produce enough collisions to filter out the statistics. Nonetheless, the Tevatron was at the time the only operational particle collider that was sufficiently powerful to be capable of seeking the Higgs particle at the time.|$|R

The measurement sample, recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), corresponds to 9. 4 fb- 1 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions at a center-of-momentum energy of 1. 96 TeV, and is the full CDF Run II data set. The value of sin 2 ?efflept is found to be 0. 23248 ± 0. 00053. The combination with the previous CDF measurement based on ?+?- pairs yields sin 2 ?efflept= 0. 23221 ± 0. 00046. This result, when interpreted within the specified context of the standard model assuming sin 2 ?W= 1 -MW 2 /MZ 2 and that the W- and Z-boson masses are on-shell, yields sin 2 ?W= 0. 22400 ± 0. 00045, or equivalently a W-boson mass of 80. 328 ± 0. 024 GeV/c 2. © 2016 American Physical Society...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, the {{discovery}} of neutral currents in the Gargamelle experiment at CERN triggered Carlo Rubbia and collaborators proposal for a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider.</b> In 1978 the project was approved by CERN Council, and the first collisions occurred in July 1981. The first run lasted until 1986, and after a substantial upgrade it continued operation from 1987 to 1991. The collider was shut {{down at the end}} of 1991, as it was no longer competitive with the 1,5 TeV <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> at Fermilab, which had been in operation since 1987.|$|E
50|$|The first {{proposal}} for a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> {{seems to have been}} made by Gersh Budker and Skrinskij at Orsay in 1966, based on Budkers new idea of electron cooling. In 1972 Simon van der Meer published the theory of stochastic cooling, for which he later received the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics. The theory was confirmed in the Intersecting Storage Rings at CERN in 1974. While electron cooling might have led {{to the idea of a}} <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider,</b> it was eventually stochastic cooling that was used in the preaccelerators to prepare antiprotons for the SpS.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} was invented and applied at the Intersecting Storage Rings, {{and later the}} Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland by Simon van der Meer, a physicist from the Netherlands. It was used to collect and cool antiprotons — these particles were injected into the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider,</b> a modification of the SPS, with counter-rotating protons and collided at a particle physics experiment. For this work, van der Meer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984. He shared this prize with Carlo Rubbia of Italy, who proposed the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider.</b> This experiment discovered the W and Z bosons, fundamental particles that carry the weak nuclear force.|$|E
50|$|Last but not {{the least}} was the Nobel Prize-winning idea behind {{stochastic}} cooling {{and the application of}} that at CERN in the late 1970s and 1980s, specifically in the Antiproton Accumulator, which supplied antiprotons to the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider.</b>|$|E
5000|$|UA8 {{experiment}} was a high-energy physics experiment at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> at CERN. The {{proposal for the}} {{experiment was}} done by physicists at the University of California, and it was approved in April 1985. Its spokesperson was Peter Schlein.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (also {{known as}} the Super Proton-Antiproton Synchrotron, or SpS) was a {{particle}} accelerator that operated at CERN from 1981 to 1991. To operate as a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) underwent substantial modifications, altering it from a one beam synchrotron to a two-beam collider. The main experiments at the accelerator were UA1 and UA2, where the W and Z boson were discovered in 1983. Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer received the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for their decisive contribution to the SpS-project, {{which led to the}} discovery of the W and Z bosons. Other experiments conducted at the SpS were UA4, UA5 and UA8.|$|E
5000|$|For {{five years}} from 1977 he was on leave from his duties at Cambridge, based again at CERN, where he functioned as the {{spokesperson}} for the UA5 collaboration. The UA5 experiment searched for Centauro events at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider,</b> a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron.|$|E
50|$|The UA5 {{experiment}} {{was the first}} experiment conducted at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (SpS), a collider using the infrastructure of the Super Proton Synchrotron. The {{experiment was}} approved in February 1979, as a collaboration between Bonn, Brussels, Cambridge, Stockholm and CERN. The spokesperson of the UA5 collaboration was John Rushbrooke.|$|E
50|$|UA4 {{experiment}} (COULOMB) was a high-energy physics experiment at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> at CERN. The UA4 collaboration {{consisted of}} physicists from Amsterdam, Genova, Napoli, Pisa, Roma, California and CERN. UA4 was approved on 18 January 1979, {{and the first}} phase of data taking lasted until 17 June 1985. The spokesperson of UA4 was Giorgi Matthiae.|$|E
50|$|Wyatt's conducts {{research}} in particle physics {{primarily on the}} DØ experiment at the Tevatron <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> in Fermilab and on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider proton-proton collider in CERN. He {{was one of three}} short-listed candidates for the position of CERN Director General in 2014, with Fabiola Gianotti and Frank Linde.|$|E
50|$|Isgur {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of the CHEER project, this envisaged an {{electron}} ring to be built at Fermilab by a Canadian group to study electron-proton collisions. CHEER was not funded, in favor of the Tevatron <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider,</b> but led to a strong Canadian involvement in the ZEUS experiment at the HERA electron-proton collider in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} the LEP {{experiments}} allowed precise values of many quantities of the Standard Model—most importantly {{the mass of the}} Z boson and the W boson (which were discovered in 1983 at an earlier CERN collider, the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider)</b> to be obtained—and so confirm the Model and put it on a solid basis of empirical data.|$|E
50|$|From 1981 to 1991, the SPS {{operated}} as a hadron (more precisely, <b>proton-antiproton)</b> <b>collider</b> (as such it {{was called}} SpS), when its beams provided {{the data for the}} UA1 and UA2 experiments, which resulted in the discovery of the W and Z bosons. These discoveries and a new technique for cooling particles led to a Nobel Prize for Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of the UA4 experiment was to measure the antiproton-proton cross-section, {{in order to show}} that cross-sections rising with energy are true a characteristic of strong interaction. One had previously measured proton-antiproton cross-sections at the Intersecting Storage Rings, but as the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> — a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron — began operating, the measurements could be done in a new energy range: up to 540 GeV center-of-mass energy.|$|E
5000|$|They built a large {{universal}} detector, {{aimed at}} investigating phenomena at the world's highest energy collisions, which {{were obtained from}} 1981 onwards, when the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron was converted into a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider,</b> as suggested by Rubbia, using the stochastic beam cooling technique devised by Simon van der Meer. The UK groups had joint responsibility for designing, constructing and operating a large hadron calorimeter and also a trigger processor.|$|E
50|$|Around 1968 Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam came up {{with the}} electroweak theory, which unified {{electromagnetism}} and weak interactions, and for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. The theory postulated the existence of W and Z bosons, and the pressure on the research community to prove the existence of these particles experimentally was substantial. During the 70s it was established that the masses of the W and Z bosons were in the range of 60 to 80 GeV (W boson) and 75 to 92 GeV (Z boson) — energies too large to be accessible by any accelerator in operation at that time. In 1976, Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline proposed to modify a proton accelerator — at that time proton accelerators were under construction both at Fermilab and at CERN (SPS) — into a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider,</b> able to reach energies large enough to produce W and Z bosons. The proposal was adopted at CERN in 1976, and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) was modified to occasionally operate as a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> (SpS).|$|E
5000|$|The BTeV Collaboration was a {{group of}} about 170 {{physicists}} drawn from more than 30 universities and physics institutes from Belarus, Canada, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States of America. The BTeV experiment was designed to utilize the Tevatron <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, located in the far west suburbs of Chicago, Illinois in the USA. The experiment was scheduled to start in 2006, followed by commissioning in 2008, and data-taking in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 {{with his}} student, S. Leone, he {{developed}} {{the study of the}} asymmetry in production and decay of the W-boson at the Tevatron <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider.</b> W bosons are predominantly produced in collisions of valence quarks; therefore, one can determine the kinematic properties of the up and down quarks in the proton and antiproton from the observation of W production. By analyzing the relative difference in the production of W+ and W&minus; particles, one can substantially reduce the effects of systematic uncertainties in the experimental device.|$|E
50|$|After a {{few years}} at CERN as visiting {{physicist}} and CERN fellow, Darriulat was offered a tenure position in 1971. For six years {{he was a member}} of the research group of Carlo Rubbia, that made essential contributions to the physics of CP violation in the neutral kaon sector. He then took part in experiments conducted at the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) — the world’s first hadron collider. Using his experience from the ISR, Darriulat and collaborators proposed the UA2 experiment in 1978 at the commissioned <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> — a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron. Darriulat acted as the spokesperson for the experiment from 1981 to 1986. In 1983 the UA2 collaboration, together with the UA1 collaboration, discovered the W and Z boson, an important milestone in modern particle physics, as it confirmed the electroweak theory. The discovery led to the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer for their decisive contributions to the design and construction of the <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider.</b> Prior to the discovery the UA2 collaboration made the first observation of emission of quarks and gluons in the form of hadronic jet - an important experimental support of the theory of quantum chromodynamics.|$|E
50|$|Peoples joined Fermilab as a {{physicist}} in 1971, eventually becoming {{head of the}} Proton Area. In 1981, Peoples became project manager of Tevatron I, which transformed the Tevatron from a fixed target accelerator to a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider,</b> and oversaw {{the construction of the}} Antiproton Source. Peoples left Fermilab briefly from 1987 to 1988 to assist the Central Design Group for the Superconducting Super Collider at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. When he returned to Fermilab in the fall of 1988, he became deputy director of the lab. After Leon M. Lederman stepped down from the Fermilab directorship, Peoples became director on July 1, 1989.|$|E
5000|$|The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), a {{circular}} accelerator with {{a diameter of}} 2 kilometres built in a tunnel, which started operation in 1976. It was designed to deliver an energy of 300 GeV and was gradually upgraded to 450 GeV. As well as having its own beamlines for fixed-target experiments (currently COMPASS and NA62), it has been operated as a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> (the SpS collider), and for accelerating high energy electrons and positrons which were injected into the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP). Since 2008, {{it has been used}} to inject protons and heavy ions into the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his Ph.D. at Imperial College London, on an experiment {{conducted at the}} Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California, he joined CERN in 1979 as a Fellow of the Experimental Physics Division. Virdee’s early scientific career (1979-1984) involved verifying the strange notion that the “quarks” (the constituents of the protons the neutrons and all other hadrons) carry fractional electric charge. This was successfully demonstrated by the NA14 photoproduction experiment at CERN in the mid-eighties. Following NA14 he joined the UA1 experiment at CERN's <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> (SPS) where his interest in high-performance calorimetry was developed, leading to his invention of a novel technique of collecting light in plastic scintillator-based calorimeters.|$|E
50|$|The Fermilab Tevatron has a {{ring with}} a beam path of 4 mi. It has {{received}} several upgrades, and has {{functioned as a}} <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> until it was shut down due to budget cuts on September 30, 2011. The largest circular accelerator ever built was the LEP synchrotron at CERN with a circumference 26.6 kilometers, which was an electron/positron collider. It achieved an energy of 209 GeV before it was dismantled in 2000 so that the underground tunnel {{could be used for}} the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is a proton collider, and currently the world's largest and highest-energy accelerator, achieving 6.5 TeV energy per beam (13 TeV in total).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the observation of the intermediate vector mesons, the CERN <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> dominated the scene of high energy physics from its first operation in 1981 until its close in 1991, when the Tevatron at Fermilab took over this role. An entirely new phenomenology of high energy collisions has resulted, in which strong interaction phenomena are dominated by the exchange of the quanta of the strong force, the gluons, particles which {{are similar to the}} intermediate vector bosons, although, like the photons, they are apparently massless. Instead, the W and Z particles are among the heaviest particles so far produced in a particle accelerator.|$|E
50|$|The UA1 {{experiment}} (an abbreviation of Underground Area 1) was a high-energy physics {{experiment that}} ran at CERN's <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (SpS), {{a modification of}} the one-beam Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The data was recorded between 1981 and 1990. The joint discovery of the W and Z bosons by this experiment and the UA2 experiment in 1983 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984. Peter Kalmus and John Dowell, from the UK groups working on the project, were jointly awarded the 1988 Rutherford Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for their outstanding roles in {{the discovery of the}} W and Z particles.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 Di Lella {{was one of}} four senior {{physicist}} who {{proposed the}} UA2 experiment. The purpose of the experiment was to detect the production and decay of the W and Z bosons at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (SpS) — a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). UA2, together with the UA1 collaboration, succeeded in discovering these particles in 1983, leading to the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. UA2 was also the first experiment to observe hadronic jet production at high transverse momentum from hadronic collisions. Di Lella was the spokesperson of the UA2 experiment from 1986 to 1990, when high-luminosity operation of the SpS was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The Underground Area 2 (UA2) {{experiment}} was a high-energy physics experiment at the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (SpS) — {{a modification of}} the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) — at CERN. The experiment ran from 1981 until 1990, and its main objective was to discover the W and Z bosons. UA2, together with the UA1 experiment, succeeded in discovering these particles in 1983, leading to the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The UA2 experiment also observed the first evidence for jet production in hadron collisions in 1981, and {{was involved in the}} searches of the top quark and of supersymmetric particles. Pierre Darriulat was the spokesperson of UA2 from 1981 to 1986, followed by Luigi Di Lella from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5000|$|The Antiproton Accumulator (AA) was an {{infrastructure}} {{connected to the}} <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider</b> (SpS) — a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) — at CERN. The AA was built in 1979 and 1980, for the production and accumulation of antiprotons. In the SpS the antiprotons were made to collide with protons, achieving collisions at a center of mass energy of app. 540 GeV (later raised to 630 GeV and finally, in a pulsed mode, to 900 GeV). Several experiments recorded data from the collisions, most notably the UA1 and UA2 experiment, where the W and Z boson were discovered in 1983. The concept {{of the project was}} developed and promoted by C. Rubbia, for which he received the Nobel prize in 1984. [...] He shared the prize with Simon van der Meer, whose invention of the method of stochastic cooling made large scale production of antiprotons possible for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|W and Z bosons are {{produced}} mainly {{as a result}} of quark-antiquark annihilation. In the parton model the momentum of a proton is shared between the proton's constituencies: a portion of the proton momentum is carried by the quarks, and the remainder by gluons. It will not be sufficient to accelerate protons to a momentum equal the mass of the boson, as each quark will only carry a portion of the momentum. To produce bosons in the estimated intervals of 60 to 80 GeV (W boson) and 75 to 92 GeV (Z boson), one would therefore need a <b>proton-antiproton</b> <b>collider</b> with a center-of-mass energy of approximately six times the boson masses, about 500-600 GeV. The design of the SpS was determined by the need to detect [...] As the cross-section for Z production at ~600 GeV is ~1,6 nb, and the fraction of [...] decay is ~3%, a luminosity of L=2,5 · 1029 cm−2s−1 would give an event rate of ~1 per day. To achieve such luminosity one would need an antiproton source capable of producing ~3·1010 antiprotons each day, distributed in a few bunches with angular and momentum acceptance of the SPS.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, he {{suggested}} adapting CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to collide protons and antiprotons {{in the same}} ring — the <b>Proton-Antiproton</b> <b>Collider.</b> Using Simon van der Meers technology of stochastic cooling, the Antiproton Accumulator was also built. The collider started running in 1981 and, in early 1983, an international team of more than 100 physicists headed by Rubbia and known as the UA1 Collaboration, detected the intermediate vector bosons, the W and Z bosons, which had become a cornerstone of modern theories of elementary particle physics long before this direct observation. They carry the weak force that causes radioactive decay in the atomic nucleus and controls the combustion of the Sun, just as photons, massless particles of light, carry the electromagnetic force which causes most physical and biochemical reactions. The weak force also plays {{a fundamental role in}} the nucleosynthesis of the elements, as studied in theories of stars evolution. These particles have a mass almost 100 times greater than the proton. In 1984 Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer were awarded the Nobel Prize [...] "for their decisive contributions to the large project, which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z, communicators of weak interaction" ...|$|E
