25|$|After the triumph, Caesar {{set out to}} <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> ambitious {{legislative}} agenda. He {{ordered a}} census be taken, which forced {{a reduction in the}} grain dole, and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries.

5|$|After leaving Barnes Corners, NY177 {{returns to}} being the two-lane rural roadway, {{progressing}} southeastward through the town of Pinckney.

Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with CR27 and CR28 (Sears Pond Road). Leaving Bellwood, NY177 continues eastward into the hamlet of Windecker, which consists only of a few houses. Leaving Windecker, NY177 bends to the southeast and enters the town of Lowville, <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> few farms and wind turbines before bending into the hamlet of West Lowville. In West Lowville, NY177 intersects with NY12, which continues eastward {{to the village of}} Lowville. NY177 terminates at this intersection.|$|E
5|$|As a {{means of}} {{rallying}} supporters to get behind their cause, awareness campaigns against the takeover were launched. Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September.

Entrance to the park is via Waterford Bridge Road, <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> {{sculptured}} duck pond and a statue of Peter Pan. The park land was donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland. The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.|$|E

5|$|By 1826, the {{economic}} climate {{in the state}} had improved significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support, {{two of the four}} New Court justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old Court Party won majorities of 5644 in the House and 2216 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the court impasse. The Old Court majorities in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New Court, <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court. Desha vetoed the bill, and scolded the legislators for <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of George M. Bibb, a New Court partisan, to a position on the re-empowered Old Court after John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826.|$|E

5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> {{number of pieces}} of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E

50|$|To <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> National Course (such as for example, Higher Mathematics), {{students}} have to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> number of National Units that are internally assessed, as well as <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> final externally assessed examination. Unit assessments are unseen and should a student fail an assessment opportunity, only one re-sit opportunity is provided using a fresh unseen assessment.

During this season, Heskey gave inconsistent performances and received abuse from Birmingham fans. Birmingham managing director Karren Brady stated that Birmingham's relegation meant that the last Â£1.5million of the maximum Â£6.25million fee for signing Heskey from Liverpool would not be payable.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, during AtlÃ©tico's pre-season, Costa {{suffered}} a serious knee injury, {{going on to}} miss {{the majority of the}} season.

On 23 January 2012, Costa was loaned to fellow league club Rayo Vallecano until June; he scored four goals in his first three appearances, including two in a 5â€“3 away win against Levante, eventually finishing his loan spell with 10 goals from 16 games.|$|E

During her term, the council <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> strong rent-control law, and also began offering domestic partnership benefits, becoming the second American city to legally recognize same-sex relationships (Berkeley had <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> similar law a year earlier).|$|R
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Milk served almost 11 {{months in}} office and was {{responsible}} for <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> stringent gay rights ordinance for the city. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, another city supervisor, who had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise but who had sought to get his position back after that endeavor failed.

Just {{to the west of the}} highway is Valley Drive, formerly NY31C, which parallels NY317 for its entire length. Separating NY317 and Valley Drive is Skaneateles Creek, which runs between the two highways.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the state}} of Hawaii <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{constitutional}} amendment against gay marriage. In 2013 a ruling, by {{the state attorney general}} on this amendment, allowed the government to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> statute legalizing gay marriage.|$|R
