2500|$|... "After {{clearing}} the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, {{it was evident}} that one <b>passenger</b> <b>oxygen</b> cylinder (number-4 from a bank of seven cylinders along {{the right side of the}} cargo hold) had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading edge fairing. The cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge, puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door. The cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame, door handle and overhead panelling, before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are strong}} {{similarities}} {{to the novel}} Orbit by Thomas Block (1982), whose [...] "Star Streak" [...] aircraft was jet-and-rocket powered and intended for high-atmospheric flight, only {{to end up in}} space. However, there are also important differences. In Orbit, the failure to shut down engines, requiring entry into space lest it burn up, was deliberate sabotage rather than accident; the aircraft returns without Shuttle assistance [...] "ploughing" [...] the way; and the Shuttle mission sent to bring the <b>passengers</b> <b>oxygen</b> fails to launch at all.|$|R
5000|$|A little later, Pyke proposed, tentatively, {{that his}} idea for [...] "Power-Driven Rivers" [...] could be {{extended}} to the transport of personnel. The pipes {{would need to be}} at least two feet in diameter and the pressures would have to be high. He worked out some rough ideas for supplying the <b>passengers</b> with <b>oxygen</b> and suggested that the problem of claustrophobia might be ameliorated by travelling in pairs and by the judicious use of barbiturate drugs. The whole experience (of riding in a pipe) however should be far less unpleasant, and take very much less time to become used to, than parachute jumping, or being bombed. Pyke quoted by Lampe ...|$|R
40|$|Maximum cabin {{pressure}} altitude is limited by regulation to 2440 m (8 kft) for normal flight. In case of cabin depressurization, the {{cabin pressure}} altitude may rapidly increase up to maximum A/C altitude. To protect the passengers from lack of <b>oxygen</b> (hypoxia), the <b>passenger</b> supplemental <b>oxygen</b> supply shall provide per regulation a minimum oxygenation equivalent to 3050 m (10 kft) or 4270 m (14, 000 kft) whether the {{cabin pressure altitude}} is lower or higher than 5640 m (18 kft). The corresponding airworthiness requirement CS/FAR 25. 1443 (c) defines the minimum performance in term of oxygen partial pressure in the trachea. For demonstration, international standards have been available (TSO C 64 a / SAE AS 8025) for several decades. 	More than the oxygen partial pressure in the trachea, the blood oxygen saturation is the most relevant parameter to characterize the level of oxygenation. Current medical instrumentation are available for measuring directly the blood oxygen saturation. This alternative means of demonstration has been systematically studied during a test campaign at the DLR – Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne with human testing in altitude chamber. Different types of oxygen dispensing devices have been tested at different altitudes. Results show that the oxygenation level required by the regulation is achieved with significantly less oxygen than used so far. This is explained by the different efficiency level of oxygen transfer to the blood during the different phases of the breathing process. In other words, {{it is important to}} deliver oxygen at the right time, so that oxygen is effectively transferred to the blood and not “wasted” during subsequent exhalation. In the last years, this alternative means of compliance has been accepted by the Airworthiness Authorities. This has opened possibilities to introduce new technologies in oxygen dispensing equipment and {{to reduce the amount of}} oxygen to be transported on-board. These different opportunities are shortly presented and discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the next}} few minutes, several warning lights on the {{overhead}} panel in the cockpit illuminated. One {{or both of the}} equipment cooling warning lights came on to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans (a result of the decreased air density), accompanied by the master caution light. The <b>passenger</b> <b>oxygen</b> light illuminated when, at an altitude of approximately 18000 ft, the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed.|$|E
2500|$|Lhasa {{has been}} served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai–Tibet Railway opened for {{passenger}} operations. Reaching {{an elevation of}} 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some [...] away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. Train number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of <b>passenger,</b> and personal <b>oxygen</b> masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigazê, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.|$|R

50|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft that operate at high flight altitudes are pressurized at a maximum cabin altitude of approximately 8,000 feet. On most pressurized aircraft, if cabin pressurization is lost when the cabin altitude is above 14,000 feet, compartments containing the oxygen masks will open automatically, either above or {{in front of}} the passenger and crew seats, and the oxygen masks will drop down {{in front of the}} <b>passenger.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> masks may also drop on extremely rough landings or during severe turbulence if the oxygen mask panel becomes loose. Rows of seats typically have an extra mask (i.e. 3 seats, 4 masks), in case someone has an infant in their lap, or someone in the aisle needs to grab one.|$|E

50|$|An {{oxygen mask}} {{consists}} of a yellow, soft, silicone facial cup with white elastic bands for securing the mask to the passenger's face. This band is adjustable by pulling two ends looped through the facial cup. The mask may also have a concentrator or re-breather bag {{that may or may}} not inflate depending on the cabin altitude, which has (in some instances) made passengers nervous the mask was not providing adequate oxygen, causing some to remove them, who thereby suffered hypoxia. All airlines now make a point in the safety video or demonstration to point out that the bag may not inflate. The bag is attached to a tube, connected to the oxygen source in the compartment, allowing for it to drop down and hang in front of the passengers. To operate on all aircraft except the L-1011, they must be pulled sharply toward the passenger who needs it to un-clip the flow pin and start the process of transporting the oxygen to the passenger. <b>Passenger</b> <b>oxygen</b> masks cannot deliver enough oxygen for sustained periods at high altitudes. This is why the flight crew needs to place the aircraft in a controlled emergency descent to a lower altitude where it is possible to breathe without emergency oxygen. While the masks are being used, passengers are not allowed to leave their seat for any reason until it is safe to breathe without the emergency oxygen. If there is a fire on board the aircraft, masks are not deployed, as the production of oxygen may further fuel the fire.|$|E
