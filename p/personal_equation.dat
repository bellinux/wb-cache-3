40|$|For most of {{his adult}} life, John Lennon fought to define himself against his public {{identity}} as "Beatle:John. " That image, crafted by the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein and the pop music industry became a burden to all four of the Beatles during the group's seven years of international stardom. For Lennon, most commentators then and now agree that his primary sacrifice was the rebellious anger that drove him to achieve the very success Epstein offered. Musically, the decision to stop touring led to a freedom to expand the studio experiments begun in early 1966, and the soundscape of Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour is defined by a nearly complete freedom from producing songs that could be replicated on stage. "Strawberry Fields" and "I am the Walrus" exemplify this freedom, and the two songs are frequently compared for their use of orchestral instrumental overlay and complicated tape-mixing effects. Here, {{for the first time in}} his songwriting, Lennon raises the issue of identity in a self-conscious fashion. Lennon immediately announces the theme of identity-dissipation in the opening line of "I am the Walrus": "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together". Not only do these <b>personal</b> <b>equations</b> dissolve the distinct identity of all members (I, he, you, me, we), but the sonic equivalence of he-me-we (mono-syllabic two letter words ending on a long -e vowel) projects an aural sameness as well. A few months after recording Plastic Ono Band, Lennon was busy working on the song and album Imagine, in which many of the 1960 s ideals would be resurrected in his music. Within the next two years he would embrace a series of radical political causes, all of which emphasized the legacy of the 1960 s...|$|R

It was only when, to his somewhat strange relief, she had refused the expedition, and Olive had started without them, that he told her of the meeting in the Gardens, {{of which he had}} been witness. She then said at once that if she had known she would, of course, have put up with anything in order to go; not because she approved of interfering, but because they must think of Robert! And the Colonel had said: [...] "D--n the fellow!" [...] And there the matter had rested for the moment, for both of them were, wondering a little which fellow it was that he had damned. That indeed was the trouble. If the Colonel had not cared so much about his niece, and had liked, instead of rather disliking Cramier; if Mrs. Ercott had not found Mark Lennan a 'nice boy,' and had not secretly felt her husband's niece rather dangerous to her peace of mind; if, in few words, those three had been puppets made of wood and worked by law, it would have been so much simpler for all concerned. It was the discovery that there was a <b>personal</b> <b>equation</b> in such matters, instead of just a simple rule of three, which disorganized the Colonel and made him almost angry; which depressed Mrs. Ercott and made her almost silent....

60|$|I {{can never}} insist enough, my dear Cyril, upon the illogicality of American life. You {{know what the}} plutocratic {{principle}} is, and what the plutocratic civilization should logically be. But the plutocratic civilization {{is much better than}} it should logically be, bad as it is; for the <b>personal</b> <b>equation</b> constantly modifies it, and renders it far less dreadful than you would reasonably expect. That is, the potentialities of goodness implanted in the human heart by the Creator forbid the plutocratic man to be what the plutocratic scheme of life implies. He is often merciful, kindly, and generous, as I have told you already, in spite of conditions absolutely egotistical. You would think that the Americans would be abashed {{in view of the fact}} that their morality is often in contravention of their economic principles, but apparently they are not so, and I believe that for the most part they are not aware of the fact. Nevertheless, the fact is there, and you must keep it in mind, if you would conceive of them rightly. You can in no other way account for the contradictions which you will find in my experiences among them; and these are often so bewildering that I have to take myself in hand, from time to time, and ask myself what mad world I have fallen into, and whether, after all, it is not a ridiculous nightmare. I am not sure that, when I return and we talk these things over together, I shall be able to overcome your doubts of my honesty, and I think that when I no longer have them before my eyes I shall begin to doubt my own memory. But for the present I can only set down what I at least seem to see, and trust you to accept it, if you cannot understand it.|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped a}} form of {{consolation}} {{which seemed to be}} encouraging me in the persuasion that my discontent was the chief evil in the world, and my benefit the soul of good in that evil. May there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philosophy is the formula of his personality? In certain branches of science we can ascertain our <b>personal</b> <b>equation,</b> the measure of difference between our own judgments and an average standard: may there not be some corresponding correction of our personal partialities in moral theorising? If a squint or other ocular defect disturbs my vision, I can get instructed in the fact, be made aware that my condition is abnormal, and either through spectacles or diligent imagination I can learn the average appearance of things: is there no remedy or corrective for that inward squint which consists in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of mental balance? In my conscience I saw that the bias of personal discontent was just as misleading and odious as the bias of self-satisfaction. Whether we look through the rose-coloured glass or the indigo, we are equally far from the hues which the healthy human eye beholds in heaven above and earth below. I began to dread ways of consoling which were really a flattering of native illusions, a feeding-up into monstrosity of an inward growth already disproportionate; to get an especial scorn for that scorn of mankind which is a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claims; to watch with peculiar alarm lest what I called my philosophic estimate of the human lot in general, should be a mere prose lyric expressing my own pain and consequent bad temper. The standing-ground worth striving after seemed to be some Delectable Mountain, whence I could see things in proportions as little as possible determined by that self-partiality which certainly plays a necessary part in our bodily sustenance, but has a starving effect on the mind.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a cross {{sectional}} sample of 485 {{lines of credit}} from the NSSBF database to investigate {{the significance of the}} agency costs of debt at private family firms. Contrary to previous studies, we consider the price of the loan as multidimensional: it mainly consists of the interest rate, business collateral and personal collateral requirements. In order {{to take into account the}} jointness in debt terms, we simultaneously estimate the entire model consisting of an interest rate equation, business collateral <b>equation</b> and <b>personal</b> collateral <b>equation</b> using an instrumental variable technique, 2 SLS. The results reveal that private family firms are confronted with higher agency costs of debt, reflected in the pledging of personal collateral. No substitution with other debt terms seems to be possible. Personal collateral seems to be an effective tool to cope with self-control problems reducing any possibility of ex post risk shifting behaviour and free riding. In addition, the results show that the interest rate and business collateral can be considered as substitutes while family ownership has no effect on these loan conditions...|$|R

60|$|Of course, I put it too strongly, {{for there}} is often, illogically, {{a great deal of}} love between the American women and their domestics, though why there should be any at all I cannot explain, except by {{reference}} to that mysterious <b>personal</b> <b>equation</b> which modifies all conditions here. You will have made your reflection that the servants, as they are cruelly called (I have heard them called so in their hearing, and wondered they did not fly tooth and nail at the throat that uttered the insult), form really no part of the house, but are aliens in the household and the family life. In spite of this fact, much kindness grows up between them and the family, and they do not always slight the work that I cannot understand their ever having any heart in. Often they do slight it, and they insist unsparingly upon the scanty privileges which their mistresses seem to think a monstrous invasion of their own rights. The habit of oppression grows upon the oppressor, and you would find tender-hearted women here, gentle friends, devoted wives, loving mothers, who would be willing that their domestics should remain indoors, week in and week out, and, where they are confined in the ridiculous American flat, never see the light of day. In fact, though the Americans do not know it, and would be shocked to be told it, their servants are really slaves, who are none the less slaves because they cannot be beaten, or bought and sold except by the week or month, and for the price which they fix themselves, and themselves receive in the form of wages. They are social outlaws, so far as the society of the family they serve is concerned, and they are restricted in the visits they receive and pay among themselves. They are given the worst rooms in the house, and they are fed with the food that they have prepared, only when it comes cold from the family table; in the wealthier houses, where many of them are kept, they are supplied with a coarser and cheaper victual bought and cooked for them apart from that provided for the family. They are subject, at all hours, to the pleasure or caprice of the master or mistress. Every circumstance of their life is an affront to that just self-respect which even Americans allow is the right of every human being. With the rich, they are said to be sometimes indolent, dishonest, mendacious, and all that Plato long ago explained that slaves must be; but in the middle-class families they are mostly faithful, diligent, and reliable in a degree that would put to shame most men who hold positions of trust, and would leave many ladies whom they relieve of work without ground for comparison.|$|E
6000|$|The {{cathedral of}} St. Patrick's, dreary enough in itself seems to grow damper and chillier as one's {{footsteps}} disturb the silence between {{the grave of}} its famous Dean and that of Stella, in death as in life near yet divided from him, {{as if to make}} their memories more inseparable and prolong the insoluble problem of their relation to each other. Nor was there wanting, when we made our pilgrimage thither, a touch of grim humor in the thought that our tipsy guide (Clerk of the Works he had dubbed himself for the nonce), as he monotonously recited his contradictory anecdotes of the [...] "sullybrutted Dane," [...] varied by times with an irrelative hiccough of his own, was no inapt type of the ordinary biographers of Swift. The skill with which long practice had enabled our cicerone to turn these involuntary hitches of his discourse into rhetorical flourishes, and well-nigh to make them seem a new kind of conjunction, would have been invaluable to the Dean's old servant Patrick, but in that sad presence his grotesqueness was as shocking as the clown in one of Shakespeare's tragedies to Châteaubriand. A shilling sent him back to the neighboring pot-house whence a half-dozen ragged volunteers had summoned him, and we were left to our musings. One dominating thought shouldered aside all others--namely, how strange a stroke of irony it was, how more subtle even than any of the master's own, that our most poignant association with the least sentimental of men should be one of sentiment, and that a romance second only to that of Abélard and Héloïse should invest the memory of him who had done more than all others together to strip life and human nature of their last instinctive decency of illusion. His life, or such accounts as we had of it, had been full of antitheses as startling as if some malign enchanter had embodied one of Macaulay's characters as a conundrum to bewilder the historian himself. A generous miser; a sceptical believer; a devout scoffer; a tender-hearted misanthrope; a churchman faithful to his order yet loathing to wear its uniform; an Irishman hating the Irish, as Heine did the Jews,[1] because he was one of them, yet defending them with the scornful fierceness of one who hated their oppressors more; a man honest and of statesmanlike mind, who lent himself to the basest services of party politics for purely selfish ends; a poet whose predominant faculty was that of disidealizing; a master of vernacular style, in whose works an Irish editor finds hundreds of faults of English to correct; strangest of all, a middle-aged clergyman of brutal coarseness, who could inspire two young, beautiful, and clever women, the one with a fruitless passion that broke her heart, the other with a love that survived hope and faith to suck away the very sources of that life whereof it was the only pride and consolation. No wonder that a new life of so problematic a personage as this should be awaited with eagerness, the more that it was to be illustrated with much hitherto unpublished material and was to be written by the practised hand of Mr. Forster. Inconsistency of conduct, of professed opinion, whether of things or men, we can understand; but an inconsistent character is something without example, and which nature abhors as she does false logic. Opportunity may develop, hindrance may dwarf, the prevailing set of temptation may give a bent to character, but the germ planted at birth can never be wholly disnatured by circumstance any more than soil or exposure can change an oak into a pine. Character is continuous, it is cumulative, whether for good or ill; the general tenor of the life is a logical sequence from it, and a man can always explain himself to himself, if not to others, as a coherent whole, because he always knows, or thinks he knows, the value of x in the <b>personal</b> <b>equation.</b> Were it otherwise, that sense of conscious identity which alone makes life a serious thing and immortality a rational hope, would be impossible. It is with the means of finding out this unknown quantity--in other words, of penetrating to the man's motives or his understanding of them--that the biographer undertakes to supply us, and unless he succeed in this, his rummaging of old papers but raises a new cloud of dust to darken our insight.|$|E

In addition to the test of these a priori models, an ad hoc model was constructed that best fitted the current data. This model indicated emotional exhaustion to precede {{the development}} of depersonalization and personal accomplishment independently.
