40|$|As <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{transforming}} {{almost every}} industry today, they are slowly {{finding their way}} into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. <b>Digital</b> <b>platforms</b> are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise {{as a result of the}} exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for <b>digital</b> <b>platforms?</b> and (6) How do <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> affect everyday life...|$|R
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{disruptive}} {{information technology}} (IT) artifacts that erode conventional business logic associated with traditional market structures. This paper presents {{a framework for}} examining the disruptive potential of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> whereby we postulate that the strategic interplay of governance regimes and platform layers is deterministic of whether disruptive derivatives are permitted to flourish. This framework has been employed in a comparative case study between centralized (i. e., PayPal) and decentralized (i. e., Coinkite) <b>digital</b> payment <b>platforms</b> to illustrate its applicability and yield propositions on the nature and impact of <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> disruptions. Preliminary findings indicate that centralized <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> attempt to create unique configurals to obtain monopolistic power by tightly coupling platform layers, which are difficult to replicate. Conversely, decentralized <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> purposely decouple platform layers, to foster open innovation and accelerate market disruption. This paper therefore represents a first concrete step aimed at unravelling the disruptive potential of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{disruptive}} IT artifacts, {{because they}} facilitate the quick release of innovative platform derivatives from third parties (e. g., apps). This study endeavours {{to unravel the}} disruptive potential, caused by distinct designs and configurations of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> on market environments. We postulate that the disruptive potential of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> {{is determined by the}} degree of alignment among the business, technology and platform profiles. Furthermore, we argue that the design and configuration of the aforementioned three elements dictates the extent to which open innovation is permitted. To shed light on the disruptive potential of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms,</b> we opted for <b>digital</b> payment <b>platforms</b> as our unit of analysis. Through interviews with experts and payment providers, we seek to gain an in-depth appreciation of how contemporary <b>digital</b> payment <b>platforms</b> are designed and configured to foster open innovation. We envision that this study bridges existing knowledge gaps between <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> and innovation literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> {{has changed the}} way in which Asia-Pacific firms conduct {{international}} transactions, condensing time and geographic distance (Manyika, Lund, & Bughin, 2016). However, the impact of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> on firms’ internationalisation strategy, and in particular entry strategy, is under-researched in current International Business literature. This study aims to explore how <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> in China, and specifically the <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> of Alibaba Group, impact New Zealand small and medium-sized (SMEs) companies’ entry strategies in the Chinese market. Empirical data were collected from four New Zealand companies through semi-structured in-depth interviews. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> impact these firms’ entry strategies through easing entry barriers to some extent, particularly in helping overcome resource constraints and obtain access to networks. However, the participating firms still required local staff as a key part of successful market entry. Therefore, it is concluded that while <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> can help alleviate some entry barriers traditionally faced by SMEs, limitations in human resources still impose challenges on firms in seeking internationalisation in China...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} proposes and validates {{a design}} theory for <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> that support online communities (DPsOC). It addresses {{ways in which}} <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> can effectively support social interactions in online communities. Drawing upon prior literature on IS design theory, online communities, and platforms, we derive an initial set of propositions for designing effective DPsOC. Our overarching proposition is that three components of <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> architecture (core, interface, and complements) should collectively support the mix of the three distinct types of social interaction structures of online community (information sharing, collaboration, and collective action). We validate the initial propositions and generate additional insights by conducting an in-depth analysis of an European <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> for elderly care assistance. We further validate the propositions by analyzing three widely used <b>digital</b> <b>platforms,</b> including Twitter, Wikipedia, and Liquidfeedback, and we derive additional propositions and insights that can guide DPsOC design. We discuss {{the implications of this}} research for research and practice...|$|R

30|$|To {{address the}} above {{mentioned}} problem of {{keeping track of}} learners’ oral production, researchers have long proposed that audio/video analysis of discourse should be integrated into courses to raise learners’ meta-cognitive awareness (Faerch & Kasper 1986). But audio or video recordings do not offer multiple functions as a <b>digital</b> <b>platform</b> would. With <b>digital</b> <b>platforms,</b> users can record their spoken production, provide feedback, and also instantly interact and exchange ideas with each other regarding provided feedback. As different functions are combined into one system, <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> save time and create more ease and comfort for the user. Thus, this study developed a <b>digital</b> <b>platform,</b> {{in the form of}} a mobile application, to explore the effects of peer feedback on EFL learners’ strategic competence and oral communication performance.|$|R
40|$|Platforms provide anchor-points for {{coordinating}} varied {{activities within}} an ecosystem. Understanding platform complexity {{and its effects}} is therefore a vital concern for academia and industry. The complexity defines the range of possible activities on the platform and the related aspects of control. This paper argues that abstract models of platforms used in current research {{remove some of the}} most important features underlying the inherent complexity of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms.</b> This insight is illustrated with a small study of platforms and their evolving complexity in the music industry. The exploration highlights salient phenomena that a more comprehensive theory of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> should encompass. We posit that advancing theoretical perspective that better embrace the complexity of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> is needed to fully capture the strategic and technological implications of emerging <b>digital</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Organizations {{are under}} {{increasing}} pressure to communicate {{their position on}} social responsibility in a changing environment whereby more critical demanding citizens are using <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> to express their opinions about the actions of corporations. These changes, demand a corporate culture of listening, management commitment, responsible action and more effective forms of CSR communication with stakeholders. The emergence of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> such as Facebook or Twitter provide managers with a mechanism for a dialogue with stakeholders to communicate their CSR initiatives and policies. While these <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> {{have the potential for}} corporations to listen and respond to stakeholder concerns in an open and honest discourse, frequently CSR communication are perceived as serving instrumental goals. This chapter argues that CSR communication through <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> grounded in the ethical premise of responsibility and the concept of dialogue could change this perception. The implications for organizations are that they can enact an ethical premise of CSR using <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> if managers adopt a dialogic mindset, and listen and respond to the views of stakeholders. The chapter makes recommendations for an implementation process of the ethical premise of CSR. Finally, our critical reflection provides researchers with a conceptual lens for future empirical studies...|$|R
