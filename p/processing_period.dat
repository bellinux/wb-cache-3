During the <b>processing</b> <b>period,</b> heat cured acrylics—also called permanent denture acrylics—go through a process called polymerization, causing the acrylic materials to bond very tightly and taking several hours to complete.

40|$|Numerous {{investigators}} {{employing a}} variety of tasks {{have found that the}} pupil of the eye can serve as an index of cognitive effort or processing. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that during cognitive task the pupil dilates in response to stimulus presentation and returns to baseline immediately following solution or task termination. Moreover the increase in pupil size during information <b>processing</b> <b>periods</b> {{has been found to be}} positively related to the difficulty level of the task employed. Thus more difficult tasks evoke larger pupillary dilation during <b>processing</b> <b>periods.</b> The consistency of findings in this area has led reviewers to comment that the relationship between pupil size and mental effort is 2 ̆ 2 well-established 2 ̆ 2 and that the pupil is 2 ̆ 2 the best single 2 ̆ 2 physiological measure of processing load. Previous research however has concentrated almost exclusively on the use of 2 ̆ 7 non-continuous 2 ̆ 7 or short-duration stimuli. That is, tasks have employed digit strings, paired-associate learning, tone discrimination, single word imagery and the like. 2 ̆ 7 Continuous 2 ̆ 7 stimuli, that is stimuli that provide an extended, contextual and grammatically-integrated information set, such as reading material, have been employed in but two studies, only one of which was concerned with the issue of cognitive effort. Interestingly this isolated study failed to support the relationship function typically obtained. The essential purpose of the present study was to provide added information on how the pupil responds when 2 ̆ 7 continuous 2 ̆ 7 stimuli are employed. As well the influence of differing levels of 2 ̆ 7 processing ability 2 ̆ 7 was also investigated. The results obtained support the typical within-task findings of previous studies; that is, the pupil size was sensitive to the presence of <b>processing</b> <b>periods.</b> Mean pupil size did not discriminate between tasks of different difficulty levels but such discrimination was obtained when peak pupil size scores were employed. No convincing support was found for the influence of individual differences in processing ability on the pupillary response. Recommendations were made regarding the need for further and more sophisticated research to support and elaborate the findings here obtained. It was also put forward that if the pupil could be brought under voluntary control through instrumental conditioning procedures then strategies of information presentation could be derived so that learning is facilitated by making such presentation contingent on the presence of 2 ̆ 7 pupillary states 2 ̆ 7 deemed especially conducive to enhanced information integration and retrieval.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automatic approach to synthesizing schedulable timing constraints for real-time control systems. Given the performance specifications and schedulability constraints of a real-time control system, the approach derives task-level timing constraints which can guarantee these requirements. The control performance is specified {{in terms of}} control output responses such as steady state error, maximum overshoot, settling time, and rise time, and the task-level timing constraints include task periods and deadlines. The approach consists of two components with a clean interface. The first component translates the performance specifications into a set of system-level timing constraints such as loop <b>processing</b> <b>periods</b> and input-to-output latency, via control theoretic modeling and optimization.

40|$|Ancient {{hydraulic}} lime mortar preserves chemical and isotopic signatures that provide important information about historical processing and its durability. The distribution and isotopic composition of calcite in a mortar of a well-preserved Punic–Roman cistern at Pantelleria Island (Italy) was used to trace the formation conditions, durability, and individual <b>processing</b> <b>periods</b> of the cistern mortar. The analyses of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of calcite revealed four individual horizons, D, E, B- 1 and B- 2, of mortar from the top {{to the bottom of}} the cistern floor. Volcanic and ceramic aggregates were used for the production of the mortar of horizons E/D and B- 1 /B- 2, respectively. All horizons comprise {{hydraulic lime}} mortar characterized by a mean cementation index of 1. 5 [*]±[*] 1, and a constant binder to aggregate ratio of 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 01. This suggests standardized and highly effective processing of the cistern. The high durability of calcite formed during carbonation of slaked lime within the matrix of the ancient mortar, and thus the excellent resistance of the {{hydraulic lime mortar}} against water, was documented by (i) a distinct positive correlation of δ 18 Ocalcite and δ 13 Ccalcite; typical for carbonation through a mortar horizon, (ii) a characteristic evolution of δ 18 Ocalcite and δ 13 Ccalcite through each of the four mortar horizons; lighter follow heavier isotopic values from upper to lower part of the cistern floor, and (iii) δ 18 Ocalcite varying from − 10 to − 5  ‰ Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (VPDB). The range of δ 18 Ocalcite values rule out recrystallization and/or neoformation of calcite through chemical attack of water stored in cistern. The combined studies of the chemical composition of the binder and the isotopic composition of the calcite in an ancient mortar provide powerful tools for elucidating the ancient techniques and <b>processing</b> <b>periods.</b> This approach helps to evaluate the durability of primary calcite and demonstrates the importance of calcite as a proxy for chemical attack and quality of the ancient inorganic binder...|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} accounts, {{fluctuations in}} sustained and focused attention and associated attentional lapses during task performance {{are regarded as}} the result of failures of top-down and effortful higher order processes. The current paper reviews an alternative hypothesis: that spontaneous patterns of very low frequency (< 0. 1 Hz) coherence within a specific brain network (‘default-mode network’) thought to support a pattern of generalized task-non-specific cognition during rest, can persist or intrude into periods of active task-specific processing, producing periodic fluctuations in attention that compete with goal-directed activity. We review recent studies supporting the existence of the resting state default network, examine the mechanism underpinning it, describe the consequent temporally distinctive effects on cognition and behaviour of default-mode interference into active <b>processing</b> <b>periods,</b> and suggest some factors that might predispose to it. Finally, we explore the putative role of default-mode interference as a cause of performance variability in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder...|$|R

50|$|The {{twentieth century}} has been {{proposed}} to be composed of four major periods: Formative Years, <b>Processing</b> <b>Period,</b> Linguistic Era, and Pragmatics Revolution. The Formative Years, which began around 1900 and ended around WWII, was a time during which the scientific rigor extended and professionalism entered the picture. During this period, the first school-based program began in the U.S. (1910). The <b>Processing</b> <b>Period,</b> from roughly 1945-1965, further developed the assessment and interventions available for general communication disorders; much of these focused on the internal, psychological transactions involved in the communication process. During the Linguistic Era, from about 1965-1975, professionals began to separate language deficits from speech deficits, which had major implications for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these communication disorders. Lastly, the Pragmatics Revolution has continued to shape the professional practice by considering major ecological factors, such as culture, in relation to speech and language impairments. It was during this period that IDEA was passed, and this allowed professionals to begin working with a greater scope and to increase the diversity of problems with which they concerned themselves.|$|E
