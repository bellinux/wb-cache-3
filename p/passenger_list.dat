5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} of the sinking is unclear, due {{to a number of}} factors, including confusion over the <b>passenger</b> <b>list,</b> which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Crumley {{was born}} in Dundee in 1890, the son of William Ferguson Crumley, a tinsmith. His older brother, Bob Crumley, also played professionally as a goalkeeper, {{and was in the}} Dundee team that won the 1910 Scottish Cup Final, {{defeating}} Clyde after two replays. The <b>passenger</b> <b>list</b> when he sailed for America in 1912 listed his occupation as that of blacksmith. During the First World War, Crumley joined the Royal Engineers. By mid-1915, he was a section corporal stationed near Dundee, and he went to reach the rank of sergeant and served in France. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and was wounded and affected by shell shock.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original <b>passenger</b> <b>list,</b> nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when trying to reach the plane.|$|E

25|$|William Carpenter (Gen. 1) born about 1575 in England. He {{died after}} 2 May 1638 (Bevis <b>passenger</b> <b>list)</b> and {{certainly}} before 1644 when his son, William settled in Rehoboth. He was of Newtown, Shalbourne Parish, Wiltshire, England, by 1608, {{when he became}} a copyholder (semipermanent leaseholder) at Westcourt Manor (Westcourt Recs 7). Shalbourne, completely in Wiltshire since 1895, previously it straddled the line separating Wiltshire and Berkshire, with Westcourt comprising the Wiltshire part of the parish (Shalbourne Map); the Hampshire border was/is about four miles away. It is likely that William was born in one of these three counties. William's renewal of his Westcourt tenancy on 22 June 1614 gives his age as 40 (Westcourt Recs 7). The <b>passenger</b> <b>list</b> of the Bevis, the ship on which he left England, is dated 2 May 1638 and states William's age as 62 leading to an estimate of about 1575 for his birth.|$|E
25|$|In {{time the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>list</b> would include many Hollywood stars, such as Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, James Cagney, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Antoine Laumet {{departed}} from France to the New World. His father lost a lawsuit against a lawyer in Castelsarrasin that caused him financial difficulties.

As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A <b>passenger</b> <b>list</b> was published before the sailing {{to inform the public}} which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.|$|E
50|$|Because so many {{immigrants}} traveled on the canal, many genealogists have sought copies of canal <b>passenger</b> <b>lists.</b> Apart from the years 1827-1829, canal boat operators {{were not required}} to record or report passenger names to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York.

25|$|According to the Mayflower <b>passenger</b> <b>list,</b> {{just over}} a third of the {{passengers}} were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618. Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council. In 1959, it was conclusively shown that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate. Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.|$|E

500|$|Things {{became more}} {{difficult}} for the Separatists in the Netherlands in the late 1610s as the Dutch government moved towards alliance with England. They had few opportunities in the Netherlands as they were limited to manual labor by the guilds' refusal to accept them, and they feared that their children were straying from their language and religion. Investors led by Thomas Weston agreed to finance an expedition to North America, and the ship Speedwell was sent to fetch Separatists from the Netherlands, then join the larger Mayflower to form a two-ship expedition. [...] After transporting the Separatists, the Speedwell proved unseaworthy for the ocean voyage. [...] The Mayflowers <b>passenger</b> <b>list</b> was formed from some Separatists who had gone to the Netherlands and some who had stayed in England, as well as a scattering of others. [...] Some would-be pioneers had to be left behind because of the problems with the Speedwell. The Mayflower sailed from Plymouth, in South West England, on September 6, 1620, with 102 passengers and a crew of 47.|$|E
