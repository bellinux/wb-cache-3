5|$|The {{assembly}} of these extracellular structures {{is dependent on}} bacterial secretion systems. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the <b>periplasm</b> or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens, so are intensively studied.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large <b>periplasm</b> that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
25|$|As a {{phospholipid}} bilayer, the lipid {{portion of}} the outer membrane is impermeable to charged molecules. However, channels called porins {{are present in the}} outer membrane that allow for passive transport of many ions, sugars and amino acids across the outer membrane. These molecules are therefore present in the <b>periplasm,</b> the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The <b>periplasm</b> contains the peptidoglycan layer and many proteins responsible for substrate binding or hydrolysis and reception of extracellular signals. The <b>periplasm</b> is thought to exist in a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and peptidoglycan found within it. Because of its location between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, signals received and substrates bound are available to be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using transport and signalling proteins imbedded there.|$|E
25|$|In gram-negative organisms, ABC {{transporters}} mediate secretion {{of protein}} substrates across {{inner and outer}} membranes simultaneously without passing through the <b>periplasm.</b> This type of secretion {{is referred to as}} type I secretion, which involves three components that function in concert: an ABC exporter, a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and an outer membrane factor (OMF). An example is the secretion of hemolysin (HlyA) from E. coli where the inner membrane ABC transporter HlyB interacts with an inner membrane fusion protein HlyD and an outer membrane facilitator TolC. TolC allows hemolysin to be transported across the two membranes, bypassing the <b>periplasm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{bacteria}} secrete small iron-binding molecules called siderophores, which bind {{strongly to}} ferric ions. FepA {{is an integral}} bacterial outer membrane porin protein, which {{is involved in the}} active transport of iron bound by the siderophore enterobactin from the extracellular space, into the <b>periplasm</b> of Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>periplasm,</b> FeEnt {{is bound}} by FepB and {{passed to the}} {{integral}} inner membrane proteins FepG and FepD through active transport, with the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis catalysed by cytoplasmic FepC. In the cytoplasm, the Fes enterobactin esterase hydrolyses and this cleaves enterobactin, releasing Fe3+ which will subsequently be reduced by the same protein, Fes, to Fe2+.|$|E
25|$|Function: There {{are several}} roles that the Extended Signal Peptide Region {{is thought to}} hold. First, biogenesis of {{proteins}} in the Type V Secretion System (T5SS). Second, it is thought to target the protein to the inner membrane to be translocated either by the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) or by twin arginine translocated (TAT). Third, {{it has been observed}} and believed to regulate the rate of protein migration into the <b>periplasm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The BtuCD and HI1470/1 are {{classified}} as large ABC importers. The transmembrane subunit of the vitamin B12 importer, BtuCD, contains 10 TM helices and the functional unit consists of two copies each of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and transmembrane domain (TMD). The TMD and NBD {{interact with one another}} via the cytoplasmic loop between two TM helices and the Q loop in the ABC. In the absence of nucleotide, the two ABC domains are folded and the dimer interface is open. A comparison of the structures with (BtuCDF) and without (BtuCD) binding protein reveals that BtuCD has an opening that faces the <b>periplasm</b> whereas in BtuCDF, the outward-facing conformation is closed to both sides of the membrane. The structures of BtuCD and the BtuCD homolog, HI1470/1, represent two different conformational states of an ABC transporter. The predicted translocation pathway in BtuCD is open to the <b>periplasm</b> and closed at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane while that of HI1470/1 faces the opposite direction and open only to the cytoplasm. The difference in the structures is a 9° twist of one TM subunit relative to the other.|$|E
25|$|Escherichia coli secrets many iron-siderophore transports, but produce {{only one}} siderophore—enterobactin. The ferric enterobactin {{receptor}} FepA recognises the catecholate part of ferric enterobactin (FeEnt), and transports {{it across the}} outer membrane from the extracellular space into the <b>periplasm.</b> The binding {{is thought to be}} in two phases, a fast step which recognises FeEnt, and a slower step which may be the first step in translocation—preparing the complex for translocation. Both steps occur independently of the TonB–ExbB–ExbD complex and the proton motive force it provides.|$|E
25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein must move across the inner membrane or, in other words, translocate, in a Sec-dependent manner via the <b>periplasm.</b> The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether to hold it in place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor. The type V secretion system is described as non-fimbrious, meaning that the bacterial cells do not use long physical appendages named pili to attach to one another.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{utilize the}} energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport various substrates across cellular membranes. They are divided into three main functional categories. In prokaryotes, importers mediate the uptake of nutrients into the cell. The substrates that can be transported include ions, amino acids, peptides, sugars, and other molecules that are mostly hydrophilic. The membrane-spanning region of the ABC transporter protects hydrophilic substrates from the lipids of the membrane bilayer thus providing a pathway across the cell membrane. Eukaryotes do not possess any importers. Exporters or effluxers, which are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, function as pumps that extrude toxins and drugs out of the cell. In gram-negative bacteria, exporters transport lipids and some polysaccharides from the cytoplasm to the <b>periplasm.</b> The third subgroup of ABC proteins do not function as transporters, but are rather involved in translation and DNA repair processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{architecture of}} ABC transporters consists minimally of two TMDs and two NBDs. Four individual polypeptide chains including two TMD and two NBD subunits, may combine {{to form a}} full transporter {{such as in the}} E. coli BtuCD importer involved in the uptake of vitamin B12. Most exporters, such as in the multidrug exporter Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus, are made up of a homodimer consisting of two half transporters or monomers of a TMD fused to a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). A full transporter is often required to gain functionality. Some ABC transporters have additional elements that contribute to the regulatory function of this class of proteins. In particular, importers have a high-affinity binding protein (BP) that specifically associates with the substrate in the <b>periplasm</b> for delivery to the appropriate ABC transporter. Exporters do not have the binding protein but have an intracellular domain (ICD) that joins the membrane-spanning helices and the ABC domain. The ICD is believed to be responsible for communication between the TMD and NBD.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are active}} transporters, that is, they require {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to translocate substrates across cell membranes. These proteins harness the energy of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to drive conformational changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and consequently transports molecules. Both ABC importers and exporters have a common mechanism in transporting substrates because of the similarities in their structures. The mechanism that describes the conformational changes associated with binding of substrate is the alternating-access model. In this model, the substrate binding site alternates between outward- and inward-facing conformations. The relative binding affinities of the two conformations for the substrate largely determines the net direction of transport. For importers, since translocation is directed from the <b>periplasm</b> to the cytoplasm, then the outward-facing conformation will have higher binding affinity for substrate. In contrast, the substrate binding affinity in exporters will be greater in the inward-facing conformation. A model that describes the conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis is the ATP-switch model. This model presents two principal conformations of the NBDs: formation of a closed dimer upon binding two ATP molecules and dissociation to an open dimer facilitated by ATP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Switching between the open and closed dimer conformations induces conformational changes in the TMD resulting in substrate translocation.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{scientists}} have been examining the possible genetic basis for P. aeruginosa resistance to antibiotics such as tobramycin. One locus identified as being an important genetic determinant of the resistance in this species is ndvB, which encodes periplasmic glucans that may interact with antibiotics and cause them to become sequestered into the <b>periplasm.</b> These results suggest [...] a genetic basis exists behind bacterial antibiotic resistance, rather than the biofilm simply acting as a diffusion barrier to the antibiotic.|$|E
2500|$|A proton pump is any {{process that}} creates a proton {{gradient}} across a membrane. [...] Protons can be physically moved across a membrane; this is seen in mitochondrial Complexes I and IV. [...] The same effect can be produced by moving electrons in the opposite direction. The result is the disappearance of a proton from the cytoplasm {{and the appearance of}} a proton in the <b>periplasm.</b> [...] Mitochondrial Complex III uses this second type of proton pump, which is mediated by a quinone (the Q cycle).|$|E
2500|$|Nitrification is {{the process}} by which ammonia (...) is {{converted}} to nitrate (...) [...] [...] Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (...) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. Nitrosomonas) and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Nitrobacter). [...] Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms. [...] Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (...) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the cytoplasm, followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the <b>periplasm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By {{using an}} SBP, TRAP {{transporters}} share some similarity to ABC transporters {{in that the}} substrate for the transporter is initially recognized outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, the SBP is usually free in the <b>periplasm</b> and expressed at relatively high levels compared to the membrane domains. In Gram positive bacteria and archaea, the SBP is tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane. In both types of systems the SBP binds to substrate, usually with low micromolar affinity, which causes a significant conformation change in the protein, akin to a Venus flytrap closing. The trapped subtrate is then delivered to the membrane domains of the transporter, where the electrochemical ion gradient is somehow exploited to open the SBP, extract the substrate and catalyse its movement across the membrane. For the SiaPQM TRAP transporter which has been studied in a fully reconstituted in vitro form, uptake uses a [...] gradient and not proton gradient to drive uptake. The SiaPQM systems also exhibits unique properties for a secondary transporter in that it cannot catalyse bidirectional transport as the SBP imposes that movement {{is only in the}} direction of uptake into the cell.|$|E
2500|$|Most ABC {{transporters}} that {{mediate the}} uptake of nutrients and other molecules in bacteria {{rely on a}} high-affinity solute binding protein (BP). BPs are soluble proteins located in the periplasmic space between {{the inner and outer}} membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive microorganisms lack a <b>periplasm</b> such that their binding protein is often a lipoprotein bound to the external face of the cell membrane. Some gram-positive bacteria have BPs fused to the transmembrane domain of the transporter itself. The first successful x-ray crystal structure of an intact ABC importer is the molybdenum transporter (ModBC-A) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Atomic-resolution structures of three other bacterial importers, E. coli BtuCD, E. coli maltose transporter (MalFGK2-E), and the putative metal-chelate transporter of Haemophilus influenza, HI1470/1, have also been determined. The structures provided detailed pictures of the interaction of the transmembrane and ABC domains as well as revealed two different conformations with an opening in two opposite directions. Another common feature of importers is that each NBD is bound to one TMD primarily through a short cytoplasmic helix of the TMD, the [...] "coupling helix". This portion of the EAA loop docks in a surface cleft formed between the RecA-like and helical ABC subdomains and lies approximately parallel to the membrane bilayer.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{high-resolution}} structure {{reported for}} an ABC exporter {{was that of}} Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus. Sav1866 is a homolog of multidrug ABC transporters. It shows significant sequence similarity to human ABC transporters of subfamily B that includes MDR1 and TAP1/TAP2. The ATPase activity of Sav1866 {{is known to be}} stimulated by cancer drugs such as doxorubicin, vinblastine and others, which suggests similar substrate specificity to P-glycoprotein and therefore a possible common mechanism of substrate translocation. Sav1866 is a homodimer of half transporters, and each subunit contains an N-terminal TMD with six helices and a C-terminal NBD. The NBDs are similar in structure to those of other ABC transporters, in which the two ATP binding sites are formed at the dimer interface between the Walker A motif of one NBD and the LSGGQ motif of the other. The ADP-bound structure of Sav1866 shows the NBDs in a closed dimer and the TM helices split into two [...] "wings" [...] oriented towards the <b>periplasm,</b> forming the outward-facing conformation. Each wing consists of helices TM1-2 from one subunit and TM3-6 from the other subunit. It contains long intracellular loops (ICLs or ICD) connecting the TMDs that extend beyond the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm and interacts with the 8=D. Whereas the importers contain a short coupling helix that contact a single NBD, Sav1866 has two intracellular coupling helices, one (ICL1) contacting the NBDs of both subunits and the other (ICL2) interacting with only the opposite NBD subunit.|$|E
50|$|Exo{{proteins}}, or {{proteins that}} are to be secreted, are first transported across the inner membrane and into the <b>periplasm</b> via the Sec translocation machinery. These exoproteins will exist here in the <b>periplasm</b> secretion until the type II secretion system is activated.|$|E
50|$|The {{localization}} {{of some of}} the Pvd {{proteins in}} the <b>periplasm</b> and the outer membrane (such as PvdN, PvdO, PvdP, and PvdQ) have been interpreted to suggest that portions of the maturation of pyoverdine takes place in this location, perhaps after being transported into the <b>periplasm</b> by PvdE, which is homologous to ABC type exporters. How completely matured pyoverdine is exported from the cell remains unclear. Once completely matured, pyoverdine is exported from the <b>periplasm</b> by PvdRT-OpmQ efflux pump.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with other}} {{secretory}} {{systems such as}} the chaperone/usher pathway and the type IV secretion system, secretion via the type II secretion system is a two-step process. The first step involves the Sec and Tat secretory pathways which are responsible for transporting proteins across the inner membrane into the <b>periplasm.</b> For instance, the Sec pathway is used to transport structural components of the type II secretion system into the <b>periplasm</b> where they can then assemble, while both the Sec and Tat pathways are used to transport secretory proteins into the <b>periplasm.</b> Once these secretory proteins are in the <b>periplasm</b> the second step can then take place and they are secreted out of the cell through the type II secretion system.|$|E

50|$|Gram-negative {{microbes}} have {{a double}} set of covering membranes. A cell membrane encloses the bacterial cytoplasm or cytosol, and over the cell membrane, there is another membrane called bacterial outer membrane. The compartment or space between these two membranes is called <b>periplasm</b> or periplasmic space. In addition, there is a firm cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan layer, which surrounds the cell membrane. Peptidoglycan layer provides some rigidity for maintaining the bacterial cell shape, besides also protecting the microbe against challenging environment. Thus, <b>periplasm</b> ensures expandable and additional space for storing microbial cell secretions, for further and strategic use via a specialized secretory pathway. Size and contents of <b>periplasm</b> are therefore, variable as per physiological requirements (Fig. 2).The first step in biogenesis of gram-negative bacterial OMVs, is bulging of outer membrane above the peptidoglycan layer (Fig 2). It has been suggested (links) that few supramolecular proteins may 'rivet' the outer and cell membranes together, so that the periplasmic bulge protrudes like a 'ballooned' pocket of inflated <b>periplasm.</b> Lateral diffusion of 'rivet complexes' may help in pinching off large bulges of <b>periplasm</b> as OMVs. Detailed experimental work is still awaited to understand the biomechanics of OMV biogenesis. OMVs are also under focus of current research in exocytosis in prokaryotes via outer membrane vesicle trafficking for intra-species, inter-species and inter-kingdom cell signaling, which is slated to change our mindset on virulence of microbes, host-pathogen interactions and inter-relationships among variety of species in earth's ecosystem.|$|E
