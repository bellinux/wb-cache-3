5|$|Following Stalin's {{death in}} March 1953, Kosygin was demoted, {{but as a}} staunch ally of Khrushchev, his career soon turned around. While never one of Khrushchev's protégés, Kosygin quickly moved up the party ladder. Kosygin became an {{official}} of the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1957, and was made a candidate member of the Politburo. He was promoted to the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> chairmanship, and became Khrushchev's First Deputy Premier in 1960. As First Deputy Premier Kosygin travelled abroad, mostly on trade missions, to countries such as North Korea, India, Argentina and Italy, for instance. Later, {{in the aftermath of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis, Kosygin was the Soviet spokesman for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Kosygin regained his old seat in the Politburo at the 22nd Party Congress in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Jagielski was {{appointed}} as a Deputy Prime Minister (thus ending {{his tenure as}} the Minister of Agriculture and becoming the Deputy of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland), and in December 1971 he became a full member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party (he was previously a deputy to an existing member). On 26 October 1971, he became the Chairman of the <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Council of Ministers. On 23 October 1975, he was relieved of his post as Chairman of the <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> after he suffered a severe heart attack.

These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Civic Centre area came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015.|$|E

5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power. Nikolai Talyzin, Chairman of the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee,</b> became the scapegoat {{for the failure of}} this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov.|$|E

5|$|During both episodes, Michael and Pam {{visit the}} various {{branches}} of Dunder Mifflin to make business lectures, {{and in particular}} visit the Utica branch – where Jim's ex-girlfriend Karen Filippelli is regional manager, and the Nashua branch, where Michael's ex-girlfriend {{and the love of}} his life, Holly is an H.R. rep. In both episodes, Jim and Dwight hit a snag as the new heads of the Party <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> when they forget Kelly's birthday. In the first episode, Andy develops a crush on a customer, and in the second episode, Angela's unhealthy obsession with her cats is spotlighted when she installs a nanny cam.|$|E
5|$|Finland sought {{security}} guarantees {{from the}} League of Nations, {{but did not}} have high expectations. Sweden {{was one of the}} founding members of the League, and consequently framed its military policies based on the League's principles of disarmament and sanctions. In the mid-1920s the Finns established a special <b>planning</b> <b>committee,</b> called the Committee of Erich after its chairman Rafael Erich, which consisted of top politicians and officers, with the aim of exploring a possible military collaboration of Finland with other nations. The prime goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, amongst which Sweden was the most important prospective partner.|$|E
5|$|He {{soon became}} {{known for his}} {{nationalist}} views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party. After Magsaysay's election, he joined the government as {{special assistant to the}} Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs.|$|E

5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee,</b> and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov {{was born}} in the city of Dzerzhynsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. After graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his {{political}} career in local industry, working his way up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. In 1979 Ryzhkov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee.</b> Following Nikolai Tikhonov's resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place. During his tenure, he supported Mikhail Gorbachev's 1980s reform of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's <b>planning</b> <b>committee.</b> In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E

5|$|After {{the power}} {{struggle}} triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the new leader. On 20 March 1959, Kosygin {{was appointed to}} the position of Chairman of the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> (Gosplan), a post he would hold for little more than a year. Kosygin next became First Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Khrushchev was replaced in 1964, Kosygin and Leonid Brezhnev became Premier and First Secretary respectively. Kosygin, along with Brezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, {{was a member of the}} newly established collective leadership. Kosygin became one of two major power players within the Soviet hierarchy, the other being Brezhnev, and was able to initiate the failed 1965 economic reform, usually referred to simply as the Kosygin reform. This reform, along with his more open stance on solving the Prague Spring (1968), made Kosygin one of the most liberal members of the top leadership.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the <b>planning</b> <b>committee</b> {{of the city}} council charged its staff with {{examining}} how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moscow on 27 September 1937, Pavlov {{graduated}} from the Moscow Finance Institute in 1958. He started his nomenklatura (bureaucratic) career as a government economist; he started working for as {{an official of the}} Ministry of Finance in 1959, and {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1962. Early in his career he also worked for the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Pavlov started working for the State <b>Planning</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1979, and became a member of the State Planning Committee's board in 1981. He held the office as head of the State Planning Committee's Finance Department, the department which oversaw all aspects of the country's planned economy. He served as First Deputy Minister of Finance in Boris Gostev's ministry from January to August 1986.|$|E
