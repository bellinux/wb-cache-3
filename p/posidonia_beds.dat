40|$|Sea. Abstract. During 1986 and 1987 a decapod {{crustacean}} taxocoenosis of <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>beds</b> {{from the}} southeast of Spain has been studied. Data on abundance-dominance of the 50 species found {{and other information}} such as reproduction and the selective use of gastropod shells by the dominant hermit crabs are given.

Replicate samples were collected at August 2011, from four stations (separated by 500 of metres). The diversity of phytoplankton was high around P. oceanica meadows compared to area without seagrass. A possible explanation to this finding is that water motion and hydrodynamics forces cause leaves agitation allowing the passage of epiphytic species in the water column. Our results also show an increase of abundance of potentially toxic dinoflagellates around Posidonia bed such as Alexandrium minitum, Amphidinium carterae, Karenia selliformis, Coolia monatis, Karlodinium veneficum, Ostreopsis ovata, Prorocentrum concavum, P. minimum, P. rathymum, and P. lima.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{detailed}} cartographic survey carried out by Side Scan Sonar and a towed underwater video camera during 2005, and from a series of historical maps (1959, 1980, 1990), an extensive regression of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile beds was evidenced for a vast area of the central Tyrrhenian Sea (Latium coast, Italy). The total loss of P. oceanica surface was assessed through GIS estimate. In 1959, the <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> extended over 7290 ha, while in the 2005 survey they had regressed to 2899 ha, a loss of about 60 % of their coverage. Also the seagrass lower limit showed a general depth decrease in time. Total seagrass coverage loss and lower limit regression were not uniform along the whole investigated areas and three main sub-areas have been identified with different degrees of regression somehow related with coastal potential human-mediated impacts.

30|$|In each case, a {{large and}} rather {{symmetric}} peak between C 21 and C 32 with a maximum at C 27 {{is followed by a}} smaller, asymmetric peak displaced towards C 23 (Fig.  5 b). We can make a reasonable hypothesis on the origins of these variations. The scuttling of the French Mediterranean fleet on the 27 th of November 1942 (Antier 1992) is the only recent event that might have initiated such a massive release of hydrocarbons. One hundred and seventeen ships were sunk, and all naval dockyard facilities destroyed. While the sabotage operation lasted for 2  h, fires and explosions continued for several days. Huge quantities of toxic waste released from the destroyed ships, docks, buildings, munitions and fuel were added to the harbour sediments. This massive and rapid pollution of the entire Toulon Bay was followed by a long period of recovery which prolonged, even though more moderately, the contamination of the bay. The 1942 cataclysm also has biological correlates in the sediment record. The level (20 – 30  cm) corresponding to the scuttling of the fleet is associated with a transition from grey, clay <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> to grey beds of decaying Posidonia debris, testimony to a strong perturbation of the underwater biological habitat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{spring and}} summer {{distribution}} of adults and larval fish stages of Sparids and Scorpaenids was studied in two sites in the western Mediterranean. Fish adults and larvae of those two taxa were identified and sorted according to their life stages in order to study their distribution and develop suitable habitat maps. Study areas were located on French coastal waters, the ‘‘Côte Bleue’ ’ Marine Park (CBMP) has an east-west orientation with substratum dominated by <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> and the Marine Reserve of Cerbère-Banyuls (MRCB) runs north–south and is dominated by rocky substrates. Generalised Additive Models (GAM) combined with Geographic Information System (GIS), were used to model the suitable habitats for fish larvae and adults. During spring months, waters exhibit low Sea Surface Temperatures (SST), low Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), high values of Sea Surface Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and mostly negative values of Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) indicating anticyclonic eddies. During summer months, waters have higher values of SST, lower values of Chl-a and positive values of SLA indicating cyclonic eddies. The results revealed different envi-ronmental responses {{in the distribution of}} fish adults and larvae in the CBMP and MRCB.

In all systems investigated, organic matter (as biopolymeric carbon) accumulated in aquaculture impacted sediments. Among the main biochemical classes, lipids appeared to be a good tracer of aquaculture impact, especially in fish-farm sediments. Exoenzymatic activities displayed higher values in sediment beneath the cages, indicating faster organic matter cycling. A significant accumulation of chloroplastic pigments was observed under mussel farms (related to the deposition of faeces and pseudo faeces), but also on fish-farm sediments. The presence of newly deployed cages induced rapid changes in the benthic compartment, and sediments reached rapidly (6 weeks) reducing conditions. Bacterial and total microbial density increased significantly in impacted sediments. Although the contribution of prokaryotic auto-fluorescent cells was very low, fthis component displayed a clear response to organic biodeposition, increasing significantly beneath the cages. Conversely, eukaryotic auto-fluorescent cells decreased. The ratio of benthic auto-fluorescent cells to total bacterial number proved to be a new, sensitive descriptor of biodeposition impact. Heterotrophic bacteria (CFU, and particularly the number of gram-negative bacteria: Cytophaga/Flexibacter-like bacteria) increased significantly in sediments beneath the farm.

40|$|Scientific {{observer}} {{records were}} used to estimate the retained and discarded catch composition of the commercial boat seine fisheries over Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile meadows in the eastern Adriatic, from November 2008 to December 2009. A total of 91 fish and cephalopod species were recorded in the catches, of which 20 species were always retained, 40 were always discarded and the remaining 31 were selected depending on size (only larger specimens were retained). The most abundant species in the retained catch were Spicara smaris, Atherina hepsetus and Mullus barbatus, while Chromis chromis, Symphodus ocellatus and small specimens of Boops boops dominated the discards. An estimated 43. 5 % by number and 28. 5 % by weight of the total catch were discarded. Since the minimum landing size (MLS) is regulated for only 4 out of the 15 most important species in this study, and even these regulations are only partially followed, discarding practices were generally market-driven. The retained and discarded amounts of the catch {{as well as the}} numbers of retained and discarded species showed a seasonal pattern. The catches recorded during summer/autumn were generally larger than those in winter/spring.

40|$|Posidonia oceanica {{forms an}} {{extremely}} productive and complex ecosystem {{in the coastal}} Mediterranean Sea providing a suitable habitat for hundreds {{of plant and animal}} species. Among motile invertebrates associated to Posidonia meadows,  polychaete borers of the plant sheaths represent a unique group which exploit a peculiar microhabitat. They belong to the family Eunicidae with three dominant species, Lysidice collaris, L. ninetta and L. unicornis. Due to their strong association with Posidonia shoots, these animals are particularly suitable to study the plant and animal spatial relationships and their pattern of variability. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of these animals (Index of Borer, IB) at different spatial and temporal (summer vs winter) scales in two Posidonia meadows off the Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples, Italy), which are exposed to different degrees of human impact and of hydrological conditions. Results showed IB values of L. collaris (the most abundant species) significantly different between meadows and at scales from 10 s to 100 s of meters, as well as between summer and winter. The IB of L. ninetta showed significant differences only at scales of 10 s of meters while, on the contrary, the IB of L. unicornis (the less abundant species) did not show variability at any spatial and temporal scales. Most of the variance was at the more impacted and less water movement exposed meadow, suggesting higher level of small and intermediate scales of patchiness of borers at this meadow.

40|$|Mariculture in Croatia {{could play}} a more {{important}} role in development of rural communities along coastline. However, by increase of fish farming, public concern over environmental issues has been raised, {{and the need for}} more responsible mariculture development and management has been asked. There are opportunities and challenges for effectively integrating mariculture into coastal zone management with equal rights and obligations. This is primarily because of its social and economic mission consisting in preventing de-population of rural coastal areas and islands and meeting the growing needs of tourist market for seafood. Although intensive mariculture production is accused of producing negative environmental effects, many of these effects still need to be scientifically documented. The effect of nitrogen and phosphorous releases from farmed fish faeces or uneaten food is not of significant issues for marine ecosystem, and it is generally of little importance compared to the inflow of nutrients from other coastal sources. The impact on sediment and benthic communities is mainly local and short-term ones, and depends on the number and extent of the farms and their location. Recovery of some benthic communities after the cessation of farming activities may be delayed over several years (i. e. <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds)</b> due to the accumulated organic matter. Bluefin tuna farming if not properly located and managed might cause pollution problems, either from uneaten feed and metabolic waste or from harvesting and processing the fish. In most cases the problem comes from smell pollution during the summer time and the oily water surface that may be widespread much outside of the farm areas. It will be important for sustainable development of Croatian mariculture to offer a healthy and good quality product in the quantities required by the market, while not degrading the marine environment...|$|E

Of the 20 sightings occurred along the shore, 6 were juveniles unpaired with their mothers and 4 of them died. First, we detaile dtheir unusual behaviour. All individuals were static, undernourished and covered with a high quantity of parasites (Penella sp.). Most of them entered ports: for instance from 20 th to 30 th May 2007 we monitored a juvenile fin whale, less than 10 m-long, which remained in shallow waters in front of Ligurian coast and entered repeatedly the port of Genova-Voltri, or the whale named “Desirée” that stayed on the French Riviera, from 14 th to 24 th July 2007. we include videos showing th 10 m-long juvenile rustling in <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds,</b> a behaviour never described yet. The second part of this work deals with general distribution of fin whales in 2007. We estimate the encounter rate of fin whale sightings according to the distance from the coast comparing data from 2004 to 2007, using 121 scientific and 565 whale-watching one-day surveys. Results indicate a significant decline of abundance throughout all 2007. Encounter rate decreases from 1. 50 sightings/ 50 MN in May 2005 to 0. 25 sightings/ 50 MN in May 2007.

40|$|Several EU Directives and {{regional}} conventions {{are concerned with}} the protection and conservation of marine habitats of special importance; a necessary prerequisite to implement such legislation are marine habitat classification systems and information on the distribution of marine habitat types. There are several habitat classification schemes in use for the description, designation and monitoring of habitats. The ‘Interpretation Manual for Marine Habitats within the 25 NM Fisheries Management Zone around the Republic of Malta’ provides an updated description of marine habitats found around the Maltese Islands, as well as a cross-referencing scheme for the different habitat classification systems. Marine habitats are listed according to bathymetric zone, going from shallow to deep water. The bathymetric zones included in the interpretation manual are: (1) mediolittoral, (2) infralittoral, (3) circalittoral, and (4) bathyal. Habitats listed in the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) database were reviewed, habitats which are present in the Maltese Islands were identified, and ‘new’ habitat categories have been included in the manual where there was no equivalent EUNIS habitat. For each habitat category presented, cross- references to the system used in connection with the Protocol for Specially Protected Areas and Biodiversity in the Mediterranean (SPABM) of the Barcelona Convention, to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) classification system of predominant habitat types, {{as well as to the}} marine habitats listed in Annex I of the ‘Habitats Directive’, were established.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the present study {{includes}} a review of the stratigraphy and a detailed account on the structure of {{the southern part of the}} Ionian zone in the region of Epirus-Greece. This takes place on the basis of the ‘‘thin-skinned tectonics’’ theory due to the presence of the Triassic evaporitic sub-stratum at depth. The above are considered in the context of the initial assessment of the hydrocarbon potential of specific locales. The structure of the entire Ionian zone is the result of its evolution from the initial stages, through the formation of boundary faults comprising its limits, to its final emergence during the compressional phase that caused the tectonic inversion of the initially formed extentional structures. During the incipient stages in the evolution of the Ionian basin the activation of listric normal faults brought about its internal differentiation into rotational sub-basins. Those listric faults were reactivated during the compressional orogenetic phase as overthrusts. The diversity which characterizes the assembling parts of the Ionian zone is best depicted in the distribution of the Jurassic formations. Their presence or absence is indicative of the paleogeograghical setting ranging from the deepest to the totally emergent parts of the distinctive sub-basins respectively. Structures indicative of the presence of a ‘‘decollement’’ surface at depth are present in the studied part of the Ionian zone. These structures were formed during the compressional phase. The ‘‘decollement’’ zone is represented by the level of the Triassic evaporites. Structures encountered along E-W generally oriented sections are studied in the context of the ‘‘ramp-flat geometry’’ prevailing in such cases and are interpreted either as ‘‘ramp anticlines’’, or ‘‘imbricate faults’’, or ‘‘fault-propagation folds’’. Areas characterized by the presence of the above structures are mainly the zones adjacent to the present-day principal tectonic lines representing eminent overthrust surfaces such as the Paramythia and the Margariti thrusts in the central and external Ionian zone respectively. The local presence of the entire Jurassic sequence, and especially the Lower <b>Posidonia</b> <b>Beds,</b> along the crestal part of anticlinal structures provides a manifestation of the effect of tectonic inversion, along previously formed listric faults, on the relocation of originally deep-seated parts of the sub-basins. The present-day distribution of the Jurassic facies combined with the observed structures provide the means for the further division of the Ionian zone into distinctive paleogeographic-structural units. The internal Ionian zone extends up to the first appearance of the Epirus-Akarnania flysch, the central Ionian zone is composed of three units while two units can be distinguished in the external Ionian zone. The tectonic movements which caused the internal differentiation of the Ionian basin into sub-basins, combined with the locally suitable physico-chemical conditions, favored the deposition in the deepest parts of the rotational sub-basins of the most important source-rock of the Ionian zone, i. e. the Lower <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds.</b> The rest of the potential source-rocks are the shale interbeds that make part of the Triassic evaporites and the shale horizons in the Upper Siliceous Zone of the Vigla limestones. In the northern part of the Ionian zone, close to the borders with Albania, a very rich organic-matter horizon was first located, spanning the Cenomanian-Touronian boundary. This horizon is representative of an anoxic event which has been recorded on a global scale. The maturation degree of the potential source rocks appears to vary from place to place. The possible effect of thrust tectonics, with the ensuing more pronounced burial, on the acceleration of the maturation process should also be considered. On the basis of microscopic observations effected on limestone samples collected along sections located in the distinctive assembling parts of the Ionian zone and ranging in age from the Lower Cretaceous Vigla formation to the Paleocene-Eocene limestones, three (3) principal facies were distinguished. The above facies entity comprises on the whole a tourbiditic sequence with the low energy facies on bottom of the sequence and the respective high energy ones on top. Their distribution frequency is a function of both, the particular formation concerned and the specific prevailing sedimentological conditions. Porosity and permeability measurements on the above mentioned samples exemplify in the vast majority of the cases the negligible values of their petrophysical properties. The determining crucial factor is the high content of lime mud observed in the samples. Relatively high measurable values of the above petrophysical properties, recorded in a few samples, are mainly ascribed to secondary solution related mechanisms. Under those circumstances secondary processes, and especially the formation of fracture porosity, become of crucial importance in light of the evaluation of the calcareous series formations as potential reservoir rocks.

40|$|The decapod {{crustacean}} fauna of Ustica Island (Sicily, southern Tyrrhenian Sea) {{has been}} investigated in summer 2002 {{with the aid of}} many different sampling methods: suction device, pushnet, skid trawl, trammel net, traps, underwater observation, interviews. All the substrata occurring around the island from 0 to about - 30 m were surveyed: midlittoral rock, infralittoral rock, pebbles, seagrass (<b>Posidonia</b> oceanica) <b>bed,</b> sand, detritic bottom, submerged cave. Fiftyseven species were collected in the investigated localities. Abundance and frequency of all species in the samples and in each surveyed biotope are given. The performance of each sampling method has been evaluated, in terms of number of species and individuals, and of species unique to each method. Methods based on direct underwater observation (i. e., visual census) and hand collection provided the largest number of species. Accounts on three remarkable species are given: Calappa tuerkayana, Pachygrapsus transverses, and Percnon gibbesi. This study increases the decapod knowledge of the southern Tyrrhenian sea...|$|R
40|$|The project {{focused on}} the {{construction}} and numerical modeling of a regional structural profile, extending from the offshore pre-Apulian zone {{in the west to}} the onshore Ionian zone within the External Hellenides in the east. A complex fold-and-thrust belt characterizes this part of NW Greece. Such type of mobile belt is likely to potentially host considerable petroleum reserves, and constitutes an attractive target for exploration. Seismic data and geological maps have been used to construct the present-day section and to infer the type and timing of structural deformation and sequence of thrusting. The first step consisted in balancing and restoring the structural section into its initial, pre-orogenic configuration. Kinematic and thermal modeling was subsequently performed to constrain the main episodes of structural deformation, source rock maturation and hydrocarbon migration, and better predict the current petroleum potential of the studied area. Direct extrapolation from the sedimentary thicknesses preserved in synclines, paleo-thermometers such as Tmax and Ro, and 1 D basin modeling on selected wells provided crude estimates on the thickness of eroded series. Different numerical tools such as Kine 2 D, Dynel, Temis and Openflow, have been sequentially used to perform the kinematic, thermal and petroleum modeling along the studied cross section. Most significant prospects in NW Greece can be found in areas with good potential structural traps such as folded and faulted anticlines, being sourced by Mesozoic source rocks. Other areas with good trap potential are those with hanging wall anticlines, formed by high-angle faults, situated in a broad syncline below the flysch cover. The main potential source rocks are: Triassic shales, which reached the oil window during Upper Jurassic; Jurassic <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> reaching the oil window during Serravallian; and the Cretaceous Vigla shales reaching the oil window after Serravallian times. The main potential reservoirs are situated in carbonate sequences of Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene age, which are being sealed by Neogene flysch sequences and local Triassic and Jurassic evaporates. Beneath the major thrust-sheets deep compressional structures are expected (duplex structures), being the main objective for sub-thrust exploration. However, for the deep un-calibrated formations significant uncertainties remain regarding the exact depth and thickness of the respective sequences. Further analysis could also focus on the eastern extension of the fold-and-thrust belt. This area underwent a different tectonic regime during Cenozoic times than the selected part of NW Greece covered by this current study. This could have resulted in different structures and therefore could affect the petroleum system analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Ionian and Gavrovo Zones in the {{external}} Hellenide fold-and-thrust belt of western Greece are a southern extension of the proven Albanian oil and gas province. Two petroleum systems have been identified here: a Mesozoic mainly oil-prone system, and a Cenozoic system with gas potential. Potential Mesozoic source rocks include organic-rich shales within Triassic evaporites and dissolution-collapse breccias; marls {{at the base of}} the Early Jurassic (lower Toarcian) Ammonitico Rosso; the Lower and Upper <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> (Toarcian-Aalenian and Callovian-Tithonian respectively); and the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) Vigla Shales, part of the Vigla Limestone Formation. These potential source rocks contain Types I-II kerogen and are mature for oil generation if sufficiently deeply buried. The Vigla Shales have TOC up to 2. 5 % and good to excellent hydrocarbon generation potential with kerogen Type II. Potential Cenozoic gas-prone source rocks with Type III kerogen comprise organic-rich intervals in Eocene-Oligocene and Aquitanian-Burdigalian submarine fan deposits, which may generate biogenic gas. The complex regional deformation history of {{the external}} Hellenide foldbelt, with periods of both crustal extension and shortening, has resulted in the development of structural traps. Mesozoic extensional structures have been overprinted by later Hellenide thrusts, and favourable trap locations may occur along thrust back-limbs and in the crests of anticlines. Trapping geometries may also be provided by lateral discontinuities in the basal detachment in the thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt, or associated with strike-slip fault zones. Regional-scale seals are provided by Triassic evaporites, and Eocene-Oligocene and Neogene shales. Onshore oil- and gasfields in Albania are located in the Peri-Adriatic Depression and Ionian Zone. Numerous oil seeps have been recorded in the Kruja Zone but no commercial hydrocarbon accumulations. Source rocks in the Ionian Zone comprise Upper Triassic - Lower Jurassic carbonates and shales of Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous ages. Reservoir rocks in both oil- and gas-fields in general consist of silicilastics in the Peri-Adriatic Depression succession and the underlying Cretaceous-Eocene carbonates with minimal primary porosity improved by fracturing in the Albanian Ionian Zone. Oil accumulations in thrust-related structures are sealed by the overlying Oligocene flysch whereas seals for gas accumulations are provided by Upper Miocene-Pliocene shales. Thin-kinned thrusting along flysch décollements, resulting in stacked carbonate sequences, has clearly been demonstrated on seismic profiles and in well data, possibly enhanced by evaporitic horizons. Offshore Albania in the South Adriatic basin, exploration targets in the SW include possible compressional structures and topographic highs proximal to the relatively unstructured boundary of the Apulian platform. Further to the north, there is potential for oil accumulations both in the overpressured siliciclastic section and in the underlying deeply buried platform carbonates. Biogenic gas potential is related to structures in the overpressured Neogene (Miocene-Pliocene) succession...|$|E
40|$|RES MARIS is an {{environmental}} protection project cofinanced by the European Union through the LIFE + Nature and Biodiversity Programme. The project aims at the conservation and recovery of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, {{included in the}} marine SCI (Site of Community Interest) "Isola dei Cavoli, Serpentara, Punta Molentis e Campulongu". The habitats selected {{for the implementation of}} the project are "Posidonia beds (Posidonion oceanicae) ", "Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. " and "Wooded dunes with Pinus pinea and/or Pinus pinaster". They are characterized by a high biodiversity and exclusive vegetal and animal communities and can easily undergo both floristic and faunal changes. Some of the main threats to the site are landscape alteration, the introduction of invasive alien plants, and boat anchoring, which are mainly the result of human activities such as tourism and recreational activities, enhanced by a strong attendance (mostly in summer months). Sea-land integrated actions are therefore needed to achieve the following objectives: (1) to reduce/eliminate the invasive plants; (2) to reduce or to eliminate the mechanical damage from boat anchoring on Posidonia beds; (3) to favour the recovery of the spontaneous autochthonous vegetation; (4) to raise the awareness of the local population and stakeholders; and (5) to share conservation skills among the key decision-making bodies of the territory for the long-term protection of these habitats. Marine concrete actions consist of the positioning of mooring buoys in selected areas to ensure the conservation of <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> and the restoration of this habitat through naturalistic engineering techniques. Terrestrial concrete actions consist of the eradication of invasive species (Carpobrotus spp., Agave spp., and Acacia spp.) in the priority habitats and restoration through naturalistic engineering techniques. Communication actions use various conventional and multimedia tools including brochures, panels, a role-playing game, and an application/game for mobile phones. Environmental education and awareness-raising activities are addressed to schools and local stakeholders; a good practices manual on the integrated management of the coastal zone is devoted to key territorial players. Bathymetric and biocenotic maps were produced for 700 hectares of seabed; also, the main anthropogenic traces of disturbances were detected. The presence of the invasive alien macro algae C. cylindracea was also registered. The floristic analysis in the coastal dune systems {{led to the creation of}} a list with 127 native and 91 alien taxa. Among these, the most invasive species are those belonging to the genera Carpobrotus, Agave, and Acacia; distribution maps of these species in the SCI were created. Germplasm collections led to the acquisition of 40 seed accessions belonging to 14 structural plant species of dune habitats. It was possible to define optimal germination protocols for the selected species, and this was used to produce 30, 000 plants for the restoration action...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the effects of the large Mediterranean {{seagrass}} Posidonia oceanica on coastal waves and wave-induced flows, which has significant implications for coastal protection. Investigations were made on both a natural shallow <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>bed</b> and, in controlled conditions of full-scale Posidonia mimics under regular and irregular waves. In the field, waves and currents were monitored during low energy conditions and a Mistral wind event. Data were collected on the distribution of Posidonia patches, density and canopy height, as well as bed sediment type and bathymetry. In the flume, measurements were made of water surface elevation along the flume and oscillatory flows at 3 locations and 4 elevations, under several wave conditions, water depths and for 2 canopy densities. The mimics were designed carefully to recreate the hydraulic behaviour of Posidonia plants under waves. Field results indicate that shallow Posidonia meadows are effective at reducing wave energy under low wave energy conditions and small wave amplitudes. The flume experiments confirm this trend. Under both regular and irregular waves, drag coefficients decrease with increasing Reynolds vegetation numbers; wave dissipation factors decrease with wave orbital amplitude. Under spectral waves, most wave energy dissipation occurs at the peak spectral frequency and it is largest for the least energetic wave spectra. At high wave Reynolds numbers, the canopyinduced hydraulic roughness (r) appears to be a function of the canopy element density only, and the empirical formula of Nielsen (1992) is successfully applied. However, more work is required in low energy conditions to examine the range of validity of the formula. In natural conditions under small amplitude waves, attenuation of wave-induced flows is negligible in the upper canopy; flume experiments confirm this trend. The typical flow intensification at the canopy top, measured for other seagrasses, occurs only for tests with the largest wave amplitudes, whilst, under smaller waves, flow intensification is located within {{the upper part of the}} canopy. In the lower canopy, flows are always reduced and flows decelerate exponentially with increasing orbital amplitude. This is a novel observation in flexible canopies. The artificial canopy, like the natural <b>Posidonia</b> <b>bed,</b> enhances flow asymmetries at the canopy top, especially under waves with large wave orbital amplitudes. This is thought to be a mechanism to enhance shoreward drift. Turbulence in the artificial canopy, under regular waves, peaks at the canopy top, as occurs under unidirectional flows and for other seagrass beds exposed to waves. Vertical turbulent exchanges are enhanced at the edge of the seagrass patch and are larger for lower submergence ratios (the ratio of canopy height to water depth). A reduction in submergence ratio in the flume, also causes increased shear stresses at the top of the canopy, lower wave height decay and reduced oscillatory flow attenuation in the lower part of the canopy. The denser canopy, in the conditions tested, increases relative roughness (r/A), wave attenuation, in canopy oscillatory flow reduction and turbulent kinetic energy at the top of the canopy. Oscillatory flows characterised by small orbital amplitudes can penetrate further into the canopy than larger orbital velocities, inducing a larger drag, thus increasing wave dissipation, as proposed for rigid canopies (corals). This is manifested as a thinner canopy boundary layer under small orbital amplitude waves than the large amplitude waves. A conceptual model is proposed to summarise these findings. Under storm conditions Posidonia is believed to be less efficient at reducing wave energy, however it remains effective at reducing sediment transport locally and, by inducing a preferential shoreward drift, at preventing sand dispersal offshor...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} fish farm biodeposition on benthic bacteria, thraustochytrid protists, and heterotrophic protozoa (nanoflagellates and ciliates) in an oligotrophic area of the Mediterranean Sea. The fish farm impact was investigated both on a seagrass (<b>Posidonia</b> oceanica) <b>bed</b> and on soft bottom sediments. In both systems, sediment samples were collected with a multicontrol sampling strategy (i. e., beneath the fish farm and at three control sites per system). The uneaten food pellets supplied to the fish determined the accumulation of sediment organic matter and the enhancement of protein content in impacted sediments (both seagrass bed and soft sediments). In both systems, the abundance and biomass of heterotrophic protists increased significantly beneath the fish farm, but {{the structure of the}} protist assemblages responded differently in vegetated and unvegetated sediments. Thraustochytrid abundance increased significantly in impacted seagrass. These results provide evidence that the structure of protist assemblages respond significantly to fish farm biodeposition and indicate that the monitoring of these benthic components provides complementary information for the assessment of the fish farm impact on the benthic systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Posidonia oceanica meadow {{constitutes}} a key ecosystem in the sub-littoral {{zone of the}} Mediterranean, from both an ecological and physical equilibrium per-spective. In addition, it harbors a very high species diversity. <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>beds</b> {{are very sensitive to}} disturbances caused by human activity (e. g. coastal development, pol-lution, turbidity, anchoring, etc.) and their loss has been observed in a number of regions. The aim of the monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Provence and French Riviera coasts is (i) to evidence possible new losses and (ii) to evaluate through a biological indi-cator the efficiency of regional policies (e. g. setting up of sewage treatment plants, reduc-tion in industrial and domestic pollution levels in the rivers flowing towards the Mediterranean, establishment of Marine Protected Areas, banning of new harbors and reclamations). Monitoring tools operate at three scales: (i) system scale (aerial photo-graphs, measurement of bottom cover, permanent transects), (ii) meadow scale (e. g. photographs of Posidonia around cement markers positioned along meadow limits, shoot-density, permanent quadrats) and (iii) shoot scale (e. g. plagiotopic to orthotropic rhizome ratio, laying bare of the rhizomes, lepidochronology, leaf epiphytes, leaf biome...|$|R
