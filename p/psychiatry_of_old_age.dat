40|$|In the 1930 s, some psychologists {{began to}} study and discuss the normal and {{pathological}} mental abilities <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> This paper explores this research {{and its implications for}} an emerging definition <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> in the 1930 s and 1940 s.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{supports}} to {{the delivery}} of quality services is the provision {{of information about the}} mental health services to stakeholders. Since the establishment of the Division, {{in the context of the}} Accountability Framework, there has been an increased focus on the development of performance metrics and in providing information on the work of the mental health services. The Division is challenged in providing detailed information about its service provision as the information systems in place are reliant on largely manual data collection processes and are very labour intensive. This limits the type of data provided, and creates challenges in respect of validation, verification and analysis. Building on the success of the annual reports which were published by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services up to 2013, the Division has developed this report, Delivering Specialist Mental Health Services 2014 - 2015, with the objective of providing an overview of the work of the specialist mental health services. The Report describes the secondary care specialist mental health services, giving an overview of the components of service and how they are accessed.

40|$|Objective: To {{create a}} record of the {{development}} of old age psychiatry in Britain, as seen through the eyes of {{some of the people who}} participated in building it, from the earliest days until it was officially recognised as a specialty by the Department of Health in 1989. Method: Group reminiscences and discussions in the format of a witness seminar which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Witnesses also provided written biographical information. Results: The annotated full record created at the seminar is available on line. This paper reflecting themes, lessons and highlights has been derived from it. Conclusions: Early old age psychiatrists often encountered opposition and incredulity from other health care professionals and managers. However, their experiences were demonstrating just how much could be achieved in improving the lives of older mentally ill people. They conveyed their enthusiasm for their work in both clinical and university settings. Clinical creativity, support when working in relative professional isolation, and dealing with opposition benefited from both the development of the Group for the <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Age</b> at the Royal College of Psychiatrists and from close links with geriatric medicine. </p...|$|E
40|$|The disproportionately high {{suicide rate}} {{among the elderly}} is {{examined}} in this review. As opposed to younger age groups, a close association exists between suicide and parasuicide in old age. Factors associated with these events include {{a high incidence of}} depression, serious physical illness, as well as social factors that serve to isolate the individual and deprive him of positive support and therapeutic intervention. A high risk profile and integrative model are proposed. Old people kill themselves at a higher rate than any other age group. This fact alone succinctly expresses the extent of psychological distress and vulnerability within the geriatric population. Although the psychiatric literature is replete with studies of suicide in physicians, adolescents, prisoners, soldiers and psychiatric trainees, it gives relatively scant attention to the elderly as a separate group. As general interest in the <b>psychiatry</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> increases, it is appropriate that the increased propensity towards suicide among the old should achieve more prominence. The problem of suicide in the elderly can also serve as a prototype for analysis of the psychological, socio-cultural and biological variables that are relevant to all mental disorders of old age and in this paper a hypothetica...|$|E

40|$|This change project {{focused on}} {{increasing}} the awareness {{and understanding of}} the Enduring Power of Attorney among members of a regional Mental Health Team, patients and carers. In 2011, 1405 Wardship orders, a provision under the outdated Lunacy Regulations Ireland Act, 1871, were signed in Ireland as opposed to 440 appointed Enduring Powers of Attorney, under Irish Power of Attorney Act 1996. This suggests a probable lack of awareness or understanding and uptake of the provisions for advance care instructions. A pre-audit revealed less than half of a selected population of the <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Age</b> patients were aware of the Enduring Power of Attorney. The project entailed developing guidelines for implementing discussions on the Enduring Power of Attorney, developing an information booklet on the Enduring Power of Attorney, facilitating training and information sessions and incorporating measures for regular reviews of the implementation into existent organisational structures. Kotter’s eight step change model was utilised to guide the change process implementation. Also, SWOT analysis was integrated prior to, during and after the implementation of the change process. The change objectives were attained, as evidenced by the development of information booklet, and approval of standard guidelines for Enduring power of attorney discussions with inclusion and exclusion criteria.

40|$|The Common Summary Assessment Report {{and this}} Guidance Document {{are part of}} a process of {{developing}} a national common assessment approach, primarily for older persons seeking access to long term residential care for in the public, voluntary or private sectors. An assessment of needs is a legislative requirement. This Guidance Document has been produced to assist practitioners in the completion of the Common Summary Assessment Report (CSAR). Admission into long term residential care is a significant life decision. It is best practice that older people should have an assessment specifically to determine whether: a) there are remedial factors which might avert admission to long term residential care; b) the older person is under inappropriate pressure to enter long term residential care; and c) to provide recommendations to maximise health, by a Consultant Geriatrician or Consultant in <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Age.</b> Where available, this assessment has a key role as part of the multidisciplinary team process in reaching a decision on the individual’s need for long term residential care. Exceptionally, adults with chronic and significant disabilities may also apply for state support. A similar approach applies to this care group, although the professions involved may vary. Health and social care professionals have a duty of care to ensure that people have been given sufficient and appropriate information for them to make an informed choice about whether they wish to enter long term residential care; this includes discussing with that person the reasonably foreseeable pros and cons of long term residential care. The rights and wishes of the person will be paramount in the decision making process. Whilst local arrangements will be made for the completion of the CSAR, it is generally envisaged that health professionals with the most comprehensive knowledge of the applicant will be central to the process...|$|E
40|$|A {{door to door}} field-survey was {{conducted}} in two villages {{by a team of}} psychiatrists with the aim of assessing the mental morbidity of the population. The present communication is restricted to the mental morbidity of the elderly population aged 60 years and above. The total sample comprised 183 persons (male 85, female 98). Majority of the families (44. 2 %) belonged to class IV according to Pareek and Trivedi's scale. Sixty one percent of the elderly population was mentally ill. Women had a higher rate of morbidity than men (77. 6 % and 42. 4 % repetitively). The overwhelming majority of the affected persons were depressives. Rate of dementia was low. Key Words: Field-survey, elderly population, psychiatric morbidity, rural community The number of elderly people is growing very fast in both developed and developing countries. The fall in the birth rate and rising life expectancy are the two main factors behind this unprecedented growth of the grey sector of human society. The rapid change in social structure and in traditional value system will have a tremendous impact on the well being of these senior citizens {{as well as on the}} equilibrium of the society itself. Against this backdrop it is reasonable to expect that the mental health problem of the elderly will grow more in the years to come. The western response to this task was expressed as a spurt in research activities in different aspects of <b>psychiatry</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> The development of screening instrument of detection of cognitive impairment in old age was an early effort in this direction. In 1975, Folsteinand his associates published the 'Mini Mental State' a practical method for grading the cognitive state of patients for the clinicians (Folstein et al., 1975). Further refinement and standardisation of screening scale followed in eighties (Yesavage et al., 1983; Roth et al., 1986). Copeland et al. (1986) came up with a computerised diagnostic system and case nomenclature for elderly subjects and thereby improved the objectivity and comparability of studies in this area. Simultaneously epidemiological studies were undertaken to assess the pattern and extent of mental morbidity in the elderly (Blazer and Williams, 1980; Copeland et al. ...|$|E
