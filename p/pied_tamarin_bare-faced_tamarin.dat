50|$|Populations of red-handed {{tamarins}} {{appear to}} be expanding into the historical range of the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin,</b> with the red-handed tamarin gradually displacing the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> through interspecific competition.|$|R
2500|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin {{has a long}} sagittal crest, consisting of white hairs, from forehead to nape flowing over the shoulders. [...] The skin of the face is black with gray or white bands located above the eyes. These bands continue {{along the edge of}} the face down to the jaw. Tamarins are generally divided into three groups by their facial characteristics: hairy-faced, mottled-faced, and <b>bare-faced.</b> The cotton-top <b>tamarin</b> has fine white hairs covering its face, but they are so fine as to appear naked, thus is considered a <b>bare-faced</b> <b>tamarin.</b> Its lower canine teeth are longer than its incisors, creating the appearance of tusks. Like other callitrichids, the {{cotton-top tamarin}} has two molar teeth on each side of its jaw, not three like other New World monkeys.|$|R
50|$|This New World monkey {{is found}} within and {{just north of}} the city limits of Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas state of Brazil. The main {{distribution}} is in the rio Cuieiras and rio Preto da Eva interfluvium. Pied tamarins are also found in the adjacent rio Preto da Eva and rio Urubu interfluvium, but are comparatively rare. There appears to be interspecific competition between the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> and the red-handed tamarin with the red-handed tamarin gradually displacing the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> from areas of its historical distribution. There are therefore multiple threats to the long-term survival off the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> that stem from habitat destruction and from interspecific competition.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Oestrone, oestradiol- 17 =b {{progesterone}} {{were measured}} by radioimmuno-assay in daily urine samples after pairing and during subsequent pregnancy in a <b>pied</b> bare-face <b>tamarin.</b> On {{the basis of}} excretion profiles an ovarian cycle length of about 3 weeks and a gestation length of about 160 days are suggested. Oestrone was the predominant urinary oestrogen excreted by the non-pregnant and pregnant <b>pied</b> bare-face <b>tamarin,</b> the oestrone/oestradiol ratio being greater than 100 : 1. The results suggest that steroid monitoring can provide useful information about reproductive physiology in this species of tamarin...|$|R
50|$|The Rio Negro State Park South Section is in {{the central}} Amazonia corridor, in the Lower Rio Negro Mosaic.It protects part of the basin of the Cuieiras river.The river and the Araras and Jaraqui streams, tributaries of the Rio Negro, are low-lying and have flooded mouths.The main plant {{formations}} are Igapó forest, dense terra firma forest and Campinarana.Wildlife is very diverse. It includes the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus bicolor), an endemic primate, {{in the south of}} the park and the red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas) on the right bank of the Cuieiras.|$|R
50|$|With so much {{industry}} and commerce, the Port of Manaus {{has become a}} sophisticated cosmopolitan center. Located next to the Amazon rainforest, it also attracts crowds of tourists who find a variety of land and boat trips into the jungle. Wildlife is plentiful, even within the city, and {{it is home to}} the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin,</b> one of Brazil's most endangered primates. Tour boats take visitors to see the point where the black waters of the Rio Negro meet the Solimões River's brown waters, flowing together without mixing for nine kilometers. Tourists can find many hotels in the jungle where they can enjoy nature in comfort.|$|R
50|$|The Trust’s {{headquarters}} {{is also a}} ‘window’ {{to the work of}} Durrell Wildlife around the world - where visitors can enjoy the opportunity {{to see some of the}} planet’s most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, such as gorillas and orangutans, are well known while other species, such as the Livingstone's fruit bat, the <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin,</b> the giant jumping rat, the Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), the echo parakeet (Mauritius parakeet), the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and Round Island boa, are more obscure.|$|R
50|$|Apenheul is home {{to about}} 70 species of animals, 35 of which are primates. The park houses lemurs from Madagascar, monkeys from Central and South America, and monkeys and apes from Asia and Africa.

50|$|Objectives were to {{conserve}} the ecosystems {{and to support}} scientific, cultural, educational and recreational activities {{in an area where}} the threatened <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus bicolor) is found. However, environmental and social groups have expressed concern that the reduced protection may result in the reserve being used by private interests or government sectors in an indiscriminate manner, as had happened with the downgrading of the conservation units on the Tapajós so a complex of hydroelectric power plants could be built..On 2-8 September 2014 eight researcher from the IPÊ, in partnership with the Grupo Natureza, Sociedade e Conservação (NSC), met with 169 families in the RDS to complete the Social and Environmental Indicators for Conservation Units questionnaire.A simplified set of 21 indicators was used. Results would be used to guide programs to promote sociobiodiversity in the region.|$|R
50|$|The zoo's {{historic}} Primate House {{first opened}} in 1927, featuring apes and monkeys from different locations and habitats {{in a series}} of small, identical barred cages typical of most early zoo exhibits. It became famous for its apes, including a gorilla named Bushman, until the Great Ape House opened. The Primate House's interior was heavily renovated in the early 1990s and it was re-opened as the Helen Brach Primate House in 1992 with eight diorama-style naturalistic exhibits simulating the swamps and rainforests of the animals' natural habitats in the wild, showcasing species such as black-and-white colobus monkeys, De Brazza's monkeys, Francois' langurs, <b>pied</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Allen's swamp monkeys and black howler monkeys. Perhaps its most notable residents are a family of northern white-cheeked gibbons that have a spacious room inside as well as an outdoor habitat for playing in the warm winter months. The zoo's male and female gibbons gave birth to baby Daxin on August 16, 2013.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.Some studies suggest that the northern shrike (Lanius excubitor) sings in winter often imitating small passerines that may be preyed upon when lured within reach.There has been one report of a margay using mimicry of the cry of an infant <b>pied</b> <b>tamarin</b> to try to lure an adult tamarin within striking distance.|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{appropriate}} stimuli associated with captive environments {{has been documented}} to cause several behavioural and physiological issues in captive species, including loss of natural behaviours, psychopathologies and decreased reproductive success. Providing free-ranging, naturalistic exhibits that replicate elements of a species’ natural environment is advocated {{as a means of}} promoting and preserving the natural behavioural repertoire in captive species. Exhibition of natural behaviour is considered beneficial to conservation in terms of animal health and welfare, reintroduction success, education and research. This study assessed differences in behaviour of emperor and <b>pied</b> <b>tamarins</b> housed in free-ranging and caged exhibits at Durrell Wildlife Park to determine the impact of exhibit type. Free-ranging tamarins were expected to exhibit a repertoire of behaviours more similar to that of wild tamarins based on their access to a more naturalistic and complex environment. Data was collected on a variety of behaviours, including activity, substrate use and communication, using instantaneous and one-zero sampling at 30 s intervals. Findings indicated that both free-ranging and caged tamarins exhibited natural behaviours; however, there were significant differences in mean rates of behaviours between conditions. Free-ranging tamarins exhibited significantly higher rates of locomotion (emperors: P < 0. 001; pieds: P < 0. 001), long calls (pieds: P = 0. 019) and alarm calls (emperors: P = 0. 012), and displayed competent use of the environment in terms of natural substrate use (emperors: P < 0. 001; pieds: P = 0. 007) and interspecific interactions. Caged tamarins exhibited significantly higher rates of affiliative (emperors: P = 0. 001; pieds: P = 0. 026) and agonistic (emperors: P = 0. 003) intraspecific interactions and time spent in contact (emperors: P = 0. 048; pieds: P = 0. 043), which was largely attributed to spatial restrictions imposed by caged exhibits. This study, consistent with existing literature, indicated that the free-ranging exhibit was conducive to the expression of a behavioural repertoire more similar to that of wild tamarins. This was probably a result of the increased behavioural opportunities available in the free-ranging exhibit, highlighting their importance in promoting wild-type behaviours. However, some mean rates of behaviour were still noticeably less than those documented in wild counterparts. Methods to further promote natural behaviours in both exhibits are recommended to facilitate ex situ and in situ conservation efforts...|$|R
