5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the expansion's {{official}} release, the PlayStation 4 version was re-released to fix performance issues. In a <b>performance</b> <b>analysis</b> by Eurogamers Digital Foundry, {{it was discovered that}} although Fallout 4 typically ran at 30 frames per second (fps), when the player was outside and, in Far Harbors foggy biomes, the frame rate could drop to 15 fps, and could drop even lower during action-oriented events such as firefights. In the same analysis, the Xbox One version was found to run at 20–30 fps but experienced various issues, such as stuttering and software lock-ups. The update toned down the level of fog, and was successful in making the game more stable.|$|E

Following the October violence, the IDF conducted an inquiry into the Iron Dome's performance and discovered that a radar failure caused some of the interceptors to miss their targets, a problem since corrected.

2500|$|For some {{versions}} of the algorithm, {{it is possible to}} prove that it is convergent (i.e., it is able to find the global optimum in finite time). The first evidence of a convergence ant colony algorithm was made in 2000, the graph-based ant system algorithm, and then algorithms for ACS and MMAS. Like most metaheuristics, {{it is very difficult to}} estimate the theoretical speed of convergence. In 2004, Zlochin and his colleagues showed that COA-type algorithms could be assimilated methods of stochastic gradient descent, on the cross-entropy and estimation of distribution algorithm. They proposed these metaheuristics as a [...] "research-based model". A <b>performance</b> <b>analysis</b> of continuous ant colony algorithm based on its various parameter suggest its sensitivity of convergence on parameter tuning.|$|E
