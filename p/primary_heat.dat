5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E

25|$|The heat {{causing the}} melting of a reactor may {{originate}} from the nuclear chain reaction, but more commonly decay {{heat of the}} fission products contained in the fuel rods is the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> source. The heat production from radioactive decay drops quickly, as the short half-life isotopes provide most of the heat and radioactive decay, with the curve of decay heat being a sum of the decay curves of numerous isotopes of elements decaying at different exponential half-life rates. A significant additional heat source can be the chemical reaction of hot metals with oxygen or steam.|$|E

40|$|We {{point out}} the {{priority}} of our paper (Mahajan et al. 2001) over (Aschwanden et al. 2007) in introducing the term ”Formation and <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> of the solar corona ” working out explicit models (theory as well as simulation) for coronal structure formation and heating. On analyzing the (Aschwanden et al. 2007) scenario of coronal heating process (shifted to the chromospheric heating) we stress, that for efficient loop formation, the primary upflows of plasma in chromosphere/transition region should be relatively cold and fast (as opposed to hot). It is during trapping and accumulation in closed field structures, that the flows thermalize (due to the dissipation of the short scale flow energy) leading to a bright and hot coronal structure. The formation and <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> of a closed coronal structure (loop at the end) are simultaneous and a process like the ”filling of the empty coronal loop by hot upflows ” is purely speculative and totally unlikely...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} are endeavouring to supply {{more of their}} energy from renewable resources. Such {{countries are}} also experiencing an aging population with {{a greater proportion of}} people aged ≥ 65 years. This demographic shift may reduce the uptake of renewable energy, if older person households are less inclined to accept change and adopt new technologies. This paper assesses whether such households have different behavioural responses to energy efficiency compared to the rest of society and investigates whether micro-generation renewable energy technologies {{are less likely to be}} adopted by these households. It uses conditional logit and mixed logit models to investigate the impact of age of household on <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> adoption, and also to assess the impact of older households on the installation of discretionary micro-generation technologies (solar thermal, solar voltaic, and wind power) to supplement existing heating and lighting systems. Results indicate that <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> choice is not affected but that older person households are less inclined to adopt micro-generation technologies...|$|R

50|$|In a {{traditional}} power plant delivering electricity to consumers, about 34.4% {{of the heat}} content of the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> energy source, such as biomass, coal, solar thermal, natural gas, petroleum or uranium, reaches the consumer, although the efficiency can be 20% for very old plants and 45% for newer gas plants. In contrast, a CHP system converts 15%-42% of the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> to electricity, {{and most of the}} remaining heat is captured for hot water or space heating.

50|$|Passive solar windows allow {{light and}} solar energy into a {{building}} while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape—while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy {{during the day and}} release it when temperatures cool at night—increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> system.|$|R
50|$|For either {{countertop}} or range-top {{two versions}} the <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> methods for the plates are through either direct gas-fired flame (natural gas and propane are typical), or via high-powered electrical elements.

50|$|The {{circulation}} {{of the atmosphere}} occurs due to thermal differences when convection becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than thermal radiation. On planets where the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> source is solar radiation, excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes.

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{evolution}} of chondrules is investigated for the stages including <b>primary</b> <b>heating</b> through accretion to parent-body processing {{to determine whether}} the chondrules could be hot during accretion. Theoretical attention is given to whether chondrites of different petrologic types could have originated by means of hot accretion or metamorphic reheating. Data are presented from cooling-rate experiments and from calculations of heat retention required for the hot-accretion scenario. The accretion of chondrules hotter than 800 C is shown to be inconsistent with constraints on chondrule thermal evolution, in particular the slow cooling environment of chondrules vs the apparent cooling of chondrites in cold environments. It is argued that petrologic chondrites are formed by cold accretion and subsequently by metamorphic heating...|$|R
