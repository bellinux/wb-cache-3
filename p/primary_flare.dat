40|$|The {{emission}} {{spectra of}} TeV blazars {{extend up to}} tens of TeV and the emission mechanism of the TeV γ-rays is explained by synchrotron self-Compton scattering in leptonic models. In these models the time variabilities of X-rays and TeV γ-rays are correlated. However, recent observations of 1 ES 1959 + 650 and Mrk 421 have found the "orphan" TeV γ-ray flares, i. e., TeV γ-ray flares without simultaneous X-ray flares. In this {{paper we propose a}} model for the "orphan" TeV γ-ray flares, employing an inhomogeneous leptonic jet model. After a <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> that accompanies flare-up both in X-rays and TeV γ-rays, radiation propagates in various directions in the comoving frame of the jet. When a dense region in the jet receives the radiation, X-rays are scattered by relativistic electrons/positrons to become TeV γ-rays. These γ-ray photons are observed as an "orphan" TeV γ-ray flare. The observed delay time between the primary and "orphan" flares is about two weeks and this is accounted for in our model for parameters such as Γ = 20, d = 4 × 10 ^ 17 cm, α = 3, and η = 1, where Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, d is the distance between the central black hole and the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> site, α/Γ is the angle between the jet axis and the direction of the motion of the dense region that scatters incoming X-rays produced by the <b>primary</b> <b>flare,</b> and η/Γ is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight.

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial structures of the UV and X-ray emissions and the magnetic field configuration in the November 12, 1980 flare observed from SMM have been studied. The UV observations were done in the O V and Fe XXI lines with a spatial resolution of 10 arcsec. The observations show that the impulsive UV bursts, and also the hard X-ray bursts by their temporal correlation with the impulsive O V emission, occurred in small localized kernels. By comparing the O V, Fe XXI, and X-ray raster images of the flare with the magnetogram, these emission kernels were identified as footpoints of interacting magnetic flux loops. The temporal evolution of the O V/Fe XXI emission shows that there was considerable preheating in the flare plasma some 8 - 9 minutes prior to {{the onset of the}} main hard X-ray bursts. The results are interpreted as indicating that the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> energy release occurred in a highly sheared multiloop structure, which lies along a magnetic neutral line. By either beam particle propagation or convective motion, flare energy is transported via a common footpoint to another loop which brightened later.

For a more comprehensive understanding of flares, it is necessary to perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis using observations from many satellites and ground-based observatories. For efficient data search, integration of different flare lists and representation of observational data, we have developed an Interactive Multi-Instrument Database of Solar Flares ([URL] The web accessible database is fully functional and allows the user to search for uniquely-identified flare events based on their physical descriptors and availability of observations by a particular set of instruments.

The secondary microwave burst in all five cases had a similar time profile to the primary burst with a delay of 2 to 25 s. The velocity of a triggering agent inferred from this delay and spatial separation is 10, 000 km to 100, 000 km/s. The intensity of the secondary burst was a factor of 3 to 25 smaller than that of the primary burst in all events except for one case in which it was a factor of 2 larger. The polarization degree of the secondary burst at 17 GHz was 35 %, significantly higher than the average value for typical impulsive bursts.

For two of the other events, X-ray images of he secondary source were obtained with the hard-X-ray imaging spectrometer on the Solar Maximum Mission.

However, direct soft X-ray (SXR) imaging of the process is rare, especially in remote brightenings associated with the <b>primary</b> <b>flares</b> that have recently attracted dramatic attention. We intend to find the evidence for chromospheric evaporation and figure out {{the cause of the}} process in sympathetic coronal bright points (CBPs), i. e., remote brightenings induced by the primary CBP. We utilise the high-cadence and high-resolution SXR observations of CBPs from the X-ray Telescope (XRT) aboard the Hinode spacecraft on 2009 August 23. We discover thermal conduction front propagating from the primary CBP, i. e., BP 1, to one of the sympathetic CBPs, i. e., BP 2 that is 60 away from BP 1. The apparent velocity of the thermal conduction is ∼ 138 km s^- 1. Afterwards, hot plasma flowed upwards into the loop connecting BP 1 and BP 2 at a speed of ∼ 76 km s^- 1, a clear signature of chromospheric evaporation. Similar upflow was also observed in the loop connecting BP 1 and the other sympathetic CBP, i. e., BP 3 that is 80 away from BP 1, though less significant than BP 2. The apparent velocity of the upflow is ∼ 47 km s^- 1. The thermal conduction front propagating from BP 1 to BP 3 was not well identified except for the jet-like motion also originating from BP 1. We propose that the gentle chromospheric evaporation in the sympathetic CBPs were caused by thermal conduction originating from the primary CBP. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Extending {{the work}} of Czerny et al. (2004), we model the {{fractional}} variability amplitude due to distributions of hot spots co-orbiting on the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. From defined radial distributions, our code samples random positions for the hot spots across the disk. The local spot emission is computed as reprocessed radiation coming from a compact primary source above the disk. The structure of the hot spot and the anisotropy of the re-emission are taken into account. We compute the fractional variability spectra expected from such spot ensembles and investigate dependencies on the parameters describing the radial spot distribution. We consider the fractional variability F_var {{with respect to the}} spectral mean and also the so-called point-to-point F_pp. Our method includes relativistic corrections for the curved space-time; the black hole angular momentum is a free parameter and subject to the fitting procedure. We confirm that the rms-variability spectra involve intrinsic randomness at a significant level when the number of flares appearing during the total observation time is too small. Furthermore, F_var is not always compatible with F_pp. For MCG - 6 - 30 - 15, we can reproduce the short-timescale variability and model the suppressed variability in the energy range of the Kalpha line without any need to postulate reprocessing farther away from the center. An increasing rate of energy production by the flares {{toward the center of the}} disk, a fast rotation of the central black hole, and considerable suppression of the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> emission are required.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} our multiwavelength {{observations}} of the simultaneous transverse and longitudinal oscillations in a quiescent prominence on 2015 June 29. A C 2. 4 flare took place in active region 12373, which {{was associated with a}} pair of short ribbons and a remote ribbon. During the impulsive phase of the flare, a coronal jet spurted out of the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> site and propagated in the northwest direction at an apparent speed of ∼ 224 km s^- 1. Part of the jet stopped near the remote ribbon. The remaining part continued moving forward before stopping to the east of prominence. Once the jet encountered the prominence, it pushed the prominence to oscillate periodically. The transverse oscillation of the eastern part (EP) of prominence can be divided into two phases. In phase I, the initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping timescale are ∼ 4. 5 Mm, ∼ 20 km s^- 1, ∼ 25 minutes, and ∼ 7. 5 hr, respectively. In phase II, the initial amplitude increases to ∼ 11. 3 Mm while the initial velocity halves to ∼ 10 km s^- 1. The period increases by a factor of ∼ 3. 5. The western part (WP) of prominence also experienced transverse oscillation. The initial amplitude is only ∼ 2 Mm and the velocity is less than 10 km s^- 1. The period (∼ 27 minutes) is slightly longer than that of EP in phase I. To the east of prominence, a handful of horizontal threads experienced longitudinal oscillation. The initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping timescale are ∼ 52 Mm, ∼ 50 km s^- 1, ∼ 99 minutes, and 2. 5 hr, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of simultaneous transverse and longitudinal prominence oscillations triggered by a coronal jet.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of an impulsive microwave burst on the Sun with both high spatial and spectral resolution, {{made with the}} Solar Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. The burst was imaged in total intensity, as well as both right and left circular polarization, at 24 frequencies distributed logarithmically over the range 2. 4 - 14. 0 GHz, with spatial resolution ranging from ∼ 5 ″- 29 ″. This powerful new technique for studying microwave bursts shows that: (1) even a relatively weak burst with a simple temporal and spectral morphology in total power can have a complex spatial structure, comprising three distinct sources; (2) the burst structure changes with frequency so that images at widely spaced frequencies show a different number and/or location of sources, whereas images at closely spaced frequencies reveal the relationship between sources at different frequencies; and (3) the brightness temperature spectrum of each source is different, so that the composite total-power spectrum is not representative of the spectrum of any individual source. We used the measured brightness temperature spectrum to infer the emission process responsible for each microwave source, and to derive physical conditions in the source region. We confirmed our predictions using soft X-ray measurements from GOES, soft X-ray images from Yohkoh, and Ha flare images together with sunspot and magnetogram images from the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The primary microwave source, located close to but not coincident with either the lone flaring soft X-ray kernel or primary Ha kernel, had a peak brightness temperature of only ∼ 10 7 K, but nevertheless was produced by nonthermal gyrosynchrotron emission. The two secondary sources, both without any soft X-ray or Hα counterparts, had lower turnover frequencies but also were produced by nonthermal gyrosynchrotron emission.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{proposed}} for this grant {{was to develop a}} promising model for ion acceleration in impulsive solar flares. Solar flares are among the most energetic and interesting phenomena in the solar system, releasing up to 10 (exp 32) ergs of energy over timescales ranging from a few tens of seconds to a few tens of minutes. Much of this energy appears as energetic electrons and ions, which produce a wide range of observable radiations. These radiations, in turn, are valuable diagnostics of the acceleration mechanism, the identification of which is the fundamental goal of solar flare research. The specific mechanism we proposed to investigate was based on cascading Alfven waves, the essence of which was as follows: During the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> energy release, it is widely believed that magnetic free energy is made available through the large-scale restructuring of the flare magnetic field. Any perturbation of a magnetic field will lead to the formation of MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) waves of wavelength comparable to the initial scale of the perturbation. Since the scalesize of a flare energy release region will likely be 10 (exp 8) - 10 (exp 9) cm, the MHD waves will be of very long wavelength. However, {{it is well known that}} wave steepening will lead to a cascade of wave energy to smaller wavelengths. Now, MHD waves consist of two specific modes-the Alfven wave and the fast mode wave, and it is the Alfven wave which can interact with the ambient ions and accelerate them via cyclotron resonance. As the Alfven waves cascade to smaller wavenumbers, they can resonate with ions of progressively lower energy, until they eventually (actually, this is less than approx. 1 s) can resonate with ions in the thermal distribution. These ions are then energized out of the thermal background and, since lower-frequency waves are already present as a result of the cascading, to relativistic energies. Hence, cascading Alfven waves naturally accelerate ions from thermal to relativistic energies in one step with one basic mechanism...|$|E

Its apparent isotropic gamma-ray luminosity (E> 100 MeV) averaged over ∼ 3 years of observations and peaking on 2010 October 14 / 15 at 2. 9 X 10 ^ 50 erg s^- 1, makes it among the brightest high-redshift Fermi blazars. No published model with a single lens can account {{for all of the}} observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radio observations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 days after a <b>primary</b> <b>flare,</b> with flux about a factor 1. 5 less. Two large gamma-ray flares of PKS 1830 - 211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period and no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows us to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the two lensed images. Swift XRT observations from a dedicated Target of Opportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significant correlation of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. The spectral energy distribution can be modeled with inverse Compton scattering of thermal photons from the dusty torus. The implications of the LAT data in terms of variability, the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-ray flux ratios are discussed. Microlensing effects, absorption, size and location of the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, an energy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by the lens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses for understanding our results.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} {{of a huge}} number of electrons and ions to relativistic energies over timescales ranging from several seconds to several tens of seconds is the fundamental problem in high-energy solar physics. The cascading turbulence model we have developed has been shown previously (e. g., Miller 2000; Miller & Roberts 1995; Miner, LaRosa, & Moore 1996) to account for all the bulk features (such as acceleration timescales, fluxes, total number of energetic particles, and maximum energies) of electron and proton acceleration in impulsive solar flares. While the simulation of this acceleration process is involved, the essential idea of the model is quite simple, and consists of just a few parts: 1. During the <b>primary</b> <b>flare</b> energy release phase, we assume that low-amplitude MHD Alfven and fast mode waves are excited at long wavelengths, say comparable {{to the size of the}} event (although the results are actually insensitive to this initial wavelength). While an assumption, this appears reasonable in light of the likely highly turbulent nature of the flare. 2. These waves then cascade in a Kolmogorov-like fashion to smaller wavelengths (e. g., Verma et al. 1996), forming a power-law spectral density in wavenumber space through the inertial range. 3. When the mean wavenumber of the fast mode waves has increased sufficiently, the transit-time acceleration rate (Miller 1997) for superAlfvenic electrons can overcome Coulomb energy losses, and these electrons are accelerated out of the thermal distribution and to relativistic energies (Miller et al. 1996). As the Alfven waves cascade to higher wavenumbers, they can cyclotron resonate with progressively lower energy protons. Eventually, they will resonate with protons in the tail of the thermal distribution, which will then be accelerated to relativistic energies as well (Miller & Roberts 1995). Hence, both ions and electrons are stochastically accelerated, albeit by different mechanisms and different waves. 4. When the protons become superAlfvenic (above about 1 MeV/nucleon), they too can suffer transit-time acceleration by the fast mode waves and will receive an extra acceleration "kick. " The basic overall objective of this 1 year effort was to construct a spatially-dependent version of this acceleration model and this has been realized...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{possibility}} that a tidal disruption event near a dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH) can give rise to spectral features of iron in 6 - 7 keV X-ray signal: a relativistic line profile emerges from debris illuminated and ionised by an intense flash produced from the destroyed star. This could provide a unique way to determine parameters of the system. We consider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape (i. e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive black hole, and also the <b>primary</b> irradiation <b>flare</b> is expected to occur more likely near the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. This suggests that the reprocessing of primary X-rays results in a transient profile that should be relevant for tidal-disruption events (TDE) in otherwise under-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i. e. with no prior accretion disc. Resonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbital eccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them close to the tidal radius, where they can give rise to TDEs. The proposed scenario appears to be distinguishably different from the standard scheme of lamp-post model for {{the origin of the}} relativistic line in active galaxies, where the source is thought to be located predominantly near the symmetry axis.

The positions of the Halpha emission and hard X-ray sources with respect to the current-free extrapolation of the MDI photospheric magnetic field and the characteristics of the radio emission provide evidence of the closed geometry of the magnetic field structure and the flare process in low altitude magnetic loops. In agreement with the predictions of some solar flare models, the hard X-ray sources are located on the external edges of the Halpha emission and show chromospheric plasma heated by the non-thermal electrons. The fast changes of Halpha intensities are located not only inside the hard X-ray sources, as expected if they are the signatures of the chromospheric response to the electron bombardment, but also away from them.

40|$|Context. In solar flares, inverse Compton {{scattering}} (ICS) of photospheric photons {{might give}} rise to detectable hard X-ray photon fluxes from the corona where ambient densities are too low for significant bremsstrahlung or recombination. γ-ray lines and continuum in some large flares imply {{the presence of the}} necessary∼ 100 MeV electrons and positrons, the latter as by-products of GeV energy ions. Recent observations of coronal hard X-ray sources in particular prompt us to reconsider here the possible contribution of ICS. Aims. We aim to evaluate the ICS X-ray fluxes to be expected from prescribed populations of relativistic electrons and positrons in the solar corona. The ultimate aim is to determine if ICS coronal X-ray sources might offer a new diagnostic window on relativistic electrons and ions in flares. Methods. We use the complete formalism of ICS to calculate X-ray fluxes from possible populations of <b>flare</b> <b>primary</b> electrons and secondary positrons, paying attention to the incident photon angular distribution near the solar surface and thus improving on the assumption of isotropy made in previous solar discussions. Results. Both primary electrons and secondary positrons produce very hard ICS X-ray spectra. The anisotropic primary radiation field results in pronounced centre-to-limb variation in predicted fluxes and spectra, with the most intense spectra, extending to the highest photon energies, expected from limb flares. Acceptable numbers of electrons or positrons could account for RHESSI coronal X/γ-ray sources Conclusions. Some coronal X-ray sources at least might be interpreted in terms of ICS by relativistic electrons or positrons, particularly when sources appear at such low ambient densities that bremsstrahlung appears implausible...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case study}} of the {{location}} of particle acceleration sites during an impulsive flare and its subsequent coronal shock which occurred on 09 September 1989. Joint radio, hard X-ray/#gamma#-ray, and H_#alpha# observations of the flare impulsive emissions reveal that electron and ion acceleration results from successive energy release in different magnetic structures. In this paper we attempt to identify these magnetic structures, during both the impulsive flare and the coronal shock propagation. This is done by tracing essential features identified in high time resolution radio spectral and hard X-ray/#gamma#-ray data in radio images, and comparing the spatial information with sequences of H_#alpha# images and a static figure of the coronal magnetic field lines derived by extrapolating photospheric field measurements. During the impulsive phase signatures of energy release are found in different coronal height ranges which are magnetically connected with a small part of an underlying active region that is invaded by an expanding H_#alpha# flare ribbon. The magnetic field configuration comprises two sites at heights between 2 x 10 " 4 and 8 x 10 " 4 km above the <b>primary</b> highly confined <b>flare.</b> These sites are characterized by coronal magnetic field line systems crossing at nearly right angle. This provides for potential sites of efficient energy release and particle acceleration without demanding for extreme twist. The subsequent shock wave, revealed by type II radio burst emission, is found to propagate over large distances (#propor to# 1 R_sun) through the corona and to accelerate electrons in regions where it propagates along and across the ambient magnetic field.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] bubble plumes have been acoustically imaged in the water column above marine gas hydrate deposits in many studies, {{little is known about the}} temporal variation in plume intensity. In July 2008, we conducted surveys using 3. 5 and 12 kHz echosounders and a 75 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) over the northern and southern summits of Hydrate Ridge, on the Cascadia continental margin. Our study included multiple surveys at both sites, including a survey of the northern summit that was repeated 16 times in 19 hours. Seafloor depth at the northern summit is 600 m, well within the hydrate stability zone (HSZ), which was below 510 m during our survey based on CTD data. Three distinct flares (a term used to denote the acoustic signature of bubble plumes) were detected at Northern Hydrate Ridge (NHR) and one was detected at Southern Hydrate Ridge (SHR), coincident with where flares were observed a decade ago, indicating that the supply of gas is stable on this time scale. High-resolution bathymetric surveys of NHR and SHR acquired with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flown 50 m above the seafloor indicate that flare locations are correlated with a distinctive pattern of short-wavelength seafloor roughness, supporting the inference of long-term stability in the location of bubble expulsion sites. As in previous studies at Hydrate Ridge, flares were not detected with the 3. 5 kHz echosounder but were clearly imaged at 12 kHz. By reprocessing routine shipboard ADCP data, we show that they are also observed in at 75 kHz, indicating that a wide range of bubble sizes is present. The intensity of the flares varied strongly with time. Two <b>primary</b> sources for <b>flares</b> were observed. One, located on the regional topographic high, showed continuous activity, with two times periods of particularly strong flares that are not correlated with tidal height. The other, located on a local topographic high, shows a pulse of increased backscatter that occurred on a falling tide. While the time period of observation is not enough to constrain the effect of tidal changes in seafloor pressure on venting, the data suggest that tides are not the dominant factor controlling release of bubbles from the seafloor. The data support previously suggested models in which temporary sealing of vents by gas hydrate formation and breaking of these barriers as gas pressure builds up is responsible for "burp-like" pulses of gas expulsion. We also report the first observations of flares originating within the HSZ that extend well above the HSZ with little loss of backscatter intensity. These represent a new source of methane injection into the upper ocean and possibly the atmosphere. Flare extension above the HSZ may be due to coating of some bubbles by oil or biofilms or to inclusion of particulate matter (possibly including floating pieces of hydrate) in the plumes. Although this study provides tantalizing new information on both short-term variability in gas expulsion rate and long-term stability of vent sites, longer, well-calibrated observations that integrate bubble flux over entire vent fields as a function of time are needed to develop accurate models for the flux of methane into the ocean and atmosphere from seafloor methane vents...|$|R
