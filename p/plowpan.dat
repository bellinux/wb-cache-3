40|$|A 2 -year {{field study}} {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} subsoiling and nematicide application, alone and in combination, on the growth and yield of field corn in a sandy soil in north-central Florida. The field had a 25 - 30 -cm-deep tillage pan (<b>plowpan)</b> and was infested with Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Trichodorus christei, and Pratylenchus spp. Subsoiling increased corn yield both years, and the residual effect of subsoiling {{in the first year}} increased yields in the second year. Preplant application of DD injected in-row increased yields and reduced nematode populations. At-planting applications of DD injected in-row and carbofuran in-furrow or in a band were less effective than subsoiling in increasing yields and reducing nematode numbers. Interactions between subsoiling and nematicide treatments occurred in the second year...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a worldwide}} problem in modern agriculture associated with overuse of heavy machinery and intensification of cropping systems. Though tillage is traditionally used to alleviate compaction effect, increasing concerns about {{environmental impacts of}} tillage have led to interest in conservational tillage systems and incorporation of cover crops into crop rotations. Previous study showed soybean (Glycine Max L.) roots grew through a <b>plowpan</b> soil using channels left by canola (Brassica napus) cover crop roots, a process termed “biodrilling ” to alleviate compaction effect. However, {{this study did not}} provide any quantitative data to support the observational conclusion. We studied “biodrilling ” abilities of three cover crops and the effects of “biodrilling ” on corn (Zea mays) /soybean growth by conducting three experiments. The first two experiments included three surface horizon compaction treatments (high, medium and no compaction), four cover crops [FR (forage radish: Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus, cultivar ‘Daikon’) and rape (rapeseed: Brassica napus, cultivar ‘Essex’) (tap-rooted species in the Brassica family), rye (cereal rye: Secal...|$|E

Previous study showed soybean (Glycine Max L.) roots grew through a <b>plowpan</b> soil using channels left by canola (Brassica napus) cover crop roots, a process termed "biodrilling" to alleviate compaction effect. However, {{this study did not}} provide any quantitative data to support the observational conclusion. We studied "biodrilling" abilities of three cover crops and the effects of "biodrilling" on corn (Zea mays) /soybean growth by conducting three experiments. The first two experiments included three surface horizon compaction treatments (high, medium and no compaction), four cover crops [FR (forage radish: Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus, cultivar `Daikon') and rape (rapeseed: Brassica napus, cultivar `Essex') (tap-rooted species in the Brassica family), rye (cereal rye: Secale cereale L., cultivar `Wheeler') (fibrous-rooted species) and NC (no cover crop) ] in Exp. 1, and three cover crops (FR, rape and NC) in Exp. 2. The third experiment was conducted on field with a legacy <b>plowpan</b> (subsoil compaction) using FR, rye and NC cover crops. Roots of FR were least inhibited by compaction, while rye roots were severely arrested by compaction. The order of "biodrilling" ability was FR > rape > rye. Soil bulk density, strength and least limiting water range were controlled by compaction treatments. Soil air permeability was greatly reduced by compaction. Air permeability was greater in rape/FR treatments than in rye/NC treatments under high/medium compaction. Corn/soybean root penetrations, subsoil water uptake in the compacted soils were enhanced by FR/rape treatments but not by rye/NC treatments. Compaction decreased corn yield only in Exp. 2 where soil sand fraction was greater. The yield of corn was greater in three cover crop treatments than in NC control. In terms of "biodrilling", Brassica cover crops (FR and rape) were more effective than rye cover crop, would alleviate effects of soil compaction on plant growth in no-till farming systems...|$|E
40|$|Compost {{application}} {{tends to}} increase soil fertility {{and is likely}} to modify soil hydrodynamic properties by acting on soil structural porosity. Two composts, a municipal solid waste compost (MSW) and a co-compost of green wastes and sewage sludge (SGW), have been applied every other year for 6 yr to cultivated plots located on a silt loam soil in the Parisian Basin, France. Four soil zones were defined in the topsoil after plowing: the <b>plowpan</b> located {{at the base of the}} plowed layer, compacted ({Delta}) or noncompacted ({Gamma}) zones located within the plowed layer, and interfurrows created by plowing and containing a large quantity of crop residues together with the recently-applied compost. To assess the effect of compost application on the near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, infiltration rates were measured using a tension disc infiltrometer at three water pressure potentials - 0. 6, - 0. 2, and - 0. 05 kPa in the various zones of the soil profile. Compost addition decreased K(sat) in the interfurrows after plowing by almost one order of magnitude with average values of 5. 6 x 10 (- 5) m. s(- 1) in the MSW plot and 4. 1 x 10 (- 5) m. s(- 1) in the SGW plot, against 2. 2 x 10 (- 4) m. s(- 1) in the control plot. This effect had disappeared 6 mo after plowing when the average K(sat) in the control plot had decreased to 1. 9 x 10 (- 5) m. s(- 1) while that in the compost-amended plots remained stable...|$|E
40|$|Bangladeshi {{agriculture}} {{has undergone}} a substantial intensification. Continued and accelerated agricultural growth will require intensification to continue. There has been rising concern, however, that intensive agriculture may not be sustainable and {{that it may be}} damaging to the environment or to other productive sectors. Rising average yields and rising production in Bangladesh have tended to mask evidence of declining productivity. Although data are weak, numerous sources of evidence point to declining productivity. Analysis of official data on yield trends at the district level shows that, despite rising input levels, yields have been declining or stagnant on about two-thirds of the area planted to modern varieties in the boro season in the last decade, and stagnant throughout the country in the aman season. Yield declines are strongly associated with the length of time that intensive production practices have been employed in each district. The results of long-term trials by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) also indicate that intensive rice cultivation can result in declining yields, even under good management and with full recommended doses of all nutrients being applied. Farmer perceptions also support this conclusion: farmers often claim that yields have been declining and that higher fertilizer applications are necessary to maintain yields. Stagnant or declining yields in the context of rising inputs indicate that land degradation is reducing productivity; if increases in input use had not counteracted the effects of degradation, yields might have fallen even further. This evidence is consistent with patterns of yield change in other Green Revolution countries, many of which have also experienced a slowdown in the rate of growth of production and yield, and with research at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). There is considerable debate over the exact causes of declining productivity. In Bangladesh, the most likely cause is nutrient imbalances. High-yielding modern varieties are far more demanding of soil nutrients than much lower yielding local varieties had been, a problem worsened by the increasing prevalence of multiple cropping. Chemical fertilizer use has increased, but not sufficiently to compensate for the higher rates of offtake, and has been offset by decreasing organic content of the soils as a result of reductions in applications of farmyard manure, which is in increasing demand for use as fuel, and increased protection against flooding, which has reduced the deposition of organic matter content from flood waters. In general, applications of nitrogen are adequate but those of other nutrients often are not. Changes in soil physical and chemical properties, such as changing quality and quantity of organic matter and formation of a <b>plowpan,</b> also play a role in declining yields.
