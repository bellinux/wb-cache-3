The aim is to promote a sector industrial politics and a regulation of the {{services of general interest}} that could be able to raise, according to the italian constitution, an effectiveness and efficiency logic of the services, enhancing the autonomy principles of the local bodies. The main element that should drive the <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>sector</b> regulation is the centrality of the «citizen-user» with his specific needs of access to the essential services of the territory where he lives and works. The attention to the local peculiarities highlights the need, and not just the will, to defend the constitutional prerogatives of local bodies’ autonomy and, at the same time, it widens the forms of diffusion of the rules created to avoid forms of discrimination in the ways local public utilities are trusted. This means to plan a «reform» of the services of public interest based not just on the organization form of the offer but, first of all, on the communities need...|$|E

In this research, the goal is to identify the Nash equilibrium point in the bi-matrix game of economic and social indicators of the companies of <b>Public</b> <b>Utilities</b> <b>sector</b> listed on the BM & FBovespa. The research was conducted with a sample of 26 companies. To evaluate the economic performance it was used the profitability and market indicators; for evaluating the social performance, it was used the indicators derived from the VAD (Value Added Statement). In the estimation of earnings among indicators, it was used the standard parameters of the multiple linear regression. The obtained results highlighted the existence of at least one point of equilibrium for the years analyzed and, especially in the models, two points of equilibrium were proposed for 2009 and 2011 and three for 2010.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to solving {{the debate about the}} framework of rules and institutions applicable to <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>sectors,</b> by adopting both economic theories, such as natural monopoly, network effects, and public goods, and practical analysis of the telecommunications sectors for both Australia and the United States. Governments must reevaluate the framework regulating <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>sectors</b> whenever rapid technological advancements occur. This thesis argues that the antitrust authority better enforces competition rules, and that the sector-specific authority better enforces technical and universal service rules. The justification of the special competition rule concerning bottleneck facilities access should be limited. As for the universal service scheme, the enforcer should ensure competitive neutrality and adopt pro-competitive instruments. This framework would allow for a more market-oriented and economy-wide regulatory administration, as well as enforcement of the universal service scheme based on a more accurate reflection of the fundamental values of citizens...|$|R

40|$|The future {{quality of}} water {{is one of the}} most {{pressing}} environmental problems in most Asian developing countries, like Philippines. With urbanization, water governance has to cope with increasing demands for steady supply and access to potable water, both for the immediate and long term. National institutions usually manage water supply/quality and sanitation. However, local governments still lack the ability to ensure efficient and sustained delivery of basic water services. Thus, some institutional development interventions among local governments were initiated to monitor, improve and sustain water quality and conservation for domestic, industrial, agricultural and other uses. Strengthening the local government's mechanism is important for integrating efforts, coordinating and managing integrated water resources and related water operations in the area and driving the different sectors involved to treat water resource in an integrated manner. Such initiatives hopes to shift from fragmented to integrated local water agenda and action, to be catalyzed by an integrated management scheme at the local government level. Specific targets for capacity-building are the strategic planning and development of the local government and the <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>sector</b> that manages the water treatment facility.

40|$|Reorganisation {{policies}} {{in the field of}} water management, in Italy, are an interesting issue to analyse, in order to evaluate the new role of public utilities in an innovative and complex strategy for local development. The core of the reform, started with “Legge Galli” (Law 36 of 1994), is the delicate balance between the public administration role of promotion and check, and the private sector role of implementation of investments and management of new water agencies. Due to the crucial role of networking strategies between local authorities and industries, the success of the Galli Reform will be the success of a innovative strategy of local development, in which co-operative linkages, management innovation, technology transfer and advanced training will be the basic tools. All these issues are crucial in Southern Italy, particularly in Campania, a region that policy of European Union classified as “Ob. 1 ” (under-developed region), for the high levels of unemployment. The analysis of the Campania’s “Regional Operative Plan” for 2000 - 2006, shows, above all in the field of water management, the choice of a strategy of local development, linking together public and private sector. In fact, the “Regional Operative Plan” for Campania give to private sector a crucial role fort the fund raising for the implementation of the reform, in co-operation with public funds. In this perspective, new organisational strategies and price policies are very important, but the core of the management innovation choice is the role of project financing. Another key question is the protection of local environment and the correct management of water supply and demand. The adoption of these innovative strategies in the field of public utilities are functional to a new policy of local development, based on participation, cost and responsibility sharing among all the actors of local innovation system. Key question of the Italian reform of the water management sector are common to all the Italian <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>sector,</b> that, in recent years, has been living an important evolution towards new management models balancing economic efficiency and public welfare. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} disclosure of executive remuneration in listed companies, by studying in-depth, in particular, the rules and recommendations adopted in industrialised Countries and to verify the effective communication behaviours adopted in Italy and in foreign Countries by listed public utility companies in relation to cognitive-evaluation stakeholders’ expectations and the observance of the regulations in force. Disclosure of the remuneration is an important topic, considering also the potential conflicts between: form, structure and level of executive directors’ remuneration and corporate performance optimization in the long term. Therefore, the following research questions are: What are the remuneration systems, disclosure tools and regulations about remuneration policies; executive directors’ remuneration; share-based remuneration adopted in the international context? What are the main results coming out from the comparison of remuneration systems disclosure by rules, regulations and recommendation provided {{in the two groups}} considered (“European” and “non-European” Countries) and the level of disclosure conformity and alignment to facilitate information accessibility and comparability to stakeholders? How have the listed companies operating in the <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>sector</b> implemented remuneration systems disclosure in the corporate behaviour in order to assess if the companies surveyed behave in conformity with transparency provisions and assure information completeness? The topic is interesting because, in listed companies, the disclosure of remuneration has recently attracted particular attention, especially with regard to remuneration of individual directors of the company, executive and non-executive or supervisory directors. From this analysis, it firmly stands out that the level of corporate remuneration systems disclosure, strictly connected to the provisions system in force is more satisfying where the reference rules are structured and detailed. In fact, with reference to several elements, we have found out that, where specific legal provisions are lacking, information provided by companies is brief or even missing. This leads to ponder about the importance of adequate regulations, able to assure an effective response to transparency needs and protection to all stakeholders, in light of the present global arena, as well. It is, therefore, desirable and we hope that policy recommendations will be considered, the achievement at an international level of representation models containing uniform and comparable information, both in form (tabular and narrative) and contents. The existence of international bodies which promote this process, at an international level, would spur further towards the creation of a system able to assign a higher value to the regulations of each country and to current corporate best practices...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{productivity}} {{advances in}} the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>sector</b> have been high, substantially mitigating the impact of inflation on operating costs. However, today's high rates of inflation, coupled with regulatory lag, have resulted in profit erosion which impacts adversely on the utility's ability to attract new investor capital. One possible {{solution to this problem}} is the two-way automatic revenue adjustment clause, coupled with an incentive to higher efficiency. Several automatic revenue adjustment clauses, proposed or in operation, are reviewed by the author, with emphasis on the "cost and efficiency adjustment clause. " If a utility maintains its total productivity {{at the level of the}} prior period, this adjustment clause permits half the increase in unit costs to be recovered automatically; the other half may be passed on to the extent the company is able to increase its productivity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} measure for the {{importance}} of aggregate shocks for fluctuations in job flows at the firm level. Using data for the Portuguese economy, we find that large and old firms exhibit higher relative sensitivity to aggregate shocks and have a disproportional influence over the dynamics of aggregate job reallocation. In the overall economy, since large and old firms reallocate jobs less procyclically than small and young firms, job reallocation is less procyclical than if firm size and age classes were equally sensitive to aggregate shocks. A similar result applies in the manufacturing and the transportation and <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>sectors.</b> However, in the services and retail trade sectors the reallocation patterns are more similar across firm size and age, likely reflecting the expansion of existing and the creation of new industries. We conclude that large and old firms seem relatively more important to assess the state of the business cycle. Labor market; Employment (Economic theory) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{franchising}} {{of public}} service activities (concessions de service public) has traditionally {{played a significant role}} in infrastructural provision in France, notably in the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>sectors</b> of electricity, gas and water. Concession accounting is troubled by two major problems. First, operating capability maintenance (OCM) is not achieved, primarily because of the failure to tackle the issue of backlog depreciation. In sectors with high capital intensity, long asset lives and marked technological change, the restrictive legislation pertaining to asset revaluation and, hence, depreciation, aggravates this OCM problem. Second, financial capital maintenance (FCM) is not achieved, particularly when amortization of the enterprise's investment in those concession assets which are surrendered to public authorities (I'amortissement de caducite) is abandoned. This evaluation of French practice is policy relevant for two distinct reasons. First, given the significance of concessions in France, it is important to establish a coherent translation of the principles of the Plan comptable general 1982 to concession assets; this will not be achieved by the proposals of the 1992 Committee on Concessions, whose implementation would represent a retreat from economic relevance. Second, the concession model is experiencing both a revival in francophone Africa and extension to the United Kingdom. ...|$|R

40|$|To avoid high profit levels often {{experienced}} {{in countries where}} monopolies in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>sectors</b> are regulated through price-cap mechanisms, several regulatory agencies have recently introduced profit-sharing (PS) clauses aimed at obtaining price reductions {{to the benefit of}} consumers. However, the implementation of these PS clauses has often turned out to be severely con- trained by the incompleteness of the price-cap itself and the non-verifiability of firms 9 ̆ 2 profits. This paper studies the properties of a second-best optimal PS mechanism designed by the regulator to induce the regulated monopolist to divert part of its profits to custormers. In a dynamic model where a reg- ulated monopolist manages a long-term franchise contract and the regulator has the option to revoke the contract if there are serious welfare losses, we first derive the welfare maximising PS mechanism under verifiability of prof- its. Subsequently, we explore the sustainability of the PS mechanism under non-verifiability of profits. In a infinite-horizon game, it is showed that the dynamic sustainability of the PS clause crucially depends upon the magni- tude of the regulator 9 ̆ 2 s revocation cost: the higher this cost, the lower the profit shared and the less frequent the regulator 9 ̆ 2 s PS introduction.
