2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., <b>polymerization</b> <b>processes</b> is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E

Addition of cobalt salts leads to a facile low temperature initiation of the <b>polymerization</b> <b>process.</b> The <b>polymerization</b> <b>process</b> was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry [DSC] and vibrating probe rheological measurements.
