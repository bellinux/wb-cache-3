40|$|Preliminary index {{diagrams}} (PIDs) are land <b>parcel</b> <b>index</b> maps traced from unrectified aerial photographs. They {{were put}} to use {{in many developing countries}} including Kenya as a temporary measure to speed up land registration pending preparation of more accurate documents. However, half a century later, they are still actively in use. Though the PIDs have satisfied the immediate need in the provision of title to land, there is a growing concern from users about the boundary information obtainable from these maps for purposes of land administration, for instance land valuation and planning. The accuracy in acreage of land registered under Registered Land Act in Kenya is guaranteed only to within an error of 20 %. Currently, high-resolution satellite imagery amongst other geo-information technologies is proving useful for cadastral surveys. This paper looks at the possibility of integrating this technology into cadastral surveying in Kenya...|$|E
40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made with rural land certification in Ethiopia. This process, however, has been mainly confined to the first phase certificates – those without a georeference. In 2008, a team conducted a simple field test using high resolution imagery. On-site tests were performed to determine if Quickbird satellite imagery could be used to establish <b>parcel</b> <b>index</b> maps in selected villages. The data collection in the field was performed with the help of land rights holders and local officials. The image quality of the plots at a scale of 1 : 2000 was sufficiently high to allow the parties to easily understand the images and contribute input, making the process very participatory. Many land rights holders were not able to present their certificates, suggesting updating issues. Even though the test was not well prepared, it yielded useful experiences and data. This limited data set was processed initially with ArcGIS and later with the first prototype of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM), which is open-source software. Processing the limited graphical display of the boundaries was relatively easy, but trying to link the data to Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates (collected, at the same time, with hand-held GPS) was not immediately possible due to offsets caused by a number of reasons. Nevertheless, the approach seems very useful for lower land value areas where coverage is more important than (absolute) accuracy. Geo-information and Land DevelopmentOTB Research Institut...|$|E
40|$|Shape {{analysis}} {{is of interest}} in many fields of spatial science and planning including land management in rural areas. In particular, evaluating the shape of existing land parcels is critical when implementing rural development schemes such as land consolidation. However, existing land <b>parcel</b> shape <b>indices</b> have major deficiencies: completely different shapes of parcels may have the same index value or similar parcel shapes may have different index scores. Thus, {{there is a clear}} requirement for a more accurate and reliable measurement method. This paper therefore presents a new <b>parcel</b> shape <b>index</b> (PSI) which integrates a geographical information system (GIS) with a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method. It involves the amalgamated outcome of six geometric measures represented by value functions involving a mathematical representation of judgements by experts that compare each geometric measure with that of an optimum parcel shape defined for land consolidation projects. The optimum shape has a PSI value of 1 while the worst shape has a value close to 0. The shape measures used in the model include length of sides, acute angles, reflex angles, boundary points, compactness and regularity. The paper uses data for two case study areas in Cyprus to demonstrate the superiority of the new PSI over three existing shape indices employed in other studies. The methodology utilized here can be implemented in other disciplines dealing with the assessment of objects that can be compared to an optimum...|$|R
40|$|Area shape {{analysis}} {{has been a}} subject of focus for research in geography and other disciplines for many years. However, existing area shape indices present significant weaknesses {{for the analysis of}} land parcels in an agricultural context as they do not measure shape in an appropriate, reliable or explicit manner. This article presents a new <b>parcel</b> shape <b>index</b> (PSI) which integrates six geometric parameters through multi-attribute decision-making, combined with value functions for parameter standardization. The superior performance of the new PSI in relation to three existing indices is demonstrated through a case study area in Cyprus. The methodology can be applied in other contexts aimed at assessing the quality of a particular shape compared to an optimum...|$|R
40|$|Land {{fragmentation}} is a {{major problem}} {{in different parts of the}} world. This paper presents a new land fragmentation index which overcomes the weaknesses of existing indices by integrating a number of land fragmentation factors, allowing the user to select which factors are included and to apply weights to the factors selected. When applied to a case study area in Cyprus, the new "global land fragmentation index" outperforms the existing indices. The paper also introduces a new "parcel shape index" and a new transformation process known as the "mean standardisation method. " Sensitivity analysis is carried out to indicate the impact of changing weights of selected factors under particular scenarios and utilisation of the new <b>parcel</b> shape <b>index</b> versus existing indices...|$|R
40|$|Land {{fragmentation}} is a {{major issue}} in many rural areas around the world, preventing rational agricultural production and sustainable rural development. Traditionally, land consolidation has been the primary land management approach for solving this problem. Land reallocation is recognised as the most important, complex, and time-consuming process of land consolidation. It is split into two components: land redistribution and land partitioning. In this paper, we outline a land redistribution model called LandSpaCES (Land Spatial Consolidation Expert System) which is the central module of LACONISS, a LAnd CONsolidation Integrated Support System for planning and decision making. LandSpaCES integrates GIS with an expert system (ES) and is able to generate alternative land redistributions under different scenarios. Two key system concepts are utilised: "No-Inference Engine Theory (NIET)," which differentiates Land- SpaCES from conventional ES development and a <b>parcel</b> priority <b>index</b> (PPI), which constitutes the basic measure that defines the redistribution of land in terms of location. The module has been applied to a case study area in Cyprus and the results compare very favourably against an independent solution derived previously by human experts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} I created the overwiew of {{instability}} indices and other characteristics of convective environment {{which can be}} found in the literature. On the basis of variables, which the instability indices are calculated from, I suggested their categorization. It was created five groups of instability indices: (i) indices of isobaric levels differences, (ii) indices of rising air <b>parcel,</b> (iii) <b>indices</b> of potential temperatures, (iv) indices of the energy potential of convection and (v) indices of wind shear. In addition to these five categories it was created the sixth category consists of other thermodynamic characteristics. In the last chapter I used the upper air soundings data and values of instability indices of the University of Wyoming for one storm in Prague and I compared instability indices to each other. The group of the indices of potential temperatures was the most successful in the storm forecast, except the Rackliff index. The bulk Richardson number from the group of indices of wind shear forecasted a supercell storm correctly. The work could be used for creation of instability climatology of the Czech Republic on the basis of the selected instability indices. Keywords: instability index, convection, convective stor...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to examine the effect of item <b>parceling</b> on goodness-of-fit <b>indices</b> at different levels of sample size, number of indicators per factor, factor structure/pattern coefficients, interfactor correlations, and item-level data distribution. Results revealed that the use of item parcels yielded more nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases than individual items. The likelihood of nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases increased as the number of indicators per factor (more items per parcel) decreased. Meanwhile, parcel solutions as compared with item solutions resulted in better fit as measured by the chi-square to degrees-of-freedom ratio, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Expected Cross-Validation Index (ECVI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), as well as two incremental fit indices, the Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI). The same pattern of results was found with data that varied in terms of skewness and kurtosis at the item level. However, the likelihood of nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases was more pronounced when data were extremely skewed/kurtotic at the item level...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the use of object-based metadata regarding data quality within the specific example of attribute uncertainty in the LCM 2000. There are three constituent parts to the work. These are using the metadata to identify and describe uncertainty, validating the metadata {{to ensure that it}} is informing the user in the way anticipated and exploring what new information can be generated from the metadata. A review {{of the state of the}} art in spatial uncertainty is presented as well as introductions to data quality metadata, land cover mapping and the Land Cover Map 2000 itself. Metadata within Land Cover Map 2000 is explored with respect to identifying, describing and visualising attribute uncertainty. It is demonstrated to be extremely useful and relatively simple to use, allowing comparison between different landscape types and between different geographical areas. The metadata is shown to be valid in that they provide a reliable indication of attribute uncertainty. This is achieved by comparing the map with cumulative evidence from other existing databases that give the extent of particular land cover types. The new information generated from the metadata gives further insight into the uncertainty, providing a simple description of heterogeneity within <b>parcels</b> using <b>indices</b> of dominance. As the metadata is object-based it also allows the spatial limits of the map to be broken down and the impact of impurities within the parcel and its neighbour to be examined. This work provides a strong argument for the inclusion of object-based data quality metadata within digital classified map products, allowing users of the data to assess whether or not the data is fit for the purpose to which they intend to put it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Research {{surrounding}} {{the built environment}} (BE) and health has resulted in inconsistent findings. Experts have identified the need to examine methodological choices, such as development and testing of BE indices at varying spatial scales. We sought to {{examine the impact of}} construction method and spatial scale on seven measures of the BE using data collected at two time points. Methods The Children’s Environmental Health Initiative conducted parcel-level assessments of 57 BE variables in Durham, NC (parcel N =  30, 319). Based on a priori defined variable groupings, we constructed seven mutually exclusive BE domains (housing damage, property disorder, territoriality, vacancy, public nuisances, crime, and tenancy). Domain-based indices were developed according to four different index construction methods that differentially account for number of parcels and <b>parcel</b> area. <b>Indices</b> were constructed at the census block level and two alternative spatial scales that better depict the larger neighborhood context experienced by local residents: the primary adjacency community and secondary adjacency community. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to assess if indices and relationships among indices were preserved across methods. Results Territoriality, public nuisances, and tenancy were weakly to moderately preserved across methods at the block level while all other indices were well preserved. Except for the relationships between public nuisances and crime or tenancy, and crime and housing damage or territoriality, relationships among indices were poorly preserved across methods. The number of indices affected by construction method increased as spatial scale increased, while the impact of construction method on relationships among indices varied according to spatial scale. Conclusions We found that the impact of construction method on BE measures was index and spatial scale specific. Operationalizing and developing BE measures using alternative methods at varying spatial scales before connecting to health outcomes allows researchers to better understand how methodological decisions may affect associations between health outcomes and BE measures. To ensure that associations between the BE and health outcomes are not artifacts of methodological decisions, researchers would be well-advised to conduct sensitivity analysis using different construction methods. This approach may lead to more robust results regarding the BE and health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A {{planning}} {{support system}} for land consolidation {{has been developed}} that has, at its heart, an expert system called LandSpaCES (Land Spatial Consolidation Expert System) which contains a "design module" that generates alternative land redistributions under different scenarios and an "evaluation module" which integrates GIS with multi-criteria decision making for assessing these alternatives. This paper introduces the structural framework of the latter module which has been applied using {{a case study in}} Cyprus. Two new indices are introduced: the "parcel concentration coefficient" for measuring the dispersion of parcels; and the "landowner satisfaction rate" for predicting the acceptance of the land redistribution plan by the landowners in terms of the location of their new <b>parcels.</b> These two <b>indices</b> are used as criteria for the evaluation of the land redistribution alternatives and are transferable to any land consolidation project. Moreover, {{a modified version of the}} ratio estimation procedure, referred to as the "qualitative rating method" for assigning weights to the evaluation criteria, is presented, along with a set of non-linear value functions for standardizing the performance scores of the alternatives and incorporating expert knowledge for five evaluation criteria. The application of the module showed that it is a powerful new tool for the evaluation of alternative land redistribution plans that could be implemented in other countries after appropriate adjustments. A broader contribution has also been made to spatial planning processes, which might follow the methodology and innovations presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|There are {{pressing}} {{concerns about the}} interplay between agricultural productivity, water demand, and water availability in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. Currently, irrigated agriculture is the dominant water user in these regions and is estimated to consume approximately 80 % of the world’s diverted freshwater resources. We develop an improved irrigated land-use mapping algorithm that uses the seasonal maximum value of a spectral index to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels in Idaho’s Snake River Plain. We compare this approach to two alternative algorithms that differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated <b>parcels</b> using spectral <b>index</b> values at a single date or the area beneath spectral index trajectories {{for the duration of}} the agricultural growing season. Using six different pixel and county-scale error metrics, we evaluate the performance of these three algorithms across all possible combinations of two growing seasons (2002 and 2007), two datasets (MODIS and Landsat 5), and three spectral indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDVI, EVI, and NDMI). We demonstrate that, on average, the seasonal-maximum algorithm yields an improvement in classification accuracy over the accepted single-date approach, and that the average improvement under this approach is a 60 % reduction in county scale root mean square error (RMSE), and modest improvements of overall accuracy in the pixel scale validation. The greater accuracy of the seasonal-maximum algorithm is primarily due to its ability to correctly classify non-irrigated lands in riparian and developed areas of the study region...|$|R
40|$|Fields, i. e. {{enclosed}} areas of arable land, are distinguished according to parcel shape and size, land fragmentation, land dispersion, and land use. The {{description of characteristics}} of a space, including a field, is unique when expressed in measurable, i. e. quantifiable values (indicators or indices), {{and this was the}} subject dealt with in this doctoral thesis. We designed a set of mutually independent indices determined either at the level of a unit, a class, or an area. The values of the indices were determined for the selected 22 fields as irregular blocks, furlongs, continuous strips, and enclosures based on the 2015 data and for selected fields also the data from the Franciscan Cadastre. The analysis of the obtained index values and statistical data processing showed that field characteristics are well described by the <b>parcel</b> shape <b>index</b> (IOP), index of land fragmentation (K), index of land dispersion (SD), and the Simpson’s Diversity Index (SIDI). The low IOP index points to irregularly shaped parcels as fields in irregular blocks and enclosures. Furlongs and fields in winegrowing areas have a high IOP, which points to parcels of more regular shapes. Enclosures and fields in winegrowing areas have high K and SD indices, which points to small land fragmentation and land dispersion. In all other types of fields, land fragmentation and land dispersion are strong (low K and SD indices). Fields in winegrowing areas particularly stand out in terms of land use diversity (SIDI index). We also found that using only one index it is difficult to distinguish between the types of arable land division, while this is possible if we use more indices. This was confirmed using the hierarchical clustering method to classify the test fields, based on the statistical values of the indices, into irregular blocks, furlongs, continuous strips, and enclosures and, as a separate group, fields in winegrowing areas. Notably, due to the deviation of the indices for the fields in winegrowing areas from other types of arable land division, we propose that these fields are classified as a separate type of arable land division. The comparison of indices in two time periods confirmed the practical application of the indices for identifying the changes in space, which could be reasonably used in continuous monitoring of land use. The SIDI index points to significant changes in land use in two periods, while the parcel shapes as well as land fragmentation and dispersion did not change significantly. Even though the indices were formed to describe field characteristics, they can be also used for describing various spatial phenomena, as proposed in the final chapters of this thesis...|$|R
