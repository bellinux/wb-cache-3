50|$|The {{ship was}} {{attacked}} by Somali pirates {{on the morning of}} 2 January 2009. The captain of the Kriti Episkopi saw the pirates and took evasive action and hailed a nearby EU ship. Pirates in 3 speedboats approached the Kriti Episkopi twice with machine guns and RPG's and tried to board. However, the pirates were driven away by the crew, who aimed high pressure fire hoses and sprayed them. While the crew was fighting off the <b>pirates,</b> EU <b>aircraft</b> took off from the nearby Taskforce 150 and arrived to help. The air support remained by the cargo ship and scared off the pirates while a frigate came to escort the ship.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish Air Force {{deployed}} P-3s {{to assist}} the international effort against piracy in Somalia. On 29 October 2008, a Spanish P-3 aircraft patrolling the coast of Somalia reacted to a distress call from an oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden. In order to deter the <b>pirates,</b> the <b>aircraft</b> flew over the pirates three times as they attempted to board the tanker, dropping a smoke bomb on each pass. After the third pass, the attacking pirate boats broke off their attack. Later, on 29 March 2009, the same P-3 pursued the assailants of the German navy tanker Spessart, resulting in the capture of the pirates.|$|R
25|$|A ship or {{aircraft}} {{is considered}} a <b>pirate</b> ship or <b>aircraft</b> if it is intended by the persons in dominant control {{to be used for}} the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains {{under the control of the}} persons guilty of that act.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 May 1957, while docked in Sydney for Coral Sea Day celebrations, ten University of Sydney {{students}} {{dressed as}} <b>pirates</b> boarded the <b>aircraft</b> carrier {{in the early}} morning hours undetected. While some began soliciting donations from the Navy crew for a local charity, others entered the bridge. The public address system was turned on. [...] "Now hear this!" [...] announced Paul Lennon, a medical student. [...] "The U.S.S. Bennington has been captured by Sydney University pirates!" [...] Alarms for general quarters, atomic and chemical attacks were sounded, rousing the crew from their bunks. Marines escorted the students off the ship. No charges were filed.|$|R
50|$|Fictional air pirates {{typically}} {{operate as}} pirates in the air, or, in general, {{the atmosphere of}} a planet, dwarf planet or moon, and travel by aircraft, {{as opposed to the}} more traditional pirates on the high seas, who travel by ship. However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target sailing ships, air pirates serve a similar role in science fiction and fantasy media: they capture and plunder aircraft and other targets for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal an entire aircraft, sometimes killing the crewmembers in the process. However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the story's setting, rather than their seafaring counterparts. On the other hand, air pirates may be modeled after stereotypical sea pirates. Some air <b>pirates</b> use airborne <b>aircraft</b> carriers as mobile bases from which to conduct raids. Air pirates made early appearances in novels, silent films, comics and pulp magazines, and have since appeared in a variety of media, including alternate history, steampunk, and dieselpunk works.|$|R
2500|$|Hoskins {{refused to}} allow his wound to force his {{premature}} exit from the Navy, asserting his fitness to visiting friend Admiral William Halsey: [...] "... the Navy doesn't expect a man to think with his feet. That blast didn't knock off my head." [...] Recovering in the Naval Hospital Philadelphia, Hoskins's rank allowed him to choose the location of his hospital bed, which he selected for its view of the naval shipyard where the next [...] was being laid down. While rehabilitating, he received both the Purple Heart and Navy Cross for his actions aboard Princeton. Fitted with a prosthetic foot, Hoskins started a vigorous exercise program, including paying visits to the shipyard to oversee construction of the new Essex-class carrier. When Princeton was commissioned in November 1945, Hoskins became her first commanding officer. A year later, {{he was promoted to}} rear admiral and given command of Carrier Division Seventeen. Air Group 81, formerly from Princeton, asked Walt Disney to design a mascot patch, [...] "a saber-slinging <b>pirate</b> with an <b>aircraft</b> carrier under one arm and a peg leg firing ammunition like a machine gun", and were for a time known as Peg-Leg Petes.|$|R
50|$|Definition of piracyPiracy {{consists}} {{of any of}} the following acts:*(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed—**(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;**(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;*(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;*(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).Piracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutiniedThe acts of piracy, as defined in article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.Definition of a pirate ship or aircraftA ship or aircraft is considered a <b>pirate</b> ship or <b>aircraft</b> if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101.

40|$|Internet {{access is}} {{available}} on some international flights; this will become more commonplace in the future. Internet frauds abound. Already, most personal banking is performed using the Internet; {{it is easy to}} transfer funds from one account to another, including from a personal or trust account to that of a fraudster. For example, if a trustee who is both an Australian citizen and a Hong Kong permanent resident, on board an aircraft (Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic, or Qantas) in international airspace flying from Hong Kong to Australia, uses a personal computer to access an Australia-based trust account and (while unauthorized) transfers money to a personal account, has the trustee committed any crime for which he/she may be arraigned in any jurisdiction? It will be argued that the answer may be 'no'. What if the trustee is flying Cathay Pacific? This is partly because the law of Hong Kong insists that Hong Kong has jurisdiction over acts committed by persons aboard Hong Kong-registered aircraft yet does not recognize Internet activity of the type indicated above as a crime if the perpetrator is in international airspace. Similarly, if the trustee is on AQ 1 Virgin Atlantic, the United Kingdom claims jurisdiction and holds that no crime has been committed unless a trust fund based in the home country has been plundered. However, the (Australian) Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (hereinafter 'the Code') appears to forbid the type of fund transfer mentioned (whether the trustee is on Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic, or Qantas); it thus seems at first blush that the trustee has committed a crime in Australia. The problem is that a Commonwealth prosecutor cannot (it is submitted) access the Code, because the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 (Cth) (promulgated earlier in time than the Code) effectively states that no non-violent act in which a person engages on an Australia-bound aircraft (Qantas or otherwise) in international airspace after takeoff from a foreign country is a crime. On such a flight, the Code is inapplicable. The maxim generalia specialibus non derogant is relevant. One solution is that concerned states should draft and sign a treaty that puts national law to one side to ensure that modern-day pirates (such as the errant trustee) are nowhere safe. Similar treaties are already in force to deal with high-seas <b>pirates</b> and <b>aircraft</b> hijackers; the meaning of piracy requires expansion in the twenty-first century...|$|R
