5|$|The 94th Infantry Division {{then moved}} by {{railroad}} and motor to {{the vicinity of}} Krefeld, Germany, assuming responsibility for containing {{the west side of}} the Ruhr pocket from positions along the Rhine on 3 April. With the reduction of the <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> mid-April, the 94th Infantry Division was assigned military government duties, first in the Krefeld and later in the Düsseldorf areas. Soldiers of the troop participated in this assignment.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussion}} continued, {{the battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front lines, leaving Task Force Wahl on 23 January. It returned to 12th Armored Division, where three platoons were committed to combat to support the fighting in the Colmar <b>Pocket</b> <b>in</b> {{the first week of}} February. The remainder of the battalion was kept in reserve, where the disciplinary problems, including assaults on civilians, grew to {{the point at which the}} commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 February. The battalion was removed from its attachment to the 12th Armored on 12 February—by request of the divisional command—and withdrawn to the rear area of XV Corps to take up guard duties.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E

5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's {{father had}} died and his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), had become a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his <b>pocket.</b> <b>In</b> 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955. He remained guided by {{a deep sense of}} duty and a strong sense of American patriotism throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Despite being neutral at {{the start}} of World War II, Belgium and its colonial {{possessions}} found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces were pushed back into a small <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> the north-east of the country, the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning an occupation that would endure until 1944. The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation of his government and sparked a political crisis after the war. Despite the capitulation, many Belgians managed to escape to the United Kingdom where they formed a government and army-in-exile on the Allied side.|$|E
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length.

The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> a tip-down position.|$|E

5|$|Under Patton, the Third Army {{landed in}} Normandy during July 1944 and {{would go on}} to play an {{integral}} role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise <b>Pocket</b> <b>in</b> mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December, a feat {{regarded as one of the}} most notable achievements in the war. The rapid offensive action and speed that Patton called for in the speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Without warning, the Germans invaded Belgium on 10 May 1940. During the {{following}} 18 Days' Campaign, the Belgian army was pushed {{back into a}} <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> the north-west of Belgium and surrendered on 28 May. The government fled to France, and later the United Kingdom, establishing an official government in exile under pre-war Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot. They were responsible for forming a small military force made up of Belgian and colonial troops, known as the Free Belgian Forces and which fought as part the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his <b>pocket</b> (<b>in</b> the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

5|$|In Banovina, the JNA {{reached the}} Kupa River and {{captured}} its entire southern bank, except for ZNG bridgeheads {{in the areas}} of Nebojan, Sunja and Sisak, on 30 September. No further advances were achieved there. The JNA attempted an additional push towards the Nebojan bridgehead via Novi Farkašić on 1718 October, and another towards Sunja on 2 November, but both attempts failed. On 4 October, the JNA initiated an attack in Kordun, in the area of Karlovac, pushing the ZNG back in the area of Slunj two days later. On 8 October, it reached the banks of the Kupa and Korana Rivers and the intensity of fighting died down. The greatest flare-up of hostilities in the area occurred on 45 November when a JNA garrison based in a suburb of Karlovac broke through the ZNG siege in the Battle of Logorište and reached JNA-held territory to the east of the city. Further south, the JNA captured Slunj on 17 November and Cetingrad on 29 November, eliminating a ZNG <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> Kordun. JNA activity in Lika was limited to shelling and air raids on Gospić and Otočac, peaking on 4 October.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for Operation Storm, the HV 4th Guards and 7th Guards Brigades were {{pulled back from}} positions facing the VRS that had been established during Operation Summer '95, and were reoriented south towards the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK). The ARSK was protecting the northern approaches to Knin − {{the capital of the}} unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina − which Croatia claimed as part of its own territory. As the two brigades turned over the positions north and west of Bosansko Grahovo to the HV 81st Guards Battalion, the HGZ was deployed {{to the rear of the}} battalion, tasked with intervening in case of any VRS attack towards Bosansko Grahovo. On the second day of the operation, 6 August, after Knin was captured by the HV, the HGZ was airlifted from the Livanjsko field to the village of Rovanjska north of Zadar. They then linked up with the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade and advanced east to capture the villages of Muškovac and Kaštel Žegarski. On 8 August, the HGZ participated in an operation against the last significant ARSK <b>pocket</b> <b>in</b> the area of Donji Lapac and Srb, alongside the three guards brigades and special police forces.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Armored Division made a {{stand at}} Bastogne and held off the Germans {{long enough to}} enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Bastogne. After a rest period in January 1945, the 9th Armored Division made preparations for a drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on February 28, and the 9th smashed across the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7, 1945. The division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated. The Division drove on to Frankfurt {{and then turned to}} assist in the closing of the Ruhr <b>Pocket.</b> <b>In</b> April it continued east, encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the Mulde River. The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V-E Day in May 1945.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1943, the Corps {{followed}} advancing {{troops in}} Ukraine, but its actions were limited by fuel and ammunition rationing. In {{the beginning of}} Battle of the Dnieper, the Corps could only dispatch two active regiments to Bukrin bridgehead; the rest was grounded by fuel shortage. The situation improved when {{the direction of the}} Soviet offensive switched to Lyutezh bridgehead. Kamanin earned the Order of Suvorov for his corp's achievement in the Battle of Kiev (1943).
