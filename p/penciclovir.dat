5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating herpes, including acyclovir, valaciclovir (valacyclovir), famciclovir, and <b>penciclovir.</b> Acyclovir {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in generic. Valacyclovir is also available as a generic and is slightly more effective than aciclovir for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penciclovir</b> is {{inactive}} in {{its initial}} form. Within a virally infected cell a viral thymidine kinase adds a phosphate {{group to the}} <b>penciclovir</b> molecule; this is the rate-limiting step in the activation of <b>penciclovir.</b> Cellular (human) kinases then add two more phosphate groups, producing the active <b>penciclovir</b> triphosphate. This activated form inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thus impairing {{the ability of the}} virus to replicate within the cell.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} and {{mode of action}} of <b>penciclovir</b> {{are very similar to}} that of other nucleoside analogues, such as the more widely used aciclovir. A difference between aciclovir and <b>penciclovir</b> is that the active triphosphate form of <b>penciclovir</b> persists within the cell for a much longer time than the activated form of aciclovir, so the concentration within the cell of <b>penciclovir</b> will be higher given equivalent cellular doses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penciclovir</b> is a {{guanosine}} analogue {{antiviral drug}} {{used for the}} treatment of various herpesvirus infections.

50|$|The {{selectivity}} of <b>penciclovir</b> may {{be attributed}} to two factors. First, cellular thymidine kinases phosphorylate the parent form significantly less rapidly than does the viral thymidine kinase, so the active triphosphate is present at much higher concentrations in virally infected cells than in uninfected cells. Second, the activated drug binds to viral DNA polymerase with a much higher affinity than to human DNA polymerases. As a result, <b>penciclovir</b> exhibits negligible cytotoxicity to healthy cells.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} coding {{thymidine}} kinase in herpes viruses can endow the virus with resistance to aciclovir. In these situations, alternative medications {{that are of}} use include other guanine analogues such as famciclovir, valaciclovir and <b>penciclovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Famciclovir is a {{guanosine}} analogue {{antiviral drug}} {{used for the}} treatment of various herpesvirus infections, most commonly for herpes zoster (shingles).

50|$|Famciclovir {{is another}} {{antiviral}} drug {{that belongs to}} the same class. Famciclovir is a prodrug that is converted to <b>penciclovir</b> in the body. The latter is the one active against the viruses. It has a longer duration of action than acyclovir and it only comes in tablets.|$|E
5000|$|Effective {{antiviral}} medications include acyclovir and <b>penciclovir,</b> {{which can}} speed healing {{by as much}} as 10%.

50|$|The drug {{inhibits}} {{replication of}} {{varicella zoster virus}} (VZV) - which causes herpes zoster - and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but not HSV-2 which typically causes genital herpes. In vitro, inhibitory concentrations against VZV are 200- to 1000-fold {{lower than those of}} aciclovir and <b>penciclovir,</b> theoretically indicating a much higher potency of brivudine. Clinically relevant VZV strains are particularly sensitive.|$|E
50|$|Women with {{a history}} of HSV, can be treated with {{antiviral}} drugs to prevent symptomatic lesions and viral shedding that could infect the infant at birth. The antiviral medications used include acyclovir, <b>penciclovir,</b> valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Only very small amounts of the drug can be detected in the fetus. There are no increases in drug-related abnormalities in the infant that could be attributed to acyclovir. Long-term effects of antiviral medications have not been evaluated for their effects after growth and development of the child occurs. Neutropenia can be a complication of acyclovir treatment of neonatal HSV infection, but is usually transient. Treatment with immunoglobulin therapy has not been proven to be effective.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance {{can develop}} quickly {{with as little}} as one mutation. [...] Mutations occur in the enzymes that phosphorylate the drug and {{activate}} it: {{in the case of}} herpes simplex, resistance to aciclovir arises thanks to a mutation affecting the viral enzyme thymidine kinase. Since nucleoside analogues require two phosphorylations to be activated, one carried out by a viral enzyme and the other by enzymes in the host cell, mutations in viral thymidine kinase interfere with the first of these phosphorylations; in such cases the drug remains ineffective. There are, however, several different nucleoside analogue drugs and resistance to one of them is usually overcome by switching to another drug of the same kind (e. g. famciclovir, <b>penciclovir,</b> valaciclovir).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To assess {{in vitro}} the {{antiviral}} efficacy against feline herpesvirus (FHV- 1) and cytotoxicity for cultured feline cells of famciclovir and its metabolites, BRL 42359 and <b>penciclovir.</b> To investigate {{the effect of}} timing of <b>penciclovir</b> application on in vitro antiviral activity. Procedures: Plaque reduction assays were used to estimate antiviral efficacy of all compounds {{and the effect of}} <b>penciclovir</b> exposure before or after exposure to a FHV- 1 field isolate. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by assessing cell morphology and viable cell number for 72 h following exposure to each compound. Results: The <b>penciclovir</b> concentration that inhibited FHV- 1 -induced plaque formation by 50 % (IC 50) was 0. 86 μg/mL (3. 4 μm). Famciclovir and BRL 42359 had no antiviral effect against FHV- 1 at any concentration assessed. Antiviral activity was significantly enhanced when cells were exposed to 4 μm <b>penciclovir</b> (approximate IC 50) for 1 h but not for 24 h before viral adsorption. Delaying exposure of cells to <b>penciclovir</b> for 1, 2, or 4 h after viral adsorption significantly enhanced antiviral activity. Relative to untreated control wells, > 88 % of cells remained viable when exposed to famciclovir (100 μm), BRL 42359 (1. 06 mm), or <b>penciclovir</b> (40 μm) for 72 h. No morphologic evidence of cytotoxicity was noted. Conclusions: <b>Penciclovir</b> demonstrates potent antiviral activity against FHV- 1 and may be effective at lower tissue, tear, and plasma concentrations than previously targeted. The duration of in vitro antiviral effect of <b>penciclovir</b> suggests that frequent famciclovir administration may be necessary in vivo.

The 6 -deoxy derivative of <b>penciclovir</b> (BRL 42359) and the corresponding diacetyl and dipropionyl 6 -deoxy derivatives (BRL 42810 [famciclovir; British approved name] and BRL 43599) were tested as oral prodrugs. The in vivo absorption (dose, 0. 2 mmol/kg) and the conversion to the active compound, <b>penciclovir,</b> were determined in rats. Compared with the sodium salt of <b>penciclovir</b> given intravenously, the bioavailabilities of <b>penciclovir</b> from orally administered <b>penciclovir,</b> BRL 42359, famciclovir, and BRL 43599 were 1. 5, 9, 41, and 27 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} and {{mode of action}} of <b>penciclovir</b> [9 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -hydroxymethylbut- 1 -yl) guanine; BRL 39123] were studied and {{compared with those of}} acyclovir. In uninfected MRC- 5 cells, low concentrations of the triphosphates of <b>penciclovir</b> and acyclovir were occasionally just detectable, the limit of detection being about 1 pmol/ 10 (6) cells. In contrast, in cells infected with either herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV), <b>penciclovir</b> was phosphorylated quickly to give high concentrations of the triphosphate ester. Following the removal of <b>penciclovir</b> from the culture medium, penciclovir-triphosphate remained trapped within the cells for a long time (half-lives, 20 and 7 h in HSV- 2 - and VZV-infected cells, respectively). In HSV- 2 -infected cells, acyclovir was phosphorylated to a lesser extent and the half-life of the triphosphate ester was only 1 h. We were unable to detect any phosphates of acyclovir in VZV-infected cells. (S) -Penciclovir-triphosphate inhibited HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 DNA polymerase competitively with dGTP, the Ki values being 8. 5 and 5. 8 microM, respectively, whereas for acyclovir-triphosphate, the Ki value was 0. 07 microM for the two enzymes. Both compounds had relatively low levels of activity against the cellular DNA polymerase alpha, with Ki values of 175 and 3. 8 microM, respectively. (S) -Penciclovir-triphosphate did inhibit DNA synthesis by HSV- 2 DNA polymerase with a defined template-primer, although it was not an obligate chain terminator like acyclovir-triphosphate. These results provide a biochemical rationale for the highly selective and effective inhibition of HSV- 2 and VZV DNA synthesis by <b>penciclovir</b> and for the greater activity of <b>penciclovir</b> than that of acyclovir when HSV- 2 -infected cells were treated for a short time...|$|E

The effects of treatment on viremia and intrahepatic viral genome replication, transcription, and translation were examined. In seven of eight penciclovir-treated ducks, viremia was barely detectable {{after a week of}} treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, molecular hybridization studies showed that intrahepatic viral DNA, RNA, and protein levels were significantly reduced compared with those in placebo-treated controls. Synthesis of all viral replicative intermediates, including the normally persistent viral supercoiled DNA species, was inhibited by <b>penciclovir</b> treatment. Examination of liver tissue sections after in situ DNA hybridization or immunohistochemical staining confirmed that viral DNA and protein synthesis had been profoundly inhibited in most hepatic parenchymal cells. However, small subpopulations of cells, in particular the small bile duct epithelial cells, remained strongly positive for duck HBV antigens and DNA despite treatment. There was no evidence of toxicity associated with <b>penciclovir</b> therapy.

40|$|Objectives We {{developed}} a population model {{that describes the}} ocular penetration and pharmacokinetics of <b>penciclovir</b> in human aqueous humour and plasma after oral administration of famciclovir. Methods Fifty-three patients undergoing cataract surgery received a single oral dose of 500 mg of famciclovir prior to surgery. Concentrations of <b>penciclovir</b> in both plasma and aqueous humour were measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Concentrations in plasma and aqueous humour were fitted using a two-compartment model (NONMEM software). Inter-individual and intra-individual variabilities were quantified {{and the influence of}} demographics and physiopathological and environmental variables on <b>penciclovir</b> pharmacokinetics was explored. Results Drug concentrations were fitted using a two-compartment, open model with first-order transfer rates between plasma and aqueous humour compartments. Among tested covariates, creatinine clearance, co-intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and body weight significantly influenced <b>penciclovir</b> pharmacokinetics. Plasma clearance was 22. 8  ±  9. 1 L/h and clearance from the aqueous humour was 8. 2  ×  10 − 5 L/h. AUCs were 25. 4  ±  10. 2 and 6. 6  ±  1. 8 μg · h/mL in plasma and aqueous humour, respectively, yielding a penetration ratio of 0. 28  ±  0. 06. Simulated concentrations in the aqueous humour after administration of 500 mg of famciclovir three times daily were in the range of values required for 50 % growth inhibition of non-resistant strains of the herpes zoster virus family. Conclusions Plasma and aqueous <b>penciclovir</b> concentrations showed significant variability that could only be partially explained by renal function, body weight and comedication. Concentrations in the aqueous humour were much lower than in plasma, suggesting that factors in the blood-aqueous humour barrier might prevent its ocular penetration or that redistribution occurs in other ocular compartment...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrophilic {{drugs are}} poorly absorbed when applied topically, due to low {{partitioning}} through the lipid matrix of the stratum corneum. Cutaneous blood flow rapidly clears the absorbed drug, which {{may result in}} low tissue levels. This is of importance for topically applied drugs whose site of action is within the epidermis or dermis. Dermal drug levels can be measured using cutaneous microdialysis, which {{is a means of}} continuously sampling substances from the dermal extracellular fluid. OBJECTIVES: To measure the contribution of stratum corneum barrier and microvascular perfusion in determining dermal tissue levels of hydrophilic drugs (aciclovir and <b>penciclovir)</b> in vivo. METHODS: Studies were performed using microdialysis of the volar surface of the forearm of healthy volunteers (n = 55) over a 5 -h collection period. Stratum corneum was removed by tape stripping, and barrier disruption quantified by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL); dermal microvascular perfusion was modulated by inclusion of noradrenaline in the microdialysis perfusate. RESULTS: With intact skin and normal cutaneous blood flow the concentration of <b>penciclovir</b> recovered was below assay threshold (0. 05 ng x mL(- 1). With noradrenaline-induced local vasoconstriction, the area under the curve of drug absorbed through normal skin (+/- SEM) was 13. 3 +/- 2. 9 ng mL(- 1) h(0 - 5) for <b>penciclovir</b> and 27. 6 +/- 10. 6 ng mL(- 1) h(0 - 5) for aciclovir. Removal of the stratum corneum (to glistening) by tape stripping increased <b>penciclovir</b> absorption by 1300 -fold and aciclovir absorption by 440 -fold, confirming the stratum corneum as the major barrier to hydrophilic drug absorption. Sequential barrier disruption by tape stripping gave a close correlation between <b>penciclovir</b> concentration absorbed per hour and barrier disruption measured by TEWL (r 2 = 0. 9283). There was a 15. 6 -fold difference in the recovery of <b>penciclovir</b> through barrier-deficient skin with and without cutaneous blood flow. There was no relationship between fibre depth and amount of drug dialysed, which suggests free movement of antiviral drug on reaching the aqueous environment of the dermis.

40|$|Abstract Background Herpes simplex virus {{infection}} (HSV) is {{a common}} and ubiquitous infection of the skin which causes mucocutaneous lesions called cold sores (herpes labialis) or fever blisters. It is estimated that approximately 80 % of the population worldwide are carriers of the Herpes simplex virus, approximately 40 % suffer from recurrent recurrent infections. This study evaluates the in vitro skin permeation and penetration of <b>penciclovir</b> and acyclovir from commercialized creams {{for the treatment of}} herpes labialis (cold sores), using non viable excised human abdominal skin samples, which were exposed to 5 mg/cm 2 of acyclovir 5 % cream or <b>penciclovir</b> 1 % cream. Methods After 24 h of cream application, excess cream was washed off and layers of stratum corneum were removed by successive tape stripping. Amounts of active ingredients having penetrated through the skin were measured, as well as the amounts in the washed-off cream, in skin strips and creams remaining in the skin. Molecular modelling was used to evaluate physico-chemical differences between the drugs. Western blot analysis enabled to determine whether the marker of basal cells keratin 5 could be detected in the various tape strips. Results Application of <b>penciclovir</b> 1 % cream yielded higher concentration of drug in the deeper layers of the epidermis as well as a higher drug flux through the skin. Molecular modelling showed two higher hydrophobic moieties for acyclovir. Presence of the basal cell marker keratin 5 was underscored in the deeper tape strips from the skin, giving evidence that both drugs can reach their target cells. Conclusion <b>Penciclovir</b> 1 % cream has the tendency to facilitate the diffusion of the drug through the stratum corneum into the deeper epidermis layers, in which it could reach the target basal cells at effective therapeutical concentration. The small difference in the surface properties between both molecules might also contribute to favour the passage of <b>penciclovir</b> through the epidermis into the deeper basal cells. </p...|$|E
