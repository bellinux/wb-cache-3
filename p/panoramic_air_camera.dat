50|$|The {{problem of}} hand-cranking and {{supporting}} the camera, and simultaneously aiming and focusing it, was difficult to solve. A variety of automatic cranking systems were developed to free one of the cameraman's hands. Various cameras were invented which replaced the hand crank with an electric motor, or with a mainspring and gears, or with gears driven by compressed air. The Aeroscope was a compressed <b>air</b> <b>camera</b> designed by Prószyński, one that proved reliable and popular. Hundreds of Aeroscopes were used during World War I by British war journalists. Sales continued into the 1920s.|$|R
25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a <b>panoramic</b> <b>air</b> traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|R

50|$|At the beginning, France had a {{significant}} corps of Blériot type observation aircraft, soon replaced by a profusion of more capable types. The Royal Flying Corps entered the war with the slow but stable and reliable B.E.2 reconnaissance aircraft. It served acceptably in the role until new German fighters drove it from the skies in 1915-16. B.E.2 variants typically mounted a vertical camera outside the pilot’s (rear) cockpit. The more capable but similar R.E.8 replaced the B.E.2c as the standard RAF reconnaissance aircraft and remained in that role despite requiring escort for survival. British aircraft used the Watson <b>Air</b> <b>Camera,</b> the Type A camera, and later the C, E, L and finally L/B cameras (L for Laws and B for Brabazon) developed specifically for aircraft. The early C-type used the available 12 inch lenses and a 4×5 in (10x12.5 cm)plate. The Allies began to standardize on 18×24 cm plates and 25, 50 and 120 cm focal lengths, 50 being the most common.|$|R

50|$|The SAGE Direction Center {{closed in}} 1966 {{along with the}} other ADC {{facilities}} at Norton. It became the home of the Air Force Audiovisual Service.

After Norton closed in April 1994, the facility was essentially abandoned, and remains so today. Many adjacent smaller structures have been demolished, and likely it remains standing is due to its heavily-reinforced concrete and steel construction.|$|R

40|$|Ventilated façades with {{external}} thermal insulation {{contribute to the}} construction, in certain climatologies, of a great energetic efficiency in the thermal envelope of the building. This façade allows to eliminate the thermal bridges, reduce the energy demand and improve the level of comfort. These pages describe the research carried out in an isolated residential block in the city centre of Alicante. The house has two façades with different orientation: a ventilated façade (north) and a conventional façade (south). The first one is solved with two sheets of brick, the <b>air</b> <b>camera,</b> the external continuous insulation, the ventilated chamber and the pieces of porcelain stoneware to the outside. The conventional one consists of two sheets with intermediate thermal insulation. The outer sheet is composed of facing brick and the inner sheet by hollow brick of minor thickness with plaster. This system was correct according to the norm NBE-CT- 79, {{but it has been}} shown that it is insufficient to reach the levels of habitability and the comfort of the current society. The two façades, as well as their adjacent living spaces, have been monitored over a period of two years. Internal and external temperature and humidity, solar radiation, air velocity in the ventilated chamber and surface temperature of each of the material layers of the sections have been obtained. A thermographic study of the two chambers was carried out to determine the thermal bridges and the air infiltration. Through the use of energy simulation tools, comparative results of some parameters have been obtained in both constructive solutions, such as thermal transmissions, average radiant temperatures, operating temperatures or energy demands. By that, we can obtain the conclusions of thermal comfort levels and energy savings of ventilated façades...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{validate}} an experimental method of in-fluid enthalpy variation measurement by means of Speckle-based Background Oriented Schlieren (SBOS). The method applies on resolving the millijoule thermal-energy transfer to fluid induced by an electric discharge in <b>air.</b> Intensified <b>camera</b> is used to match the electric discharge exposure time constraint. Speckle is used as the reference pattern as it allows an easier access to high density pattern for subcentimetrics imaging. Geometrics optics principles are used to extract line of sight integrated index of refraction. Local density field is then computed through filtered back projection of Gladstone-Dale equation. The method is first validated in close experimental conditions provided by the density measurement of a millimeters-dimensions CO 2 gaseous laminar jet. An analysis on the jet gives useful insights on noises sources and uncertainties of the method which is then transposed to the discharge. Results of enthalpy measurements are discussed...|$|R
