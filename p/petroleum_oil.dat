5|$|The Mangalore Harbour has shipping, storage, and {{logistical}} services, while the New Mangalore Port handles dry, bulk, and fluid cargoes.

This artificial harbour is India's eighth largest port, in terms of cargo handling, {{and is the only}} major port in Karnataka. Foreigners can enter Mangalore through the New Mangalore Port with the help of Electronic visa (e-visa). Cruise ships from Europe, North America and UAE arrive at New Mangalore Port.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well as some other transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, <b>petroleum,</b> <b>oil,</b> and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E

Also on 1 April, Plan Alamo was implemented to utilize {{and defend the}} DAO compound and its annex as an evacuee holding area, intended to care for 1,500 evacuees for five days.

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the fence, the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of {{supplies}} in 3,000 trucks with a net loss of 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a <b>petroleum,</b> <b>oil,</b> and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E

25|$|Water-gas-tar {{creosote}} is also {{derived from}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> or shale oil, {{but by a}} different process; its distilled during the production of water gas. The tar is a by-product resulting from enrichment of water gas with gases produced by thermal decomposition of petroleum. Of the creosotes derived from oil, it is practically the only one used for wood preservation. It has {{the same degree of}} solubility as coal-tar creosote and is easy to impregnate into wood. Like standard oil-tar creosote, it has a low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and has less antiseptic qualities. Petri dish tests have shown that water-gas-tar creosote is one-sixth as anti-septically effective as that of coal-tar.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{can also}} be {{harnessed}} for constructive purposes. For example, many sewage treatment plants include a secondary treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter (BOD), while protozoa and rotifers are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. Slow sand filters rely on biofilm development {{in the same way}} to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB).|$|E
25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} {{the rates}} from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively {{lower than the}} rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, or they have been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oil—that is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but {{the net result is}} that from Maine to California the general arrangement of open rates on <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors.|$|E

40|$|Vegetable {{and animal}} oils {{as a class}} of fluids {{have been used for}} {{hundreds}} of years, if not longer, as quenchants for hardening steel. However, when <b>petroleum</b> <b>oils</b> became available in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s, the use of these fluids as quenchants in addition to their use in other industrial oil applications quickly diminished. This was primarily, but not exclusively, due to their generally very poor thermal-oxidative instability and the difficulty for formulating fluid analogs with varying viscosity properties. Interest in the use of renewable fluids, such as vegetable oils, has increased dramatically in recent years as alternatives to the use of relatively non-biodegradable and toxic <b>petroleum</b> <b>oils.</b> However, the relatively poor thermal-oxidative stability has continued to be a significant reason for their general non-acceptance in the marketplace. Soybean oil {{is one of the most}} highly produced vegetable oils in Brazil. Currently, there are commercially produced epoxidized versions of soybean oil which are available. The objective of this paper is to discuss recently obtained results showing the potential use of bioquenchants formulated from epoxidized soybean oil and heat transfer properties as viable alternatives to <b>petroleum</b> <b>oils</b> for hardening steel...|$|R
