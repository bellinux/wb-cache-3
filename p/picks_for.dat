5|$|The Giants did not draft {{a player}} in the first round on 11 occasions.

Although the Bears offered him less money than did the Broncos, playing for his hometown team and coach George Halas was more enticing. His rookie contract was worth $200,000. Along with fellow future Hall of Famer Gale Sayers, Butkus was one of three first-round <b>picks</b> <b>for</b> the Bears in the 1965 NFL Draft. The pick they used for Butkus had been acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
25|$|Created as {{a result}} of the Cleveland Browns {{relocation}} controversy, the rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. Unlike the other two rivalries, this one is more lopsided: the Ravens lead 25-9. Additionally, this matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft <b>picks</b> <b>for</b> 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won Super Bowl for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by GM Ozzie Newsome) might have given the Browns the title after a 35-year drought. This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second world title in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In the offseason, the Knicks traded {{controversial}} guard Raymond Felton, {{along with}} former NBA {{defensive player of}} the year, Tyson Chandler, to the Dallas Mavericks.

Cedric Brown went to the Oakland Raiders in return for selections in rounds 6 and 9, while guard John Miller brought a tenth-round pick from the San Francisco 49ers. Brown eventually returned to the Buccaneers after being waived from Oakland.
