The aim is to estimate the derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM with the modified system in conditions of frequent starts, depending on the intensity of its speed up. To estimate the derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM with the modified system, depending intensity of its speed up the complex simulation model of electromagnetic and thermal process are designed. This model describes the thermal transient process in structural elements of AM and allows considering peculiarities of electromagnetic energy transformation in thermal energy, heat transferring and heat interchanging processes. The use of AM with the modified system pulse control will reduce the derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM up to 12 times compared to derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM at direct start.

30|$|The pulse {{off time}} is {{referred}} as Toff and {{it represents the}} duration of time in micro seconds (μs), between the two simultaneous sparks. The voltage is absent during {{this part of the}} cycle. With a lower value of Toff, there is more number of discharges in a given time, resulting in increase in the sparking efficiency. As a result, the cutting rate also increases. Using very low values of Toff period, however, may cause wire breakage which in turn reduces the cutting efficiency. As and when the discharge conditions become unstable, one can increase the Toff period. This will allow lower <b>pulse</b> <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> and will reduce the average gap current.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the control of switching transistors for use in clocked transistor output stages or half/full bridges at fixed working frequencies and a <b>pulse</b> <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> of about 1 : 1.

This is achieved by the input capacitance of the MOS transistor forming a resonant circuit in conjunction with an inductance, said resonant circuit being tuned to the working frequency. To obtain floating control, the resident circuit has two coupled coils L 1, L 2 (resonance transformers) via which energy is also transferred.

40|$|AbstractMetal removal {{mechanism}} in Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is mainly a thermal phenomenon where thermal energy {{is produced in}} plasma channel, and is dissipated though work piece, tool and dielectric.

40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} {{receiving}} direct sequence (DS) spread spectrum, binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) information in pulsed noise and continuous wave (CW) jamming is studied in additive white noise. An {{automatic gain control}} is not modelled. The general system theory of receiver analysis is first presented and previous literature is reviewed. The study treats the problem of decision making after matched filter or integrate and dump demodulation. The decision methods have a great effect on system performance with pulsed jamming. The following receivers are compared: hard, soft, quantized soft, signal level based erasure, and chip combiner receivers. The analysis is done using a channel parameter D, and bit error upper bound. Simulations were done in original papers using a convolutionally coded DS/BPSK system. The simulations confirm that analytical results are valid. Final conclusions are based on analytical results. The analysis is done using a Chernoff upper bound and a union bound. The analysis is presented with pulsed noise and CW jamming. The same kinds of methods {{can also be used}} to analyse other jamming signals. The receivers are compared under pulsed noise and CW jamming along with white gaussian noise. The results show that noise jamming is more harmful than CW jamming and that a jammer should use a high <b>pulse</b> <b>duty</b> <b>factor.</b> If the jammer cannot optimise a <b>pulse</b> <b>duty</b> <b>factor,</b> a good robust choice is to use continuous time jamming. The best performance was achieved by the use of the chip combiner receiver. Just slightly worse was the quantized soft and signal level based erasure receivers. The hard decision receiver was clearly worse. The soft decision receiver without jammer state information was shown to be the most vulnerable to pulsed jamming. The chip combiner receiver is 3 dB worse than an optimum receiver (the soft decision receiver with perfect channel state information). If a simple implementation is required, the hard decision receiver should be used. If moderate complex implementation is allowed, the quantized soft decision receiver should be used. The signal level based erasure receiver does not give any remarkable improvement, so that it is not worth using, because it is more complex to implement. If receiver complexity is not limiting factor, the chip combiner receiver should be used. Uncoded DS/BPSK systems are vulnerable to jamming and a channel coding is an essential part of antijam communication system. Detecting the jamming and erasing jammed symbols in a channel decoder can remove the effect of pulsed jamming. The realization of erasure receivers is rather easy using current integrated circuit technology...|$|E

Screening experiments are used to identify the key parameters (factors) that significantly affect these outcomes. In this investigation, Plackett-Burman screening design was used to identify {{the factors that influence}} the surface properties of titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) during electro-discharge machining (EDM) with Cu-TaC electrodes. These properties are the surface roughness and the surface micro-hardness. The experimental design has seven factors where each factor is set at two different levels.

However, determination of adequate dosages presents a great challenge due {{to the difficulty of}} measuring tissue temperatures during the process. Further, accurate calculation of temperature field induced by ultrasound within the tissue is difficult to develop because of the time-scale differences between pressure and temperature analyses. In order to overcome this issue, practical and accurate methods to couple both analyses are needed. In the present study, Westervelt’s nonlinear wave equation is used to simulate ultrasonic propagation driven by an unfocused piston source in an axisymmetric biological tissue phantom.

Materials and methods: A single element spherically focused transducer of 5 cm diameter, focusing at 10 cm and operating at either 0. 5 MHz or 1 MHz was considered. The power field was estimated using the Khokhlov-Zabolot-skaya-Kuznetzov (KZK) model. The temperature was estimated using the bioheat equation. The goal was to extract the acoustic parameters (frequency, power, and <b>duty</b> <b>factor)</b> that maintain a temperature increase of less than 1 oC during {{the application of a}} pulse ultrasound protocol. Results: It was found that the temperature change increases linearly with <b>duty</b> <b>factor.</b> The higher the power, the lower the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> needed to keep the temperature change to the safe limit of 1 oC. The higher the frequency the lower the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> needed to keep the temperature change to the safe limit of 1 oC.

More correct calculations of low frequency <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> through the RF phase displacement method are presented. ...|$|R
5000|$|One way to {{generate}} fairly accurate square wave signals with 1/n <b>duty</b> <b>factor,</b> where n is an integer, is to vary the duty cycle until the nth-harmonic is significantly suppressed. For audio-band signals, this {{can even be}} done [...] "by ear"; for example, a -40dB reduction in the 3rd harmonic corresponds to setting the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> to 1/3 with a precision of 1% and -60 dB reduction corresponds to a precision of 0.1%.|$|R
2500|$|The key {{variables}} for gait are the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> and the forelimb-hindlimb phase relationship. <b>Duty</b> <b>factor</b> {{is simply the}} {{percent of the total}} cycle which a given foot is on the ground. [...] This value will usually be the same for forelimbs and hindlimbs unless the animal is moving with a specially trained gait or is accelerating or decelerating. [...] <b>Duty</b> <b>factors</b> over 50% are considered a [...] "walk", while those less than 50% are considered a run. Forelimb-hindlimb phase is the temporal relationship between the limb pairs. [...] If the same-side forelimbs and hindlimbs initiate stance phase at the same time, the phase is 0 (or 100%). [...] If the same-side forelimb contacts the ground half of the cycle later than the hindlimb, the phase is 50%.|$|R
