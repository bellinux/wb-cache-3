5|$|When the January 1975 {{issue of}} Popular Electronics reached readers in mid December 1974, MITS {{was flooded with}} orders.

5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a <b>people</b> <b>just</b> as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|Elis Lapenmal was Vanuatu's sole {{participant}} in the women's 100m dash. She {{took part in the}} first round of the event on August 15, in which she was placed in heat three versus athletes that included the United States' Muna Lee; Saint Kitts and Nevis' Virgil Hodge; and Mauritania's Bounkou Camara. Lapenmal ran the 100m in 13.31seconds, placing eighth in a heat of nine <b>people,</b> <b>just</b> ahead of Camara, who scored 13.69seconds. Muna Lee scored first in Lapenmal's heat with a time of 11.33seconds. Overall, Lapenmal tied Guam's Cora Alicto for 76th place out of 85, and did not advance to the second round on August 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{these new}} towns, the {{aristocracy}} was allocated the higher areas, {{where the air}} was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the town centre (Illustration 8), for convenience to all, and to reflect the church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal Palazzo Vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, {{and members of the}} few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford building plots, often lived {{on the periphery of the}} commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally often these <b>people</b> <b>just</b> lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and most notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used {{to examine}} ways in which {{societies}} can remedy social exclusion. These tactics affect youth because they deal with the labor market and thus young <b>people</b> <b>just</b> beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to social exclusion. This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and welfare to those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing social exclusion. This method suggests punishment {{as a means of}} remedying social exclusion. The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the labor market as the enemy to social exclusion and therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force.|$|E

He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs. Connolly. He was crushed when Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of <b>people,</b> <b>just</b> like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.|$|E
