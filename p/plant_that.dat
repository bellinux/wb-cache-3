5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day.

5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{can grow}} to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
40|$|Outsourcing or {{subcontracting}} {{is increasingly}} used by firms as a production alternative, {{which would be}} expected to affect productive performance as well as input mix. To evaluate outsourcing relationships for plants in a less developed country, we first estimate within-industry proportional differences in various performance indicators between <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> subcontract inputs or outputs and <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> do not engage in outsourcing activity for Turkish textile and apparel manufacturing <b>plants.</b> We find <b>that</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> outsource internationally exhibit better performance than <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> choose to outsource in the domestic market, especially for <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> subcontract outputs. We then evaluate labor productivity gaps before and after outsourcing, and find <b>that</b> more productive <b>plants</b> tend to engage in input and international outsourcing but also increase their relative productivity after beginning outsourcing. We further explore the relationships among outsourcing and productivity, input composition, and trade by estimating a flexible transformation function model by methods that control for simultaneity and selection bias. We find that the higher productivity of <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> engage in input subcontracting and foreign outsourcing involves greater skilled labor intensity, and that the reverse is true for output subcontracting plants...|$|R

5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form {{available}} in commercial nurseries is unimproved Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy pruning. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, except that B.integrifolia subsp. monticola may be assumed frost-tolerant. Dwarf forms of B.integrifolia are sometimes sold, and a registered prostrate cultivar, Banksia 'Roller Coaster', is available.

5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{produces a}} rosette of leaves {{in its first}} year of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
