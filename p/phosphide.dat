5|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound {{which is}} readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium <b>phosphide,</b> Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium <b>phosphide,</b> are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium <b>phosphide</b> harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium <b>phosphide</b> compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
25|$|For farm use, pellets of {{aluminium}} <b>phosphide,</b> calcium <b>phosphide,</b> or zinc <b>phosphide</b> release phosphine upon contact with atmospheric water or rodents' stomach acid. These pellets also contain agents {{to reduce the}} potential for ignition or explosion of the released phosphine. A more recent alternative {{is the use of}} phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either CO2 or N2 or even air to bring it below the flammability point. Use of the gas avoids the issues related with the solid residues left by metal <b>phosphide</b> and results in faster, more efficient control of the target pests.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively the acid-catalyzed disproportioning {{of white}} {{phosphorus}} yields phosphoric acid and phosphine. Both routes have industrial significance; the acid route is preferred method if further {{reaction of the}} phosphine to substituted phosphines is needed. The acid route requires purification and pressurizing. It can also be made (as described above) by the hydrolysis of a metal <b>phosphide,</b> such as aluminium <b>phosphide</b> or calcium <b>phosphide.</b> Pure samples of phosphine, free from P2H4, may be prepared using the action of potassium hydroxide on phosphonium iodide (PH4I).|$|E

25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium <b>phosphide,</b> thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium <b>phosphide</b> (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of anticoagulants, <b>phosphides</b> were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of {{shortage}} of strychnine due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the strychnine tree is grown. <b>Phosphides</b> are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{because of}} its strong {{association}} with elemental phosphorus, phosphine was once regarded as a gaseous form of the element, but Lavoisier (1789) recognised it as a combination of phosphorus with hydrogen and described it as phosphure d'hydrogène (<b>phosphide</b> of hydrogen).|$|E
25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc <b>phosphide</b> {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc <b>phosphide,</b> but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{versatile}} route for {{the preparation of}} metal <b>phosphides</b> using PH plasma for supercapacitor applications. The high reactivity of plasma allows rapid and low temperature conversion of hydroxides into monometallic, bimetallic, or even more complex nanostructured <b>phosphides.</b> These same <b>phosphides</b> are {{much more difficult to}} synthesize by conventional methods. Further, we present a general strategy for significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of monometallic <b>phosphides</b> by substituting extrinsic metal atoms. Using NiCoP as a demonstration, we show that the Co substitution into NiP not only effectively alters the electronic structure and improves the intrinsic reactivity and electrical conductivity, but also stabilizes Ni species when used as supercapacitor electrode materials. As a result, the NiCoP nanosheet electrodes achieve high electrochemical activity and good stability in 1  M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, our assembled NiCoP nanoplates//graphene films asymmetric supercapacitor devices can deliver a high energy density of 32. 9  Wh kg at a power density of 1301  W kg, along with outstanding cycling performance (83 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 20  A g). This activity outperforms most of the NiCo-based materials and renders the NiCoP nanoplates a promising candidate for capacitive storage devices...|$|R

25|$|A second view, {{based on}} the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water {{intensified}} the flames) suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and quicklime. Although quicklime was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare, the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's Tactica indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships, although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades, which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition. Furthermore, C. Zenghelis pointed out that, based on experiments, the actual result of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea. Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had in fact discovered calcium <b>phosphide,</b> which can be made by boiling bones in urine within a sealed vessel. On contact with water, calcium <b>phosphide</b> releases phosphine, which ignites spontaneously. However, extensive experiments with it also failed to reproduce the described intensity of Greek fire.|$|E

Although the Fe 2 P catalyst showed an excellent activity for NO conversion to N 2, there was a competition between NO reduction by CO and Fe 2 P oxidation by oxygen originated from NO dissociation. A complete equality of NO conversion and NO reduction degree can be obtained after increasing CO concentration in the system, which demonstrated that a catalytic redox cycle can be established on Fe 2 P catalyst, and hence in-situ oxidation of bulk Fe 2 P was avoided...|$|R

Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn+2.

25|$|Many astronomers {{request that}} nearby {{communities}} use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium indium <b>phosphide</b> LED {{as much as}} possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out.

Similar programs are now in place in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen gas {{obtained}} by the electrolysis of water has long been proposed as a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Noble metals such as Pt are capable of splitting water at low overpotentials, but the implementation of inexpensive solar-driven water-splitting systems and electrolyzers could benefit from the development of robust, efficient, and abundant alternatives to noble metal catalysts.
