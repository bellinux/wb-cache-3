5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. <b>Precipitations</b> and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
25|$|The northwest-southeast {{alignment}} of Zagros Mountains forms {{the terrain of}} the area. The two important mountain ridges are Kabir Kuh and Dinar Kuh. Being located in the western-most part of Zagross Mountains gives the province its special landscape including deserts in the western counties of Mehran and Dehloran bordering Iraq which feature very hot summers and mild winters and very low <b>precipitations</b> and the mountainous regions of east like Abdanan and Darreh Shahr which are milder and receive higher <b>precipitations,</b> mostly in form of rain, although snow is not rare. The northern region of Ilam, due to its altitude, experiences cold winters and mild summers and receives the highest amount of precipitation in the province.

30|$|Two <b>precipitation</b> {{forecasting}} {{practices were}} used: the track <b>precipitation</b> forecast and the cross-validation <b>precipitation</b> forecast. In track <b>precipitation</b> forecasting, parameter estimation is done using the seasonal <b>precipitation</b> data covering {{the period of}} 1959 – 2000 and the estimated parameter(s) is(are) used to forecast the <b>precipitation</b> in 2001. The forecasted seasonal <b>precipitation</b> in 2001 {{is added to the}} seasonal <b>precipitation</b> series of the period of 1959 – 2000 and parameters are estimated again, based on the newly produced seasonal <b>precipitation</b> series. Then, the seasonal <b>precipitation</b> is forecasted for 2002, using the newly estimated parameters based on the newly produced seasonal <b>precipitation</b> series of the period of 1959 – 2001. This procedure is repeated until the forecasted seasonal <b>precipitation</b> for 2010 is attained. In cross-validation <b>precipitation</b> forecasting, parameter estimation is done using the seasonal <b>precipitation</b> data covering the calibration period, such as 1959 – 2000, and then the estimated parameter(s) is(are) used to forecast the seasonal <b>precipitation</b> for the verification period, such as 2001 – 2010.|$|R

Intense <b>precipitation</b> is defined by several different parameters, such as a 95 th percentile threshold of daily <b>precipitation,</b> a mean <b>precipitation</b> that exceeds that percentile, or a fixed threshold of daily <b>precipitation</b> value [e. g., 25 and 50 mm day(exp - 1) ].

40|$|Accurate {{observational}} <b>precipitation</b> data supplied at a fine {{spatial resolution}} {{is vital for}} informing sustainable water resources management in Nepal.

In this research, statistical measures were used to assess the accuracy of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite-derived <b>precipitation</b> estimates (TRMM 3 B 42) relative to ground-based <b>precipitation</b> data (APHRODITE), seasonally from 2001 to 2007. In all seasons the majority of satellite <b>precipitation</b> estimates were significantly correlated with ground-based <b>precipitation.</b> However, satellite <b>precipitation</b> estimates consistently overestimated the amount of <b>precipitation,</b> with error greatest in the monsoon season. The satellite <b>precipitation</b> product inaccurately detected extreme <b>precipitation</b> events, 'rainy days' and <b>precipitation</b> intensity in the monsoon season.

Currently, ground-based <b>precipitation</b> measurements still provide the most accurate information for use in water resources management.

25|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD, and satellite images, do not detect tornadoes or hail, only indications that the storm has the potential. Radar and satellite data interpretation will usually give a warning before there is any visual evidence of such events, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine it is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what these remote sensing devices cannot is especially important as distance from a radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, due to curvature of Earth {{and the spread of}} the beam with distance. Therefore, when far from a radar, only <b>precipitations</b> and velocities high in the storm are observed. The important areas might not then be sampled or the resolution of the data might be poor. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.|$|E

Methods A simulated experiment was conducted in 2009 {{to examine the effects}} of <b>precipitation</b> quantity and interval on S. grandis seedlings in open-top chambers at the Inner Mongolia Grassland Ecosystem Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Important findings At final harvest, aboveground biomass of S. grandis seedlings was significantly increased by an average of 23 % (p < 0. 05) by increased <b>precipitation</b> quantity (+ 50 %) and by an average of 48. 8 % (p < 0. 001) by extending the <b>precipitation</b> interval from 5 to 15 days. <b>Precipitation</b> quantity had no significant effect on belowground biomass. When compared with that under regular <b>precipitation</b> interval with same <b>precipitation</b> quantity, belowground biomass was significantly increased 56. 2 % (p < 0. 001) with extended <b>precipitation</b> interval under low <b>precipitation</b> quantity, but was not significantly affected by extended <b>precipitation</b> interval under high <b>precipitation</b> quantity. The effect of <b>precipitation</b> quantity and interval on root/shoot ratio depended greatly on each other. Root/shoot ratio was significantly decreased by 28. 4 % (p < 0. 05) by increased <b>precipitation</b> quantity only under the extended <b>precipitation</b> interval level and significantly decreased by 28. 8 % (p < 0. 05) by extended <b>precipitation</b> interval only under increased <b>precipitation</b> quantity. During the whole treatment period, differences in aboveground, belowground and total biomass of seedlings between treatments for seedlings treated for 30 days and 45 days were determined by total <b>precipitation</b> quantity, and biomass differences for seedlings treated for 75 days were determined by <b>precipitation</b> interval. Therefore, <b>precipitation</b> interval could be as important as <b>precipitation</b> quantity on growth of S. grandis seedlings. Effects of <b>precipitation</b> patterns could be complex since the effects of <b>precipitation</b> quantity and <b>precipitation</b> intervalinteracted greatly and changed with seedling growth period...|$|R
