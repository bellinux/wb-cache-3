40|$|In {{separate}} but complementary {{letters to the}} editor of Tax Notes, Calvin Johnson (University of Texas School of Law) and Lawrence Waggoner (University of Michigan Law School) respond to an article by Dennis Belcher and seven other practicing attorneys that defend the GST exemption for <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts.</b> In Federal Tax Rules Should Not Be Used to Limit Trust Duration, 126 Tax Notes 832 (Aug 13, 2012), the attorneys argue that the duration of a trust is a state law issue. Their article is actually a response to a Shelf Project article: Lawrence W. Waggoner, Effectively Curbing the GST Exemption for <b>Perpetual</b> <b>Trusts,</b> 125 Tax Notes 1267 (June 4, 2012), Doc 2012 - 9442, 2012 (TNT 110 - 14, available electronically at [URL] In Perpetual Trusts: The Walking Dead, 126 Tax Notes 1215 (Sept. 3, 2012), Johnson argues that the harm to the national wealth done by <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts</b> is a federal responsibility. Trusts reduce the value of wealth, and settlors could figure that out if they were not seduced by the tax exemption. Specific settlor instructions get out of date and become an impediment after a generation. Delegating to trustees accountable to no one means trusts are managed primarily {{for the benefit of the}} trustees. <b>Perpetual</b> <b>trusts</b> become monsters, the walking dead.

40|$|Trusts {{that can}} operate {{for as many}} as a {{thousand}} years or even forever, typically {{for the benefit of the}} settlor’s descendants living from time to time, now and in the future, are all the rage in banking and estate-planning circles. Before 1986, when Congress passed the federal generation-skipping transfer tax (GST tax), settlors had little incentive and probably little desire to establish <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts,</b> even though they were permitted to do so under the law of Wisconsin, South Dakota, or Idaho. The GST tax created an artificial incentive for the wealthy to establish such trusts. The origin of the perpetual-trust movement is the GST exemption, which is part of the GST tax. When Congress granted the GST exemption, it did not impose a durational limit on trusts that qualify for the exemption, but instead relied on state perpetuity laws to supply that limit. The reliance on state perpetuity laws was badly misplaced. At the instigation of state banking groups and estate-planning attorneys, states began to pass legislation allowing trust settlors to create perpetual trusts—trusts that can last for several centuries or even forever. With state perpetuity laws out of the way, the wealthy began creating <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts</b> in significant numbers. This essay questions whether the state legislators who vote to authorize <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts</b> and the wealthy who create them are thinking through what they are allowing or putting in place. The essay shows the folly of such trusts, primarily by producing a table projecting how, with each step down the generational ladder, the number of beneficiaries will proliferate and the settlor’s genetic connection with the beneficiaries will decline. The essay then points out that the primary responsibility for the perpetual-trust movement rests not with the state legislators or the wealthy, but with Congress. The primary responsibility for curtailing it also rests with Congress, but so far Congress has been decidedly uninterested in curtailing the duration of GST-exempt trusts...|$|R

40|$|This posting updates {{the article}} titled Congress Promotes Perpetual Trusts: Why?. The article was {{originally}} posted on SSRN in September 2013. The updated version incorporates {{a discussion of}} two new developments—the unveiling of the long-awaited House Ways and Means Committee’s proposal for comprehensive tax reform and the issuance of the president’s proposed budget for 2015. Both of these new developments are disappointing because neither proposes curtailing or effectively curtailing <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts.</b> By unwittingly granting a tax exemption for <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts,</b> Congress undermined state perpetuity law and promoted private trusts that can last and remain tax exempt for many centuries and maybe forever. As {{a direct result of}} Congress’s action, and then of lobbying by financial institutions and other interest groups to convince state legislatures to remove the obstacle of perpetuity law, the very wealthy can now create tax-exempt private trusts for generations upon generations of their descendants. And they are massively taking advantage of the opportunity. Congress as an institution has known of its blunder for years, but has failed to remedy its mistake. On February 26, 2014, the House Ways and Means Committee unveiled its longawaited proposal for comprehensive tax reform, but the proposal does not address the tax exemption for <b>perpetual</b> <b>trusts.</b> The prospect for enactment of comprehensive tax reform in this Congress—the 113 th—appears bleak in any event. The author asks why Congress has not acted to correct its mistake and why it seems so uninterested in doing so. There is no federal interest in promoting perpetually tax-exempt trusts and, in fact, the federal interest cuts the other way. Tax revenues are lost by Congress’s action and subsequent inaction. A plausible explanation for Congress’s persistent indifference to {{the problem is that the}} revenue gain by correcting the oversight would be a long way off. Congress is not known for giving a high priority to problems of that sort. The longer Congress procrastinates, however, the amount of wealth that is safely sheltered in perpetually tax-exempt trusts—already estimated to be in the billions of dollars—continues to grow. The Treasury Department has a proposal before Congress for remedying the situation, but the Treasury’s proposal, reiterated in the president’s proposed budget for 2015 issued on March 4, 2014, but ignored by the Ways and Means Committee’s comprehensive tax-reform proposal, is not nearly as effective as it could and should be. The author proposes a remedy that would be entirely effective and would be consistent with the original purpose of the tax law. Regrettably, the prospect that Congress will ever address the problem, much less address it effectively, grows dimmer with each passing year...|$|R

Lack of experience and, in many cases, lack of knowledge on the part of federal authorities have not dissuaded them from undermining well-considered state law.
