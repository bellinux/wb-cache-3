40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that, in {{addition}} to previously considered microscopic aspects of ion <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> in the auroral region, the effect of mass-dependent resident times in a finite-length <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> region may be important. In a simple illustrative model, particles are assumed to enter upward into an auroral acceleration region of finite extent along B, in which both parallel electric fields and <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> exist. In this situation, the particle residence times vary with particle mass as M to the 1 / 2 -power, so that, {{in addition to}} effects associated with species-dependent heating rates, the resultant perpendicular energization associated with residence time also varies as M to the 1 / 2 -power. The residence time effect thus favors heating of heavier particles, and may therefore be of some importance in understanding the greater energization of oxygen over hydrogen that has been observed, and also why no electron conics have been observed...|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft {{measurements}} {{show that}} protons undergo substantial <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> during their transit from the Sun {{to the outer}} heliosphere. In this paper, we use Helios 2 measurements to investigate whether stochastic heating by low-frequency turbulence is capable of explaining this <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating.</b> We analyze Helios 2 magnetic-field measurements in low-β fast-solar-wind streams between heliocentric distances r= 0. 29 AU and r= 0. 64 AU to determine the rms amplitude of the fluctuating magnetic field, δ B_ p, near the proton gyroradius scale ρ_ p. We then evaluate the stochastic heating rate Q_ stoch using the measured value of δ B_ p and a previously published analytical formula for Q_ stoch. Using Helios measurements we estimate the `empirical' <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> rate Q_ emp = (k_ B/m_ p) B V (d/dr) (T_ p/B) {{that is needed to}} explain the T_ p profile. We find that Q_ stoch∼ Q_ emp, but only if a key dimensionless constant appearing in the formula for Q_ stoch lies within a certain range of values. This range is approximately the same throughout the radial interval that we analyze and is consistent with the results of numerical simulations of the stochastic heating of test particles in reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. These results support the hypothesis that stochastic heating accounts for much of the perpendicular proton heating occurring in low-β fast-wind streams.

A number of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) discontinuities can be produced by MR. Previous studies showed that the heat conductivity parallel to the magnetic field was much larger than the perpendicular conductivity.

40|$|Minor ion (such as He^ 2 +) heating via nonresonant {{interaction}} with spectra of linearly and circularly polarized Alfvén waves (LPAWs and CPAWs hereafter) is studied. The obtained analytic solutions {{are in good}} agreement with the simulation results, indicating that newborn ions are heated by low-frequency Alfvén waves with finite amplitude in low-beta plasmas such as the solar corona. The analytic solutions also reproduce the preferential heating of heavy ions in the solar wind. In the presence of parallel propagating Alfvén waves, turbulence-induced particle motion is clearly observed in the wave (magnetic field) polarized directions. After the waves diminish, the newborn ions are heated, which {{is caused by the}} phase difference (randomization) between ions due to their different parallel thermal motions. The heating is dominant in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating,</b> η=(T_i^R-T_i 0 ^R) /T_i 0 ^R (where T_i 0 ^R and T_i^R are the perpendicular temperature of species i before and after genuine heating, respectively), in the spectrum of CPAWs is a factor of two stronger than that of LPAWs. Moreover, we also study the effect of field-aligned differential flow speed of species i relative to H^+, δ v_ip = (v_i-v_p) ·B / |B| (where v_i and v_p denote vector velocities of the H^+ and species i, respectively), on the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating.</b> It reveals that large drift speed, v_d=δ v_ip, has an effect on reducing the efficiency of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating,</b> which is consistent with observations.

40|$|Heating {{of heavy}} ions by the {{electromagnetic}} ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, which {{are driven by}} proton temperature anisotropies, is studied by means of hybrid particle simulations. Initially, relaxation of the temperature anisotropies in the proton distribution and isotropic heating of the heavy ions are observed (phase I), followed by substantial <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> of the heavy ions (phase II). The heavy ions are distinctly gyrophase modulated by the EMIC waves. The isotropic heating in phase I is due to magnetic trapping by the excited proton cyclotron waves. The <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> in phase II is attributed to cyclotron resonance with the EMIC waves, which becomes possible {{by means of the}} preceding heating in phase I. Saturation of the EMIC instability is instead attributed to magnetic trapping of the majority ions: protons. When the proton anisotropy is very large, frequency shift (decrease) of the proton cyclotron waves to less than 1 / 2 Ohm(p) is observed.

In this paper, we review the linear tearing mode equations in order to identify the relevant instability regimes. The relevance of some regimes to experiments is discussed and analytical results in different regimes are presented. In all cases, realistic value of the <b>perpendicular</b> electron <b>heat</b> transport produces a strong destabilizing term proportional to the electron temperature gradient in the expression of the island growth rate. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} heating of charged test {{particles}} in three-dimensional numerical simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence (``Alfvenic turbulence''); {{these results are}} relevant to particle heating and acceleration in the solar wind, solar flares, accretion disks onto black holes, and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle {{is comparable to the}} frequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational domain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heating</b> (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle scattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong parallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional parallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets. Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the particle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make up Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions, energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened. '' We discuss the implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic turbulence produces significant parallel heating via the interaction between particles and magnetic field compressions (``slow waves'').

This mode is driven unstable by a sufficiently large electron temperature gradient in a certain range of the electron diamagnetic drift frequency omega(*e). The stability of the drift tearing mode is found to be mainly determined by omega(*e). The parallel ion flow driven by the parallel pressure gradient is found to be stabilizing for the drift tearing modes, while the perturbed bootstrap current is destabilizing for large or small omega(*e) but can be stabilizing for a certain range of omega(*e).

40|$|An {{investigation}} is made into {{the effect of}} the reduction in anomalous <b>perpendicular</b> electron <b>heat</b> transport inside the separatrix of a magnetic island chain associated with a neoclassical tearing mode in a tokamak plasma, due to the flattening of the electron temperature profile in this region, on the overall stability of the mode. The onset of the neoclassical tearing mode is governed by the ratio of the divergences of the parallel and <b>perpendicular</b> electron <b>heat</b> fluxes {{in the vicinity of the}} island chain. By increasing the degree of transport reduction, the onset of the mode, as the divergence ratio is gradually increased, can be made more and more abrupt. Eventually, when the degree of transport reduction passes a certain critical value, the onset of the neoclassical tearing mode becomes discontinuous. In other words, when some critical value of the divergence ratio is reached, there is a sudden bifurcation to a branch of neoclassical tearing mode solutions. Moreover, once this bifurcation has been triggered, the divergence ratio must reduced by a substantial factor to trigger the inverse bifurcation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} discuss three {{discontinuous}} Galerkin (dG) discretizations for the anisotropic heat conduction equation on non-aligned cylindrical grids. Our most favourable scheme {{relies on a}} self-adjoint local dG (LDG) discretization of the elliptic operator. It conserves the energy exactly and converges with arbitrary order. The pollution by numerical <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes degrades with superconvergence rates.

Here, the dG method provides the necessary interpolation. The first aligned discretization can be used in an explicit time-integrator. However, the scheme violates conservation of energy and shows up stagnating convergence rates for very high resolutions. We overcome this partly by using the adjoint of the parallel derivative operator to construct a second self-adjoint aligned scheme. This scheme preserves energy, but reveals unphysical oscillations in the numerical tests, which result in a decreased order of convergence. Both aligned schemes exhibit low numerical heat fluxes into the perpendicular direction.

40|$|International audienceIt is well {{established}} that interface resistances do usually exist in layered structures, and their values strongly depend on their origin. They may arise from different vibrational properties of the layers, nonharmonic processes at the interface, surface chemical contamination, interfacial defects, etc. Numerous studies have been published to evaluate their values, most of the time, in a <b>perpendicular</b> <b>heat</b> diffusion scheme. In this paper, the effect of interface resistances on the lateral modulated surface temperature of a layered structure for cylindrical symmetry heat diffusion is studied.
