In order {{to investigate the}} influence of contact time, adsorbent mass and pellet size on the adsorption efficiency the batch mode was carried out. Faster uptake of copper ion was obtained with the fired clay <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 5 mm diameter size within 30 minutes. The <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 8 mm diameter size showed the higher equilibrium time (60 to 75 minutes) for copper and zinc ion. The results pointed out that adsorption efficiency increases {{with the increase of}} adsorbent mass. The maximal efficiency is different for Cu(II) and Zn(II) ion due to the pellet size. Therefore, the fired clay <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 5 mm diameter size present an effective adsorbent for Cu(II) ion removal (adsorption efficiency is 63. 6 %), whereas the fired clay <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 8 mm diameter size are the best alternative for Zn(II) ion removal (adsorption efficiency is 92. 8 %) from a waste printing developer.

Detection of minerals composition is important to help consumer choose the right variety <b>of</b> <b>rice.</b> In this paper, an ungated Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) system was used to detect calcium in rice.

Twelve samples <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> were purchased from local market which offered differences {{with regard to their}} rice varieties, grain size and polishing rate.
