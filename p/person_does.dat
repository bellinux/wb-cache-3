5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms {{of muscles}} {{in either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Other {{investigations}} (such {{as blood}} tests and viral culture) are discouraged, {{as they may}} cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, {{can be used to}} confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this <b>person</b> <b>does</b> or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

25|$|A large {{overdose}} {{can cause}} asphyxia and death by respiratory depression if the <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not receive medical attention immediately. Overdose treatment includes {{the administration of}} naloxone. The latter completely reverses morphine's effects, but may result in immediate onset of withdrawal in opiate-addicted subjects. Multiple doses may be needed.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} lived {{religion}} was popularized {{in the late}} 20th century by religious study scholars like Robert A. Orsi and David Hall. The study of lived religion has come to include {{a wide range of}} subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious <b>person</b> <b>does</b> and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.|$|E
25|$|Like Jovinian, Pelagians {{insisted that}} human {{affections}} and desires were not {{touched by the}} fall either. Immorality, e.g. fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, i.e. a <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained {{it as one of}} the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.|$|E

The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.|$|E

Using {{a book or}} a website, a <b>person</b> <b>does</b> the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Most large tournaments seed players, but players {{may also}} be matched by their skill level. According to how well a <b>person</b> <b>does</b> in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is {{adjusted}} periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.|$|E
25|$|Many new assistive devices made {{especially}} for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves {{activities of daily living}} (ADL). Able Data lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories. Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).|$|E

25|$|Free Grace {{teaches that}} a <b>person</b> <b>does</b> {{not need to}} promise disciplined {{behavior}} or good works in exchange for God's eternal salvation; thus, one cannot lose his or her salvation through sinning and potential failure, and that assurance {{is based on the}} Bible, not introspection into one's works. This view strongly distinguishes the gift of eternal life (the declaration of justification by faith) from discipleship (obedience). There is also an emphasis within Free Grace on the judgment seat or Bema Seat of Christ, where Christians are rewarded based on obedience to God through faith.|$|E
25|$|Rescue, {{and where}} necessary, resuscitation, should be started {{as early as}} {{possible}} for best results. If conscious, the person should be taken out of the water as soon as possible. In-water resuscitation may increase the chances of a favourable result by a factor of about three, if there will be any delay in getting the person out of the water, but the necessary skills require training. Only rescue ventilation is practicable in the water, chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes the priority.|$|E
25|$|Extreme penalties. The maximum {{penalty for}} failing to file an FBAR is $100,000 or 50% {{of the value of}} the account, {{whichever}} is greater for each unfiled report. Because the statute of limitations period is six years, the maximum penalty is essentially 300% of the maximum account balances. Another penalty of $10,000 or more may apply if the <b>person</b> <b>does</b> not report the same account on Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets. This would be true even if the taxpayer did not owe any U.S. tax on unreported income from the account, and even if the taxpayer’s tax preparer did not inform him or her of the FBAR filing requirement. Such large penalties may be unconstitutional under the excessive fines clause.|$|E
