The claim was dismissed. The original cover design featured a volcano similar to the one depicted on the cover of Dianetics, but Scientology won an injunction against it. The legal dispute was ongoing when the publisher wished to distribute the work, so Stuart altered the design of the book cover to instead feature a letter addressed [...] "Dear Bookbuyer:" [...] This is not the jacket we planned for this book. We have been forced to use this makeshift design in order to safeguard our right to ship MESSIAH OR MADMAN? in original text to the public. We consider it our duty to make this important book available to you as soon as possible - despite the ongoing legal harassment we are suffering. The contents of L.

We are convinced that this book must not be suppressed at any cost! Later editions will bear a jacket consistent with our usual high standards.
