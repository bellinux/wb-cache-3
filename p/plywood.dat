5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), <b>plywood,</b> plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak <b>plywood.</b> Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) <b>plywood</b> from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such <b>plywood</b> affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{manufacturers}} {{within the}} city produce industrial-related products such as chemicals, textiles, clothing, and electronic goods. Food and beverages and tobacco products also produced. Local entrepreneurs continue to process primary commodities for export, including rope, <b>plywood,</b> refined sugar, copra, and coconut oil. The food-processing industry {{is one of the}} most stable major manufacturing sector in the city.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch <b>plywood,</b> {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in <b>plywood</b> and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and <b>plywood.</b> The wood of conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, <b>plywood</b> or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{supervised}} {{the assembly of}} the plant at Glidden {{when he arrived in}} 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir <b>plywood,</b> and in the manufacture of water-based paints.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the <b>plywood</b> and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the <b>plywood</b> and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to take 133 days and began on 7 November 2011 in and around London. Production moved to Turkey in April 2012, with parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Main Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—closed for filming in April. Filming also took place in Shanghai. Although set in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using <b>plywood</b> and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building, with some exterior scenes shot in Glen Etive and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{industries}} in the city's economy are: food processing (production of meat products, fruit and vegetable products, the production of spirits, the production of frozen food, grain processing), electrical engineering (production tools and equipment for machine tools, production of electric heaters, manufacture and production mixers household appliances). There is also a developed machine industry (electronics, machinery and metal), plastic processing (production of household appliances), textiles (textiles and upholstery, manufacture of underwear, clothing accessories, footwear and backpacks), Wood (production <b>plywood</b> and furniture) building materials.|$|E

5|$|The van Berkel Pavilion was {{composed}} of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops, all built on a steel frame covered with glossy white <b>plywood.</b> It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible. The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and <b>plywood</b> held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2010 Malaysian census, {{the town}} of Sibu (excluding {{suburban}} area) has total population of 162,676. Chinese (62.1%, 101,019) is the largest ethnic group in the town, followed by indigenous people (35.01%, 56,949), non-Malaysians (1.99%, 3,236), and Indians (0.37%, 598). Among the indigenous tribes, there are Iban (26,777), Malays (16,646), Melanau (10,028), Bidayuh (1,337), and other indigenous tribes (874). A majority of the non-Malaysians are Indonesian workers employed at <b>plywood</b> and sawmills factories. There are also a number of illegal workers employed by syndicates to tap rubber. A number of foreign Chinese nationals and Indonesians are also working in massage parlours.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build <b>plywood</b> bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{transitioning}} into an extratropical cyclone {{during its}} passage of Japan, Linfa still maintained strong winds, which caused heavy damage to susceptible structures. The highest wind associated with Linfa in Japan was clocked at 119km/h (74mph) in Murotomisaki, Kōchi Prefecture. Operations on the Tōhoku Main Line were delayed {{as a result}} of strong winds onset by Linfa. Wind gusts as high as 55km/h (35mph) in Nakatsugawa in Tochigi Prefecture caused the complete destruction of at least five buildings and damaged several others, resulting in ¥$760,000 (US$6,400) in damage. More considerable damage occurred in Shiga Prefecture, where strong winds caused damage to greenhouses and nearby crops, accruing ¥36.75million (US$308,700) in damage. In addition, two people were injured after winds threw a section of <b>plywood</b> into the car they were occupying.|$|E
5|$|He drove for Penske in the renamed Nationwide Series, {{failing to}} qualify for his first two races of the season. Hornish's best finish of the season was {{eleventh}} place in the Diamond Hill <b>Plywood</b> 200 at Darlington Raceway, where he started twelfth. In the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Lowe's Motor Speedway he led his first laps of the series (eight), but a mid-race accident relegated him to 39th place. Late in the season, Hornish drove one race in the Craftsman Truck Series (the Kroger 200 at Martinsville Speedway) for Bobby Hamilton Racing in its No. 4 Dodge Ram, starting 16th and finishing ninth.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's <b>plywood</b> templates.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered <b>plywood</b> and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, <b>plywood,</b> veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|Upon Alex's {{classification}} as {{a hurricane}} on January14, the Azores Meteorological Service issued a hurricane warning for {{the islands of}} Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Graciosa, and Terceira. They also issued a tropical storm warning for São Miguel and Santa Maria. A red alert—the highest stage for meteorological warnings—was declared for central and eastern islands. Homeowners protected doors and windows with <b>plywood</b> and sandbags in anticipation of damaging winds and flooding. Officials closed schools and administrative buildings {{for the duration of}} the hurricane on January15. SATA Air Açores cancelled 33domestic and international flights for the morning of January15, stranding more than 700passengers. The hurricane and tropical storm warnings were discontinued after Alex's passage on January15.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including <b>plywood.</b> The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as <b>plywood</b> boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the <b>plywood</b> landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E
5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Six hours later, {{the watch}} was upgraded to a hurricane warning for Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in Montserrat mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase <b>plywood,</b> canned food, bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed {{a direct threat to}} the islands. Three hours later, all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place. By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Bestime {{released}} the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy's Taxi Game, a board game which features Noddy driving about town, picking up various characters. Bestime released its <b>Plywood</b> Noddy Jigsaws series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy jigsaws {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975, and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later. In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure. Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by Hodder & Stoughton in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, The Wreckers' Tower Game, was published in October 1984.|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with <b>plywood</b> and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|Lumber mills, {{originally}} {{built to}} provide construction-grade materials for homes and business but then expanded to entice and then {{meet the demands}} of the railroad, profited from an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the NorthernPacific and CopperKing MarcusDaly, became the largest producer of lumber in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula's location as both a major lumber producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service created to help manage the nation's timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula's various lumber industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a downward spiral of Missoula's lumber industry began with the closure of a <b>plywood</b> plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner's sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container pulp mill in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous <b>plywood,</b> are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by <b>plywood</b> by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including <b>plywood</b> paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of <b>plywood</b> cutout figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to take up to 133 days, although the actual filming took 128. Filming began on 7 November 2011 in and around London, with the cinematographer Roger Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. Scenes were shot in London Underground stations, Smithfield car park in West Smithfield, the National Gallery, Southwark, Whitehall, Parliament Square, Charing Cross station the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Cadogan Square and Tower Hill. St Bartholomew's Hospital {{was used as the}} filming location for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station in London served as the MI6 training grounds. For the meeting between Q and Bond, production worked during the National Gallery's closing hours at night. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was used in the scene when Bond stood on the roof {{near the end of the}} film. The Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank was closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. Unlike The World Is Not Enough, which also featured an explosion at the building—which was filmed at a large-scale replica—the explosion in Skyfall was added digitally in post-production. Shooting of the finale was planned to take place at Duntrune Castle in Argyll, but was cancelled shortly after filming began. Glencoe was instead chosen for filming of these scenes. Although supposedly based in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using <b>plywood</b> and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike began {{development}} as a game for the 3DO under the working title of 32-bit Strike. Strike series creator Mike Posehn assisted in early programming and the design but otherwise {{did not wish to}} work as part of a large team, necessitated by the move to a more advanced console. The development team, who had already spent several months working on the 3DO version, decided to rework it instead as a PlayStation game when {{it was clear that the}} 3DO's demise was inevitable; an additional two years' labor time was the result. The team re-evaluated the basics of the 16-bit games and aimed to create more lifelike environments and enemy behaviour. The 3D engine - created by the Road Rash 3DO team - used satellite images of real topography, imposed on polygonal maps. It also modified the preceding isometric viewpoint - which caused buildings to obstruct the player's view - to an overhead perspective with which the player could move and see over terrain and structures. In order to ensure proper spatial relations and unit placement, the team built three dimensional reliefs of each mission on sheets of <b>plywood.</b> Unlike some of its predecessors, Soviet Strike features only a helicopter - albeit with power-ups in some levels - and the team also abandoned the unpopular on-foot levels found in Urban Strike. The developers aimed to include more humour in the game, with other additions being voice-overs and full motion video.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center began issuing {{hurricane}} warnings {{early on}} August 14, anticipating that Beryl would reach hurricane strength. The warnings were issued along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to the United StatesMexico border. The Government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings from the borderline south to La Pesca. The hurricane warnings issued stretched for 230miles (370km) along the coast. Mexico also issued {{a tropical storm}} warning south of La Pesca to Tampico. A storm surge of 2 to 5feet (0.6m to 1.5m) was expected along the coast near and {{to the north of}} Beryl’s center. Rainfall between 5 and 10inches (125 to 250mm) were also expected. Thousands of residents in coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Mexico were asked {{to pay attention to the}} hurricane warnings and to move towards higher ground. The National Weather Service warned the cities of Cameron and Kenedy, and Willacy County in southern Texas that severe flooding is the deadliest threat associated with the storm. In low-lying rural areas near the mouth of the Rio Grande, an estimated 20,000 residents were urged to seek shelter, as the inadequate drainage in these areas make them in danger to severe flooding. The National Weather Service also warned of possible tornadoes forming when associated with thunderstorms and tropical storm generated winds. Authorities in southern Texas filled 20,000 sandbags along the shores, and closed government offices. Residents nailed <b>plywood</b> on windows, parks were temporarily closed, and documents were transferred to waterproof storage areas.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded <b>plywood.</b> Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
