40|$|Based {{on prior}} {{work at the}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ambient-temperature passive {{magnetic}} bearings are being adapted for use in high-power flywheel energy storage systems developed at the Trinity Flywheel Power company. En route to this goal specialized test stands have been built and computer codes have been written {{to aid in the}} development of the component parts of these bearing systems. The Livermore passive magnetic bearing system involves three types of elements, as follows: (1) Axially symmetric levitation elements, energized by permanent magnets., (2) electrodynamic ''stabilizers'' employing axially symmetric arrays of permanent magnet bars (''Halbach arrays'') on the rotating system, interacting with specially wound electrically shorted stator circuits, and, (3) eddy-current-type vibration dampers, employing axially symmetric rotating <b>pole</b> <b>assemblies</b> interacting with stationary metallic discs. The theory of the Livermore passive magnetic bearing concept describes specific quantitative stability criteria. The satisfaction of these criteria will insure that, when rotating above a low critical speed, a bearing system made up of the three elements described above will be dynamically stable. That is, it will not only be stable for small displacements from equilibrium (''Earnshaw-stable''), but will also be stable against whirl-type instabilities of the types that can arise from displacement-dependent drag forces, or from mechanical-hysteritic losses that may occur in the rotor. Our design problem thus becomes one of calculating and/or measuring the relevant stiffnesses and drag coefficients of the various elements and comparing our results with the theory so as to assure that the cited stability criteria are satisfied...|$|R

The localization of oskar and nanos mRNAs is closely related to their translational activation. We provide evidence here by in vitro biochemical assays that Vasa protein is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, an ATPase and an RNA-binding protein, as was predicted from its sequence similarity to mammalian translation initiation factor eIF- 4 A. The enzymatic activities of Vasa protein are important for its function, but the initial localization of Vasa protein to the pole plasm is independent of its RNA helicase and RNA-binding activities. Further, we cloned Bruno, a Xenopus etr- 1 homologue with three ribonucleoprotein-recognition-motifs (RRM), by far-western screening using Vasa protein as bait. Bruno is the product of the gene arrest, which was cloned independently by Webster and Macdonald at Stanford University. The localization of Bruno protein in S 1 - 10 oocytes {{is similar to that of}} oskar and gurken RNAs. This is significant as both oskar and gurken RNAs contain Bruno-response-elements at their 3 $ sp prime$UTRs. Bruno is mislocalized in vasa mutant ovaries, suggesting that the localization of Bruno protein requires Vasa function.

40|$|As in many organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes {{assemble}} bipolar meiotic spindles in {{the absence}} of centrosomes. While the assembly of the mitotic spindle in C. elegans has been studied in some detail, how the poles assemble {{in the absence}} of centrosomes remains poorly understood. In an ongoing screen for temperature-sensitive (TS), embryonic-lethal mutants, we have identified TS mutations in multiple genes required for oocyte meiotic spindle <b>pole</b> <b>assembly.</b> We have so far identified mutations in four genes: or 1178 ts in mei- 1, which encodes the catalytic domain of the microtubule severing complex katanin; or 447 ts in klp- 18, which encodes a kinesin 12 family member; or 645 ts in aspm- 1, which encodes a microtubule scaffolding protein; and or 1092 ts and or 1292 ts in klp- 7, which encode a kinesin 13 /MCAK family member. By using live cell imaging of oocytes from transgenic strains expressing GFP and mCherry fusion to proteins associated with the spindle, we have found and confirmed other findings that klp- 18 promotes spindle bipolarity and that MEI- 1 promotes <b>pole</b> <b>assembly</b> both by severing microtubules and by recruiting ASPM- 1. More recently, we have found that klp- 7 is required for maintaining bipolarity in the meiotic spindle by preventing the number of poles that can form. In klp- 7 (-) mutants, we observed in addition to extraneous poles an excess accumulation of microtubules during Meiosis I. Futhermore, reducing klp- 7 function can restore bipolarity in a klp- 18 (-) monopolar spindle mutant background. We also observed that disruption of the kinetochore factor KNL- 1 in klp- 7 (-) mutants exacerbates the extra spindle pole phenotype.

Microtubule asters assembled in response to centrosomes and Ran-GTP in this system. Magnetic beads coated with pADPr, extended from PARP- 5 a, also triggered aster assembly, suggesting a functional role of the pADPr in spindle <b>pole</b> <b>assembly.</b> We found that PARP- 5 a is much more active in mitosis than interphase. We used mitotic PARP- 5 a, self-modified with pADPr chains, to capture mitosis-specific pADPr-binding proteins.

We propose that pADPr provides a dynamic cross-linking function at spindle poles by extending from covalent modification sites on PARP- 5 a and NuMA and binding noncovalently to NuMA and that this function helps promote assembly of exactly two poles.

40|$|SummaryTranslation of oskar {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA) {{is activated}} at the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte, producing Long Oskar, which anchors the RNA, and Short Oskar, which nucleates the pole plasm, containing the posterior and germline determinants.

Furthermore, the nonphosphorylatable mutant produces bicaudal embryos when oskar mRNA is mislocalized.

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} has a key {{function in}} the temporal and spatial organization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the identification of {{a new class of}} polymer-forming proteins, termed bactofilins, that are widely conserved among bacteria.

In other bacteria, bactofilins can establish rod-shaped filaments or associate with the cell division apparatus, indicating considerable structural and functional flexibility. Bactofilins polymerize spontaneously in the absence of additional cofactors in vitro, forming stable ribbon- or rod-like filament bundles.

40|$|SummaryVasa (Vas) is a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase {{expressed}} in germline cells [1] that localizes to a characteristic perinuclear structure called nuage [2, 3]. Previous {{studies have shown}} that Vas has diverse functions, with roles in regulating mRNA translation, germline differentiation, <b>pole</b> plasm <b>assembly,</b> and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) -mediated transposon silencing [1, 4 – 10]. Although vas has also been implicated in the regulation of germline proliferation in Drosophila and mice [1, 11], little is known about whether Vas plays a role during the mitotic cell cycle. Here, we report a translation-independent function of vas in regulating mitotic chromosome condensation in the Drosophila germline. During mitosis, Vas facilitates robust chromosomal localization of the condensin I components Barren (Barr) and CAP-D 2. Vas specifically associates with Barr and CAP-D 2, but not with CAP-D 3 (a condensin II component). The mitotic function of Vas is mediated by the formation of perichromosomal Vas bodies during mitosis, which requires the piRNA pathway components aubergine and spindle-E. Our results suggest that Vas functions during mitosis and may link the piRNA pathway to mitotic chromosome condensation in Drosophila...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{mechanism by which}} meiotic spindles become bipolar and the correlation between bipolarity and poleward flux, using Xenopus egg extracts. By speckle microscopy and computational alignment, we find that monopolar sperm asters do not show evidence for flux, partially contradicting previous work. We account for the discrepancy by describing spontaneous bipolarization of sperm asters that was missed previously. During spontaneous bipolarization, onset of flux correlated with onset of bipolarity, implying that antiparallel microtubule organization may be required for flux. Using a probe for TPX 2 in addition to tubulin, we describe two pathways that lead to spontaneous bipolarization, new <b>pole</b> <b>assembly</b> near chromatin, and pole splitting. By inhibiting the Ran pathway with excess importin-alpha, we establish a role for chromatin-derived, antiparallel overlap bundles in generating the sliding force for flux, and we examine these bundles by electron microscopy.

To investigate the role of vasa in oocyte development, we generated a new null mutation of vasa, which deletes the entire coding region. Analysis of vasa-null ovaries revealed that the gene {{is involved in the}} growth of germline cysts. In vasa-null ovaries, germaria are atrophied, and contain far fewer developing cysts than do wild-type germaria; a phenotype similar to, but less severe than, that of a null nanos allele. The null mutant also revealed roles for vasa in oocyte differentiation, anterior-posterior egg chamber patterning, and dorsal-ventral follicle patterning, in addition to its better-characterized functions in posterior embryonic patterning and pole cell specification. The anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning phenotypes resemble those observed in gurken mutants. vasa-null oocytes fail to efficiently accumulate many localized RNAs, such as Bicaudal-D, orb, oskar, and nanos, but still accumulate gurken RNA. However, GRK accumulation in the oocyte is severely reduced in the absence of vasa function, suggesting a function for VASA in activating gurken translation in wild-type ovaries...|$|R

We did not find evidence that this function is conserved in flies yet. We created a null mutant for vls, which shows a maternal effect lethal phenotype accompanied by posterior polarity defects in the embryos. Hemizygous vlsEMS females show a weaker, partially maternal-effect lethal and a fully penetrant grandchildless phenotype. The posterior localization of Vasa is disrupted in vlsnull ovaries, but the initial distribution of Oskar protein and mRNA appear normal. However, levels of the Short Oskar isoform responsible for <b>pole</b> plasm <b>assembly</b> are greatly reduced and Vasa appears to be differently modified post-translationally. Furthermore, a Vls::GFP fusion protein is detected all throughout oogenesis in the nurse cell and oocyte cytoplasm.

40|$|AbstractThe GTPase Ran regulates {{multiple}} cellular functions {{throughout the}} cell cycle, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, nuclear membrane assembly [1], and spindle assembly [2 – 10]. Ran mediates spindle assembly by affecting multiple spindle assembly pathways: microtubule dynamics [6, 7], microtubule motor activity [6], and spindle <b>pole</b> <b>assembly</b> [8 – 10]. Ran {{is predicted to}} facilitate spindle assembly by remaining in the GTP-bound state around the chromatin in mitosis. Here, we directly test the central tenet of this hypothesis in vivo by determining the cellular localization of Ran pathway components in Drosophila embryos. We find that, during mitosis, RCC 1, the nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, is associated with chromatin, while Ran and RanL 43 E, an allele locked in the GTP-bound state, localize around the spindle. In contrast, nuclear proteins redistribute throughout the embryo upon nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB). Thus, in vivo RanGTP has the correct spatial localization within the cell to modulate spindle assembly...|$|E
40|$|During interphase, Rab 11 -GTPase-containing {{endosome}}s recycle endocytic cargo. However, {{little is}} known about Rab 11 endosomes in mitosis. Here, we show that Rab 11 localizes to the mitotic spindle and regulates dynein-dependent endosome localization at poles. We found that mitotic recycling endosomes bind gamma-TuRC components and associate with tubulin in vitro. Rab 11 depletion or dominant-negative Rab 11 expression disrupts astral microtubules, delays mitosis, and redistributes spindle pole proteins. Reciprocally, constitutively active Rab 11 increases astral microtubules, restores gamma-tubulin spindle pole localization, and generates robust spindles. This suggests a role for Rab 11 activity in spindle pole maturation during mitosis. Rab 11 depletion causes misorientation of the mitotic spindle and the plane of cell division. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the organization of astral microtubules and the mitotic spindle through Rab 11 -dependent control of spindle <b>pole</b> <b>assembly</b> and function. We propose that Rab 11 and its associated endosomes cocontribute to these processes through retrograde transport to poles by dynein...|$|E

40|$|In many animals, germ-cell fate is {{specified}} by inheritance of the germ plasm, which is enriched in maternal RNAs and proteins. Assembly of the Drosophila germ (pole) plasm {{begins with the}} localization and translation of oskar (osk) RNA at the oocyte posterior pole. osk RNA produces two isoforms, long and short Osk. Short Osk recruits other pole plasm components, and long Osk restricts them to the oocyte cortex. Although molecular functions of long Osk remain mysterious, it {{is known to be}} involved in endocytic activation and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. We identified several vesicular trafficking machinery components that act downstream of long Osk in <b>pole</b> plasm <b>assembly.</b> These included the Rab 5 effector protein Rabenosyn- 5 (Rbsn- 5) and the Golgi/endosomal protein Mon 2, both of which were crucial for Osk-induced actin remodeling and the anchoring of pole plasm components. We propose that, in response to long Osk, the Rab 5 /Rbsn- 5 -dependent endocytic pathway promotes the formation of specialized vesicles, and Mon 2 acts on these vesicles as a scaffold to instruct actin nucleators like Cappuccino and Spire to remodel the actin cytoskeleton, which anchors pole plasm components to the cortex.

40|$|The {{localization}} of Oskar at {{the posterior}} pole of the Drosophila oocyte induces the <b>assembly</b> of the <b>pole</b> plasm and therefore defines where the abdomen and germ cells {{form in the}} embryo. This localization is achieved by the targeting of oskar mRNA to the posterior and the localized activation of its translation. oskar mRNA seems likely to be actively transported along microtubules, since its localization requires both an intact microtubule cytoskeleton and the plus end-directed motor kinesin I, but nothing is known about how the RNA is coupled to the motor. Here, we describe barentsz, a novel gene required for the localization of oskar mRNA. In contrast to all other mutations that disrupt this process, barentsz-null mutants completely block the posterior localization of oskar mRNA without affecting bicoid and gurken mRNA localization, {{the organization of the}} microtubules, or subsequent steps in <b>pole</b> plasm <b>assembly.</b> Surprisingly, most mutant embryos still form an abdomen, indicating that oskar mRNA localization is partially redundant with the translational control.

It has previously been shown in a variety of model systems that B-type cyclin/CDK complexes, kinesin- 5 motors, and the SCF Cdc 4 ubiquitin ligase are required for the separation of spindle <b>poles</b> and <b>assembly</b> of a bipolar spindle. It has been suggested that, in budding yeast, B-type cyclin/CDK (Clb/Cdc 28) complexes promote spindle pole separation by inhibiting the degradation of the kinesins- 5 Kip 1 and Cin 8 by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC Cdh 1). We have determined, however, that the Kip 1 and Cin 8 proteins are present at wild-type levels in the absence of Clb/Cdc 28 kinase activity.

Mass spectrometry analysis confirms that two CDK sites in the tail domain of Kip 1 are phosphorylated in vivo.

Here, we report Plk 3 localizes to the nucleolus and is involved in regulation of the G 1 /S phase transition. We demonstrate that the level of Plk 3 protein is cell cycle regulated, peaking in G 1. We have delivered Plk 3 -interfering RNA with lentivirus to serum-starved cells and found that, upon serum stimulation, Plk 3 is required for cyclin E expression and entry into S phase. Plk 3 -interfering RNA-induced Plk 3 depletion resulted in a large fraction of asynchronously proliferating cells to become quiescent. We propose the Plk 3 requirement in the cell cycle is fulfilled in G 1, and that once cells pass this point, they are able to complete cell division, whereas in the absence of Plk 3, they fail to reenter the cell cycle. Additional data suggest that Plk 3 may regulate entry into S phase in part through interaction with the phosphatase Cdc 25 A, because its depletion also resulted in attenuation of cyclin E expression...|$|E
40|$|Dynactin is a multi-subunit complex {{which was}} {{initially}} identified in 1991 as an activator of cytoplasmic dynein-driven microtubule-based organelle motility in vitro. Although genetic studies also supported {{the involvement of}} both complexes in the same functional pathways in yeast, filamentous fungi, and Drosophila, none of these findings yielded significant insights into dynactin 2 ̆ 7 s mechanism of action. The full range of cytoplasmic dynein functions in vertebrate cells has also remained poorly understood, due, in large part, {{to the lack of}} a specific method of inhibition. The present thesis work was designed to investigate these issues through a study of the 50 kDa subunit of dynactin. As a first step (Chapter 1), I cloned mammalian p 50 and characterized its expression at the tissue and subcellular levels. Rat and human cDNA clones revealed p 50 to be a novel α-helix-rich protein containing several highly-conserved structural features including one predicted coiled-coil domain. Immunofluorescence staining of p 50, as well as other dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein components in cultured vertebrate cells showed that both complexes are recruited to kinetochores during prometaphase and concentrate near spindle poles thereafter. These findings represented the first evidence for dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein co-localization within cells, and for the presence of dynactin at kinetochores. The second major phase of the thesis (Chapter 2) was focused on investigating dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein function in cultured cells in vivo using a dominant negative inhibition approach based on transient transfections of p 50 constructs. Overexpression of wild type human p 50 in cultured cells resulted in a dramatic fragmentation and dispersal of the Golgi apparatus. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy analysis of p 50 -overexpressing cells revealed that microtubule-based vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi was inhibited. Also, the interphase microtubule organizing center was found to be less well-focused in some but not all transfected cells. Overexpression of p 50 also disrupted mitosis, causing cells to accumulate in a prometaphase-like state. Chromosomes were condensed but unaligned, and spindles, while still generally bipolar, were dramatically distorted. Sedimentation analysis revealed the dynactin complex to be dissociated in the transfected cultures. Furthermore, both dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein staining at prometaphase kinetochores was markedly diminished in cells expressing high levels of p 50. These findings provided the first in vivo evidence for the role of dynactin in cytoplasmic dynein function, i. e. mediating the motor 2 ̆ 7 s binding to at least one 2 ̆ 2 cargo 2 ̆ 2 organelle, the kinetochore, and probably also to others such as vesicles destined for the Golgi complex. These data also strongly implicated both dynactin and dynein in Golgi organization during interphase, and chromosome alignment and spindle organization during mitosis. Based on the remarkable disruptive phenotypic effects associated with overexpressing of p 50, the name of dynamitin was proposed for this polypeptide. In the third and last phase of the thesis (Chapter 3), two issues were addressed: first, the dynamitin-induced mitotic arrest phenotype was studied in greater detail to better understand the exact sites of dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein activity throughout mitosis. Second, a domain analysis of dynamitin was performed to gain insight into its function within the dynactin complex. A time-lapse fluorescence microscopy study of mitosis in living dynamitin-overexpressing COS- 7 cells strongly suggested specific defects in interactions of astral microtubules with the cell cortex, and in both spindle <b>pole</b> <b>assembly</b> and maintenance. Analysis of the mitotic arrest phenotype in a second cell line revealed a second arrest point at metaphase, and a clear effect of dynamitin overexpression on spindle axis orientation, again consistent with defects in interactions between microtubules and the cell cortex. Refined analyses of kinetochore and spindle pole components also confirmed specific defects in kinetochore function and spindle pole organization. Taken together, these findings support three main sites of dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein activity during vertebrate mitosis: prometaphase kinetochores, spindle poles, and the cell cortex. Finally, the domain analysis revealed dynamitin to be capable of self-association through at least two separate interaction domains, consistent with models of the mechanism underlying dynamitin-induced dynactin dissociation, and therefore, yielding important new insights into dynactin assembly. This study also indicated that a third region within dynamitin, residues 105 to 154, is essential for dynamitin and dynactin function. An independent study confirmed this finding, implicating this region in binding to ZW 10, an upstream kinetochore protein. Dynamitin has therefore been revealed to be the kinetochore-targeting subunit of dynactin, and indirectly, cytoplasmic dynein. Through the body of this thesis work, dynamitin has also emerged as a powerful new tool for studying vertebrate dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein function in vivo and in vitro...|$|E

With this paper we start a series of publications considering designing of Halbach cylinder based magnet assemblies for non simultaneous cycles. In present, for the first part we define a designing procedure which, applied to the Halbach cylinder, allows creation of two or higher <b>pole</b> number magnet <b>assemblies.</b> We consider here two and four pole cases in great details. Each designing procedure step is accompanied by 3 D finite element simulation. The achieved final magnet designs fulfill the predefined requirements of particular field distribution in the air gap, maximized ratio of high field volume to the permanent magnet volume, best utilization of magnets and magnetocaloric materials and constructional simplicity. A short comparison of two and four pole arrangements is given...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAccurate {{animal cell}} {{division}} requires precise coordination {{of changes in}} the structure of the microtubule-based spindle and the actin-based cell cortex. Here, we use a series of perturbation experiments to dissect the relative roles of actin, cortical mechanics, and cell shape in spindle formation. We find that, whereas the actin cortex is largely dispensable for rounding and timely mitotic progression in isolated cells, it is needed to drive rounding to enable unperturbed spindle morphogenesis under conditions of confinement. Using different methods to limit mitotic cell height, we show that a failure to round up causes defects in spindle <b>assembly,</b> <b>pole</b> splitting, and a delay in mitotic progression. These defects can be rescued by increasing microtubule lengths and therefore appear to be a direct consequence of the limited reach of mitotic centrosome-nucleated microtubules. These findings help to explain why most animal cells round up as they enter mitosis...|$|R
6000|$|The {{principals}} in the duel to which Byron alludes were Wellesley-Pole and Lord Kilworth. The {{occasion of the}} quarrel was a misconception of some expression of <b>Pole's</b> at an <b>assembly</b> at Lady Hawarden's (August 6, 1811). A meeting took place on Wimbledon Common (August 9), at which the seconds intervened, and everything was [...] "amicably adjusted." [...] Some days later a letter appeared in the 'Morning Post' (August 14, 1811), signed [...] "Kilworth," [...] {{to the effect that}} an apology had been offered and accepted. This led to a second meeting on Hounslow Heath (August 15), when shots were exchanged. Again the seconds intervened, and, after more explanations, matters were finally arranged. A 'jeu d'esprit' which appeared in the 'Morning Chronicle' (August 16, 1811) connects the [...] "mortal fracas" [...] with Pole's prowess in waltzing at a fête at Wanstead House, near Hackney, where, when the heiress had been wooed and won, his guests used to dine at midnight after the opera.|$|R
40|$|In angiosperms, mitosis and {{cytokinesis}} {{take place}} in the absence of structurally defined microtubule-organizing centers and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In the spindle and phragmoplast, microtubule reorganization depends on microtubule-interacting factors like the γ-tubulin complex. Because of their critical functions in cell division, loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding genes are often homozygous or sporophytic lethal. However, a number of mutations like gem 1, gcp 2, and nedd 1 can be maintained in heterozygous mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. When mutant microspores produced by a heterozygous parent undergo pollen mitosis I, they are amenable for phenotypic characterization by fluorescence microscopy. The results would allow us to pinpoint at specific functions of particular proteins in microtubule reorganization that are characteristic to specific stages of mitosis and cytokinesis. Conclusions made in the developing microgametophytes can be extrapolated to somatic cells regarding mechanisms that regulate nuclear migration, spindle <b>pole</b> formation, phragmoplast <b>assembly,</b> and cell division plane determination...|$|R
50|$|The governor's role {{is largely}} ceremonial, but plays {{a crucial role}} when it comes to {{deciding}} who should form the next government or in suspending the legislature as has happened in the recent past. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005. In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the governor and President's Rule was declared, which suspended the legislature. A by-election in June 2005 saw the Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The Congress party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the two largest parties in the state. In the <b>assembly</b> <b>pole</b> of 2007, Congress-led coalition won and started ruling the state.

40|$|Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-related motors, Cin 8 p and Kip 1 p, {{perform an}} {{essential}} role in the separation of spindle <b>poles</b> during spindle <b>assembly</b> and a major role in spindle elongation. Cin 8 p and Kip 1 p are also required to prevent an inward spindle collapse prior to anaphase. A third kinesin-related motor, Kar 3 p, may act antagonistically to Cin 8 p and Kip 1 p since loss of Kar 3 p partially suppresses the spindle collapse in cin 8 kip 1 mutants. We have tested the relationship between Cin 8 p and Kar 3 p by overexpressing both motors using the inducible GAL 1 promoter. Overexpression of KAR 3 results in a shrinkage of spindle size and a temperature-dependent inhibition of the growth of wild-type cells. Excess Kar 3 p has a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of cin 8 kip 1 mutants and can completely block anaphase spindle elongation in these cells. In contrast, overexpression of CIN 8 leads to premature spindle elongation in all cells tested. This is the first direct demonstration of antagonistic motors acting on the intact spindle and suggests that spindle length is determined by the relative activity of Kar 3 p-like and Cin 8 p/Kip 1 p-like motors...|$|R
40|$|Type IV {{secretion}} {{is used by}} pathogenic microorganisms {{to transfer}} effector macromolecules to eukaryotic target cells. The VirB/D 4 apparatus of Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers DNA and proteins to plant cells. We postulated that the cell pole {{is the site of}} assembly of the A. tumefaciens type IV apparatus. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we now demonstrate that 10 of the VirB proteins localized primarily to one cell pole and a macromolecular VirB complex is assembled at the <b>pole.</b> Neither the <b>assembly</b> of the complex nor polar localization of a VirB protein requires ATP utilization by the VirB ATPases. The requirement of other VirB proteins for the polar localization of at least six VirB proteins indicates an essential role of protein–protein interaction in polar targeting. Four proteins (VirB 3, VirB 4, VirB 8, and VirB 11) could target themselves to a cell pole independent of a VirB protein. We provide evidence that VirB 6 –VirB 10 are the structural components of the type IV apparatus. Using strains that express defined subsets of the virB genes, we demonstrate that VirB 7 –VirB 10 are the minimum components sufficient for the assembly of a polar VirB complex. VirB 6 associates with this complex to form the type IV secretion apparatus. VirB 8 functions as the assembly factor and targets the apparatus to the cell pole...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation depends on biorientation, whereby sister chromatids attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle <b>poles.</b> The spindle <b>assembly</b> checkpoint is a conserved surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes that inhibits anaphase onset until all chromosomes are bioriented 1, 2, 3. In current models, {{the recruitment of}} Mad 2, via Mad 1, to improperly attached kinetochores is a key step needed to stop cell cycle progression 3, 4, 5, 6. However, {{it is not known}} if the localization of Mad 1 -Mad 2 to kinetochores is sufficient to block anaphase. Furthermore, it is unclear if other signalling proteins (e. g. Aurora kinases 7) that regulate chromosome biorientation have checkpoint functions downstream of Mad 1 -Mad 2 recruitment to kinetochores or if they act upstream to merely quench the primary error signal 8. Here, to address both these issues, we engineered a Mad 1 construct which, unlike endogenous Mad 1, localizes to kinetochores that are bioriented. We show that Mad 1 ’s constitutive localization at kinetochores is sufficient for a metaphase arrest that depends on Mad 1 -Mad 2 binding. By uncoupling the checkpoint from its primary error signal, we show that Aurora kinase, Mps 1 and BubR 1, but not Polo-like kinase, are needed to maintain the checkpoint arrest even when Mad 1 is present on bi...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{orientation}} of the mitotic spindle is essential during animal development for the generation of cell diversity and organogenesis. To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this process, genetic studies have implicated evolutionarily conserved proteins that function in diverse cell types to align the spindle along an intrinsic cellular polarity axis. This activity is achieved through physical contacts between astral microtubules of the spindle and a distinct domain of force generating proteins on the cell cortex. In this work, I shed light on how these proteins form distinct cortical domains, how their activity is coupled to their subcellular localization, and how they provide cytoskeletal and motor protein connections that are required to generate the forces necessary to position the mitotic spindle. I first discuss the mechanisms by which Mushroom body defect (Mud; NuMA in mammals), provides spindle orientation cues from various subcellular locations. Aside from its known role at the cortex as an adapter for the Dynein motor, I reveal novel isoform-dependent Mud functions at the spindle <b>poles</b> during <b>assembly</b> of the mitotic spindle and astral microtubules, thus implicating Mud in spindle orientation pathways away from the cell cortex. Moreover, through collaborative efforts with former lab members, I describe molecular regulation and assembly of two ‘accessory’ pathways that activate cortical Mud-Dynein, one through the tumor suppressor protein Discs large (Dlg), and another through the signaling protein Dishevelled (Dsh). I demonstrate that the Dlg pathway is spatially regulated by the polarity kinase atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) through direct phosphorylation of Dlg. This signal relieves Dlg autoinhibition to promote cortical recruitment of the Dlg-ligand Gukholder (Gukh), a novel microtubule-binding protein that provides an additional connection between astral microtubules and the cortex that is essential for activity of the Dlg pathway. Lastly, I determine that the Dsh accessory pathway provides an alternative cytoskeletal cue by recruiting Diaphanous (Dia), an actin nucleating protein. By demonstrating interchangeability between the two accessory pathways, we conclude that Mud-Dynein is activated by various cytoskeletal cues and that the mode of activation is cell-context dependent.

40|$|Proper cell {{division}} requires an accurate {{definition of the}} division plane. In bacteria, this plane is determined by a polymeric ring of the FtsZ protein. The site of Z ring assembly in turn {{is controlled by the}} Min system, which suppresses FtsZ polymerization at noncentral membrane sites. The Min proteins in Escherichia coli undergo a highly dynamic localization cycle, during which they oscillate between the membrane of both cell halves. By using computer simulations we show that Min protein dynamics can be described accurately by using the following assumptions: (i) the MinD ATPase self-assembles on the membrane and recruits both MinC, an inhibitor of Z ring formation, and MinE, a protein required for MinC/MinD oscillation, (ii) a local accumulation of MinE is generated by a pattern formation reaction that is based on local self-enhancement and a long range antagonistic effect, and (iii) it displaces MinD from the membrane causing its own local destabilization and shift toward higher MinD concentrations. This local destabilization results in a wave of high MinE concentration traveling from the cell center to a pole, where it disappears. MinD reassembles on the membrane of the other cell half and attracts a new accumulation of MinE, causing a wave-like disassembly of MinD again. The result is a pole-to-pole oscillation of MinC/D. On time average, MinC concentration is highest at the <b>poles,</b> forcing FtsZ <b>assembly</b> to the center. The mechanism is self-organizing and does not require any other hypothetical topological determinant...|$|R
