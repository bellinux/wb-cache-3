Different grades of crosslink <b>polyacrilic</b> resin were utilised to prepare MIMTs; employing complexation technique; and using additives like Mannitol DC, Ac-di-sol, Avicel-pH 112, Tusil pinapple, Saccharine sodium, Aerosil and Magnesium stearate. MIMTs were evaluated for compliance to pharmacopoeial specifications.

40|$|Foi realizado estudo {{in vitro}} da infiltração {{marginal}} apical de obturações retrógradas no qual se procurou avaliar a capacidade de selamento do ionômero de vidro (Ketac-cem), cimento EBA e cimento Zoecim em função do uso de substâncias complementares de limpeza como solução fisiológica, EDTA e ácido poliacrílico. Para tanto, foram utilizados 90 dentes, instrumentados e obturados pela condensação lateral. A seguir procedeu-se à apicetomia a 3 mm do ápice. Prepararam-se cavidades apicais a 2 mm de profundidade. Impermeabilizou-se a superfície externa dos dentes e dividiu-se aleatoriamente em 9 grupos de 10 dentes, que deveriam receber as substâncias complementares de limpeza e os materiais retrobturadores em teste. As raízes foram imersas em azul de metileno a 2 % por 24 horas e a seguir lavadas e desgastadas em sua hemiface para as leituras da infiltração marginal apical, em ocular micrométrica. A análise estatística dos dados mostrou que a microinfiltração ocorreu em todos os grupos e que o ionômero de vidro foi significantemente melhor que o EBA e o Zoecim, que se igualaram entre si com uma pequena vantagem em relação ao ácido poliacrílico. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the sealing ability of glass ionomer cement, Zoecim cement and EBA cement, as retrofolling material, when the cavity preparations were cleaned with saline solution, EDTA ans <b>polyacrilic</b> acid. Ninety extracted human single-rooted anterior teeth were instrumented ans obturated with laterally condensed gutta-percha sealer. The apical 3 mm of each root was resected and 2 mm deep apical preparation cut. The root surfaces were coated and randomly allocated to nine groups of ten teeth and submitted to one of the experimental groups. The teeth were immersed em 2 % methylene blue solution for 24 hours. After vertical sectioning, dye penetration was examined and the results were statistically analyzed. The microleakage has occurred in all groups and the glass ionomer cement was significantly better than EBA and Zoecim cement. When comparing EBA and Zoecim no differences were found. Regarding the cleaning procedures, the <b>polyacrilic</b> acid demonstrate a slight advantage when compared to EDTA and saline solution...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new label-free detection technique called Pulsed Streaming Potential (PSP). Its novelty relies on the adaptation of a classical electrokinetic phenomenon (streaming potential) into a tool which can evaluate molecular interplay in label-free fashion. Implementation of PSP to microfluidic platforms allowed the label-free sensing of binding events to plastic (modified and unmodified) surfaces. It was demonstrated the use of real time PSP in plastic microfluidic platforms for determination of kinetic parameters of the interaction of proteins and plastic surfaces. Moreover, initial change of PSP after adsorption of proteins showed to be proportional to the bulk concentration of proteins and it was used for quantification of Lysozyme in the nanomolar range. Several approaches were studied to manipulate the surface of microfluidic channels in order to improve selectivity of PSP through reduction of non-specific adsorption. These approaches included the fabrication of composite surface of <b>polyacrilic</b> acid (PAA) and polyethylene glycol acrylate (PEGA) on cyclic olefin copolymer microchannels, as well as adsorption of nanospheres on COC-PEGA channels...|$|E
40|$|Composite anodes {{based on}} Si and reduced {{graphene}} oxide (RGO) {{have been prepared}} using commercial Si nanopowder, graphene oxide (GO) and <b>polyacrilic</b> acid (PAA) as starting materials. A double reduction step, consisting in microwave irradiation at mild power followed by thermal annealing in reducing atmosphere, yielded the composite powder made of Si:reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in the approximate mass ratio 30 : 70. The charge/discharge properties of the anode materials {{are determined by the}} homogeneous dispersion of Si grains between RGO nanosheets, that act as structural buffer for volume changes related to Li-Si reversible alloying and as improved electrical conductor. Electrodes have been prepared using high-molecular weight PAA as binder, which promises better mechanical stability towards silicon volume changes. The electrochemical behavior of the composite anode material has been characterized by galvanostatic cyclations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, using LiPF 61 M in EC:DMC 1 : 1 electrolyte, also modified by the addition of 5 % vinylene carbonate (VC). Several anodes have been investigated, consistently delivering reversible capacities higher than 1000 mAhg- 1, with a mechanism that, after initial lithiation of crystalline Si, mainly involves reversible Li-Si alloying/dealloying between amorphous a-Li and a-LixSi phases. Particularly, when cycled in VC-modified electrolyte the anode exhibits a remarkable cycle life, resulting in a residual capacity of more than 900 mAhg- 1 after 60 cycles at 500 mAg- 1 and efficiency values close to unity. Several factors concur in determining this behavior, namely: (i) the efficient Si dispersion in RGO carbonaceous matrix; (ii) the good mechanical properties of PAA binder; (iii) the formation of a stabilized SEI by VC additive in the electrolyte...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} vehicle itself today outlives its battery, necessitating battery replacement. Lithium titanium oxide (LTO) has, in this context, been suggested {{as a new}} anode material in heavy {{electric vehicle}} applications due to intrinsic properties regarding safety, lifetime and availability. The work presented here {{is focused on the}} LTO electrode/electrolyte interface. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) has been applied to determine how and if the usage of LTO could prevent extensive anode-side electrolyte decomposition and build-up of a surface layer. The presence of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, carbonates and ether compounds was found in half-cells utilizing a standard ethylene:diethylcarbonate electrolyte with 1 M LiPF 6. Via testing of symmetrical LTO-LTO cells, the stability of the formed SEI was put in to question. Moreover, the traditional polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) binder was replaced by more environmentally benign carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) and <b>polyacrilic</b> acid (PAA) binders in LTO electrodes, and it was found that CMC helped to form a more stable surface-layer that proved beneficial for long term cycling. Following the half-cell studies, full-cells were investigated to observe how different cathodes influence the SEI of LTO. The SEI in full-cells displayed characteristics similar to the half-cells, however, when utilizing a high voltage LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 cathode, more electrolyte decomposition could be observed. Increasing the operational temperature of this battery cell generated even more degradation products on the LTO electrodes. Mn was also found on the anode when using Mn-based cathodes, however, it was found in its ionic state and did not significantly affect the composition or behavior of the observed SEI layer. Furthermore, by exchanging the electrolyte solvent for propylene carbonate, the thickness of the SEI increased, and by replacing the LiPF 6 salt for LiBF 4 the stability of the SEI improved. Thus is it demonstrated that such a passivation can be beneficial for the long-term surface stability of the electrode. These findings can therefore help prolong the lifetime of LTO-based battery chemistries...|$|E

Para a consecução, obtiveram-se a partir de uma escala de alumínio, densidades radiográficas comparáveis e possíveis de serem utilizadas no trabalho clínico. Corpos-de-prova cilíndricos foram obtidos utilizando-se lâminas de vidro de 25, 4 x 76, 2 x 1, 0 mm perfuradas por uma broca número 5 com 5, 0 mm de diâmetro. As radiografias dos corpos-deprova foram obtidas em três marcas de filmes. Foi utilizado neste experimento uma escala de alumínio padronizada denominada penetrômetro e um aparelho de raios-X Gnatus XR 6010. Os dados foram coletados por cinco examinadores devidamente calibrados e analisados pelos testes de Friedman e de Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que existiu diferença estatisticamente significante nas médias conseguidas por cada examinador nos grupos formados pelos cimentos e pelos filmes. Também mostrou que todos os cimentos apresentaram valores médios de densidade radiográfica menor que 1. Glass ionomer cements are {{generally}} {{represented by a}} combination of a powder, which main components are alumina (Al 2 O 3), silica (Si 2 O 3) and calcium fluoride (CaF 2), and a liquid, which is an aqueous solution basically compound of <b>polyacrilic</b> acid and tartaric acid. Its excellent features have been described since the 1960 s, and some of these are the radiopacity and fluoride release. The aim of this work is to study the radiopacity measured by radiographic exposures of the following restorative glass ionomers: Vidrion R (SS White Manufacturing Ltd, Gloucester, England); Chemfil (DENTSPLY DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany); Vitro Molar (DFL); Maxxion R (FGM Dental products Ltd); Riva self cure powder and liquid and Riva self cure in capsules (Riva SC, SDI Ltd, Bayswater, Australia) and to make comparisons among them. Then, different radiographic densities from an aluminum scale were attained and they could be compared and used in the clinical work. The specimens were made using standard glass plates (25, 4 x 76, 2 x 1, 0 mm) manufactured by Global Trade Technology and they were perforated by a 5 mm bur (number 5, Black & Decker, Brazil) especially used for glass. For the radiopacity evaluation, the samples were radiographed using three different types of films, which are the following: Kodak Dental Intraoral ESpeed Film (EASTMAN KODAK Co., Rochester, N. Y.); Contrast DFL DV- 58 (DFL Ltd); and Agfa Dentus M 2 Confort (Heraeus Kulzer Inc.). A 99, 5 % pure aluminum step wedge and a Gnatus XR 6010 X-ray equipment were utilized in this work. The data were collected by 5 examiners, who were properly calibrated, and analyzed by Friedman and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The results showed no statistical differences among the averages of each examiner comparing the cements and the films. And the results also showed that all the cements present radiographic density average values below 1...|$|E
