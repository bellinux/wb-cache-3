Supercritical extraction using carbon dioxide was carried out in a semi-continuous mode on the binder and its components of an acrylate-based system, the results of which were compared with a <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral)</b> -based system. To investigate the contribution of each of the binder components to overall weight loss of the acrylic-based binder, pure components as well as combination of different components were subjected to supercritical extraction. To enhance the extraction of binder, co-solvents were evaluated on the most extractable binder component and an optimal co-solvent loading was determined. Supercritical extraction experiments were then carried out and the effect of the co-solvent on the extraction profiles was examined. Enhancement in extraction was observed for the acrylic-based system whereas no overall enhancement was observed for the <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral)</b> -based system. To interpret the dynamics of supercritical extraction, diffusivities of the binder components of the acrylic-based and the <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> based) multilayer ceramic capacitors were calculated, and were found {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude. Finally, visual analysis was performed on the acrylic-based system to suggest a mechanism that led to defects in these green ceramic bodies after the extraction process. Supercritical extraction with carbon dioxide at 10 - 40 MPa and 55 - 90 ⁰C was used to remove binder from multilayer green ceramic bodies. Defects such as cracking and delamination were occasionally observed in the green bodies following the extraction process, and these defects were attributed to pressure gradients that arise during depressurization from conditions of supercritical extraction. A model based on flow in porous media was thus developed to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of pressure within the green body during depressurization. The model incorporated the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state to describe the pressure-volume-temperature behavior of the supercritical carbon dioxide, and the effect of changes in the viscosity of the supercritical fluid. The effects of the body size and gas-phase permeability on the pressure within the green body were examined...|$|E

In this study, the damages from ballistic threats at level 3 according to NIJ standard in laminated glass were investigated. Laminated glass with various configurations was fabricated using rolling and vacuum techniques. The ballistic tests were performed and the resulting radial cracks, which intercept several circumferences on each sheet of glass, were quantified.

40|$|Multi-axial aramid fabrics have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in the construction of composite structures for body armor. Nanoparticles, which include nanosilica, {{are one of the most}} common nanofillers for these structures. The particles of nanosilica possess nanometer dimensions with high specific surface area. Silane coupling agents are mostly used for modifying nanosilica surface in order to prevent silica agglomeration. Incorporation of nanosilica treated with silane adhesion promoter, in the matrix part of the hybrid composite form, leads to increased resistance to the bullet shock impact. In this study, the resistance to penetration of a shot bullet was tested for four samples of the aramid fabric composite forms.

Due to the random nature of the reaction, some of the hydoxyl groups are left unreacted. The residual hydroxyl groups greatly influence its solution behaviour leading to aggregate formation in many solvents. A number of modified samples of PVB were prepared by esterification of the hydroxyl groups with butanoic anhydride, benzoic anhydride, trifluroacetic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and succinIcanhydriue: - These modified samples were examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and dilute solution viscometry. The degree of modification was determined by chemical determination of the residual hydroxyl groups, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Viscosity measurements showed that modification with non-polar ester groups diminished the degree of aggregate formation in THF while modification. with the cyclic anhydrides showed an increased tendency towards aggregation in THF while the aggregates were efficiently disrupted by methanol. The miscibility of the modified PVB with a polyester, a polyurethane, polyethylenimine and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) was investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). It was found that samples modified with non-polar. ester groups showed reduced miscibility with these polymers, while samples modified with cyclic anhydrides showed improved miscibility with these polymers and formed macromolecular complexes with polythylenimine and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone). It was concluded that intermolecular hydrogen bonding fected the viscosity behaviour of PVB in various sole vents and was the main thermodynamic reason for promoting miscibility with the polymers studied...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research involved determining the processes that occur during dye diffusion thermal transfer printing. Dye diffusion printing is a novel method of printing photo quality graphics from a personal computer. The process involves two polymer films coming into contact, one containing a dye, and the diffusion of the dye from this donor sheet onto the receiving sheet using heating elements to drive the diffusion process. In this high temperature, high pressure, and short time scale regime undesirable adhesion between the two polymer sheets is observed. It is this adhesion and its mechanisms that were investigated. Several types of homopolymers were used in. an attempt to obtain information on the processes involved in the adhesion of the two films during the printing stage. Initially dyes were absent from the polymer films to examine the polymer adhesion alone. It was hoped that the principal factors involved in the unusual joint forming conditions could be explained. The unusual conditions are high heat (250 °C) and short time span (10 - 15 milliseconds). Polystyrene, poly (methyl methacrylate) and poly (vinyl acetate) were chosen {{to determine the effect}} of Glass Transition Temperature (T g), surface energies and molecular weight on the polymer adhesion. Initial results showed that the adhesion was a complex system. but {{it became clear that the}} t g of the polymers and the presence of small molecules and contaminants· were very important. Work with commercial polymers was undertaken to transfer the knowledge gained from the homopolymers to the more complicated commercial systems using poly (vinyl. chloride) and <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral).</b> To expand the understanding of the results small molecules and dyes were added to these commercial polymers to examine their effects. The surface of the samples were analysed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). This was used to determine if there was any migration of the small molecules to the surface of the polymer films. It was also useful in indicating the location of the dyes and how much penetration into the polymers is achieved by them. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was implemented to analyse the surface morphology and gave an insight into the mechanism of the small molecule migration. The conclusions drawn were that the presence of small molecules had significant affect on the adhesion of the polymers. Compatible small molecules would act as plasticisers and lower the T g of the polymers giving rise to higher adhesion. Small molecules that were incompatible were found to migrate to the surface in large quantities and would act as weak boundary layers, significantly reducing the adhesion. Work in this area has shown that an autolayering mechanism is occurring that may be useful in producing a release mechanism for the commercial products...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{covered in}} this thesis aimed to investigate the use of nanofibre and microfibre veils in carbon fibre reinforced composites and assessed {{the potential of the}} veils to improve damage resistance during impact and fatigue loading. It was hypothesised that the interleavings would increase the amount of energy required for crack propagation because of toughening due to fibre reinforcement mechanisms such as crack deflection, fibre pull out and fibre breakage. The work was undertaken as a combined project between the University of Waikato (Hamilton, New Zealand) and Revolution Fibres Ltd (Auckland, New Zealand). During this investigation, six thermoplastic polymers were chosen (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), polystyrene (PS), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC)) that could potentially be used for the electrospinning of polymer nanofibre veils. Nanofibre veils were successfully produced from PMMA, and a polymer blend of polyamide 6, 6 (PA 6, 6) and PMMA, (referred to as 'nanoNyplex'). These veils, along with three other nanofibre veils (nanoPA 6, 6, <b>poly</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> (nanoPVB), and poly ether sulfone (nanoPES)), three microfibre veils (polyphenylene sulfide (microPPS), polyetherimide (microPEI), and woven polyamide 6 (microtricot)) procured from other manufacturers, and three veils combining one of the nanofibre veils with each of the microfibre veils (microPPSnanoPA 6, 6, microPEInanoPA 6, 6, and microtricotnanoPA 6, 6) were then used as interleaves in the manufacture of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite panels. Interleaves were placed between every ply of prepreg. After curing the panels, test specimens were created to assess fatigue, vibration damping and compression after impact performance. From the vibration damping study, {{it was found that the}} nanoNyplex interleaving improved damping the most. It was thought that energy dissipation was due friction brought about by the movement of the interleaving fibres in the matrix, resulting in friction due to weak adhesion between the nanoNyplex fibres and the epoxy matrix. From the compression after impact (CAI) section of this study, it was found that specimens interleaved with nanoPA 6, 6, microPPS and microPPSnanoPA 6, 6 had the highest CAI strengths. From optical inspection, it appeared (in general) that as the CAI strength of the specimen increased, the length of the damage region also increased. However, those identified with the highest CAI strengths had shorter damage regions. From the fatigue section of this study, it was found that the use of most interleavings, (apart from microtricot) increased the number of cycles to failure. Post fatigue test scanning electron microscopy confirmed that crack deflection was present for most interleaved specimens. Some evidence of pull out and breakage of the interleaving fibres was seen on the fracture surfaces of the nanoPA 6, 6, microPPS, microPEI, microPEInanoPA 6, 6 and microPPSnanoPA 6, 6 interleaved specimens. For both CAI and fatigue, it was found that improvement was generally greater with veils that had a large number of fibres per unit area and high adhesion strength with the matrix. However, for CAI it seems that high fracture toughness was also desirable...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays energy {{conservation}} {{is an important}} factor that could be reached in house and building. Nanocomposite coating for windows with solar shield and heat insulator properties could represent an example. In this work, nanocomposite materials are prepared and investigated starting from two different types of polymer matrices and antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticles, known for their infrared light insulating properties. The aim is to obtain heat insulator coating for windows by using different preparative approaches. A polyurethanes of synthesis and a commercial polymer commonly used in laminate glass, named as poly(vinyl butyral), are used as polymer matrices. These materials should be transparent in visible light, able to block near infrared radiation and easy to be applied on glass in form of coating. Different kind of antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticles are used: a commercial ethanol dispersion and three ethanol dispersions prepared in our lab from nanoparticles in powder form. Dispersions from powder are achieved with and without the use of a dispersant agent. A dispersant agent able to react with polyurethane is also used in order to covalently link polymer and nanoparticles. Polyurethane matrices are based on linear thermoplastic polyurethanes formed by hard (aromatic diisocyanate) and soft segments (poly tetramethylene oxide). They are synthesized via prepolymer method followed by a chain extender step, thus leading to a hard-soft segmented polyurethane. Three nonionic polyurethanes are obtained in this way with different hard-soft content and different chain extender. Anionic and cationic derivatives are obtained by post modification of nonionic polyurethanes. In particular, cationic derivatives are synthesized via a quaternization of nitrogen atoms of the chain extender, while anionic derivatives are synthesized through ionization reaction of carboxylic groups of a different chain extender. A cationic polyurethane is synthesized directly, using a chain extender of cationic nature. Ionic charge on polyurethanes is exploited to create water polymeric dispersion, {{in order to avoid the}} use of organic solvent in the final application as coating. Nonionic polyurethanes and water polymer dispersions are then modified with antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticles. Thus, polyurethane nanocomposites are synthesized at different hard/soft content ratio, different % and type of ionic content. Materials are then characterized by several experimental techniques in order to evaluate how the different composition of polymeric matrices can affect morphology, thermal, and spectral properties of polymers and nanocomposites. <b>Poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>butyral)</b> is commercially available and it has used without modification. Poly(vinyl butyral) nanocomposites are obtained in three different ways, in order to find an approach that can be scaled up: • Casting a polymer solution added with nanoparticles dispersed in a common solvent; • Mixing poly(vinyl butyral) and antimony-doped tin oxide, all in solid state, with a mechanical mixer at high temperature; • Spray deposition of a metal oxide suspension onto poly(vinyl butyral) commercial film, followed by glass lamination. All composites both polyurethane and poly(vinyl butyral) are spectroscopically characterized in the 200 – 3000 nm spectrum region to verify the near infrared shielding effect. In order to give quantitative information about efficiency of these materials, parameters of ultraviolet, visible and solar transmittance are calculated. Size, content and type of antimony-doped tin oxide have influence on infrared transmission, but also visible transmission is affected. Promising results in shielding near infrared radiation while the visible region is maintained are reached at low nanoparticles content. Best results are obtained with laminated glass, which are compared to a commercial energy saving glass. A study of dielectric spectroscopy, 1 H Low-Field nuclear magnetic resonance, Fast Field-Cycling relaxometry and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance on poly(vinyl butyral) and its composites is performed to characterize their structural and dynamic microscopic properties.

Prophylactic measures were taken in Bulgaria to lessen the occupational hazard in the productions as set forth included limitation of the work day to 6 hr, free food, additional bonus and leave, and annual physical examinations of workers...|$|R
50|$|With the seed-mediated {{approach}} to silver nanoprism synthesis, selectivity of one shape over another can in part {{be controlled by}} the capping ligand. Using essentially the same procedure above but changing citrate to <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> pyrrolidone) (PVP) yields cube and rod-shaped nanostructures instead of triangular nanoprisms.|$|R

These prints are used instead of hand written banner for its low cost and durability.|$|R
40|$|MnO 2 -Doped Polyaniline/Poly (Vinyl alcohol) {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} chemical oxidative polymerization, using microwave oven technique on glass substrate. These thin films prepared by using Analytical Reagent grade solutions of Polyaniline, <b>Poly</b> (<b>Vinyl</b> alcohol), MnO 2, primary dopant hydrochloric acid are mixed in stoichiometric proportion. The solutions {{were kept in}} microwave for 10 sec then oxides with ammonium peroxydisulphate oxidant, then after kept in water bath to obtain the uniform thin films. Films were dries it in air medium for an hour. The electrical and gas sensing properties of these films were investigated. MnO 2, Doped Polyaniline/Poly(Vinyl alcohol) thin films showed better ammonia and trimethyl ammine vapour response as compared to undoped Polyaniline / <b>Poly</b> (<b>Vinyl</b> alcohol) thin films. The gas response was observed to be increased with their stoichiometric composition of films...|$|R
40|$|Unsupported films cast {{from water}} {{solutions}} of <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> alcohol) (PVA) and plasticizer are transparent, tough, tear and puncture resistant, resistant to oils and impermeability to most gases. PVA is apt for production of environmentally friendly items. Due to strong intermolecular forces PVA has {{high mechanical strength}} (tensile strength B > 80 MPa), though small deformability (elongation at break B < 5 %). The last one is considered as the constitutive drawback of polymers, which are intended to use for films preparation. PVA plasticizing by hydroxyl groups containing mostly low-molecular substances (glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol etc.) is recognized trend of weakening of too high intermolecular interaction. Development of PVA blends with another more deformable polymeric counter component could turn out efficient. <b>Poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> acetate) (PVAc) was chosen as a counter component...|$|R
