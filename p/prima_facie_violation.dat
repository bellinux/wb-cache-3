40|$|The Constitution of Botswana {{under section}} 3 read in {{conjunction}} with section 15, guarantees all Batswana equal enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms irrespective of one's race, colour, sex, tribe, status etc. Section 15 (3) further qualifies what conduct will be deemed discriminatory. Section 9 also ensures that every person's right to privacy is protected except where the person has given consent to have their right violated. Notwithstanding, the same Constitution permits limitations to the full enjoyment of these fundamental rights and freedoms on matters of public interest, public morality or for protecting the interests and rights of others. However, limitations in order to pass the constitutional scrutiny, must take place in terms of the authority of the law and have to be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. Criminalisation of same sex conduct which is provided for under the Penal Code is a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of the above constitutional provisions, which is, as it will be argued here, not capable of justification. The Penal Code violates section 3 of the Constitution, which aims at promoting equality of all citizens. It does so by criminalising certain sexual conducts committed by a certain group of persons (those involved in same-sex relationships), and not extending the same treatment to heterosexuals−thereby creating a discriminatory act. A <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of the right to privacy under section 9 is also established by this criminalisation. It will be argued that permitting the law to traverse into the sexual life of grown up people and regulate their sexual behavior, is not only a violation of their privacy but also dignity. Prescribing who people should fall in love with and who they should engage in sexual conduct with, violates individual autonomy―freedom of choice, which freedom should be inherent in every individual. Section 15 of the Constitution is also violated in the sense that, although its objective is to eradicate any form of discrimination, permitting {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation through criminalising same sex sexual conduct between consenting adults, defeats the very purpose that the provision is aimed at achieving. This paper acknowledges the existence of the rights to religious beliefs and practices as well as the culture and morals of the majority in Botswana. Notwithstanding, it will be argued that, taking these rights into consideration, it still does not justify the violations that the Penal Code establishes through criminalisation. This paper will recommend that, because courts are vested with the powers to declare any law or policy which it finds unconstitutional, they should thus declare those provisions of the Penal Code null and void to the extent of their unconstitutionality...|$|E

In this paper, I build a rights-based strategy for supportive housing advocates, specifically structured around {{meeting the needs}} of mentally ill homeless people. A rights-based strategy, emanating from constitutional law, is the most robust way to secure this support. The failure of New York State to provide supportive housing for mentally ill homeless people is a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of human rights under domestic law (specifically, NYS constitution Article 17, Section 1) and various international treaties. The government has enforced a property ownership and regulatory regime that interferes with mentally ill citizens' ability to satisfy their basic needs and therefore must provide a publicly-financed remedy for their condition. This thesis identifies the best legal strategy by which activists can secure this remedy. To make this is case, it is necessary to circumvent resistance from federal courts to affirmative welfare policy. I do this by identifying the state law basis of the right to adequate housing. Once it has been established as a right at the state level, federal attitudes take a different character as federal courts treat welfare entitlements as property-and federal courts vigorously defend property. by Christian Nicolas Desrosiers.

40|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides: No person shall [...] . {{be subject}} {{for the same}} offense to be twice put in {{jeopardy}} of life or limb... If a refugee who has committed a deportable offense and served his sentence is subsequently deported from {{a place where he}} calls home to a place where he would face persecution, he could literally be said to have been twice put in jeopardy of life and limb. That seems to be a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This constitutional guarantee is, however, not currently available to refugees for a complex set of reasons. The most fundamental reason is that deportation is deemed to be a consequence of a civil proceeding that does not necessitate constitutional guarantees attending proceedings of a criminal nature. Although traditionally the Double Jeopardy Clause has been viewed as a procedural safeguard and a substantive limitation on criminal punishments, the constitutionality of second civil punitive sanctions has always been a subject of serious challenges. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has expressly addressed these challenges in a series of cases and consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does impose substantive limitations on civil sanctions that are so punitive in nature to be considered second punishments. Deportation is generally considered to be a civil sanction. Notwithstanding the jurisprudential complexities involved, this article argues that the deportation of an already recognized refugee to a place where he might face persecution, pursuant to the statutory exclusion of convicted criminals, is a second punishment, and as such violates the Double Jeopardy Clause...|$|E
40|$|Over {{thirty years}} ago the Supreme Court {{established}} the standard for {{a violation of the}} Sixth Amendment right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community. Today the most consistent conclusion one can reach about fair cross-section claims is that they are unsuccessful. This Article asserts that a surprising number of Sixth Amendment claims are being denied because courts are erroneously applying the test for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee. As a result, criminal defendants are being deprived of the unique Sixth Amendment fair cross-section right, which extends beyond the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection from discrimination. Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant does not need to allege that any state actor discriminated in the jury selection process. Instead, a defendant can establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> by showing that the underrepresentation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is inherent in the jury selection process, whether by accident or design. The equal protection clause, in contrast, demands evidence of discriminatory intent. This Article reveals that at least eight federal circuits and twenty-eight states have erroneously denied defendants’ Sixth Amendment claims for failure to satisfy the equal protection requirement of discriminatory intent. This Article also uses an original survey of federal and state fair cross-section cases to explore the potential scope of the problem for the first time. Courts denied defendants’ cross-section claims for failure to meet equal protection standards in over one-third of the cases surveyed. In contrast to scholarship arguing that the fair cross-section standard needs to be revisited, this Article asserts that the anemic application of the Sixth Amendment guarantee results not from weaknesses in the underpinnings of the right or the test for enforcing it, but rather from courts’ routine importation of equal protection standards into the analysis. The key to enforcing the fair cross-section guarantee for criminal defendants is not to change the standard, but to apply it consistently with the demands of the Sixth Amendment and Supreme Court doctrine...|$|E

When a particular value arises {{despite a lack of}} explicit legal protection, its possessors often ask courts or legislatures to give them a legal entitlement to preserve and further exploit that value. Typically the holders demand (1) a liberty to employ the valued thing; (2) a right to exclude others from using it; and (3) a power to transfer the rights of exclusion and liberties of use to a market buyer. Taken together, these three entitlements - to use, to exclude, and to alienate - are recognizable as property. The law of intellectual property and unfair competition must continually decide which valuable things and behaviors should be subject to private control, and whether that control should take the form of 2 ̆ 2 property. 2 ̆ 2 Such decisions are not necessary with regard only to newly developed technologies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create understanding about Freire's critical pedagogy with its compelling emphasis on student-centered learning and social justice. The researcher maintained that Freire's work either has been distorted or {{has the potential to be}} distorted because of limited philosophical inquiry. To address this concern, then. This study explores two key elements of Freire's work. First, it identifies various philosophical assumptions shaping Freire's critical pedagogy. Second, it examines how Freire synthesized these philosophical ideas. Ultimately, the researcher discusses how these ideas might find application in adult education. An historical and philosophical approach was used in this study. The philosophies of Aristotle, Karl Marx, and Jean-Paul Sartre are important historical and philosophical components in Freire's narratives. In the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle argued that the characteristics distinguishing humans from all other entities or their "excellence", is their ability to reason. Freire adopted and expanded this idea by arguing that denying humans the opportunity to reason is a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of their basic humanity. The dialectical social conflict that Freire identifies between the oppressors and the oppressed is directly indebted to Marx's theory of dialectical materialism. Lastly. Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialism is a philosophy concerned with `being' and 'existence' which are recurring concepts in Freire's philosophical synthesis. Furthermore, this work is informed by my personal experiences in Latin America. The research concludes that Freire was particularly concerned about ideological influences on human consciousness and actions. Freire continually addressed ideological influence through a Marxist analysis. He recognized that humans are shaped by social ideas. Freire's observations provide many opportunities for progressive educators to critique their adult education curriculum and practice. The researcher concluded that; 1) Educators should be aware that Freire is not a method. In other words, educators should create their own methods; 2) Critical reflection on practice has the potential to influence one's ontology; 3) Dialogue is a central element to critical reflection on practice; 4) Teaching and learning are enhanced by contextualization and politicizing of experiences and; 5) Problem-posing education engages students through dialogue and experiential learning.

But how is a fair cross-section determined? In Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court outlined a three-pronged test defendants must satisfy to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>violation</b> of the fair-cross-section requirement: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable {{in relation to the}} number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. 1 In her article, “Systematic Negligence in Jury Operations: Why the Definition of Systematic Exclusion in Fair Cross Section Claims Must be Expanded,” Paula Hannaford-Agor explains: [w]ith few exceptions, the cases that have survived the hurdle of Duren’s [first and] second prong[s] ultimately fail because the underrepresentation was not the result of “systematic exclusion. ” Courts have consistently held the Constitution cannot hold trial courts accountable for protecting the rights of defendants if they lack the ability to prevent or control the factors that undermine or interfere with those rights. 2 For example, caselaw has established that when source lists used to compile master jury lists (especially voter-registration lists) significantly underrepresent minorities, it is not systematic exclusion for two reasons. First, unless those lists were created in a manner that constitutionally discriminates against minorities they presumptively pass constitutional muster. Second, because courts have no authority to require underrepresented groups to register to vote or obtain a state driver’s license, their underrepresentation is not inherent to the juryselection process, but rather is a result of self-exclusion. Hannaford-Agor argues: By perpetuating the misconception that courts have no responsibility to address causes of underrepresentation other than those inherent in the system itself, caselaw has created a functional safe harbor in which courts can ignore substantial minority underrepresentation in their own jury pools {{as long as they can}} plausibly deny actively contributing to the problem. 3 Hannaford-Agor argues that despite this lack of incentive created by caselaw, there are in fact many practices that courts can employ to address or mitigate the impact of nonsystematic factors. This article discusses one state’s work to both measure and address the extent to which nonsystematic factors have contributed to the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in the initial and eligible pools of jurors...|$|E
