60|$|Having fairly started, John {{took his}} stand {{opposite}} his circular {{window in the}} <b>protecting</b> <b>screen</b> or weather-board and kept a sharp look-out ahead. Will Garvie kept an eye chiefly on the rear to note that all was well in that direction. And much cause was there for caution! To rush through space at such a rate, even on a straight line and in clear weather, was trying enough, but when it is remembered that the day was wet, and that their course lay through sundry deep cuttings and tunnels, and round several curves where {{it was not possible}} to foresee obstruction, the necessity for caution will be more apparent.|$|E

They had lived in Exeter, both of them having belonged to Devonshire from their birth; and Mr. Ray, though not a clergyman himself, had been {{employed}} in matters ecclesiastical. He was a lawyer,--but a lawyer of that sort that is so nearly akin to the sacerdotal profession, as to make him quite clerical and almost a clergyman. He managed the property of the dean and chapter, and knew what were the rights, and also what were the wrongs, of prebendaries and minor canons,--of vicars choral, and even of choristers. But he had been dead many years before our story commences, and so much as this is now said of him simply to explain under what circumstances Mrs. Ray had received the first tinge of that colouring which was given to her life by church matters.|$|E

A roof-shaped <b>protecting</b> <b>screen</b> can be installed above the heat exchanger modules to keep out agglomerates and impurities that cannot pass safely through the tube packages.

He receives help from long-standing rival Julius Nicholson, who agrees to pardon Malcolm from his alleged wrongdoings in his inquiry report concerning the crime statistics {{on the condition of}} Malcolm's return. However, Nicholson is forced to blame it all on Steve Fleming who, due to Malcolm's machinations, is made to look guilty in trying to influence the inquiry report. Malcolm swiftly descends back onto the scene to hand Fleming his resignation letter. He regains his position and gives a foul-mouthed battle speech to ministers and civil servants about the impending election.|$|E

Moreover, nets are used as insect <b>protecting</b> <b>screens</b> along greenhouse ventilation openings, shading screens above greenhouse roofs, etc. In these applications, plastic nets are considered as an environmental and human health friendly alternative to pesticides, which also {{reduce the risk of}} damage of the production under adverse climatic conditions. In this respect, agricultural nets support the production of higher quality, lower input products using lower levels of agrochemicals and, in some cases, reducing or eliminating the need for energy consumption. However, their design and use is more or less empirical and the design and construction of the supporting structures are grossly empirically modified greenhouse frames or farmers made constructions, which usually pay little respect to the environment. In this study the main characteristics of agricultural nets, their use, the supporting structures and standard adopted are described...|$|R

It can absorb 90 percent of infrared radiation at up to a 55 degree angle to the screen. The layers do not need accurate alignment. The polyimide cap <b>protects</b> the <b>screen</b> and helps reduce any impedance mismatch that might occur when the wave crosses from the air into the device.|$|R
