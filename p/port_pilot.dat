50|$|Maneuvering a ship {{through the}} shallow water to berth / unberth in a port {{requires}} teamwork which involves, apart from the <b>port</b> <b>pilot,</b> the ship's captain (jointly responsible), ship's crew, port tugs, and shore linesmen. Since the pilot is on board the ship, he controls the tugs and linesmen through a radio and the ship directly. The ship's captain ensures his crew carry out the pilot's orders.|$|E
50|$|Boyd {{was born}} September 2, 1864, in Honolulu, to Edwin Harbottle Boyd (1834-1875) and Maria Punapanaewa Adams Boyd (1841-1891). His family {{background}} was of British and Hawaiian descent. His two-time great-grandfather John Harbottle (1781-1830) was a British naval officer, {{who was one}} of the first foreign residents in Hawaii and Kamehameha I's <b>port</b> <b>pilot.</b> Harbottle's wife, High Chiefess Papapaunauapu, was the adoptive granddaughter of Kamehameha I. His paternal grandfather Robert Lopaka Boyd (1785-1870), who married one of Harbottle's daughters, had served as the King's shipbuilder, and it is believed that he came from the British West Indies. Boyd's maternal grandfather, Alexander Adams, of Scottish descent, was another well-known foreign advisor of the King and has been credited by some historians as the designer of the flag of Hawaii.|$|E

50|$|Hurricane Katrina struck {{southern}} Louisiana near Pilottown, inflicting heavy {{damage on}} nearly every structure. The headquarters of the Associated Branch Pilots, located in Pilottown for over 100 years, was pushed backward off its foundation, leading the pilots to decide against rebuilding in Pilottown.

50|$|Gwyn Griffin {{was born}} in Egypt, where his {{father was in the}} Colonial Service, and was educated in England. During World War II he {{performed}} administrative duties in several British colonies in Africa. These included service as a cipher clerk to Major Orde Wingate in Ethiopia and later as adjutant to Prince Makonnen, one of the sons of Emperor Haile Selassie I, in the Sudan Defence Force. In 1946-47 he was an Assistant Superintendent in the Eritrean Police, and later worked as a <b>port</b> <b>pilot</b> in Assab. Imperfect eyesight prevented him from becoming an officer in the British Merchant Navy. In 1950 he married Patricia Dorman-Smith, a daughter of Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith. The couple lived in Australia and the Canary Islands before settling in Introdacqua in the Abruzzo region of Italy. They had no children. Gwyn Griffin died of a bloodstream infection in October 1967, while being treated for a spinal disk problem.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} part of the {{research}} on integrated port database system that was developed to deal with the inefficiency issues cause from the overlapping task by multi-agency in port area. These agencies carried out several parallel activities in the port area. The main challenge of the study is {{to ensure the safety of}} the ships as well as the passenger due to these parallel activities. The regulation that has been set up to overcome the problem sometimes could lead to inefficiency of the port activities such as the delay of departure as well as the berthing. Thus the alternative approach has been tested to overcome the problem. Automation pilotage is one of the approaches that successfully meet the challenge to overcome the problem of pilot incapability to navigate in port area. Current regulation that requires local <b>port</b> <b>pilot</b> to berthing the visiting ship need to be revised sooner as the new alternative of automation berthing system are ready to compete...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{presenting}} the activities undertaken since 2012 by the G. A. M. E. – Gesellschaft für Ausbildung in Maritimem Englisch (German Association for Maritime English) with the seat at Bremen University of Applied Sciences, Nautical Department and presided by Capt.

The Association gathers Maritime English instructors and maritime professionals who have recently focused on updating the existing Standard Marine Communication Phrases – SMCP – {{in order to}} better match the ever growing requirements in maritime aff airs. The emphasis has been put on the pilotage and tug assistance phrases, as the existing body of phrases has not been felt entirely suitable to the activities performed. Thus, Capt. Matthias Meyer, master mariner and lecturer at the Nautical Department of the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, former elder brother of <b>Port</b> <b>Pilot</b> Society Bremerhaven, was entrusted with the task of proposing a further development of the phrases related to this particular seafaring activity.

50|$|The (New Zealand) Transport Accident Investigation Commission {{released}} an interim report into the grounding on 8 March 2012. The report states only what happened but not why, {{and does not}} apportion blame. It states that Rena arrived {{at the port of}} Napier and began unloading cargo, but was forced to stand off in the harbour when a ship with priority booking arrived. Rena was therefore delayed 13 hours in leaving Napier. On making the run toward Tauranga, the captain was under pressure to make up time and to arrive at the <b>port's</b> <b>pilot</b> station by 3:00 am, and the ship's charts showed that a more direct course than usual had been set that took Rena toward Astrolabe Reef. An intermittent radar echo first noticed at 2:05 am was ignored when nothing was seen through binoculars, and at 2:14 Rena struck the reef.|$|R
40|$|Navigational {{collisions}} {{are a major}} {{safety concern}} in many seaports. Despite the recent advances in port navigational safety research, {{little is known about}} harbor pilot’s perception of collision risks in anchorages. This study attempts to model such risks by employing a hierarchical ordered probit model, which is calibrated by using data collected through a risk perception survey conducted on Singapore <b>port</b> <b>pilots.</b> The hierarchical model is found to be useful to account for correlations in risks perceived by individual pilots. Results show higher perceived risks in anchorages attached to intersection, local and international fairway; becoming more critical at night. Lesser risks are perceived in anchorages featuring shoreline in boundary, higher water depth, lower density of stationary ships, cardinal marks and isolated danger marks. Pilotage experience shows a negative effect on perceived risks. This study indicates that hierarchical modeling would be useful for treating correlations in navigational safety data...|$|R
40|$|Navigational {{collisions}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} safety concerns in many seaports. Despite the extent of recent works done on port navigational safety research, little is known about harbor pilot’s perception of collision risks in port fairways. This paper uses a hierarchical ordered probit model to investigate associations between perceived risks and the geometric and traffic characteristics of fairways and the pilot attributes. Perceived risk data, collected through a risk perception survey conducted among the Singapore <b>port</b> <b>pilots,</b> are used to calibrate the model. Intra-class correlation coefficient justifies use of the hierarchical model in comparison with an ordinary model. Results show higher perceived risks in fairways attached to anchorages, and in those featuring sharper bends and higher traffic operating speeds. Lesser risks are perceived in fairways attached to shoreline and confined waters, and in those with one-way traffic, traffic separation scheme, cardinal marks and isolated danger marks. Risk is also found to be perceived higher in night...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in the likelihood of navigational collisions in port waters has put focus on the collision avoidance process in port traffic safety. The most widely used on-board collision avoidance system is the automatic radar plotting aid which is a passive warning system that triggers an alert based on the pilot’s pre-defined indicators of distance and time proximities at the closest point of approaches in encounters with nearby vessels. To better help pilot in decision making in close quarter situations, collision risk {{should be considered as}} a continuous monotonic function of the proximities and risk perception should be considered probabilistically. This paper derives an ordered probit regression model to study perceived collision risks. To illustrate the procedure, the risks perceived by Singapore <b>port</b> <b>pilots</b> were obtained to calibrate the regression model. The results demonstrate that a framework based on the probabilistic risk assessment model can be used to give a better understanding of collision risk and to define a more appropriate level of evasive actions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} an active control system for lean blowout (LBO) in a premixed combustor. The investigated control system consists of acoustical and optical sensors, an optimal, rule-based controller and a pilot fuel actuator. The controller uses the acoustic and/or optical sensors to detect the presence of “extinguishment events ” in the flame stabilization region. The frequency (number of events per second) dramatically increases as LBO is approached. LBO is prevented by “actuating ” a pilot fuel valve that increases the {{fraction of the total}} fuel injected through a small <b>pilot</b> <b>port.</b> The <b>piloted</b> combustion region acts to stabilize the overall combustion process. It is shown that the use of the pilot fuel injection allows safe combustor operation at a lower overall equivalence ratio, which results in significant reduction of NOx emissions...|$|R
50|$|At 6am on Monday the 22 February 1932 {{in a heavy}} fog the Nimbin went ashore {{about three}} miles south of Ballina Heads. The sea was calm at the time, with the fog driving from the north.
