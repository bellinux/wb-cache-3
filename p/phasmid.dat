5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick <b>phasmid</b> (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, the goats destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks and disturbing the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native <b>phasmid</b> and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E

40|$|Stick insects (Phasmida) are {{important}} herbivores in tropical ecosystem. To date, only few studies {{that had been}} conducted on <b>phasmids</b> diversity in Malaysia. We conducted {{a study on the}} diversity of <b>phasmids</b> in Gunung Ledang National Park, Johor, Malaysia. Our objective is to determine whether there is a variation in <b>phasmids</b> diversity at different elevation levels. Besides that, this study was aimed to provide an inventory of <b>phasmids</b> in Gunung Ledang for different altitudes. Samplings were denoted by four locations based on altitude i. e. Location L 1 (altitude 1000 – 1200 m), L 2 (700 – 900 m), L 3 (200 – 350 m) and L 4 (100 – 120 m). Samplings were done by active samplings for every location using torch light between 2000 to 2230 hours during a dark moon phase. This was based on twelve sampling occasions conducted from November 2012 until October 2013. A total of 765 individuals of <b>phasmids</b> comprising 46 species in 22 genera under 5 families (Phasmatidae, 4 spesies in 3 genera; Heteronemiidae, 35 spesies in 15 genera; Aschiphasmatidae, 4 spesies in 1 genus; Bacillidae, 2 spesies in 2 genera; Phyllidae, 1 spesies, 1 genus) has been recorded for Johore National Park, Mount Ledang. The Margalef’s Species Richness index (R’) based on altitude shows the highest at L 4 (R’= 4. 857) and lowest at L 1 (R’ = 3. 765). Analysis of Shannon Wiener Diversity Index (H’) following the altitude was highest in altitude L 2 (H’ = 2. 547) and L 3 shows the lowest value (H’ = 1. 6). The Evenness Index, E’ = 0. 6072 was highest at L 4 and lowest at L 3 (E’ = 0. 1981). Species Accumulation Curve was not reaching the asymptotes; hence, further samplings are needed in order to obtain better results to represent species richness of <b>phasmids</b> for these areas...|$|R
