40|$|We {{present a}} {{clinical}} classification of central vestibular syndromes {{according to the}} three major <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the vestibulo-ocular reflex: yaw, roll, and pitch. The plane-specific syndromes are determined by ocular motor, postural, and percep tual signs. Yaw plane signs are horizontal nystagmus, past pointing, rotational and lat eral body falls, deviation of perceived straight-ahead {{to the left or}} right. Roll plane signs are torsional nystagmus, skew deviation, ocular torsion, tilts of head, body, and perceived vertical in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Pitch plane signs are upbeat/downbeat nystagmus, forward/backward tilts and falls, deviations of the per ceived horizon. The thus defined vestibular syndromes allow a precise topographic analysis of brainstem lesions according to their level and side. Special emphasis is placed on the vestibular roll <b>plane</b> syndromes <b>of</b> ocular tilt reaction, lateropulsion in Wallenberg's syndrome, thalamic and cortical astasia and their association with roll <b>plane</b> tilt <b>of</b> perceived vertical. Recovery is based on a functionally significant central compensation of a vestibular tone imbalance, the mechanism of which is largely un known. Physical therapy may facilitate this central compensation, but this has not yet been proven in prospective studies.

Evidence is presented for a preliminary classification of central vestibular brainstem syndromes according to the three major <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) : (1) disorders of the VOR in the horizontal (yaw) plane (horizontal nystagmus, pseudo 'vestibular neuritis'); (2) disorders of the VOR in the sagittal (pitch) plane (downbeat nystagmus; upbeat nystagmus); (3) disorders of the VOR in the frontal (roll) plane (ocular tilt reaction; lateropulsion). The pathophysiology of peripheral vestibular disorders is discussed: a specific gravity differential between the cupula fluid and the endolymph (buoyancy mechanism) causes vertigo in benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo and positional alcohol nystagmus. Vestibular neuritis is probably a partial unilateral vestibular paralysis due to viral infection of the superior division of the nerve trunk. The common post-traumatic vertigo is explained by otolith dysfunction secondary to dislodged otoconia resulting in unequal loads on the macula beds and a tonus imbalance between the two otoliths...|$|R

5000|$|Ralph Trine {{wrote in}} In Tune With The Infinite (1897): The law of {{attraction}} works universally on every <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and we attract whatever we desire or expect. If we desire {{one thing and}} expect another, we become like houses divided against themselves, which are quickly brought to desolation. Determine resolutely to expect only what you desire, then you will attract only what you wish for. [...] Rhonda Byrne published in 2006 the film The Secret wherein she emphasized thinking about what each person wants to obtain, but also to infuse the thought with the maximum possible amount of emotion. She claims the combination of thought and feeling is what attracts the desire. The Secret says your subconscious mind can control everything that happens around you, including both positive experiences, like having someone call you from miles away, and negative experiences, like death. The Byrne underlines {{the power of the}} subconscious mind by asking the reader to take full control of these thoughts, in order to achieve things in life, with the mind, as much as with action. Another similar book, is James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy, which says reality can be manifested by man. Man and the universe have a force of attraction between them similar to a magnetic attraction. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, says readers can achieve seemingly impossible goals by learning how to bring the mind itself under control. The Power by Rhonda Byrne, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle are similar. While personal testimonies claim the secret and the law to have worked for them, a number of skeptics have criticized Rhonda Byrne's film and book. One New York Times book review calls the secret pseudoscience and an [...] "illusion of knowledge".|$|E
40|$|We are {{approaching}} the 20 th anniversary of Ian Ayres’ and John Braithwaite’s 1992 book, Responsive Regulation. This paper, which {{was prepared for}} a September 2010 workshop at UBC, considers {{the implications of the}} recent financial crisis for Ayres’ and Braithwaite’s concept of “enforced self-regulation. ” Its main thesis is that flexible and iterative regulatory strategies, such as enforced self-regulation and its progeny, are more porous to influence from different <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> than prescriptive regulation would be. When focusing on technical regulatory design strategies, scholars should therefore be cautious about bracketing or underestimating the problem of power operating at the “macro level” of political and economic influence. In the context of financial regulation, this background power framework contributed to an under-ambitious regulatory agenda framed around the inevitability of complexity, the clear value of innovation, and the need to minimize the regulatory burden. Also, at the “micro” <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> implementation, the content of regulatory principles was poorly specified {{because of the lack of}} a robust regulatory presence, pervasive (and predictable) over-optimism, and an excessive reliance on computer modeling and code to assess risk and compliance. The paper argues that considerable regulatory autonomy and internal analytical capacity is required to make the precise form that flexible regulation takes reflect actual regulatory intention, rather than the influence of these “macro” and “micro” level forces. Among the various contemporary forms of flexible regulation, only meta-regulation – an approach that includes the updated version of Responsive Regulation, as articulated by John Braithwaite in a new article to be published in this volume – has been designed with this kind of systematic learning at the core of its regulatory project...|$|R
40|$|This {{anatomical}} study {{describes the}} morphology {{of the human}} lumbar multifidus muscle through gross and chemical dissection of fresh cadavers. Previous morphological descriptions were analyzed with regard to fascicular divisions and cleavage planes. Gross dissection {{was performed on the}} lumbar multifidus of four fresh adult human cadavers and four preserved cadavers. Gradual chemical dissection using nitric or formic acid was used for connective tissue digestion to enhance the documentation of muscle fiber direction. Results revealed four distinct layers of the lumbar multifidus separated by cleavage planes. The superficial layer was more extensive than previously described with bony attachments at both the origin and insertion at several vertebral levels. The attachments of the second through fourth layers differed in that distinct cleavage planes between the various fascicles were not found with chemical dissection. The lumbar multifidus has a multipennate fiber arrangement, and the fascicles between the various layers inter-attach. Inter-fascicle attachment differs with the description by Macintosh et al <b>of</b> distinct cleavage <b>planes</b> between and within the fascicles of each layer. Accurate anatomical knowledge of the fascicles of the lumbar multifidus is integral for defining the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> this complex lumbar muscle. This study supports the clinical belief that the multifidus has a significant role in control and stabilization of the lumbar spine in multiple <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The multipennate arrangement of this muscle with fascicular inter-attachment supports the clinical premise that the multifidus is activated in a variety of positions and can potentially produce and mediate intersegmental mobility and provide proprioception...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to examine the physical, private/domestic and public/national space, {{as well as the}} complex interrelations between them, as {{represented}} in Woolf’s last novel, Between the Acts (1941). My method involves a gradual broadening of the perspective. I begin by studying the representation and symbolism of physical objects and spaces of Pointz Hall – the novel’s setting, before moving on to a discussion of the domestic objects and architecture, and their implications for the family and domestic sphere. Finally, I investigate the elements of national space in the novel, and the tense relationship between the private and public space – “this odd mix up”, a consequence of Woolf’s feeling of her private sphere being invaded by the public event of war (Diary V 110). The constant and somewhat rapid oscillation between private and public, and the various <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in the pageant scene, as well as the concomitant fragmentation of the narrative, invite a spatial/simultaneous apprehension of the scene and the whole novel, a fact which, to my knowledge, has gone unremarked by critics. Thus, using Joseph Frank’s (1941) essay on spatialisation of form in modern literature as a conceptual framework, I analyse the spatiality of the novel’s form, and suggest that its interlocking planes fit in mosaic patterns evocative of Cubist art. All in all, the simultaneous summoning up of “all life, all art, all waifs & strays”, and the old English country house with the adjacent landscape, seems to be Woolf’s nostalgic last glance at “all things lovely” (Diary V 135, 351) ...|$|R

40|$|Motile {{spermatozoa}} {{from the}} golden hamster {{have been arrested}} by rapid freezing and then fixed with glutaraldehyde at low temperature after substitution with ethylene glycol. As far as can be judged, the flagellar waveforms thus stabilized {{are similar to those}} seen in living sperm; in contrast, fixation in glutaraldehyde, without prior freezing, induces agonal changes in flagellar conformation. The characteristic waveform after freeze substitution contains three bends. Approx. half of these flagella are entirely planar. The rest are threedimensional, with the third bend displaced in a regular way from the plane containing the proximal two bends. From the geometry of these flagella, it is concluded that the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of a given bending cycle undergoes a clockwise twist (from a forward viewpoint) as the cycle is succeeded by new bending cycles. This "twisted plane " undulation is quite different from helical movement.

A numerical discrete 3 D model is proposed and compared to the homogenised Love–Kirchhoff plate model.

The bending constants of both Love–Kirchhoff and Reissner–Mindlin models are the same, while the shear constants of the Reissner– Mindlin model are identified using a simple procedure of compatible identification between the 3 D discrete model and the 2 D one. A numerical evaluation of the scatter between the 3 D discrete model and both Love–Kirchhoff and Reissner–Mindlin models is performed on a test case for various values of the ratio between the thickness of the wall and its overall size, and for various values of the parameter that characterises the heterogeneity of the wall. It is shown that both plate models coincide asymptotically with the discrete 3 D model, the convergence being better for the Reissner–Mindlin model...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two problems central to contemporary philosophy: the unacknowledged bias of structuralist theory towards linguistic signs {{and the lack}} of a coherent theorisation of social conflict. In order to address these conundrums, I reconcile Saussurean and Peircean semiotics and then use Ruthrof's corporeal pragmatics to break from the verbocentric idea of language as a closed system, showing instead that verbal meanings originate from the body, its senses and its imagination, as informed by the deixis of individual communities. With the transformation of linguistic semiotics into corporeality, Foucault's notion of discourse and the neglected category of discursive practice are then reworked to show how statements based on nonverbal signs might function discursively. The culmination of the 1970 s Northern Irish prison war in the events of the 1981 hunger strikes offers a study that unites the focus upon nonverbal discourses with the examination of conflict. In exploring the ways in which republican hunger strikers struggled for legitimacy with the prison authorities, I am able to show how previous notions of conflict, especially Lyotard's differend, are thrown into disrepute by a corporeal perspective recognising the intersemiotic and heterosemiotic character of communication. The availability of diverse semiotic media such as the visual, the haptic, the proximic, etc., offers positions in which conflicts may be regulated without ending in the stalemate that Lyotard describes. The division of semio-discursive phenomena into verbal and nonverbal elements, and the tracing of the effects that these elements have upon ideational and pragmatic <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> also reveal a variety of strategies related to conflict that are superposable upon other instances. As a result, the thesis suggests that the role of political violence in politics and the meanings associated with the taking of life can be approached from a new angle...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} direct link between manifestations of {{classical}} Hamiltonian chaos and quantum nonintegrability effects as they occur in quantum invariants. In integrable classical Hamiltonian systems, analytic invariants (integrals of the motion) can be constructed numerically by means of time averages of dynamical variables over phase-space trajectories, whereas in near-integrable models such time averages yield nonanalytic invariants with qualitatively different properties. Translated into quantum mechanics, the invariants obtained from time averages of dynamical variables in energy eigenstates provide a topographical map <b>of</b> the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> quantized <b>actions</b> (quantum numbers) with properties which again depend sensitively {{on whether or not}} the classical integrability condition is satisfied.
