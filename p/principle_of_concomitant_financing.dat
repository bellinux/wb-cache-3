40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Kropotkin’s {{commitment}} to a concept of evolution has often been viewed as a problematic aspect of his political thought, and {{the adoption of the}} evolutionary metaphor has led to the marginalisation of his historical works. Mainstream readings suggest that he adhered to a fatalist position, seeing anarchism as an inevitable future state, revealed by a careful reading of the historical record. It is argued here that Kropotkin’s use of evolution is more subtle. A closer analysis of his historical writing reveals that he did not adopt a straightforward notion of progression, and that reaction {{played a central role in}} his analysis of history. Thus, for Kropotkin, anarchism was not the inevitable culmination of the historical process, and active revolutionary activity remained essential. Moreover, Kropotkin did not see anarchism as representing an end to history. As a potential mode of future organisation Kropotkin’s image of anarchism enshrined a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> flux, <b>concomitant</b> with an anarchist emphasis on maximising freedom. Far from conflicting with his anarchist politics, Kropotkin’s approach to history reflects its central principles...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{multitude}} of methacrylic monomers {{is used in}} dentistry. Glutaraldehyde (G) is used in dental practice and consumer products as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the frequency and the risk <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization to some methacrylic monomers (methyl methacrylate (MMA), triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2, 2 -bis-[4 -(2 -hydroxy- 3 -methacrylo-xypropoxy) phenyl]-propane (Bis-GMA), 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate (2 -HEMA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate (THFMA)) and glutaraldehyde in students of dentistry, students from the dental technician school, dental professionals and dental patients. Material and Methods: A total of 262 participants {{were included in the}} study: students of dentistry, students from the dental technician school, dental professionals, and dental patients as a control group. All were patch-tested with methacrylic monomers and glutaraldehyde. The results were subject to the statistical analysis (p < 0. 05). Results: Among the group of dental students, the highest frequency <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization was to TEGDMA and G (15. 5 %). In the group of patients the highest frequency <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization was to EGDMA and G (16. 4 %). The frequency <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization among dental professionals was much lower, with the highest rate to TEGDMA and G (7. 7 %), too. We consider the students from the dental technician school, where the exposure to glutaraldehyde is less likely, to be the group at a lesser risk <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization. Conclusions: Dental students and dental patients could be outlined as groups at the risk <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization to glutaraldehyde and methacrylic monomers. For dental professionals, we assumed an increased risk for concomitant sensitization to TEGDMA and aldehydes that are commonly used in dentistry. We consider the students from the dental technician school to be the group at a lesser risk <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> sensitization to glutaraldehyde and methacrylic monomers.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{externally}} validate the prognostic value <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) in radical cystectomy (RC) specimens using a large international cohort of bladder cancer patients. Methods: The records of 3, 973 patients treated with RC and bilateral lymphadenectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) at nine centers worldwide were reviewed. Surgical specimens were evaluated by a genitourinary pathologist at each center. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression models addressed time to recurrence and cancer-specific mortality after RC. Results: 1, 741 (43. 8 %) patients had concomitant CIS in their RC specimens. Concomitant CIS was more common in organ-confined UCB and was associated with lymphovascular invasion (p < 0. 001). Concomitant CIS was not associated with either disease recurrence or cancer-specific death regardless of pathologic stage. The presence <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> CIS did not improve the predictive accuracy of standard predictors for either disease recurrence or cancer-specific death in any of the subgroups. Conclusions: We could not confirm the prognostic value <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> CIS in RC specimens. This, together with the discrepancy between pathologists in determining the presence <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> CIS at the morphologic level, limits the clinical utility <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> CIS in RC specimens for clinical decision-making.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{surgical}} removal of the meth A fibrosarcoma from its semisyngeneic host fails to result in postexcision immunity to growth of a tumor implant unless the host already has acquired a mechanism <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> immunity to growth of an implant. Therefore, tumor excision does not cause immunity to be generated but preserves a mechanism <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> immunity that already exists and which otherwise would eventually undergo down-regulation {{under the influence of}} suppressor T cells. Removal of the tumor after it has grown large enough to cause the T cell-mediated suppression <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> immunity does not result in the reemergence of immunity. Instead, the host remains unable to generate concomitant immunity to a second tumor {{for a long period of}} time and retains, for at least 31 d, suppressor T cells able to passively transfer suppression to appropriate recipients. Like the suppressor T cells responsible for active suppression <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> immunity, the suppressor T cells responsible for "memory" suppression are of the Ly- 1 + 2 - phenotype. The results indicate that progressive tumor growth results in a state of immunological tolerance of tumor-specific, transplantation antigens that can persist in the apparent absence of tumor antigens...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) co-existence of {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) can be present. Varicosities are considered as {{a risk factor for}} both SVT and DVT separately. However, current evidence is contradictory whether varicosities are associated with an increased or reduced prevalence <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> DVT in {{patients with}} SVT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic value of both presence and absence of varicosities in the detection <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> DVT in non-hospitalized patients with SVT. METHODS: In MEDLINE and EMBASE, a systematic search was performed to collect all published studies on this topic. The selected papers were critically appraised. By diagnostic 2 × 2 tables prior probabilities and predictive values were computed. RESULTS: Six relevant articles were identified. The prior probability <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> DVT in patients referred from primary care to the outpatient clinic varied between 13 and 34 %. In five studies, absence of varicosities was related to a higher probability <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> DVT (33 - 44 %) compared to a presence of varicosities (3 - 23 %). The sixth study showed an inversed, non-significant association: DVT was present in 21 % of patients with SVT on non-varicose veins versus in 35 % of patients with SVT on varicose veins. CONCLUSION: In five out of six studies on patients with SVT in outpatient settings, absence of varicosities was related to a higher probability <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> DVT. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether an assessment of varicosities in general practice could result in an improved selection of patients who require additional imaging to detect or exclude DVT...|$|R
40|$|Historically, archaeological evidence, {{post-mortem}} {{findings and}} retro- spective analysis of leprosy institutions??? data demonstrates a high observed incidence <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> infection with leprosy and tuberculosis (TB). However, reports <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> {{infection in the}} modern literature remain scarce, with estimates of annual new case detection rates <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> infection at approximately 0 ?? 02 cases per 100, 000 population. Whilst the mechanism for this apparent decline in concomitant infections remains unclear, further research on this topic has remained relatively neglected. Modelling of {{the interaction of the}} two organisms has suggested that the apparent decline in observations <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> infection {{may be due to the}} protective effects of cross immunity, whilst more recently others have questioned whether it is a more harmful relationship, predisposing towards increased host mortality. We review recent evidence, comparing it to previously held understanding on the epidemiological relationship and our own experience <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> infection. From this discussion, we highlight several under-investigated areas, which may lead to improvements in the future delivery of leprosy management and services, as well as enhance understanding in other fields of infection management. These include, a) highlighting the need for greater understanding of host immunogenetics involved in concomitant infection, b) whether prolonged courses of high dose steroids pre-dispose to TB infection? and, c) whether there is a risk of rifampicin resistance developing in leprosy patients treated in the face of undiagnosed TB and other infections? Longitudinal work is still required to characterise these temporal relationships further and add to the current paucity of literature on this subject matter...|$|R

30|$|The {{incidence}} of complications {{in this series}} was significantly higher in those having major concomitant surgery than in the total group. However, this applied only to all complications grouped together rather than individual complications. The rate was still lower than the rate of complications encountered in the randomised controlled trial that compared TVT sling to Burch colposuspension [16]. Whilst it is logical that major surgery {{would be associated with}} more {{incidence of}} complications than minor surgery, a similar observation was not reported by any of the published studies that looked at TVT sling insertion alongside other gynaecological procedures [4 – 14]. Nonetheless, published studies looked at a much smaller range <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> gynaecological procedures, whereas this series included the full range <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> gynaecological operations. The rate was not significantly higher in those who had previous continence surgery. It is important to bear in mind that neither this series nor the published studies were powered to compare the safety <b>of</b> <b>concomitant</b> surgery in different subgroups of patients.|$|R
