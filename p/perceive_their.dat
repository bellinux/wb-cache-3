40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examined}} the likely direction of influence between perceived parental rearing and attachment type among first grade school children. Measures of perceived parental rearing and attachment type were administered to children through interview (n= 120). The results revealed that securely attached children <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> mothers as warmer than insecurely attached children. Ambivalently attached children <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> mother as overprotective, anxious and less warm. More so, avoidantly attached children <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> mothers as less warm and less protective. Further findings indicated that, ambivalently attached children <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> mothers as overprotective and anxious than avoidant children. These results provide new insight into the direction of effects between attachment and perceived parental rearing during childhood. Future studies may consider moderating variables which may affect the relationship between perceived parental rearing and attachment style...|$|R

25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E

Across cultures, best professors were perceived to employ more nonverbal expressiveness, relaxed movement, in-class conversation, and out-of-class communication than worst professors. Relative to Japanese and Taiwanese students, Australian and U. S. students <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> professors to use more nonverbal expressiveness. Students from Australia, Sweden, and the U.

The report is based on the analysis of data drawn from a representative sample of 10,000 U.S. workers who were surveyed through WorkTrends, KRI’s annual survey of worker opinions. The results indicated a shift in women’s perceptions about work–life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain balance due to the competing pressures at work and demands at home.|$|E
25|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} the neural process that allows humans to <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> {{surroundings}} as a seamless, unified image despite rapid changes in fixation points. The human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly, {{focusing on a}} single point for only {{a short period of}} time before moving to the next point. These rapid eye movements are called saccades. If a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points, the image on screen would be a blurry, nauseating mess. Despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system, the normal experience is of a stable visual world; an example of perceptual constancy. Transsaccadic memory is a system that contributes to this stability.|$|E
25|$|Marketing for organ {{donation}} must walk {{a fine line}} between stressing the need for {{organ donation}} and not being too forceful. If the marketing agent is too forceful, then the target of the message will react defensively to the request. According to psychological reactance theory, a person will <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> freedom threatened and will react to restore the freedom. According to Ashley Anker, the use of transportation theory has a positive effect on target reactions by marketing attempts. When public service announcements use recipient-focused messages, targets were more transported. Individuals who watched recipient-focused messages were more transported because potential donors experience empathy for the potential recipient. Future public service announcements should use recipient-focused stories to elicit relationship formation between potential donors and recipients.|$|E

25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

International students who <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> cultural group to be relatively low in status experienced lower levels of psychological adjustment. Also, as expected, the effects of status were moderated by perceptions of both the permeability of intergroup boundaries and {{the legitimacy of the}} status differential. At high levels of legitimacy, perceptions of permeable group boundaries were associated with better psychological, sociocultural, and academic adjustment among international students <b>perceiving</b> <b>their</b> group to be low in status, but lower levels of adjustment among students who <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> group to be high in status.

40|$|The current {{research}} {{examined the effects}} of perceived work status of hourly employees on the established relationships between turnover intentions and the constructs of autonomy, affective organizational commitment, perceived management concern for employees, and perceived management concern for customers in the casual-dining restaurant industry. Surveys were collected from 296 employees of a multi-unit casual-dining restaurant franchise, part of a large, national, casual-dining restaurant chain. Employeeswith perceived part-time work status revealed a generally negative trend in factors shown to contribute to turnover. Employees who <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> work status as parttime also showed significantly lower levels of affective organizational commitment than those who <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> work status as full-time. Additionally, the mean scores of the desirable attributes trended lower for those employees who perceived themselves as part-time. Even more, helping behaviors, so crucial in a casual-dining environment, were lower when employees <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> work status to be part-time.

25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Victory– The long-standing {{historical}} contempt held by many Western Australians {{toward their}} eastern state neighbours, {{as well as}} a scorn for anything Victorian has culminated in an especial rivalry with the Melbourne Victory Football Club. The distaste felt by many Glory fans toward the Victorians can largely be put down to the greater bitterness felt by Western Australians toward the Eastern states in regard to matters of politics, culture and indeed other sports, especially Australian Rules Football. Western Australian's often <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> state to be 'forgotten' in matters of national interest, {{largely as a result of}} the state being such a distance from the main population and political centres of the country; a factor which can also be said to result in Western Australians being some of the more parochial people in Australia. This hatred of the eastern states can be said to focus upon Melbourne Victory in the A League as Victory are the biggest and most successful club on the Eastern seaboard. Another reason for the hate towards Melbourne Victory is due to Besart Berisha, who was awarded a controversial penalty in the dying minutes of the 2012 Grand Final.|$|E

25|$|Feeney and Thrush (2010) have {{identified}} three main functional components of secure base caregiving. First, individuals can support their relationship partner's exploratory, autonomous behaviour by being available in case support is needed. This can include actions such as removing obstacles to the partner's goal pursuit (for example, taking over some household chores {{to free up}} time for the partner {{to engage in a}} new activity), being sensitive and responsive to the partner's communications of distress, and communicating readiness to help in the event that support becomes needed. Second, effective caregiving does not unnecessarily interfere with exploration. That is, effective caregivers do not provide support when it is neither needed nor desired, attempt to take over or control the activity, or disrupt the partner's goal strivings. Third, partners should communicate encouragement and acceptance of exploration (i.e., convey enthusiasm about the pursuit rather than suggest that it is not worthwhile or will somehow detract from the relationship). Individuals who <b>perceive</b> <b>their</b> partners to be available to help are more persistent in the performance of challenging activities, whereas individuals whose partners show more interference during an activity show less persistence at the task, poorer performance, less enthusiasm for the challenge, greater negativity/hostility toward their partner, and decreases in self-esteem. Partners' communications of enthusiasm are related to better performance, heightened enthusiasm, better mood, increases in state self-esteem, enhanced self-perceptions, greater enjoyment, and more positive feelings toward the partner.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the popular notion that crushes or secondary attachments to celebrity figures are {{an important aspect of}} self-concept development during adolescence. In a repeated measures design, 79 male and female 5 th, 8 th, and 11 th graders and college sophomores completed a set of personality scales, first describing themselves and later, describing the favorite celebrity. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) analysis of self-object congruence revealed no significant main or interaction effects for the type of attachment, gender, or age of subject. Significant within subject effects were obtained for the repeated measures factor (self-object congruence). Overall, students <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> attachment objects to be more agentic, yet less expressive and emotionally vulnerable than themselves. MANOVA analyses indicated that males and older students <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> attachment objects to be higher in agency than expressivity, whereas females and younger students <b>perceived</b> <b>their</b> attachment objects to be higher in expressivity than agency. These data indicate that the function served by secondary attachments in the development of self-concept may be quite similar for adolescent males and females...|$|R
