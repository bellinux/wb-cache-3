50|$|<b>Preproinsulin</b> is {{the primary}} {{translational}} product of the INS gene. It is a peptide that is 110 amino acids in length. <b>Preproinsulin</b> is a proinsulin molecule with a signal peptide attached to its N-terminus.|$|E

50|$|Almost no <b>preproinsulin</b> {{exists in}} the cell, because removal of the signal peptide is not a {{separate}} step, but rather is closely linked to translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

50|$|Some protein {{precursors}} are secreted {{from the}} cell. Many {{of these are}} synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that targets them for secretion. Like other proteins that contain a signal peptide, their name is prefixed by pre. They are thus called pre-pro-proteins or pre-pro-peptides. The signal peptide is cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum. An example is <b>preproinsulin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the insulin {{synthesis}} pathway, first <b>preproinsulin</b> is translocated {{into the}} endoplasmic reticulum of beta {{cells of the}} pancreas with an A-chain, a C-peptide, a B-chain, and a signal sequence. The signal sequence is cleaved from the N-terminus of the peptide by a signal peptidase, leaving proinsulin. After proinsulin is packaged into vesicles in the Golgi apparatus (beta-granules), the C-peptide is removed, leaving the A-chain B-chain, bound together by disulfide bonds, that constitute the insulin molecule.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{proteins}} and hormones are synthesized {{in the form}} of their precursors - zymogens, proenzymes, and prehormones. These proteins are cleaved to form their final active structures. Insulin, for example, is synthesized as <b>preproinsulin,</b> which yields proinsulin after the signal peptide has been cleaved. The proinsulin is then cleaved at two positions to yield two polypeptide chains linked by two disulfide bonds. Removal of two C-terminal residues from the B-chain then yields the mature insulin. Protein folding occurs in the single-chain Proinsulin form which facilitates formation of the ultimately inter-peptide disulfide bonds, and the ultimately intra-peptide disulfide bond, found in the native structure of insulin. [...] Proteases in particular are synthesized in the inactive form so that they may be safely stored in cells, and ready for release in sufficient quantity when required. This is to ensure that the protease is activated only in the correct location or context, as inappropriate activation of these proteases can be very destructive for an organism. Proteolysis of the zymogen yields an active protein; for example, when trypsinogen is cleaved to form trypsin, a slight rearrangement of the protein structure that completes the active site of the protease occurs, thereby activating the protein.|$|E
40|$|Transcription {{from all}} early {{adenovirus}} promoters is stimulated by a 289 amino acid phosphoprotein encoded in the pre-early transcription unit E 1 A. To determine if this protein could act on a nonviral gene {{placed on the}} viral chromosome, adenovirus recombinants were constructed in which the rat <b>preproinsulin</b> I gene, including its promoter region, was substituted in both orientations for E 1 A. <b>Preproinsulin</b> mRNA synthesis from these recombinants was greatly stimulated after infection of line 293 cells, which constitutively express E 1 A protein, compared to HeLa cells, which do not. Expression of the <b>preproinsulin</b> gene was also greatly stimulated when HeLa cells were coinfected with the recombinants and wild-type adenovirus or a mutant defective in a second E 1 A protein, but much less so by coinfection with a mutant defective in the 289 amino acid phosphoprotein. Much of the E 1 A-induced <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA had a 5 ' end at {{the same position as}} the <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA isolated from insulinoma cells, but a considerable fraction had 5 ' ends mapping heterogeneously within several hundred nucleotides of this site. <b>Preproinsulin</b> mRNA was also detected in 293 cells but not HeLa or HEK cells after transfection of a plasmid containing the <b>preproinsulin</b> gene with no adenovirus sequence. This indicates that there is no cis-acting adenovirus sequence required for E 1 A protein stimulation of <b>preproinsulin</b> transcription. Infection of rat cells with adenovirus did not induce detectable mRNA synthesis from the endogenous <b>preproinsulin</b> I gene. These results demonstrate that the E 1 A protein can induce expression of a nonviral gene when it is newly introduced into mammalian cells by viral infection or transfection, but it does not induce the endogenous cellular gene...|$|E
40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the key metabolic signals of glucose-stimulated proinsulin gene transcription and translation, focusing on the mechanism of succinate stimulation of insulin production. METHODS: Wistar rat islets were incubated in 3. 3 mmol/l glucose with and without esters of different mitochondrial metabolites or with 16. 7 mmol/l glucose. Proinsulin biosynthesis was analysed by tritiated leucine incorporation into newly synthesised proinsulin. <b>Preproinsulin</b> gene transcription was evaluated following transduction with adenoviral vectors expressing the luciferase reporter gene {{under the control of the}} rat I <b>preproinsulin</b> promoter. Steady-state <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA was determined using relative quantitative PCR. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by microspectrofluorimetry using rhodamine- 123. RESULTS: Succinic acid monomethyl ester, but not other mitochondrial metabolites, stimulated <b>preproinsulin</b> gene transcription and translation. Similarly to glucose, succinate increased specific <b>preproinsulin</b> gene transcription and biosynthesis. The inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), 3 -nitropropionate, abolished glucose- and succinate-stimulated mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarisation and proinsulin biosynthesis, indicating that stimulation of proinsulin translation depends on SDH activity. Partial inhibition of SDH activity by exposure to fumaric acid monomethyl ester abolished the stimulation of <b>preproinsulin</b> gene transcription, but only partially inhibited the stimulation of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose and succinate, suggesting that SDH activity is particularly important for the transcriptional response to glucose. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Succinate is a key metabolic mediator of glucose-stimulated <b>preproinsulin</b> gene transcription and translation. Moreover, succinate stimulation of insulin production depends on its metabolism via SDH. The differential effect of fumarate on <b>preproinsulin</b> gene transcription and translation suggests that these processes have different sensitivities to metabolic signals...|$|E
40|$|Short-term (less than 2 h) glucose {{stimulation}} of isolated pancreatic islets specifically increases the biosynthesis of proinsulin and its converting enzymes PC 2 and PC 3 at the translation level. To determine whether gene expression of PC 2 and PC 3 was also regulated by longer-term (more than 6 h) glucose stimulation {{along with that}} of <b>preproinsulin,</b> studies were performed with the beta TC 3 insulin-producing cell line. By Northern blot analysis, glucose maintained PC 2 and PC 3 mRNA levels in parallel with those of <b>preproinsulin.</b> After 48 h, mRNA levels of <b>preproinsulin,</b> PC 2 and PC 3 were, respectively, 2. 9 (P < 0. 05), 3. 0 (P < 0. 005) and 5. 3 (P < 0. 001) times greater {{in the presence of}} glucose than in beta TC 3 cells cultured in the absence of glucose. Glucose-regulated PC 2 and PC 3 gene expression, like that of <b>preproinsulin,</b> was maximal at glucose concentrations above 5. 5 mM. Studies of mRNA stability showed that the half-lives of PC 2 (9 h) and PC 3 (5 h) mRNA were much shorter than that of <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA (over 24 h), but little effect of glucose on stability of these mRNAs was observed. Nuclear run-off analysis indicated that transcription of <b>preproinsulin,</b> PC 2 and PC 3 was modestly induced after 1 h exposure to 16. 7 mM glucose. Therefore <b>preproinsulin,</b> PC 2 and PC 3 mRNA levels in beta TC 3 cells were most probably maintained at the level of gene transcription. In contrast, elevation of cyclic AMP by forskolin had no effect on mRNA levels or gene transcription of <b>preproinsulin,</b> PC 2 and PC 3, despite a cyclic-AMP-induced phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein that correlated with a marked increase in cJun and cFos gene transcription in the same beta-cells. These results suggest that <b>preproinsulin,</b> PC 2 and PC 3 gene transcription can be specifically glucose-regulated in a mechanism that is unlikely to involve a key role for cyclic AMP. The co-ordinate increase in PC 2 and PC 3 mRNA levels with that of <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA in response to chronic glucose represents a long-term means of catering for an increased demand on proinsulin conversion...|$|E
40|$|The rate of glucose stimulated {{in vitro}} (pro) insulin {{synthesis}} in islets of Langerhans isolated from fed male rats was determined. Increases in the glucose {{concentration of the}} incubation medium, over the physiological range (2 to 20 mM), stimulated the rates of both (pro) insulin and total protein synthesis during a two hour incubation. This stimulation was preferential for (pro) insulin synthesis and had a sigmoidal dose response curve with a concentration threshold of between 2. 5 mM and 5. 0 mM and a maximal rate at 20 mM glucose. Inhibition of islet RNA synthesis by.;ctinomycin D depressedthe rate of total protein synthesis within 30 minutes of {{the application of a}} 20 mM glucose stimulus. A specific inhibition of (pro) insulin synthesis by actinomycin D, that occured 60 minutes after the application of a 20 mM glucose stimulus, was thought to reflect the inhibition of glucose stimulated <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA synthesis. The effect of glucose on islet <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content during in vitro incubations was also determined. To achieve this a dot blot hybridization assay for <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA was 3 2 developed which used a P-labeled cloned human insulin gene as the hybridization probe. The assay proved to be sensitive enough to detect <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA in as few as fifty islets. Incubation of islets, for 2 hours, at 2. 5 mM glucose had no effect on islet <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content but incubation at 20 mM glucose increased islet <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content. Actinomycin D had no effect on this pattern of glucose stimulation and it is suggested that the degradation of <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA is in some way dependent on RNA synthesis and that its inhibition by glucose {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of islet <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content...|$|E

When E. coli is transformed with plasmids bearing a gene {{consisting of a}} fusion of <b>preproinsulin</b> DNA to part or {{to all of the}} DNA encoding a bacterial signal sequence, a variety of hybrid <b>preproinsulin</b> molecules can be made. Molecules with largely complete hybrid signal sequences are secreted into the periplasm.

Efficiency of expression was investigated in the Escherichia coli strain CAG 456. The synthesized protein was sequestered in an insoluble form in inclusion bodies and was purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography based on the specific complex formation of the histidine-hexapeptide and a chelating matrix which was charged with Ni 2 + ions. The antigenic nature of the purified recombinant <b>preproinsulin</b> fusion protein was evaluated by ELISA screening for insulin autoantibodies in selected sera from patients with recent-onset type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus classified by the existence of additional autoantibodies reactive against glutamic acid decarboxylase. 14 % of the tested sera (n= 43) conttained insulin autoantibodies which strongly recognized the recombinant human <b>preproinsulin.</b> Comparable measurements with both recombinant human <b>preproinsulin</b> and mature insulin suggested that the observed autoantigenicity of <b>preproinsulin</b> was mediated by the C-peptide or/and signal peptide. ...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{defects in}} the early events of insulin biosynthesis, {{proinsulin}} misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have drawn increasing attention as causes of β cell failure. However, no studies have yet addressed potential defects at the cytosolic entry point of <b>preproinsulin</b> into the secretory pathway. Here, we provide the first evidence that inefficient translocation of <b>preproinsulin</b> (caused by loss of a positive charge in the n region of its signal sequence) contributes to β cell failure and diabetes. Specifically, we find that, after targeting to the ER membrane, <b>preproinsulin</b> signal peptide (SP) mutants associated with autosomal dominant late-onset diabetes fail to be fully translocated across the ER membrane. The newly synthesized, untranslocated <b>preproinsulin</b> remains strongly associated with the ER membrane, exposing its proinsulin moiety to the cytosol. Rather than accumulating in the ER and inducing ER stress, untranslocated <b>preproinsulin</b> accumulates in a juxtanuclear compartment distinct from the Golgi complex, induces the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), and promotes β cell death. Restoring an N-terminal positive charge to the mutant <b>preproinsulin</b> SP significantly improves the translocation defect. These findings not only reveal a novel molecular pathogenesis of β cell failure and diabetes but also provide the first evidence of the physiological and pathological significance of the SP n region positive charge of secretory proteins...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: A {{restricted}} {{region of}} proinsulin {{located in the}} B chain and adjacent region of C-peptide {{has been shown to}} contain numerous candidate epitopes recognized by CD 8 (+) T-cells. Our objective is to characterize HLA class I-restricted epitopes located within the <b>preproinsulin</b> leader sequence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven 8 - to 11 -mer <b>preproinsulin</b> peptides carrying anchoring residues for HLA-A 1, -A 2, -A 24, and -B 8 were selected from databases. HLA-A 2 -restricted peptides were tested for immunogenicity in transgenic mice expressing a chimeric HLA-A* 0201 /beta 2 -microglobulin molecule. The peptides were studied for binding to purified HLA class I molecules, selected for carrying COOH-terminal residues generated by proteasome digestion in vitro and tested for recognition by human lymphocytes using an ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay. RESULTS: Five HLA-A 2 -restricted peptides were immunogenic in transgenic mice. Murine T-cell clones specific for these peptides were cytotoxic against cells transfected with the <b>preproinsulin</b> gene. They were recognized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 17 of 21 HLA-A 2 type 1 diabetic patients. PBMCs from 25 of 38 HLA-A 1, -A 2, -A 24, or -B 8 patients produced IFN-gamma in response to six <b>preproinsulin</b> peptides covering residues 2 - 25 within the <b>preproinsulin</b> region.

A small amount of labeled peptide material which may represent the excised NH 2 -terminal extension of <b>preproinsulin</b> or its fragment was also detected. The kinetics of formation and processing of the <b>preproinsulin</b> fraction were complex, consisting of a rapidly turning over component having a half-life of about 1 min and a slower minor fraction that may have bypassed the normal cleavage process.

40|$|Rats {{and mice}} both express two, non-allelic, insulin genes. In the rat {{the ratio of}} the two <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNAs closely matches that of the mature insulin peptides. The {{experiments}} reported here demonstrate {{that this is not the}} case in the mouse. The relative amounts of the two murine proinsulin RNAs were measured by an S 1 nuclease assay. The ratio of <b>preproinsulin</b> I mRNA to <b>preproinsulin</b> II mRNA was 4 : 1 in RNA extracted from the pancreas of mice fed ad libitum or fasted for 72 h. A similar value was found in mouse islets of Langerhans after maintenance in tissue culture for 48 h at either 2. 8 or 16. 7 mM glucose. The ratio of insulin I:insulin II peptides, assessed by separating the two insulins using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography, was approximately 1 : 3 in both pancreas and islets.

40|$|We have cloned and sequenced the two mouse <b>preproinsulin</b> genes. The deduced {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} of the mature mouse insulins are {{identical to the}} published protein sequences.

We used an S 1 nuclease assay to confirm {{the presence of the}} deletion and to measure the ratio of transcripts from gene I to transcripts from gene II. The mouse <b>preproinsulin</b> I gene, like the rat gene I, is missing the second intervening sequence that normally interrupts the C-peptide region in other insulin genes. Comparison of the 52 ̆ 7 flanking sequences of the mouse and rat genes II indicates that they are homologous for at least 1000 base pairs. The <b>preproinsulin</b> I genes also share homology in their 52 ̆ 7 flanking DNAs; however, their homology to the <b>preproinsulin</b> II genes extends for only about 500 base pairs...|$|E
40|$|The two non-allelic <b>preproinsulin</b> {{genes of}} the mouse have been cloned and their {{nucleotide}} sequences determined. The mouse <b>preproinsulin</b> I gene, like its rat counterpart, has only one intron. Homology between the two mouse genes extends in the 52 ̆ 7 direction to about position - 500. Homology 32 ̆ 7 of the coding sequence terminates shortly after the polyadenylation signal with a dA rich region found in gene I. The coding sequences of the two genes have been compared. The deduced amino acid sequences of the mature hormones are identical to the published protein sequences and to the corresponding sequences of rat insulins I and II. The prepeptides of mouse insulin I and II differ at six positions. However, they maintain hydrophobic cores that are required for transport of the nacent peptide across microsomal membranes. The B-peptide of mouse insulin I differs from insulin II at two positions: at position B 9 a proline has replaced a serine, and at position B 29 a lysine has replaced a methionine, compared to the sequence of insulin II. The A-peptides of the two hormones are identical. The C-peptide of mouse proinsulin I has a deletion eliminating amino acids C 17 (Gly) and C 18 (Ala) compared to the sequence of proinsulin II. The presence of this deletion in mature RNA was confirmed through an S 1 nuclease assay. The transcriptional start sites for the <b>preproinsulin</b> genes were determined with S 1 and Mung Bean nuclease assays, and with a primer extension assay. The data indicate that transcription {{of the mouse}} <b>preproinsulin</b> genes starts 6 bp 52 ̆ 7 of the site reported for the rat II gene. Single-stranded DNA probes {{were used to determine}} the structure of the 32 ̆ 7 ends of the <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNAs. Hybridization conditions were used which only allowed each probe to detect its cognate mRNA. Digestion of the resulting DNA-RNA duplex molecules with S 1 nuclease followed by gel electrophoresis demonstrated that transcription of mouse <b>preproinsulin</b> I mRNA terminates 18 bases after the polyadenylation signal. Transcription of <b>preproinsulin</b> II mRNA terminates 43 bases after the polyadenylation signal, thus extending 25 bases past the last point of homology between the two genes. The 32 ̆ 7 end-specific probes were used in experiments designed to determine the ratio of <b>preproinsulin</b> I and II mRNA in pancreatic extracts of normal, fasted and fasted and refed mice. In all cases the amount of <b>preproinsulin</b> I mRNA exceeded <b>preproinsulin</b> II by about 2. 3 : 1. These results were extended to include an analysis of <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA from freshly isolated islets and islets incubated for 48 hours in the presence of 2. 8 mM or 16. 7 mM glucose. With both high and low glucose concentrations, the amount of <b>preproinsulin</b> I mRNA exceeded <b>preproinsulin</b> II by about 2. 3 : 1. The mouse islets were also incubated with 3 H-leucine and the ratio of insulin I and II determined after fractionation by HPLC. Unlike the mRNA results, the level of insulin II, within the islets and secreted into the media, exceeded insulin I by about 2 : 1 under all conditions. The available <b>preproinsulin</b> prepeptide amino acid sequences have been compared. The sequence of mouse I prepeptide differs from most other insulin prepeptides at amino acid position 4. At that position a tryptophan residue that is conserved in most insulin prepeptides {{has been replaced by a}} leucine in the mouse I prepeptide. This change causes a shift in the hydropathy profile in that region of the mouse insulin I prepeptide making it more hydrophobic. Every other insulin prepeptide is relatively hydrophilic at that position. This difference is postulated to interfere with signal recognition particle mediated regulation of translation and/or transport of nacent mouse <b>preproinsulin</b> I to microsomal membranes, and nay account for the discordant mRNA-peptide ratios.

The molecular weight of the mRNA is about 210, 000, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in formamide, and its sedimentation coefficient is 9. 3 S in sucrose gradients containing 0. 2 M NaCl. These results indicate that the synthesis of <b>preproinsulin</b> is directed by a monocistronic mRNA 600 nucleotides in length and requires approximately 55 % of the molecule's coding capacity...|$|E
40|$|The long terra {{effects of}} glucose on {{the rate of}} (pro) insulin {{biosynthesis}} {{and the amount of}} <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA in rat islets maintained in tissue culture were investigated. The rate of (pro) insulin synthesis was 35 times greater in islets cultured for 6 days in 8 mM glucose than it was in islets cultured in 4 mM glucose. The <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content at this time was 2 fold greater in islets incubated with 8 mM glucose compared to 4 mM glucose. The rate of (pro) insulin synthesis and the <b>preproinsulin</b> mRNA content of islets cultured at 8 mM glucose were maximal since no further significant increases were observed in islets cultured at 16 mM glucose for 6 days. These results indicate that the long term effects of glucose on the rate of (pro) insulin synthesis in rat islets of Langerhans is mediated both by transcriptional and translational events and that translational events exert the major controlling influence...|$|E
40|$|Simian virus 40 -based {{plasmids}} {{that direct}} {{the synthesis of}} <b>preproinsulin</b> during short-term transfection of COS cells {{have been used to}} probe the mechanism of reinitiation by eucaryotic ribosomes. Earlier studies from several laboratories had established that the ability of ribosomes to reinitiate translation at an internal AUG codon depends on having a terminator codon in frame with the preceding AUG triplet and upstream from the intended restart site. In the present studies, the position of the upstream terminator codon relative to the <b>preproinsulin</b> restart site has been systematically varied. The efficiency of reinitiation progressively improved as the intercistronic sequence was lengthened. When the upstream "minicistron" terminated 79 nucleotides before the <b>preproinsulin</b> start site, the synthesis of proinsulin was as efficient as if there were no upstream AUG codons. A mechanism is postulated that might account for this result, which is somewhat surprising inasmuch as bacterial ribosomes reinitiate less efficiently as the intercistronic gap is widened...|$|E
40|$|Background Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 1, formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes, {{is one of}} the autoimmune diseases where insulin-producing {{cells are}} destroyed by autoimmune response via T cells. The new approaches in treatment of diabetes are using the stem cells, cell transplantation of islet β cell, gene transfer by virus based plasmids, and non-viral gene constructs. Objectives The {{purpose of this study was}} to construct glucose inducible insulin gene plasmid and use it in the muscle tissue of the rabbit. Materials and Methods To achieve this goal, the <b>preproinsulin,</b> metallothionein 2 A promoter and the response element to carbohydrate genes were cloned into pBIND plasmid by standard cloning methods, to construct pBINDMTChIns. The gene cloning products were confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion template. The recombinant plasmid, containing the <b>preproinsulin</b> gene, was transferred into NIH 3 T 3 cells and insulin gene expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR and western blotting techniques. Plasmid naked DNA containing the <b>preproinsulin</b> gene was injected into the rabbits’ thigh muscles, and its expression was confirmed by western blotting method. Results This study shows the prepared gene construct is inducible by glucose. Gene expression of <b>preproinsulin</b> was observed in muscle tissue of rabbits. Conclusions These finding indicated that research in diabetes mellitus gene therapy could be performed on larger animals...|$|E
