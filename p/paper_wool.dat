50|$|Kazakhstan has {{practically}} no waste recycling enterprises. The few currently operating recyclers face {{a number of}} financial and organizational constraints. For instance, in Pavlodar there are two enterprises employing unique technologies (up to 96% of waste {{is used in the}} production process). They are: Pavlodar Ash-Sludge Waste Processing Plant JSC and EMEKO JSC. The base raw materials used by these enterprises are bauxite slime ofAluminum of Kazakhstan JSC and ash waste of Pavlodar TES-1, resulting from combustion of Ekibastuz coal with a high ash content. The plant produces 14 kinds of construction materials, such as brick (including fire-resistant), cement, etc. Provided the plant operates on a two-shift basis, it can annually process 32,000 tons of slime and 38 tons of ash. However, it cannot operate at full capacity due to lack of working capital.Enterprises of the ore dressing and metallurgical complexes, petrochemical, heat-and-power generating facilities, coal pits, etc. use industrial waste for the mining-technical reclamation of tailings, ash dumps, overburden dumps and hosting rocks. Thus, in waste-intensive areas (East Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanai and Pavlodar oblasts) the percentage of industrial waste usage varies, from 1.5-2% in Pavlodar oblast to 25% in Karaganda oblast. A high level of waste utilization has been achieved in this oblast {{in the last two years}} mainly due to the use of overburden and hosting rocks for technical reclamation of up to 85% of the used and disturbed land.The metallurgical slime stored on test sites is usually buried. This is largely due to lack of efficient and cost-effective recycling technologies. A small part of the waste is used in production and construction technologies by Ispat-Karmet JSC (Karaganda oblast), where practically all metallurgical slag is processed and reused. Zhairem Tsvet Мет JSC and the Balkhash smelter of Kazakhmys Corporation process all the metallurgical slag accumulated throughout the year, together with ore, in the production of copper concentrate.The following technologies of waste processing and neutralization are applied at Sokolovsko-Sarbaisky smelter (Kostanai Oblast): crushing of rocks for construction; use of mill tailings in the extraction of collective sulfide concentrate by a floatation unit and its further processing at the mining-chemical integrated works, although this technology has yet to be finalized.In 2000 Maikainzoloto OJSC (Pavlodar Oblast) started to use off-balance ores from overburdened soil dumps, including dumps located in the Maikain settlement. Maikainzoloto JSC, jointly with Technopark- Stepnogorsk JSC, plans to apply environmentally friendly technology in the production of the copper-zinc concentrate without cyanides.Ferrochrome JSC (Aktyube Oblast) is an example of successful industrial waste utilization and processing. This JSC has started to produce crushed stone from the scoria of high and low-carbon ferrochrome (more than150.0 tons per year) and ferrodust (more than 4,000 tons per year) which is further used in the manufacturing of lime-and-sand brick (more than 12,000 pieces per year). In addition, the company plans to use a bin for the reception and sorting out of the waste for further recycling. A dedicated area will be used to store metal scrap.Private sector participation in solid waste disposal helps to raise significantly the efficiency of recycling. For instance, in Pavlodar the situation improved after solid waste management was transferred to Polygon MDS JSC (accumulator of solid waste of III-IV class of hazard) and Spetsmashiny JSC (the city solid waste land fill). Another private company, which is part of Pavlodar Chemical Plant JSC, is engaged in collection, employing the technology of Tolyatti IFC Chelnok JSC (Russia). The enterprise has so far recycled more than 90,000 lamps. Experimental work has been conducted on ‘demercurization’ in the use of fluorescent lamps of Petropavlovsk by ZIKSTO JSC. In Almaty oblast the mercury-containing waste and fluorescent lamps are delivered for demercurization to the specialized enterprise Synap JSC (Almaty). A facility for the centralized collection, storage and recycling of utilized luminescent, mercury lamps and devices has been opened in Uralsk, western Kazakhstan.Recycling efforts are being made in West Kazakhstan also. For instance, Stroitekh JSC has begun to recycle broken glass and produce consumer goods from them. A similar project is being developed by Zheksengaly JSC. Uralvtorma Research and Production Association has designed a project on recycling wood-shavings, scrap <b>paper,</b> <b>wool</b> to produce composite building slabs used in the construction industry.In order to resolve the problem of waste management, it is necessary to develop a National Waste Management Program, spelling out waste management policies, a legal framework and methodology for waste disposal, an economic mechanism for waste management and monitoring. Implementation of this program requires: an inventory of existing tailings and dumps and assessment of their technical condition; specification and analysis of flows, volumes and components of accumulated and buried waste; assessment of risks for decision-making.|$|E
40|$|Preamble. Insulation of {{buildings}} {{is an important}} technology for saving heating energy and for a sustainable development. The results of a comparative LCA study of three insulation products applied for roof insulation are summarised in two parts. The products selected are based on HT stone wool representing traditional products- flax representing crop grown products and <b>paper</b> <b>wool</b> representing recycled products, respectively. Although the three materials have vastly different life cycles, they yet fulfil the same function; the methodology used should be of general interest. Part 1 of the paper contains the project background, the goal and scope definition and three life cycle assessments for the three individual products, with a detailed inventory analysis, impact assessment, sensitivity analysis and interpretation. The actual comparison of {{the results from the}} three individual life cycle assessments is presented in Part 2. An attempt is made to answer {{the question of whether the}} biological products flax and <b>paper</b> <b>wool</b> are more environmentally preferable than the mineral product stone wool representing more traditional insulation materials. In general, <b>paper</b> <b>wool</b> has the lowest global and regional environmental impacts, and flax insulation the highest, with stone wool falling in between. A notable exception is the total energy use, where stone wool has the lowest consumption followed by cellulose and flax. The study also addresses occupational health issues using an approach similar to that for risk assessment. Here, the less biopersistent HT stone wool products are seen to be the safest alternatives, because of a low potential for exposure, sufficient animal testing, and the obvious absence of carcinogenic properties...|$|E

40|$|Wool fiber is {{commonly}} used in textile industry, however, it has some technical problems which affect the quality and performance of the finished products such as felting shrinkage, handle, lustre, pilling, and dyeability. These problems may be attributed mainly {{in the presence of}} wool scales on the fiber surface. Recently, chemical treatments such as oxidation and reduction are the commonly used descaling methods in the industry. However, {{as a result of the}} pollution caused by various chemical treatments, physical treatment such as low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment has been introduced recently because it is similarly capable of achieving a comparable descaling effect. Most of the discussions on the applications of LTP treatment on wool fiber were focused on applying this technique for improving the surface wettability and shrink resistance.

30|$|Dyes are {{extensively}} {{used in many}} industries, such as in textile, leather, <b>paper,</b> <b>wool,</b> {{printing and}} cosmetics. The release of wastewater containing dye compounds into water sources has caused a severe environmental impact. As dyeing effluent will deplete the dissolved oxygen content in water and also inhibit sunlight from reaching to the water sources, some of the dye wastewater is usually poisonous and carcinogenic to human beings (Bhattacharya and Sharma 2005). Thus, the removal of dyes from wastewater is necessary before discharging into water bodies. Methylene blue (MB), an aromatic heterocyclic compound, was extensively used {{in a range of}} different fields, especially in textile industry. The wastewater containing MB has adverse impacts on flora, fauna and aquatic ecosystems (Ghosh and Bhattacharyya 2002; Guo et al. 2014). Moreover, MB is frequently used as a probe molecule for determining the adsorption capacity of adsorbents (Bestani et al. 2008). Therefore, it is essential to minimize a number of dyes to the lowest possible limit approved by the environment and health agencies. A wide range of methods has been adopted for the treatment of wastewater containing dye residues, such as coagulation, ozonation, irradiation, flocculation, electrochemical destruction, electrokinetic, membrane filtration, photocatalytic oxidation, ion exchange and adsorption on a solid phase. Adsorption is a cost-effective and user-friendly technique for the removal of existing dyes (Danish et al. 2014 a).|$|E
