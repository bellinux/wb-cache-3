40|$|On November 1, 2009, the Directive on Payment Services in the Internal Market (Payment Services Directive), which {{defines the}} legal {{framework}} {{for the establishment of}} a single market for payment services in the European Economic Area 2 and introduces a new category of payment service providers (known as “payment institutions”), was implemented in Austrian law by means of the Austrian Payment Services Act (Zahlungsdienstegesetz). The essential areas governed by the Payment Services Act are market access and licensing requirements for <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> (including the relevant supervisory provisions) as well as the issues of transparency, liability and recourse in the execution of payment services. The definition of <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> now allows nonbanks to provide payment services (subject to certain licensing and supervisory provisions), which – as classic banking transactions – were previously the exclusive domain of credit institutions in Austria. From the European Commission’s perspective, this change should facilitate access to the financial market for new payment service providers. Against this backdrop, this article provides an overview of the most important supervisory provisions in the Payment Services Act. The article then assesses the current significance of these newly defined <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> for the Austrian financial market and takes a look beyond Austria’s borders to discuss the situation in selected countries. ...|$|R

To achieve this objective, the different forms of centralization and integration of the infrastructure and processes in the area of payment services were presented. Next, the reference to the consequences of the concept of payment services hub for the organization of banks was made. The hypothesis of this article is as follows: full centralization of intra-bank systems, processes and activities related to the execution of payment services, will lead to the organisational division of business of some banks to the deposit-credit institution and the <b>payment</b> <b>institution.</b> The findings formulated in the article point to the need to consider in the banks’ strategies their role in a national, European and global payments market. They also show the need for a review of the organization of the banks’ operation, taking into consideration the concept of full centralization of payment services and integration of internal processes associated with their implementation. These changes may result in full separation of business as service providers from the organizational structure of banks, especially under European regulations.
