50|$|In {{many modern}} {{conventional}} aircraft, {{the center of}} gravity is placed ahead of the center of pressure of the main wing. The wing lift then exerts a pitch-down moment around the centre of gravity, which must be balanced by a <b>pitch-up</b> <b>moment</b> (implying negative lift) from the tailplane. A disadvantage is that it generates trim drag.|$|E
50|$|However, this {{arrangement}} also has serious stability problems. The rearmost {{section of the}} wing will stall first causing a <b>pitch-up</b> <b>moment</b> pushing the aircraft further into stall similar to a swept back wing design. Thus swept-forward wings are unstable in a fashion similar to the low-speed problems of a conventional swept wing. However unlike swept back wings, the tips on a forward swept design will stall last, maintaining roll control.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{the development of}} the transitioning vehicle Cyclone, which has been specifically designed for meteorological and agricultural applications. The mission requirements demand take-off and landing from a small area and the ability to cope with high wind speeds. In contrast with recent suggestions, our proposed design aims to be closer to a fixed-wing airplane rather than a rotary wing. In particular, the design focuses on a tilt-body style transitioning vehicle with blown-wing concept. The propeller wing interaction is calculated using a semi-empirical method. The total wing span and wing surface area are decided according to the mission performance requirements. For the control of the vehicle, incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion is used. This control method does not need the modeling of external forces or moments and is able to counteract the strong aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the vehicle through the feedback of its angular acceleration. Together with the design phases and manufacturing process, several test flights are presented. Particular diffculties of the proposed design are discussed, including lack of providing suffcient <b>pitch-up</b> <b>moment</b> and control reversal during descent. The test flights demonstrate the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of the vehicle, as well as its transitioning into forward flight from hovering, and vice versa, for an effcient missionperformance...|$|E
40|$|Power, wing {{angle of}} attack, and {{the angle of}} the duct {{relative}} to the wing were varied to achieve a specified lift and thrust for a forward velocity range from 0 to 140 knots. In this manner a so-called transition program of steady-state conditions was defined over the velocity range. It was found-that large <b>pitch-up</b> <b>moments</b> resulted when the ducted fan was operated at an angle of attack to the air stream. A deflected vane installed in the high-energy air at the duct exit was helpful in reducing these <b>pitch-up</b> <b>moments.</b> Large downwash angles were induced by the ducted fan at a selected horizontal-tail location. The possibility of using guide vanes in the duct inlet to vary thrust for the purpose of roll control at low forward speeds was examined. The maximum incremental thrust available at zero forward velocity was found to be 11 % of the total thrust required at that speed...|$|R
