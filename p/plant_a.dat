5|$|Between 1907 and 1913, a {{development}} boom occurred in Lethbridge, {{making it the}} main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> power <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — {{as well as a}} construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the mining town into a significant city. Between World WarI and World WarII, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World WarII, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, {{generating}} 20 {{megawatts of}} electricity in doing so.

5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power <b>plant.</b> <b>A</b> wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E

A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E

The commission eventually recommended the closure of the <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
