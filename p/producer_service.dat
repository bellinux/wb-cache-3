40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation explores the spatial distribution of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> establishments in the Washington DC area for 1997. Producer services are a distinct and important segment of the US industrial economy. These businesses provide the intermediary goods and services that are used as inputs for many other industrial sectors. <b>Producer</b> <b>service</b> employment and sales have grown substantially during the 1990 s {{in relation to other}} portions of the overall US economy, surpassing growth in most sectors including other types of services. The majority of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> research tends to focus on these services at the national scale or comparative studies of whole metropolitan areas. This work presents the findings for two complementary <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> research problems pertinent to intra-metropolitan spatial scale research, the contribution of face-to-face interaction to the spatial concentration of these services using sales between particular producer services, and the entropy (or diversity) of services within postal code areas and how this measure correlates to {{the presence or absence of}} particular producer services. The findings indicate that there is empirical evidence of a relationship between the strength of intra-sector trade and the degree of spatial concentration of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> establishments. This analysis also demonstrates that some <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> sectors known to have weak trade relations to other producer services do locate in areas with a lower diversity of services. The results of this research add to a growing body of research and theory that centers on interpreting the role of producer services in shaping metropolitan economies. The spatial component of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> establishment location in research is often neglected entirely or is superficially referenced.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tendencies of {{co-location}} between <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> and manufacturing across Swedish functional regions. The employment in these industries is modeled as being determined simultaneously, i. e. {{the location of}} <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> {{is a function of}} the location of manufacturing and vice versa. The rationale for the simultaneous approach comes from an assumption of a supplier-customer relation between the two categories of industries. Manufacturing firms benefit from short-distance supply of <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> The service suppliers benefit from accessibility to customers among the manufacturing firms. Accessibility based on time distances is incorporated into the analysis to allow for inter-regional effects. Controlling for the availability of a skilled workforce and the size of the private sector for <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> and the average wage-level and the size of the private sector for manufacturing, the empirical results suggest that the location manufacturing employment can be explained by its accessibility to <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> However, accessibility to manufacturing is not a statistically significant explanatory factor for the location of <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> The interpretation is that many <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> are produced for other service industries, which is consistent with previous empirical results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to describe the spatial distribution of foreign direct investment in <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> in the United States between 1978 and 1987. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the state level distribution of incoming investment in the <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> sector. However, secondary aims included a study of the links between foreign investment in <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> and local economic factors; and an investigation of the distribution of the sources of <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> foreign direct investment. ^ It was discovered that <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> foreign investment is concentrated in the coastal states, particularly New York and California. However, there has been a considerable redistribution of new investment since 1978, with states in the East North Central and South Atlantic experiencing considerable growth in foreign owned <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> firms. ^ In addition, investments initially were concentrated in a very few large metropolitan areas. Over the ten year study period, investments filtered down through the urban hierarchy and by 1987 foreign direct investments in <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> were common in a tier of medium-sized cities such as Ann Arbor, Milwaukee, and Portland. ^ Few links were found between foreign direct investment and local economic factors, with the exception that employment in foreign owned financial service firms was highly correlated with employment in domestic financial service firms, suggesting that agglomeration economies are important in attracting FDI in financial services. ^ In terms of source of FDI in <b>producer</b> <b>services,</b> most investment came from Europe, and Canada. However, in recent years, investment from Asia has become increasingly important. Spatial links were found between sources and destinations of <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> FDI. Generally, sources of <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> FDI invested in geographically proximate regions of the US.

They have created new and remarkable changes in 'postsocialist cities'. This study analyzes the intraurban {{location of}} information and consulting services in Guangzhou, China. The findings suggest that the distribution pattern of <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> has gradually changed from dispersed to centripetal development towards the new business district. This is in stark contrast with the situation in Western cities. In Ghangzhou, urban land reform, city planning, and the need for <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> to gain more prestige and business linkages have together shaped new location dynamics for <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> There has been a transformation from the once dispersed pattern into one that is more concentrated. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In contrast, more advanced (and often more expensive) services such as management consulting and industrial design exhibit lower levels of contact sensitivity.

For example, {{a certain amount}} of reward is given in some cities to service enterprises newly settled in the producer services agglomeration areas that are encouraged by the city and submit an annual tax surpassing a certain amount. For small- and medium-sized service enterprises newly settled in the producer services agglomeration areas that have difficulty paying taxes, land use tax, property taxes, and others are regularly reduced or exempted after the application is reported and approved according to the current taxation management authority. For key <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> projects newly constructed in agglomeration areas that do not divide and sell the property rights after the construction, the government awards a subsidy equal to 50 % of the local retention of the sales tax and corporate income tax levied on the business and property rental within 2 years from the starting of the business. The policy support measures of these cities have effectively promoted the development of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> agglomeration areas and functional parks, and driven the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing.|$|E

30|$|China is in {{the phase}} of {{accelerated}} development {{in the middle and}} late stages of industrialization. As seen from the international experience, countries generally follow a development path that is driven by two factors, modern manufacturing and <b>producer</b> <b>services,</b> which are integrated with each other. This means that China can neither follow the old route of relying on traditional manufacturing and heavy industry and the chemicals industry, nor develop <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> separated from industry. Instead, China should select the strategy of development driven by both modern manufacturing and <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> along with their division and interaction and should especially focus on the ‘entity economy’ of manufacturing to vigorously develop <b>producer</b> <b>services,</b> embedding high-end service elements solidly into manufacturing and promoting the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing as well as enhancing its competitiveness by <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> China has a large manufacturing industry. With the enhancement of manufacturing's development level and degree of specialization, there exists a requirement for separating <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> from manufacturing. The key to establishing the service economy is to make corresponding policies, create a favorable environment, and enable manufacturing companies to have the incentive and capability to separate <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> An important way to achieve this strategic goal is to refine the division of labor based on specialization, encourage the service segment of manufacturing enterprises to be hived off, and facilitate business outsourcing, i.e., manufacturing enterprises making a vertical decomposition of a series of <b>producer</b> <b>services</b> activities previously provided internally, outsourcing those activities such as R&D, designing, internal transportation, and procurement to professional service providers. The biggest benefit of this type of division based on specialization is that it can enable each party to fully exert their own comparative advantages, realize the optimal allocation of resources and factors, expand market demand from other parties, and enhance the industry's development potential.|$|R

40|$|Input {{users and}} {{producers}} seek {{to increase their}} profitability by locating near each other. This self-reinforcing relationship between input producers and users can be views as a basic agglomeration force to enable the modeling of agglomeration economies based on a standard monopolistic competition model without making strong a priori assumptions. First, we develop a continuous one-dimensional, general equilibrium spatial model consisting of an agricultural, manufacturing and vertically linked differentiated producer services sectors and we will demonstrate that manufacturing and <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> firms agglomerate if <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> output transportation costs are too high. On the other hand, given a small population size, only <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> firms agglomerate if <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> output transport costs are relatively lower. If the cost of transporting the agricultural good is very high, an agglomeration will not be developed. Subsequently, we introduce economies of scope in manufacturing sector through {{the presence of a}} sharable fixed input in order to discuss tradeoffs between concentration of production, to take advantage of scale economies, and dispersion of production, to take advantage of differing productivities across locations. We show that, given imperfect competition across differentiated goods, multiplant operations exist if scope economies are present and if input cost ratios across locations are neither too low or too high. Finally, we develop a simulation model to measure the investment diversion effect of tariff changes. It is analytically derived that, given imperfect competition market structure, profitability of manufacturing at each location reflects labor cost advantage, access to output markets and inputs producers, as well as intensity of competition, then an location index of profitability was constructed reflecting these elements. This measurement is adopted to a multinomial logit-type model and applied to the case of Japanese electronics direct investment changes resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Our calculations show that Asian countries will receive slightly less investment from Japan as a result of NAFTA. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} THE CHARACTER OF <b>PRODUCER</b> <b>SERVICE</b> DEMAND IN MAINLAND CHINA [...] - ITS REPERCUSSION ON HONG KONG’S SERVICE INDUSTRIES Submitted by Chan Tsze-wah, Gabriel For {{the degree}} of Doctor of Philosophy At the University of Hong Kong In February 2016 A common conviction is that Hong Kong’s economic future hinges on its successful integration with Mainland China, but despite Mainland China’s vast increase in national income {{since the beginning of}} the millennium, Hong Kong‘s yearly GDP growth rate has been showing a downward trend. This thesis seeks to uncover the causes for the feebleness of the growth momentum in Hong Kong’s service economy through studying contextually the interactions between Hong Kong’s <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> industries and the demand from the mainland from the beginning of the new century to date. To deepen the understanding of the economic integration process between Hong Kong and Mainland China, in the study, the characteristics of <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> demand and the structural restraints on the demand for knowledge-intensive producer services in the Mainland market are introduced as a critical factor, and focus is also placed on the capabilities of Hong Kong’s <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> providers and whether the city can provide the <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> needs of Mainland China competitively. The thesis finds that the low income elasticities of trade and transport services provided by Hong Kong to the mainland as well as intensive competition from mainland providers in respect of those services, the under-development of demand for knowledge-intensive producer services on the mainland, the city’s weakness in scientific and technological services, the decline in the demand for financial and professional services due to reduction in overseas fund-raising activities by Mainland enterprises, and the general obstructiveness of the Mainland market to Hong Kong service providers have largely constituted the present economic woes of the service economy of Hong Kong. In the long-term, due to the expected progressive enhancement of Mainland China’s competitiveness relative to Hong Kong and the likelihood of the continuation of the present unfriendliness in the Mainland market, there is doubt whether Hong Kong can just rely on the Mainland market to anchor its long-term economic development. The thesis also finds that in Mainland China, there are deep-rooted structural restraints on the development of knowledge-intensive producer services, an effective conduit for the dissemination of knowledge, and the country needs to overcome such restraints in order to enhance the employment of knowledge-intensive producer services so as to increase the knowledge intensity of its production systems and achieve success in its present economic transformation. published_or_final_versionGeographyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{spatial and}} sectoral {{reorganisation}} of producer services {{has begun to}} change the urban structure of Seoul. In addition to the existing centre of the CBD, two areas, Kangnam and Yongdeungpo, have emerged as the new centres of producer services in Seoul resulting from relocations from the CBD {{and the location of}} firm start-ups and spin-offs, so creating a multi-centred structure. There is a difference between the centres related to the fact that Kangnam is specialised in advanced services and has strong local networks among service firms, firms in Yongdeungpo have strong forward linkages to nearby manufacturing firms and to larger <b>producer</b> <b>service</b> firms, while firms in the CBD are relatively older and have much more intensive overseas ties. This outcome illustrates that shifts in the organisation of producer services in favour of outsourcing have been felt in shifts in spatial patterns.

We {{find that a}} country’s ability to develop a competitive service economy depends {{on the structure of}} its manufacturing sector as some manufacturing industries are more intensive users of these services. Moreover, we find a virtuous cycle as the same <b>service</b> <b>producers</b> are also intensive users of these <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> Finally we find that information and communication technologies {{have a significant impact on}} trade performance of these <b>producer</b> <b>services.</b> © 2005 Elsevier B.
