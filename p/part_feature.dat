50|$|The high altar {{was made}} by a Stralsund {{sculptor}} around 1480. During World War II the altar {{was removed from the}} church and stowed in a safe place, but it was nevertheless partially destroyed. In 1948 the damaged altar returned to the church. In 1997, a new crucifix built by Halberstadt artist Johann-Peter Hinz was installed. The central part of the 6.70 wide by 4.20 meters high altar shows the crucifixion of Christ. The wings and the central <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> numerous carved figures, all depicting the story of the Passion. The predella is dedicated to Christ's birth. In 1992, the painted wings were taken from the altar and now protrude from the two pillars on the left and right of the altar.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{turbine blades}} is often outsourced to investment casting foundries by aerospace companies that {{design and build}} jet engines. Aerospace companies have found that casting defects are an important cost driver in the price that they pay the foundries for the turbine blades. Defect types include porosity, stress, grain, fill, and mold-related defects. In order to address the defect problem, aerospace companies have adopted a design for manufacture approach to drive {{the cost of the}} turbine blades down. The principal research objective of this thesis was to discover how the critical <b>part</b> <b>features</b> on the turbine blade drive the number of manufacturing defects seen in the casting process. In the experiment, the dimensions of the critical <b>part</b> <b>features</b> were varied in order to quantify how the critical <b>part</b> <b>features</b> relate to manufacturing defects. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} CAD {{systems do}} not provide <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> information which is essential for process planning. A fully automatic <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> recognition system serves as an efficient link between CAD and CAPP. A <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> recognition system for rotational parts is proposed in this research work. The system, which is named as INFERS, consists of three modules, capable of recognizing rotational parts with multiple parallel axes. Human interpretation for feature recognition is eliminated by INFERS during the whole process. Except for the data extraction section, INFERS is independent of CAD systems by which the part is drawn. The output of the system {{can be used as}} <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> input for a CAPP system. INFERS serves as a valuble link between CAD and CAPP systems.

40|$|The plastic {{injection}} molding process {{is one of}} the most popular manufacturing processes for manufacturing thermoplastic products. The main objective of this paper is to describe the development of a <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> database and a CAD file-parsing program, which helps in identifying the features of a model, which is used in the plastic {{injection molding}} process. Part geometry is a key factor, which affects both the mold design and the manufacturing processes. For example, the mold base design needs cavity image dimensions and the part weight, which are provided by the parsing program. The manufacturing process involves optimizing the process parameters such as clamp tonnage, injection pressure, back pressure, melt temperature, mold temperature, nozzle temperature. Optimizing these parameters requires information about part surface area and part thickness, which is provided by this parsing program. The <b>part</b> <b>feature</b> database provides the basis for all these three important aspects in the plastic injection molding process...|$|E
