5|$|Bermuda's {{debut in}} the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the Bermudian {{delegation}} included five athletes, all men. Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} Bermudian Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{first saw}} {{baseball}} player David Justice on TV playing in an MTV celebrity baseball game in February 1992. When {{a reporter from}} Justice's hometown of Cincinnati told her that Justice was a fan, Berry gave her phone number to the reporter to give to Justice. Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993. Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> she was so depressed that she considered taking her own life. Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24, 1997.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> {{the main}} thrust of his legislative proposal {{would be to}} withhold funds from any local school district which integrated. In response, Gray called a meeting of the Gray Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Rosenthal {{was forced}} out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of The Arena, with both Rosenthal {{on behalf of the}} Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an option to {{purchase}} the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a proposed new professional league over exclusive rights to the Arena for professional hockey. In a plan to derail the proposed new league, Dey maintained <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> he had reserved the Arena for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on the Arena. Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at the Arena, attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918, and Rosenthal resigned from the club. Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed. Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.|$|E

5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would {{be relegated to}} a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it {{on the basis of}} patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism. When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard {{and other}} MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC; {{they wanted the}} MCC to state <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> the team {{selection}} had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed {{that it would have}} been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards. Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain. Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated <b>publicly</b> <b>that</b> they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E
