50|$|The {{bottom of}} a pH {{electrode}} balloons out into a round thin glass bulb. The pH electrode is best {{thought of as a}} tube within a tube. The inner tube contains an unchanging 1&times;10−7 mol/L HCl solution. Also inside the inner tube is the cathode terminus of the reference probe. The anodic terminus wraps itself around the outside of the inner tube and ends with the same sort of reference probe as was {{on the inside of the}} inner tube. It is filled with a reference solution of KCl and has contact with the solution on the outside of the <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> by way of a porous plug that serves as a salt bridge.|$|E
50|$|An ISFET {{electrode}} {{sensitive to}} H+ concentration {{can be used}} as a conventional glass electrode to measure the pH of a solution. However, it also requires a reference electrode to operate. If the reference electrode used in contact with the solution is of the AgCl or HgCl2 classical type, it will suffer the same limitations as conventional pH electrodes (junction potential, KCl leak, and glycerol leak in case of gel electrode). A conventional reference electrode can also be bulky and fragile. A too large volume constrained by a classical reference electrode also precludes the miniaturization of the ISFET electrode, a mandatory feature for some biological or in vivo clinical analyses (disposable mini-catheter <b>pH</b> <b>probe).</b> The breakdown of a conventional reference electrode could also make problem in on-line measurements in the pharmaceutical or food industry if highly valuable products are contaminated by electrode debris or toxic chemical compounds at a late production stage and must be discarded for the sake of safety.|$|E
30|$|QDs as <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> for {{the study}} of enzyme {{reaction}} kinetics[117] Lately, worth advancement has been achieved in water-soluble QDs as ionic probe. Jin et al. reported the use of modified CdSe QDs for the sensitive determination of cyanide ions [C[*]≡[*]N]−[117, 118]. Xie et al. reported the determination of Cu 2 + by using CdSe/ZnS QDs modified with bovine serum albumin [119]. QDs also have been reported to be sensitive to pH [120 – 125]. The sensitivity of QDs' photoluminescence to pH, improve stability, and a monitoring range for the determination of proton concentration, which is maybe due to a function of surface modifications and effects on exciton trap sites, leads to applications utilizing QDs as <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> [126]. Water-soluble QDs, ZnS, modified with mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) were sensitive to environmental factors and found to be a satisfactory <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> that could have potential applications in chemical and biochemical sensing. Using the modified QD surface, they were applied as <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> in monitoring the hydrolysis of glycidyl butyrate which is catalyzed by porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) [117].|$|R

Intracellular fluorescent <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> comprise {{one of the}} most widely used families of biosensors in microscopy. One key application of <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> has been to monitor the acidification of vesicles during endocytosis, an essential function that aids in cargo sorting and degradation. Prior to the development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (nanoscopy), investigation of endosomal dynamics in live cells remained difficult as these structures lie at or below the ~ 250 [*]nm diffraction limit of light microscopy. Therefore, to aid in investigations of pH dynamics during endocytosis at the nanoscale, we have specifically designed a family of ratiometric endosomal <b>pH</b> <b>probes</b> for use in live-cell STED nanoscopy...|$|R

5000|$|In 1969-1970, Devyatkov {{with his}} colleagues {{designed}} the world's first industrial model of <b>pH</b> <b>probe,</b> which measured the acidity {{of the two}} points of the gastrointestinal tract and apparatus for recording the pH. Also he created the original versions of pH-probes with 3, 4 and 5 sensors, intraoperation, endoscopic, children's pH-probes for different age groups, dentistry and gynecology pH-probes, as well as equipment, recording pH with multisensor pH-probes.

5000|$|The {{importance}} of refluxed gastric contents in {{the pathogenesis of}} GERD was emphasized by Winkelstein who introduced the term [...] "peptic esophagitis" [...] and by Bernstein and Baker who reported the symptom of heartburn following instillation of hydrochloric acid in the distal esophagus. Formal measurement of acid in the esophagus was first described in 1960 by Tuttle. He used a glass <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> to map the gastroesophageal pH gradient, and demonstrated a sharp gradient in normal subjects and a gradual sloping gradient in patients with esophagitis. Four years later, Miller used an indwelling esophageal pH electrode to continuously measure esophageal and gastric pH for a period up to 12 hours. This technique required that the patient keep their hands immersed in saline {{to serve as a}} reference. Prolonged monitoring became feasible in 1974 when Johnson and DeMeester developed a dependable external reference electrode. Using this technique to monitor esophageal acid exposure patients for periods up to 24 hours, DeMeester and Johnson were able to identify the most important parameters of esophageal acid exposure and they developed a composite pH score to quantify gastroesophageal reflux. The initial 24-hour pH studies required hospitalization until the introduction of microcircuits in the 1980s that allowed portable esophageal pH monitoring in an outpatient setting.|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} newborns and infants with {{gastroesophageal}} reflux (GER) {{were retrospectively analyzed}} for the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic guidance offered by extended intraesophageal pH monitoring. There were 28 patients in group I whose major presenting sign was recurrent pneumonia due to GER, and 22 patients in group II, with apnea caused by GER. The <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> was 100 % accurate in identifying the presence of GER. Barium esophagram was accurate 46 % of the time. The <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> accurately identified the appropriate mode of therapy in all patients. In the medically treated GER/Pneumonia group, {{the mean number of}} episodes of GER per 24 hours was 24, whereas in the surgical group the mean number was 63. Similarly, in the medically treated GER/Apnea group, the mean number of reflux episodes per 24 hours was 26, whereas the surgical group experienced 64. Had the <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> been used to guide therapy, no patient would have been treated inappropriately. The number of patients in this report is not large.

40|$|The {{information}} content of ice core records {{and the strength}} of ice-atmosphere interactions depend on the morphology and composition of the fluid films threading polycrystalline ice. Flat ice surfaces separated by pure water always attract by dispersive forces. Thus, these films owe their existence to the presence of impurities and to curvature effects. Electrolyte impurities induce colligative effects, but also adsorb on charged ice surfaces and screen their resulting electrostatic repulsion. Film thickness � is not therefore a monotonically increasing function of electrolyte concentration as it may be surmised. This possibility is herein demonstrated via time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging of the freezing and thawing process of electrolyte solutions doped with a dual-emission <b>pH</b> <b>probe.</b> During freezing of water, the <b>pH</b> <b>probe</b> accumulates into 12 � 2 �m thick veins embedded in a pristine ice matrix.
