As the new influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus {{spread across the}} world, vaccines were being produced and licensed at an unprecedented scale and speed. In Europe, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted H 1 N 1 pdm 09 vaccines were licensed through fast track procedures with the first centrally registered vaccines authorized {{at the end of}} September 2009. Due to the nature of <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza,</b> uncertainties surrounding the benefit risk balance for <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> remained at the time of licensing. These uncertainties were addressed in the post-licensure phase through additional studies and alternative monitoring efforts. Whilst the monitoring of effectiveness and safety of vaccines is challenging under most circumstances it is particularly so when vaccination is rolled out within a developing pandemic at the scale seen in 2009 and 2010.

50|$|Currently, {{influenza}} vaccine for the annual, seasonal influenza program comes from four manufacturers. However, {{only a single}} manufacturer produces the annual vaccine entirely within the U.S. Thus, if a pandemic occurred and existing U.S.-based {{influenza vaccine}} manufacturing capacity was completely diverted to producing a pandemic vaccine, supply would be severely limited. Moreover, because the annual influenza manufacturing process takes place {{during most of the}} year, the time and capacity to produce vaccine against potential pandemic viruses for a stockpile, while continuing annual influenza vaccine production, is limited. Since supply will be limited, it is critical for HHS to be able to direct vaccine distribution in accordance with predefined groups (see Appendix D); HHS will ensure the building of capacity and will engage states in a discussion about the purchase and distribution of <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> is {{important}} {{in order to prevent}} dissemination of influenza, to decrease rates of complications and mortality due to influenza, to prevent mutation of virus in case epidemics last for a long time, to decrease the need for intensive care hospitalisation due to disease, to maintain health care services, to prevent school and work day loss and to decrease the economic burden. Our questionnaire was conducted in 3 different centers to evaluate view of health care staff for <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> prior to epidemics. Materials and Methods: Our questionnaire was conducted with health care workers with a possibility of direct exposure to patients including 182 doctors, 158 nurses and 54 management staff, making a total of 394 people. The location of the staff, position, period of office, whether she/he had seasonal influenza vaccine, whether he/she planned to have the <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> and the reason for this were questioned and noted. Results: Of the 394 healthcare staff included in our study, 221 were working in Hacettepe University Hospital, 102 in Ankara University Hospital and 71 in Ankara Hematology and Oncology Hospital. Of the people enrolled in our study, 259 were planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> while 135 were not. Of the staff planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine,</b> 77. 6 % were planning because they thought they were in the risk group, 22. 4 % were planning because there was pandemics. Of the staff not planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine,</b> 23 % were not having the vaccine because they did not want be guinea pigs, 30. 9 % were concerned with its side effects and 46 % had concerns because the vaccine was too new.

40|$|Vaccination is a {{cornerstone}} of influenza prevention, but limited vaccine uptake was a problem worldwide during the 2009 - 2010 pandemic. Community acceptance of a vaccine is a critical determinant of its effectiveness, but studies have been confined to high-income countries. We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-method study in urban and rural Pune, India in 2012 - 2013. Semi-structured explanatory model interviews were administered to community residents (n = 436) to study awareness, experience and preference between available <b>vaccines</b> for <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza.</b> Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews complemented the survey. Awareness of <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> was low (25 %). Some respondents did not consider vaccines relevant for adults, but nearly all (94. 7 %), when asked, believed that a vaccine would prevent swine flu. Reported vaccine uptake however was 8. 3 %. Main themes identified as reasons for uptake were having heard of a death from swine flu, health care provider recommendation or affiliation with the health system, influence of peers and information from media. Reasons for non-use were low perceived personal risk, problems with access and cost, inadequate information and a perceived lack of a government mandate endorsing <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> A majority indicated a preference for injectable over nasal vaccines, especially in remote rural areas. Hesitancy {{from a lack of}} confidence in <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> appears to have been less of an issue than access, complacency and other sociocultural considerations.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{method is}} presented to rank strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a platform for pre-pandemic and <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to achieve pairwise comparisons among SWOT factors in order to prioritize them. Key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> field were interviewed to collect a unique dataset to evaluate the market potential of this platform. The purpose of this study, to evaluate commercial potential of the MVA platform {{for the development of}} novel generation <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> is accomplished by using a SWOT and AHP combined analytic method. Application of the SWOT-AHP model indicates that its strengths are considered more important by KOLs than its weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Particularly, the inherent immunogenicity capability of MVA without the requirement of an adjuvant is the most important factor to increase commercial attractiveness of this platform. Concerns regarding vector vaccines and anti-vector immunity are considered its most important weakness, which might lower public health value of this platform. Furthermore, evaluation of {{the results of this study}} emphasizes equally important role that threats and opportunities of this platform play. This study further highlights unmet needs in the <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> market, which could be addressed by the implementation of the MVA platform. Broad use of MVA in clinical trials shows great promise for this vector as vaccine platform for pre-pandemic and <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> and threats by other respiratory viruses. Moreover, from the results of the clinical trials seem that MVA is particularly attractive for development of vaccines against pathogens for which no, or only insufficiently effective vaccines, are available...|$|R
