25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was {{tolerant of}} Christianity. Marcellinus writes of Christianity {{as being a}} <b>pure</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> religion that demands only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so {{on the basis of}} their Christianity as such. His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the Arian controversy) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{fractional}} Fourier transform and its applications is discussed. The fractional Fourier transforms has several {{applications in the}} area, analog optical information processing, or Fourier optics. Fourier optical systems can be analyzed using geometrical optics, Fresnel integrals (spherical wave expansions), and plane wave expansions. The class of Fourier optical systems (or first order optical systems) consist of arbitrary thin filters lies in between arbitrary quadratic-phase systems. Quadratic graded-index media have a natural and direct relationship with the fractional Fourier transform. Light is simply fractional Fourier transformed as it propagates through quadratic graded-index media. Quadratic graded-index media realize fractional Fourier transforms in their <b>purest</b> <b>and</b> <b>simplest</b> form. The fractional Fourier transform can describe all systems composed of an arbitrary number of lenses separated by arbitrary distances, whereas imaging and Fourier transforming systems are only special cases...|$|R

I am inclined to fancy, my mistress, who never said a harsh word to her children (and but twice or thrice only to one person), must have been too fond and pressing with the maternal authority; for her son and her daughter both revolted early; nor after their first flight from the nest could they ever be brought back quite to the fond mother's bosom. Lady Castlewood, and perhaps it was as well, knew little of her daughter's life and real thoughts. How was she to apprehend what passes in Queen's ante-chambers and at Court tables? Mrs. Beatrix asserted her own authority so resolutely that her mother quickly gave in. The maid of honor had her own equipage; went from home and came back at her own will: her mother was alike powerless to resist her or to lead her, or to command or to persuade her.|$|R
500|$|The Roughriders offered Speedie double his Browns salary as the Canadian leagues {{tried to}} make names for {{themselves}} by signing top-level NFL players. Paul Brown refused to match the offer, and Speedie, who was making $11,000 per year with the Browns, joined the Canadian team for the 1953 season. Brown then threatened to sue Speedie for violating his existing contract with the team, saying the Browns had exercised an option to extend the deal after it expired {{in the summer of}} 1953. [...] "This was a case of jumping a contract, <b>pure</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> as this young man morally and ethically had a contract with us", Brown said at the time.

He hoped that NHL participation would [...] "get exposure like the world has never seen for hockey". The typical NBA season is held {{in the winter and}} spring, so the Summer Olympics do not conflict with the regular season schedule. Bettman [...] "floated a concept of moving hockey to the Summer Games", but this was rejected because of the Olympic Charter. In March 1995, Bettman, René Fasel, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and NHLPA executive director Bob Goodenow met in Geneva, Switzerland. They reached an agreement that allowed NHL players to participate in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The deal was officially announced by the NHL on October 2, 1995. Bettman said: [...] "We're doing this to build the game of hockey, <b>pure</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> we think whatever benefits are recouped, it will end up making this game bigger, stronger and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a {{brief summary}} and review of the film and gave minor praise for the production. The {{reviewer}} wrote, [...] "The details of this comedy are well worked out, and {{it is good for}} a portion of genuine laughs. The girls of Miss Street's Seminary become so elated over their success in the gymnasium that they feel impelled to branch out, and accordingly they challenge the boys of Adair College to a game of ball. At the last moment the girls feel like backing out, when two of Cornell's star baseball players arrive in town. They agree to pitch and catch for the girls, who give them bloomers and rats from their hair for disguise. At the eighth inning the score was 0 to 0. By the ninth it was 0 to 2, in favor of Miss Street's Seminary for Girls. The nine girls then showed their gratitude by giving the pitcher and catcher a round of kisses, while the Adair College boys stood off at a respectful distance. The actors were equal to the occasion." [...] The Billboard affirmed by stating, [...] "Thanhouser producers have again placed a picture of originality on the market in Baseball and Bloomers. It is a farce <b>pure</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> but it offers many laughable situations. The acting is generally good, but in a few instances scenes were overacted." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} say that Mrs. Orme in these days ever regretted that her sympathy and {{friendship}} had been thus bestowed, but she frequently acknowledged to herself that the position was too difficult for her. There was no one whose assistance she could ask; for {{she felt that she}} could not in this matter ask counsel from Sir Peregrine. She herself was good, <b>and</b> <b>pure,</b> <b>and</b> straightminded, <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> in her perception of right and wrong; but Lady Mason was greater than she in force of character,--a stronger woman in every way, endowed with more force of will, with more power of mind, with greater energy, and a swifter flow of words. Sometimes she almost thought it would be better that she should stay away from Orley Farm; but then she had promised to be true to her wretched friend, and the mother's solicitude for her son still softened the mother's heart.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} e/ect of a {{combined}} <b>pure</b> homogeneous strain <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> shear in a principal {{plane of the}} latter on the propagation of surface waves for an incompressible isotropic elastic half-space whose boundary is normal to the glide planes of the shear. This generalizes previous work in which, separately, <b>pure</b> homogeneous strain <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> shear were considered. For a special class of materials, the secular equation is obtained in explicit form and then specialized to recover results obtained previously for the two cases mentioned above. A method for obtaining the secular equation for a general form of strain–energy function is then outlined. In general, this is very lengthy {{and the result is}} not listed, but, for the case {{in which there is no}} normal stress on the half-space boundary, the result is given, for illustration, in respect of the so-called generalized Varga material. Numerical results are given to show how the surface wave speed depends on both the underlying <b>pure</b> homogeneous strain <b>and</b> the superimposed <b>simple</b> shear. Further numerical results are provided for the Gent model of limiting chain extensibility...|$|R

500|$|The second Test {{was badly}} {{affected}} by weather and Hirst did not bat or bowl, {{and in the}} third Test in Sheffield, lost by England, he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets. Although he failed at Sheffield, Hirst was the leading all-rounder in England and thus unlikely {{to be left out}} of the team. However, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was engaged in a dispute with the team selectors over the composition of his side. He was given only 12 players to choose from for the fourth Test. Fred Tate was one of the twelve and the selectors probably included him as they believed MacLaren could not possibly choose him in the final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field the side they wanted. MacLaren responded by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of anger towards the selectors. The pitch was soft, which would have favoured the bowling of Tate, but Wisden reported that while this offered some justification for dropping Hirst, [...] "it meant playing a bowler <b>pure</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> in preference to a first-rate all-round man, and the result proved anything but happy." [...] Tate bowled just 16 overs in the game, dropped a vital catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the series; later writers claimed that Tate's performance was responsible for losing the match.|$|E

I am more at a loss to account for the sudden and fixed development of this type of archivolt than for any other architectural transition with which I am acquainted.
