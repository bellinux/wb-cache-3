The transmitter for KWQC-DT 56 had been operating at half of its assigned effective radiated power (ERP) since 12:45 PM on December 16, 2008, due {{to the need to}} convert one of the Power Amplifier Cabinets from channel 56 to channel 36. At 12:02 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the digital over-the-air signal on channel 56 was turned off and this lasted for about an hour or so in order to change the transmitter-to-antenna connections from the remaining DT 56 cabinet to the newly converted DT 36 cabinet. KWQC returned to the air an hour later on KWQC-DT 36, and continued to operate at half-power on channel 36 for about a week or so while the other cabinet was converted from channel 56 to channel 36. KWQC estimated that the other <b>power</b> <b>cabinet</b> would be fully converted and that its new digital signal on channel 36 would be operating at its fully licensed ERP of 1 million watts around June 19, 2009, one week after the DTV transition was complete.

50|$|The 803 is a transistorised, bit-serial machine; the 803B {{has more}} {{parallel}} paths internally. It uses ferrite core memory in 4096 or 8192 words of 40 bits, comprising 39 bits of data with parity. The CPU {{is housed in}} a single cabinet about 66 inches long, 16 inches deep and 56 inches high. Circuitry is based on printed circuit boards with the printed circuits being rather simple {{and most of the}} signalling carried on wires. There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large nickel-cadmium battery with charger, an early form of uninterruptible power supply. A third cabinet (the same size as the <b>power</b> <b>cabinet)</b> holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores. There is an operator's control console, Creed teleprinter and high-speed paper tape reader and punch for input/output, using 5-track Elliott telecode code, not Baudot. Tape is read at 500 characters per second and punched at 100 cps.The operator's console, about 60 inches long, allows low-level instructions to be entered manually to manipulate addresses and data and can start, stop and step the machine: there is a loudspeaker (pulsed by the top bit of the instruction register) which allows the operator to judge the status of a computation. The system requires air conditioning, drawing about 3.5 kW of power in a minimal configuration.|$|E

30|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the thermal design is not the prediction of component temperatures, but rather the reduction of risk, which is thermally associated to the product [1]. This risk, inherent to today megawatt level wind power converters, especially the <b>power</b> <b>cabinet</b> involving {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) modules, is manifested in compromised designs that cannot satisfy projected schedules due to unforeseen thermal and/or reliability issues. Therefore, thermal engineers should use temperature and airflow predictions to uncover the potential risk areas and develop feasible solutions as early as possible in the product design process. Many methods are helpful during this process, including heat transfer correlations, flow network modeling (FNM), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and experimental measurement techniques.|$|E

40|$|Political science is, we {{are led to}} believe, {{the study}} of <b>power.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> and the {{executive}} {{appear to be the}} epitome of national authority, but not of analysis. In Australia by contrast it seems that the study of power has not focussed on federal power, or at least power at the centre of national government. If the remit is to explore that centre - the prime minister, cabinet, ministers, the senior officials and the departments that coordinate the activities of government - then over the last few decades, the cupboard is somewhat bare. It is not that nothing has been written; rather it is that little has been done by the academic community and especially by political science profession in an area that at first sight should have been of direct interest to them. My concern here is not whether the history of the period has been told, but whether there has been an analysis of the forms, institutions and conventions through and by which political power is exercised at the centre of government. That may be a narrow definition, but related topics such as: departments, federalism and public management are being covered by others in this assessment of current research. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to analyze the degree of political dominance exer-cised by the executive <b>power</b> on <b>cabinets</b> in presidential systems. According to the 1990 s debate, in contrast to parliamentary systems where a joint decision-making process is prevalent, presidential systems are characterized by a non-collegial decision-making process, led and personalized in the figure of the president (Lijphart 1992; Sartori 1997; Amorim Neto 2006). The key argument of this paper is that, although all presidents have the constitutional <b>power</b> to remove <b>cabinet</b> ministers, the executive decision-making process in presidential systems is not necessarily vertical or based on a non-collegial process. We found a significant variation on executive power exerted by presidents over the cabinets, and that this variation has not been addressed by current literature. To classify the degree of political dominance of the presidents over the cabi-nets, we analyzed 18 Latin American constitutions focusing on the rules of the cabinet’s decision-making process...|$|R
