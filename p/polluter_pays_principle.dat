Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made. [...] Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the <b>polluter</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principle,</b> which makes the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment, is accepted.

[...] EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it.

40|$|In {{search for}} equity at the Rio summit, it was {{suggested}} that in case of pollution or any other environmentally negative effect, the costs are inflicted on the responsible agents to pay for the rectification. The <b>Polluter</b> <b>Pay</b> <b>Principle</b> (PPP) has since then been touted as a useful environmental management tool that makes provisions for innovative penalties seeking to place the burden of environmental pollution control on those that abuse the environment. Despite such euphoria, the results on the ground have been appalling. In this analysis we question the practical utility of the PPP viz avis the deteriorating environmental fabric of many nations. The analysis reveals that it is cheaper for many individuals, organizations or even countries to pollute the environment and pay a fine than to install systems that require the constant monitoring of the environment. Emphasis of the PPP is misplaced as it focuses on curing damages and not on the process that brings the environmental problems to a halt. Its implementation is further constrained by the difficulty associated with placing a price tag on environment parameters. We recommend a proactive alternative to PPP that emphasize on preventative measures through environmental education. The success of such a management strategy is however not spontaneous as it needs to be rooted upon an effective system of values, institutions, attitudes, personal commitment, self confidence and active participation of all individuals in managing and detecting environmental problems that affect them. <b>Polluter</b> <b>Pay</b> <b>Principle,</b> pollution cost, environment and development, sustainable development...|$|R

We exemplary investigate tradable permits as reduction measures in a national OverLapping Generations (OLG) -model, where we change the discounting technique by using generation adjusted discounting (GAD) in comparison to conventional OLG-models. We show that within our model-framework Germany is able to develop along growing paths of e. g. GDP in sharp contrast to conventional results of OLG-simulations. At the same time, nowadays living generations have to share higher burdens in terms of lower GDP, per capita consumption and employment which can be interpreted, firstly, as contemporary costs for reaching sustainable paths and, secondly, contributions for internalising intertemporal external effects. However, all costs in terms of lower macro-variables for current living generations are overcompensated by higher future values of them. This effect can be interpreted as intertemporal application of full cost-bearance, or, in other words, the <b>polluter</b> <b>pay</b> <b>principle</b> which is oriented on the sustainability of GHG abatement...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} of petroleum resources requires appropriate management of all waste streams generated {{over the entire}} life cycle of this development beginning with initial planning of projects and operations right through to decommissioning and site restoration. Hence a quality waste management approach became crucial to achieve this goal. The principle aim of waste management {{is to ensure that}} waste does not contaminate the environment at such a rate or in such a form or quantity as to overload natural assimilative processes and cause pollution. Eliminating or minimising waste generation is crucial, not only to reduce environmental liabilities but also operational cost. Many disposal practices of the past are being questioned now. The cost of cleaning up many past hazardous waste sites will be high and a substantial part of these clean-up costs will be charged to industry under the <b>polluter</b> <b>pay</b> <b>principle.</b> As inadequate waste handling eventually leads to environmental damage and financial liabilities, systematic waste management through integrated environmental economics became a preferred approach in the up stream phase of the petroleum industry. This paper discusses basic concepts for managing waste generated during upstream operations and provides systematic approach for pro-active waste management practices. It provides a framework {{that can be used to}} develop classification systems in line with local requirements, while maintaining consistency with industry standards. It addresses the various stages in waste management, and emphasizes the phases of identification, characterization, inventorisation, segregation, minimization, treatment and disposal as integral parts of the waste management process. It emphasises the importance of proper classification of waste streams, focusing on pragmatic assessment of environmental hazards at all stages in the waste life cycle. Some practical aspects of classifying waste in the context of exploration and production operations in the petroleum industry are also give...|$|R

The vision he presents i one of a vibrant, innovation, market-driven industry operating within a regulatory framework that gives the maximum flexibility for creative solutions. The greatest challenges faced by the world energy sector are concerned with environmental sustainability. Because the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide spread rapidly around the globe, sustainability has to be considered on a global basis and global solutions are rquired.

40|$|Seeking just {{procedures}} {{to respond to}} and to handle climate change is the main goal of this thesis. Climate justice {{is a concept that}} relates to people’s behavior towards climate; it relates to people’s uses of carbon resources. Philosophers and researchers propose different principles to share the burden of carbon emissions and adapt with climate change. I critically respond to Singer’s views on climate justice. I use conceptual method that engages in interpreting different principles related to climate justice. Singer, in his work One World, offers two principles for sharing the burdens and benefits of climate change. One is the <b>Polluter</b> <b>Pay</b> <b>Principle</b> (PPP) and another is the Equal Share Per Capita Principle (ESPCP). I explain both principles and look at some difficulties for these principles in practical uses. I think Capacity to <b>Pay</b> <b>Principle</b> (CPP) is fairer than Singers’ principles. I suggest that as we {{know that there is a}} positive correlation between carbon emissions and development so that CPP would be more appropriate than PPP or ESPCP in distribution of burden and benefit to establish equality across the nations. The logic behind the claim that CPP is a fair principle for climate justice is that the past and present emissions of the developed world have greatly benefited the developed nations. As a matter of fairness, they should shoulder the burden of climate change. Finally, I discuss pluralistic approach for climate justice, where distributive procedure and procedural procedure take place. Distributive justice focuses on an even distribution of the burdens and benefits of climate change, and procedural justice focuses on resolving disagreements to take climate policy. Procedural justice take part in taking rational and just decisions by resolving disagreements among the nations and considering all parties’ concerns. Such decisions generate distributive process. So climate justice consists of both distributive and procedural justice. The study makes the policy makers aware and suggests the legislative bodies to respond to climate change on the basis of our moral thinking and the procedural procedure justifies decisions or policies that take part to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In climate justice we should emphasis on both even distribution of burden and benefit of climate change and just decision to generate distribution...|$|R
