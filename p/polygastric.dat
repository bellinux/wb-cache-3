40|$|Seasonal {{abundance}} of siphonophores in Korsfjord and Fanafjord was studied by net sampling. Nanomia cara, Lensia conoidea and Dimophyes arctica were dominant species present throughout the year. Abundance of N. cara colonies peaked in late May and early June. Low numbers of rela-tively large colonies and {{high numbers of}} siphonulae were observed during winter. Dimophyes arctica and L. conoidea had a generation shift in March, when large over-wintering and small young <b>polygastric</b> colonies co-existed briefly before the former disappeared. Abundances were lowest during winter, and eudoxids were consistently more numerous than <b>polygastric</b> colonies for both species. Maximum abundances of <b>polygastric</b> D. arctica and L. conoidea occurred in early May and late June, respectively. Lensia conoidea may {{have more than one}} annual generation in Korsfjord. Vertical distributions of siphonophores were studied with an remotely operated vehicle in nine fjords. The distributions of agalmatid physonects, probably mostly N. cara, differed signifi-cantly between the fjords, with the weighted mean depths of the distributions ranging from 99 to 412 m. Results from Sognefjord suggested diel vertical migration. The bulk of the adult colonies in each fjord occurred below sill depth.

40|$|Diphyid siphonophores {{are small}} rocket-shaped cnidarians (Fig. · 1). The <b>polygastric</b> {{stage of the}} animals {{consists}} {{of one or two}} nectophores, which trail a long fishing stem with batteries of nematocysts. There are numerous species, but physiological work has mainly been done upon the relatively abundant Chelophyes appendiculata. Like all diphyids, Chelophyes swims rapidly by propulsive jets; if undisturbed in large aquaria, it shows occasional apparently spontaneous short bursts of jet pulses at frequencies up to ~ 8 ·Hz (Mackie and Carré, 1983). Vibration or light touch evoke similar series of jet pulses, during which Chelophyes withdraws the fishing stem and attains maximum instantaneous speeds of 20 ·body lengths per second (20 ·BL·s– 1; Bone and Trueman, 1982).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of soybean processed by a new technical version of the toaster aimed {{to be used for}} small amounts. The research was conducted on a thin and a thick layer of soybean, and the results indicate that only a thin layer can be toasted satisfactorily due to large differences in urease activity ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 26 mgN/g/min and trypsin inhibitor activity (2. 53 to 4. 04 mg/g) in thick layers. Further more, it was determined that after toasting a thin layer of soybean at the temperatures of 125 oC, 130 oC and 135 oC for 10 - and 15 -minute periods, the most favorable treatment for monogastric animals was 125 oC/ 15 min (2. 12 mgTI/g trypsin inhibitor activity), and for <b>polygastric</b> (ruminant) animals 130 oC/ 10 min (0. 00 mgN/g/min urease) ...|$|E

In order to properly monitor the technological process of soybean thermal processing, it was necessary to study crude protein content, urease activity, trypsin inhibitor activity and amino acid composition of soybean in natural and toasted samples. Results demonstrate that protein content in soybean toasted in thick and thin layer was found to be slightly increased while urease activity was reduced in relation to non-treated sample.

40|$|Techniques {{and methods}} {{required}} for accurate and reproducible measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), were studied in seven-week and five-month-old calves. Since reliable pleural pressure measurement in cattle {{has already been}} described, separate experiments were conducted to compare retrodiaphragmatic pressures measured (i) with balloon-catheters and needle catheters, (ii) before and after eructation and (iii) in the ruminal and in the peritoneal cavities. Whereas respiratory-induced pressure changes were equally transmitted throughout the rumen content, a marked anteroposterior damping was observed as the recording site in the abdominal cavity was {{moved away from the}} diaphragm (P < 0. 0001). It was concluded that the most appropriate and accurate way to measure Pdi changes in <b>polygastric</b> animals is to measure the pressure changes existing in the mid-thoracic portion of the oesophagus and in the liquid content of the rumen with balloon-tubing units. Neither growth- and diet-related rumen enlargement nor eructation, which are two typical characteristics of ruminants, altered the reliability of retrodiaphragmatic pressure measurements in the two age groups studied.

40|$|We {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the manure on the soil weed infestation in our stationary field experiment on University experimental station in Abcice. It was determined on plots with monoculture of spring barley and on plots with chosen crop rotations with different corn distribution. All variants were conventional tilled. With farmyard manure fertilisation, the potential weed infestation of the topsoil with weed seeds was found to increase statistically significantly; this level differing in the different crop rotations. Ploughdown of the manure did not influence the proportion of weed seeds in the respective topsoil layers. On the manured areas the proportion of healthy (viable) seeds was higher than of seeds which appeared to be whole seeds. Acute weed infestation of stands of red clover, spring barley and winter wheat in 1995, i. e. after 25 years of the experiment, was in relation with the results of potential weed infestation. Compared with fields not fertilised with farmyard manure this growth was by 61 - 100 % higher. With increasing amounts of slurry the level of weed infestation decreased. We {{observed the}} impact of gradually doses of cattle sewage on soil weed infestation in field experiment in potato production area. The application of slurry and the amounts applied were found to have a decisive effect on changes in the potential weed infestation of the topsoil. The NPK levels in industrial fertilisers did not affect the statistical significance of the changes in weed infestation below values for fertilisation with individual doses of slurry. In 1997 and 1998 the effect was investigated of some processes occurring in the digestive system of <b>polygastric</b> animals and the effect of the maturing of farmyard manure on the viability of weeds. Under laboratory conditions the weed seeds were exposed to a solution which simulated the properties of rumen fluids and the pepsin enzyme. The seeds were left in the manure for 3 and 6 months. After 6 months the proportion of viable seeds in the manure decreased to the minimum (0 - 10 %). In the course of maturing the intensity of losses of the viability of the seeds in farmyard manure increased (in the 1 st - 3 rd month less seeds lost their viability than in the 4 th - 6 th months). The proportion of viable seeds among seeds kept under laboratory conditions (in vitro) in the rumen fluid and pepsin solution decreased significantly. The effect of the pepsin solution was stronger.

40|$|Siphonophores {{collected}} in Chilean Patagonian fjords, between the Gulf of Penas and the Trinidad Channel in 2008 were analysed. A total of 12 species were recorded, of which Muggiaea bargmannae, Lensia subtilis, Praya dubia and Sphaeronectes fragilis were identified {{for the first}} time in this sector of the Patagonian fjords. M. bargmannae represents a new record for the southeastern Pacific. The most abundant species were Muggiaea atlantica (78. 6 %), Lensia conoidea (8. 7 %) and Dimophyes arctica (8. 5 %). M. atlantica, the dominant species, showed high densities in both oceanic and interior waters. L. conoidea and D. arctica, on the other hand, were principally {{collected in}} interior waters. M. atlantica was collected in less saline (< 30), more oxygenated (6 - 7 mL L– 1) shallow strata (0 - 50 m), while L. conoidea and D. arctica were collected below 50 m depth in more saline (30 - 33) and less oxygenated (4 - 6 mL L– 1) waters. The eudoxids of these species followed the same horizontal and vertical distribution patterns as their <b>polygastric</b> stages. These results confirm the success of M. atlantica in the colonization of all the southern fjords and document an increase with respect to the results obtained for the same geographical area in the spring of 1996. They also allowed us to infer that salinity and dissolved oxygen vertical gradients play an important role in determining the depth distribution patterns of these species...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and AimsDietary Tran’s {{fatty acids}} (TFA) comes {{mostly from the}} {{industrial}} hydrogenation of unsaturated vegetable oils. TFA also are formed during the natural bacterial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids that occurs in the rumen of <b>polygastric</b> ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The epidemiologic evidences suggest that the intake of Tran’s fatty acid {{may be associated with}} increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as atherosclerosis or chronic heart disease (CHD). The purpose of the current study is better understanding of effects of TFA on cardiovascular disease. So, the available evidences from studies were reviewed. Materials and MethodsA complete search was performed about the association of TFA intake with risk of CVD in databases electronic such as ISI Web of science and PubMed and also in SID from 1993 to 2014. ResultsThe results of most studies have indicated a significant direct association between the TFA intake and risk of CVD. Also, increasing of TFA intake was related with increased risk of diabetes, systemic inflammation, decreased membrane fluidity, increased serum lipid levels and inflammatory markers. ConclusionThe most evidence for association between the intake of TFA and cardiovascular diseases were related to TFA from hydrogenated vegetable oils and information about the effects of TFA from ruminant was inconsistent. It is necessary performing studies about the effects of rTFA (ruminant trans fatty acid) on risk of CVD and banning the use of these fatty acids in the food industry. * Corresponding Author: Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, School of Nutrition and Food Science.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica is expanding its geographical distribution. The mechanisms behind this expansion remain unclear due to our limited knowledge of the species’ ecology. We modelled the functional relationship between the 2 main life-cycle stages of M. atlantica over a 5 yr period (2009 ? 2013) in the Western English Channel. Our aims were to determine the key features of the species’ population dynamics {{and the influence of}} local environmental conditions on its population development. Our results highlighted a strong coupling between the timing of specific environmental conditions and the development of the M. atlantica population, thereby explaining interannual differences in the phenology of its blooms. Population development commenced with the initiation of eudoxid production by the overwintering <b>polygastric</b> stages. This reproductive event was linked to the onset of a spring temperature threshold, suggesting a critical basal limit of 10 °C for eudoxid production. Interannual variability in the timing of this threshold modulated the degree of mismatch between the developing M. atlantica population and the availability of copepod prey. Unusually cold conditions in the spring of 2010 and 2013 limited the capacity for M. atlantica to initiate eudoxid production leading to poor trophic phasing and the production of single autumn cohorts. In contrast, warmer conditions during spring 2009, 2011, and 2012 facilitated earlier population development, optimal trophic phasing and the production of both summer and autumn cohorts. These findings represent an important addition {{to our understanding of the}} ecology of M. atlantica in the Northeast Atlanti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mucins {{are large}} glycoproteins implicated in {{protection}} of all mucosal surfaces. In humans and rodents, the mucin gene {{family has been}} well described and previous studies have investigated the distribution and function of mucins in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In contrast, little data {{is available on the}} mucin gene family in <b>polygastric</b> species, such as cattle. The aim of the current study was to identify all members of the bovine mucin family by genome mining and subsequently investigate the transcription pattern of these mucins in the GI tract. Results Nine bovine membrane-associated mucins (MUC 1, MUC 3 A, MUC 4, MUC 12, MUC 13, MUC 15, MUC 16, MUC 20 and MUC 21) and six secreted mucins (MUC 2, MUC 5 AC, MUC 5 B, MUC 6, MUC 7 and MUC 19) were identified in the bovine genome. No homologues could be identified for MUC 3 B, MUC 8 and MUC 17. In general, domain architecture of the membrane-associated mucins was found to be similar between humans and cattle, while the protein architecture of the gel-forming mucins appeared to be less conserved. Further analysis of the genomic organization indicated that the previously reported bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) may be part of a larger gene encoding for MUC 19. Analysis of the transcription profile showed that the secreted mucins were transcribed from the abomasum onwards, whereas the membrane associated mucins MUC 1 and MUC 20 were transcribed throughout the whole GI tract. In contrast to humans, MUC 5 B transcript was found in both the small and large intestine, but was absent in oesophageal tissue. Conclusions This study provides the first characterization of the mucin gene family in cattle and their transcriptional regulation in the GI tract. The data presented in this paper will allow further studies of these proteins in the physiology of the GI tract in ruminants and their interactions with pathogens. </p...|$|E
40|$|From the Institute of Physiology, Toulouse, France SUMMARY Propionate {{disappearance}} {{from the}} loops of the hindgut in the rabbit was evaluated by measuring {{variations in the}} concentration of propionate in caecocolonic loops and differences in the arterial and venous plasma. In vivo metabolism in gut and liver tissues was studied after introduction of (1 -'C) propionate into the caecocolonic loops. The rate of disappearance from the loops was always quantitatively significant but was greater in the proximal colon. Hindgut tissue metabolised propionate {{and the intensity of}} the metabolism varied with the segment studied; the proximal colon showed by far the highest propionate consumption. Radioactivity was found in a certain number of free amino acids, organic acids, sugars, lipid soluble substances and proteins. Propionate is an efficient respiratory fuel for the colonocyte and a good precursor for gluconeogenesis. It is well known that volatile fatty acids (VFA) - for example, acetate, propionate and butyrate- are the major end products of microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of <b>polygastric</b> and monogastric animals. ' 2 In the rabbit a large proportion of its energy requirement (30 - 40 %) is derived from the catabolism of the bacterial metabolites formed in the hindgut;j 5 nearly half of the energy supplied is because of the butyrate. ' The large intestine tissues metabolise the VFA, the intensity of this metabolism varying with the location in the gut and the excretion pattern. 59 - ' It has been shown that butyrate ' is a good respiratory fuel for the colonocyte, and that acetate 7 is mainly converted into aspartate and glutamate; these can be considered as 'stock forms ' which can be diverted either towards oxidative metabolism or towards protein synthesis. For monogastric animals, much less information is available about the meta-bolism of propionate by caecal"; " and colonic mucosa. Thus the aim of the present investigation is {{to determine the extent to}} which propionate is metabolised during its absorption from the large intestine of the rabbit...|$|E
40|$|Cinco bovinos imunizados contra a ação tóxica das sementes de Abrus precatorius L. ("tento", "jiquiriti") não adoeceram ou somente levemente pela administração das sementes de Ricinus communis L. ("mamona"), em doses que em bovinos que antes nunca ingeriram sementes de A. precatorius ou R. communis, causaram intoxicação de intensidade de grau moderado a acentuado ou até a morte. Um sexto bovino, que não ficou bem imunizado contra a ação tóxica das sementes de A. precatorius, adoeceu em grau acentuado pela administração de dose elevada das sementes de R. communis. Já dos cinco bovinos imunizados contra a ação tóxica das sementes de R. communis quatro adoeceram em grau acentuado, oquinto em grau moderado, pela administração das sementes de A. precatorias em doses que em bovinos que antes nunca ingeriram sementes de R. communis ou A. precatorius causaram intoxicação de intensidade leve a acentuada. Estes resultados permitem concluir que bovinos imunizados contra a ação tóxica das sementes de A. precatorius são resistentes à ação tóxica das sementes de R. communis, mas que o contrário não ocorre, isto é, bovinos imunizados contra a ação tóxica das sementes de R. communis, não se mostraram protegidos contra a intoxicação por A. precatorius. Estudos anteriores por outros autores mostraram que as toxalbuminas de A. precatorius e R. communis, respectivamente abrina e ricina, são diferentes do ponto de vista antigênico. Uma explicação para a divergência desses resultados com os nossos poderia estar no fato de que no presente estudo foram usados poligástricos que receberam as sementes por via oral, enquanto que nos estudos anteriores foram usados monogástricos em que as sementes ou as toxinas foram aplicadas por via parenteral. A administração de folhas frescas ou do pericarpo do fruto de R. communis a bovinos imunizados contra a ação das sementes desta planta tiveram o mesmo efeito tóxico que em animais não imunizados, demonstrando que a imunidade conferida pela ricina não inibe a ação da ricinina, o {{principio}} tóxico das folhas e do pericarpo. Five bovines immunized {{against the}} toxicity {{of the seeds}} of Abrus precatorius L. (jequiriti bean) did not get poisoned or only slightly so when the seeds of Ricinus communis L.

A sixth bovine, which was not well immunized against the toxic action of the seeds of A. precatorius, was severely poisoned when given a high dose of the seeds of R. communis. On the other side, from five bovines immunized against the toxic action of the seeds of R. communis four were severely poisoned and the fifth one moderately when the seeds of A. precatorius were given in doses that in bovines, which never before ingested seeds of R. communis or A. precatorius, caused slight to severe poisoning. It is concluded that bovines immunized against the toxic action of the seeds of A. precatorius are resistant to the toxic action of the seeds of R. communis, but that the contrary is not the case; this is, bovines immunized against the toxic action of the seeds of R. communis were not protected against the poisoning by A. precatorius. Earlier studies by other authors had shown that the toxalbumins of the seeds of A. precatorius and R. communis, respectively abrin and ricin, are different as to their antigenic properties. A {{possible explanation for the}} difference in results can be. that in the present study <b>polygastric</b> animals were used which received the seeds orally, but in the earlier studies monogastric animals received the seeds or toxins by parenteral route.
