5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa <b>Police</b> <b>arrested</b> four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11.

5|$|In March 2008 {{a series}} of police raids in gay bathhouses and at gay meeting spots in Beijing have {{resulted}} in arrests and bathhouse closures. This included raids on two branches of the Oasis bathhouses, known {{to be the most}} popular in Beijing. In 2000, <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> 37 men in a Guangzhou gay spa on charges of prostitution. Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, SAO Krajina <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> four Serbian {{civilians in}} Široka Kula, Mane Rakić {{and his three}} {{children}} for allegedly collaborating with Croatian authorities. During the night of 20/21 October, the police searched Rakić's home, and then killed his wife in another house in Široka Kula. Her body was doused with kerosene and torched. By {{the end of the}} month, Rakić and his children were also murdered and their remains thrown into the Golubnjača Pit.|$|E
40|$|While most {{police chiefs}} {{might be willing}} to make such a claim that there is a {{positive}} relationship between COPS grants and <b>police</b> <b>arrests,</b> empirical research on this topic is very limited. Following from an earlier study by Zhao, Scheider, and Thurman (2003), this research makes several contributions to the current literature. First, it includes additional years of data from police agencies receiving federal funding {{to examine the effects of}} additional resources on arrests. Second, making use of the two waves of census data (1990 and 2000) allowed time-varying analysis of the relationship between <b>police</b> <b>arrests</b> and demographics. Finally, a hierarchical statistical method for longitudinal analysis (HMLM) was used in the analysis of <b>police</b> <b>arrest</b> data from 5, 871 cities during 1993 and 2000 when the involvement of federal government for promoting community policing or quality of life policing was unprecedented. Our primary findings suggest a positive relationship between COPS hiring grants and all four types of <b>police</b> <b>arrests</b> during the period of study though COPS funding usually accounted for only a small percentage of the total budget in a police department (GAO, 2005). More specifically, the hiring grant, the largest part of the COPS funding project, had consistently significant impact on <b>police</b> <b>arrests</b> after controlling for the socioeconomic variables and crimes. In addition, the hiring grant was significant predictor of all four categories of arrests, indicating that additional manpower did have a direct casual relationship with number of <b>police</b> <b>arrests...</b>|$|R

5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|With {{government}} abatement and Quisling's personal engagement, Jews {{were registered}} in a German initiative of January 1942. On 26 October, German forces, {{with help from}} the Norwegian <b>police,</b> <b>arrested</b> 300 registered male Jews in Norway and sent them to concentration camps, most in Berg and manned by Hirden, the paramilitary wing of Nasjonal Samling. Over-65s were quickly released by the Norwegian government. Most controversially, the Jews's property was confiscated by the state.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not clear}} how the fight started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans {{throwing}} beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. <b>Police</b> <b>arrested</b> Ali Umit Demir and three other men for the stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder {{and was sentenced to}} 15 years imprisonment. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E

Another such example was Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E

5|$|The Houston riot of 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers {{took to the streets}} of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty {{to prevent a}} repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; <b>police</b> <b>arrested</b> 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.|$|E
