An image <b>processing</b> <b>fee</b> of 47 cents is levied on vehicles without an e-tag from 15 September 2010. The tolls are expected to increase on 1 January each year according with Brisbane CPI. These toll rates are as expensive as the Sydney Cross City Tunnel which is Australia's most expensive toll road.|$|E

25|$|In November 2016 the European Commission {{proposed}} {{a system for}} an electronic authorisation of visa-exempt third country nationals called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System). Under the proposal the ETIAS will be managed by the European Border and Coast Guard in cooperation with national authorities. Foreign visitors {{will be required to}} submit personal data in advance and pay a <b>processing</b> <b>fee</b> (fee is waived for children). Submitted applications will be processed automatically by checking against databases and watch lists and in case no issues appear the authorisation should be issued immediately. The authorisation request may be processed for up 72 hours in which case the applicant must be notified if the authorisation request was issued or refused or if additional information is required. In case the authorisation is refused the applicant will have the right of appeal in accordance with national law of the member state. The authorisation will be valid for five years. A travel authorisation with limited territorial validity may be issued only exceptionally. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. It is expected to enter into operation on 1 January 2020. The cost for developing ETIAS is estimated at EUR 212,1 million.|$|E

500|$|The Government of Canada {{requires}} that the above processes be financed by the petitioner; that is the person requesting the grant or registration of arms, who pays the fees associated with the request and grant/registration.

In Canada, the petitioner does not [...] "buy" [...] a coat of arms, the arms themselves are freely given to qualified individuals, but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists for the services rendered. The average time needed to complete a grant is about 12 to 14 months, though it can take longer for particularly detailed or intricate arms.|$|E

Relying on the above case, the High Court held {{that it could not}} grant a mandamus in such terms. Instead, it quashed the Commissioner's decision and issued a mandamus directing him to [...] "consider and determine the application of the applicants according to law". Similarly, in Borissik v.
