40|$|Schistosomiasis is a helminthic {{disease that}} affects more than 200 million people. An {{effective}} vaccine {{would be a}} major step towards eliminating the disease. Studies suggest that T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide help to B cells to generate the long-term humoral immunity, which would be a crucial component of successful vaccines. Thus, understanding the biological characteristics of Tfh cells in patients with schistosomiasis, which has never been explored, is essential for vaccine design. In this study, we investigated the biological characteristics of <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> Tfh cells in schistosomiasis patients by flow cytometry. Our data showed that the frequencies of total and activated <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> Tfh cells in patients were significantly increased during Schistosoma japonicum infection. Moreover, Tfh 2 cells, which were reported to be a specific subpopulation to facilitate the generation of protective antibodies, were increased more greatly than other subpopulations of total <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> Tfh cells in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. More importantly, our result showed significant correlations of the percentage of Tfh 2 cells with both the frequency of plasma cells and the level of IgG antibody. In addition, our results showed that the percentage of T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells was also increased in patients with schistosomiasis. Our report is the first characterization of <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> Tfh cells in schistosomasis patients, which not only provides potential targets to improve immune response to vaccination, but also is important for the development of vaccination strategies to control schistosomiasis...|$|E

The area-optimized version of MicroBlaze, which uses a 3-stage pipeline, sacrifices clock frequency for reduced logic area. The performance-optimized version expands the execution pipeline to 5 stages, allowing top speeds of 210 MHz (on Virtex-5 FPGA family). Also, key processor instructions which are rarely used but more expensive to implement in hardware can be selectively added/removed (i.e. multiply, divide, and floating point operations).

40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} or peptides {{are capable}} of inducing specific immunity; however, their translation to the clinic has generally been problematic, primarily due to the reduced magnitude of immune response and poor pharmacokinetics. Herein, we demonstrate that a novel immunization strategy, encompassing sequential exposure of the lymph node milieu to plasmid and peptide in a heterologous prime-boost fashion, results in considerable MHC class I-restricted immunity in mice. Plasmid-primed antigen expression was essential for the generation of a population of central memory T cells, expressing CD 62 L and low in PD- 1, with substantial capability to expand and differentiate to <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> and effector cells, following subsequent exposure to peptide. These vaccine-induced T cells dominated the T cell repertoire, were able to produce large amounts of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recognized tumor cells effectively. In addition to outlining a feasible and effective method to transform plasmid DNA vaccination into a potentially viable immunotherapeutic approach for cancer, this study sheds light on the mechanism of heterologous prime-boost and the considerable heterogeneity of MHC class I-restricted T cell responses...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that during acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the peripheral blood fills up with latently infected, resting memory B cells {{to the point}} where up to 50 % of all the memory cells may carry EBV. Despite this massive invasion of the memory compartment, the virus remains tightly restricted to memory cells, such that, in one donor, fewer than 1 in 10 (4) infected cells were found in the naive compartment. We conclude that, even during acute infection, EBV persistence is tightly regulated. This result confirms the prediction that during the early phase of infection, before cellular immunity is effective, there is nothing to prevent amplification of the viral cycle of infection, differentiation, and reactivation, causing the <b>peripheral</b> <b>memory</b> compartment to fill up with latently infected cells. Subsequently, there is a rapid decline in infected cells for the first few weeks that approximates the decay in the cytotoxic-T-cell responses to viral replicative antigens. This phase is followed by a slower decline that, even by 1 year, had not reached a steady state. Therefore, EBV may approach but never reach a stable equilibrium...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize chemokine receptor expression in <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>memory</b> T cells in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to correlate the expression with disease activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 24 patients with CD, 30 patients with UC, 24 normal controls and 10 disease controls. PBMCs were stained by anti-CCR 3, CCR 4, CCR 5, CXCR 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO and β 7 integrin, and the expression of the chemokine receptors were determined by flow cytometry. CCR 4 expression on memory T cells was significantly lower in UC than in CD or normal controls, and that of memory CD 4 + T and β 7 high memory CD 4 + T cells was significantly higher in CD than in UC or normal controls. CCR 4 expression on memory CD 4 + T cells exhibited significant positive correlation with disease activity in CD, and this decreased significantly after treatment. Such a decrease was not found in the disease controls. CCR 5 and CXCR 3 expression on memory CD 8 + T cells was significantly lower in CD than in normal controls. CXCR 3 expression on β 7 high memory CD 4 + T and CXCR 3 expression on memory CD 8 + T cells were lower in UC than in normal controls.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Disturbances in <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>memory</b> B cell subpopulations {{have been}} {{observed}} in various autoimmune diseases, but have not been fully delineated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, the possible role of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in regulating changes in specific <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>memory</b> B cell subsets in RA is still unclear. METHODS: The frequency and distribution of B cell subsets in the peripheral blood and synovial membrane of active RA patients with long-standing disease have been analysed. Additionally, the possible role of TNF in causing disturbances in memory B cell subsets in RA patients was assessed in a clinical trial with the specific TNF-neutralising antibody, infliximab. RESULTS: RA patients, independent of disease duration, have a significantly lower frequency of peripheral blood pre-switch IgD+CD 27 + memory B cells than healthy individuals, whereas post-switch IgD-CD 27 + accumulate with increased disease duration. Notably, both pre-switch IgD+CD 27 + and post-switch IgD-CD 27 + memory B cells accumulate in the synovial membrane of RA patients. Finally, anti-TNF therapy increased the frequency of pre-switch IgD+CD 27 memory B cells in the peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that decreases in peripheral blood IgD+CD 27 + pre-switch memory B cells in RA reflect their accumulation in the synovial tissue. Moreover, the {{significant increase in the}} <b>peripheral</b> blood pre-switch <b>memory</b> B cells in patients who underwent specific TNF-blockade with infliximab indicates that trafficking of memory B cells into inflamed tissue in RA patients is regulated by TNF and can be corrected by neutralising TN...|$|R
