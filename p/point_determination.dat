40|$|The {{geometric}} {{performance of}} large format multi-head photogrammetric sensors, Intergraph DMC and Vexcel UltraCamD, was evaluated theoretically and empirically. Theoretical <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> accuracy coefficients were derived by simulation; <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> accuracy estimates are obtained by multiplying these coefficients by measurement accuracy and scale number. Multihead images have special multi-head distortions. The simulation {{study showed that}} the systematic image distortions caused systematic block deformations. In the empirical study three DMC blocks were evaluated. <b>Point</b> <b>determination</b> accuracy was evaluated using blocks with large overlap percentages. The standard error of unit weight was 2. 5 - 3 µm in adjustments without self-calibration and approximately 2 µm in self-calibrating adjustments; the multi-head parameters efficiently reduced the systematic errors of image residuals. Without additional parameters, the <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> accuracy was 2 - 4 µm in horizontal coordinates in image and 0. 03 - 0. 07 ‰ of object distance in height; with the best available self-calibration model the corresponding values were 1. 5 - 2 µm and 0. 02 - 0. 05 ‰. Large-scale blocks collected by DMC, UltraCamD and RC 20 all gave fairly similar <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> accuracy values.

40|$|Ground {{magnetic}} anomaly separation using reduction-to-the-pole (RTP) technique and the fractal concentration-area (C-A) method {{has been applied}} to the Qoja-Kandi prosepecting area in NW Iran. The geophysical survey that resulted in the ground magnetic data was conducted for magnetic elements exploration. Firstly, RTP technique was applied for recognizing underground magnetic anomalies. RTP anomalies was classified to different populations based on this method. For this reason, drilling <b>points</b> <b>determination</b> with RTP technique was complicated. Next, C-A method was applied on the RTP-Magnetic-Anomalies (RTP-MA) for demonstrating magnetic susceptibility concentration. This identification was appropriate for increasing the resolution of the drilling <b>points</b> <b>determination</b> and decreasing the drilling risk, due to the economic costs of underground prospecting. In this study, the results of C-A Modeling on the RTP-MA are compared with 8 borehole data. The results show there is good correlation between anomalies derived via C-A method and log report of boreholes. Two boreholes were drilled in magnetic susceptibility concentration, based on multifractal modeling data analyses, between 63 533. 1 and 66 296 nT. Drilling results show appropriate magnetite thickness with the grades greater than 20 % Fe total. Also, anomalies associated with andesite units host iron mineralization...|$|R

The mathematical model of photogrammetric <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> {{is based on a}} polynomial approach in case of airborne imagery, whereas orbital constraints should be utilized in case of spaceborne imagery. Computer simulations on <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> have turned out that the most accurate results can be obtained by simultaneous block adjustment of multiple overlapping and additional crossing strips. The usefulness of the 3 -line camera concept and the applicability of the proposed mathematical models of <b>point</b> <b>determination</b> have been proven with practical airborne MEOSS and spaceborne MOMS- 02 imagery.
