5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E

5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> franchise.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing war with Scotland. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage {{of a small group of}} royal favourites. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young prince, the king had him created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} of France during the Second World War tarnished the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, {{leading to the}} Malagasy Uprising of 1947. This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with {{the adoption of a}} constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.|$|E
40|$|Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown & Hackett, 1994) {{provides}} a framework for understanding career development, taking into account background and contextual variables using a social cognitive perspective. Given SCCT’s focus on both personal and contextual factors, it has been widely applied to understanding <b>the</b> career development <b>of</b> ethnic minorities and women. This study extends the SCCT framework by testing the SCCT career choice model with variables defined along the prestige dimension, {{in a sample of}} 198 African American college women. Path analysis results supported SCCT propositions for <b>the</b> relations <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> self-efficacy and prestige outcome expectations with <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> vocational interests, and <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> outcome expectations and <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> vocational interests with <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> choice goals. <b>The</b> relation <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> self-efficacy to <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> choice goals was fully mediated by <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> vocational interests; <b>the</b> relation between prestige outcome expectations and <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> choice goals was partially mediated by <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> vocational interests. Contrary to SCCT, <b>the</b> hypothesized relation <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> self-efficacy to prestige outcome expectations was non-significant. These findings provide preliminary evidence for <b>the</b> utility <b>of</b> SCCT in explaining <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> prestige-related career interests and choice goals among African American women...|$|R

5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of the power and the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E

5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E

5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it.

Recognition increases the visibility and <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

5|$|A {{new era of}} castle {{construction}} {{began when}} the daimyo Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle from 1576 to 1579. Earlier fortifications of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods were crude large scale structures; Azuchi, however, with rich ornamentation and a keep rising seven stories high, became the prototype for castle construction of the period. The style of Azuchi Castle marked {{a shift in the}} function of the castles from a place that was merely a fortress and military garrison to a political, cultural and economic center. The newer style castles functioned as home to the daimyo, his family, and his most loyal retainers. Because of the expense of building such a lavish structure, castles in the style of Azuchi, functioned also to highlight the power and <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daimyo. These new castles were built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation. Generally the main keep or tenshu was positioned at the highest point, surrounded by a series of interlocking baileys with walls, small towers and pathways. Residential buildings were located in one of the outer circles. The daimyo conducted his business in the citadel.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Entrepreneurs are a {{fundamental}} source {{of economic growth}} and prosperity of today's societies. Understanding the socio-cultural factors that support potential entrepreneurs is vital. <b>The</b> focal construct <b>of</b> this research is <b>the</b> social <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> an entrepreneur: <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value and appreciation <b>of</b> entrepreneurs in <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> their friends and peers. The research explores how the social prestige - the perceived social - value of entrepreneurs - can be conceptualized and empirically captured. Theories and Methodology: Drawing upon theories from entrepreneurship, organization and sociological research, the present work develops novel concept <b>of</b> social <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs. <b>The</b> empirical research {{is based on a}} four-step item generating process. The process explains and validates the created theoretical sub-dimensions <b>of</b> social <b>prestige.</b> <b>The</b> process includes a mix of qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (online questionnaire) methods, and explains and validates the created theoretical sub-dimensions <b>of</b> social <b>prestige.</b> <b>The</b> identified theoretical sub-dimensions <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> are: moral legitimacy, cognitive legitimacy, pragmatic legitimacy, emotional legitimacy, status, reputation and uniqueness. Based on these seven theoretical sub-dimensions, a large pool of items was created in order to develop the base for a measurement <b>of</b> 'social <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs'. Findings: Based on the four-step item generation process, a specific set of items are defined {{that can be used in}} future research to observe <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> social <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs. In doing so, the present work reflects a first step towards conceptualizing and measuring the social <b>prestige</b> in field <b>of</b> entrepreneurship. <b>The</b> study's findings also emphasize the need for conducting future research <b>of</b> social <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs more globally and for exploring further <b>the</b> supportive role <b>of</b> closest friends and peers to possible entrepreneurs. In conclusion, <b>the</b> develop measure <b>of</b> social <b>prestige</b> can open a new ways to analyze social influences on the entrepreneur's mindset, intention and possible start up behavior...|$|R
