5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is also a}} host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from {{parasitism}} of the common <b>periwinkle</b> Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} <b>periwinkle</b> results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E

5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar <b>periwinkle,</b> Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers {{are found}} {{throughout}} Pettigrew State Park. Atamasco lily, <b>periwinkle,</b> buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and in the shallows of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found near the river. This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat <b>Periwinkle,</b> a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, <b>periwinkle,</b> and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar <b>periwinkle.</b> The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} sell large quantities, {{distributors}} are commonly used {{in order to move}} the <b>periwinkles</b> to the retailer. These have vast networks of transport available both internationally, regionally and locally inside a city. In order to move <b>periwinkles</b> all the way, one would usually depend upon several distributors, each focusing on their own part of the transport network.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the three}} <b>periwinkles</b> Littorina littorea, Littorina saxatilis and Littorina littoralis only L. littorea, is of {{commercial}} value. The other two species are used mainly for decorative purposes {{and not for}} human consumption. <b>Periwinkles</b> are found on rocky shores and also on muddy intertidal zones which have a good cover of seaweed. They {{spend most of their}} existence in the intertidal zone below high water of neap tide and are found associated with the brown sea weeds such as bladderwrack (Ascophalium nodosum) and also the green sea weeds (Enteromorpha spp.). These weeds provide them with both shelter and food. <b>Periwinkles</b> browse on the sedentary animals which live on sea weed and on the weed itself. The investigations were confined to the size and quality of the <b>periwinkles</b> from Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Youghal and Cork Harbours. The numbers per kilogram and the percentage meat yield were determined together with length frequency distribution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Periwinkles</b> samples (Tympanostomus fuscatus) {{bought from}} {{different}} major markets in Warri Township were investigated for elemental contaminants.

All the metals except Cr ands Co were present in appreciable quantities in the samples. In descending order of predominance, the overall mean levels (ppm) of the metals in the <b>periwinkles</b> are: Fe (14. 67) > Cr (13. 59) > Ba (6. 46) > Cu (2. 06) > Cd (0. 57) >Pb (0. 05) while Ni and Co were below detection limit.

5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar <b>periwinkle.</b>|$|E

25|$|The rosy <b>periwinkle</b> case {{dates from}} the 1950s. The rosy <b>periwinkle,</b> while native to Madagascar, had been widely {{introduced}} into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of vincristine. This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine is derivable from the rosy <b>periwinkle.</b>|$|E
