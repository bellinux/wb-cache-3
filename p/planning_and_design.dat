5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{allocated}} $22 million to renew <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> efforts for the Second Avenue line, but in 1993 the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan's East Side. The study analyzed several alternatives, such as {{improvements to the}} Lexington Avenue Line to increase capacity, enhanced bus service with dedicated lanes, and light rail or ferry service on the East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. In November 1997, the MTA initiated the Lower Manhattan Access Study (LMA) to improve access to Lower Manhattan from the New York City suburbs. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to Lower Manhattan {{was one of the}} five build alternatives developed by the study.|$|E

5|$|The Negative Declaration for the {{expansion}} of US 113 from {{the north end of the}} Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The FredericaLittle Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the environmental effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study.|$|E

40|$|Creative {{problem solving}} {{is a key}} factor to {{successful}} innovation and, therefore, {{to the survival of}} organizations that <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> products. TRIZ is a very useful methodology for creative problem solving. However, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>designing</b> products involves complexity (multiple requirements, multiple functions, multiple contradictions), while TRIZ problem solving methods are effective for single problems. Hence, the use of TRIZ in product <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> conceptual <b>design</b> must involve transformation of complex into simple problems. In this paper, a prescriptive model for creative problem solving in product <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> conceptual <b>design</b> is presented. The systematic approach proposed by Pahl & Beitz (1988) is used as the prescriptive model framework. The model is completed with inclusion of basic TRIZ concepts and with elements from different creative problem solving methods, specially TRIZ problem solving methods...|$|R

25|$|The nearly 30-acre {{park has}} been {{open to the}} public since the early 1970s. In 2011, a master plan was {{developed}} with help from the <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> firm, Cecil Group of Boston and Bioengineering Group of Salem. The City of Salem paid $45,000 in federal money. In the long term, the projected cost to rehabilitate just the barracks was $1.5 million. But in the short term, there are multiple lower-cost items, like a proposed $15,000 kayak dock or $50,000 to relocate and improve the bathhouse. This is a very important project since Fort Pickering guarded Salem Harbor {{as far back as the}} 17th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} manage the project, a public company, CITY, was created in 1992 in order to oversee the initial {{creation}} and development of Moscow City {{as well as its}} subsequent usage. CITY is also a general contractor and both landlord and leaser. Overall responsibility for the architectural <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> of Moscow City belongs to the architectural studio No. 6, which {{is a part of the}} large Moscow practice Mosproject-2 named after Mikhail Vasilyevich Posokhin. This group, headed by Gennadiy Lvovich Sirota, who is officially the Chief Architect of Moscow City, is in charge of overseeing the design of the complex as a whole and agreeing the details of individual projects. Each building lot has its own investor and architect. By 2014 the volume of investments in Moscow City was approximately $12 billion.|$|E
