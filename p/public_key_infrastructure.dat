25|$|Cryptography can {{introduce}} security problems {{when it is}} not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. <b>Public</b> <b>key</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead {{technologist}} for the NSA's information-sharing office. At {{the time}} of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his [...] "breaking point" [...] of [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress"—Snowden quit his job at Dell. Although he has stated that his career high annual salary was $200,000, Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen, where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity. According to a Reuters story by Mark Hosenball, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have misled 20–25 co-workers into giving him their logins and passwords under false pretenses. NBC News subsequently reported that the NSA sent a memo to Congress suggesting that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>infrastructure</b> certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. This report was disputed, with Snowden himself saying in January 2014, [...] "With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers." [...] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.|$|E

In this paper we examine the role <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>infrastructures</b> play in electronic voting in various protocols proposed in the literature, some of which are the kernel of experimental projects and/or commercial products. Although one of the rationals to move towards electronic voting systems is cost-effectiveness, in this paper we argue that performance issues should not be overlooked, especially in case of disaster recovery, were a CA to revoke all of its certificates during an election.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>key</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (PKIs) play an {{important}} role in secure electronic communication via the internet. More and more governments, companies and customers use this technology and trust in the provided security, but PKIs have risks. On the one hand the mathematical problems on the hardness of which <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptography depends are not provably hard, on the other hand failures in implementations can happen. A mechanism to restore the security of an infrastructure is to revoke damaged areas. Depending on the extent a breakdown would restrict the functionality of the PKI which would imply costly consequences for business and society. To maintain the PKI, new components would be developed, produced, distributed, and installed which would cost time and money. Furthermore a failure would imply the loss of the provability of digital signatures and of the confidence in sensitive data. In this thesis the described problems will be solved by a fail safe concept for <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R
