50|$|The {{production}} of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment. Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus. mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol, {{where they are}} translated by ribosomes.

Upon exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport, a specific lysosomal tag, mannose 6-phosphate, {{is added to the}} peptides.

In view of the faulty packaging, it was common for 50 per cent to 90 per cent of hand grenades and mortar shells to fail to function. Now, however, the Japanese are utilizing metal and asphalt-impregnated paper linings for their ammunition containers, and consequently deterioration has been materially lessened.|$|E

40|$|The {{recast version}} of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010 / 31 /EU) proposes a {{comparative}} methodology aimed at defining the energy performance of buildings “with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels”. Really, how can the cost-optimal technologies be detected? Moreover, how can the most <b>proper</b> <b>packages</b> of energy efficiency measures be chosen {{in order to obtain}} the cost-optimality? This paper would provide answers to these questions, by proposing a new methodology for the evaluation of the cost-optimality, by means of the multi-objective optimization of energy performance of buildings and indoor thermal comfort. The optimization procedure is developed by means of the coupling between MatLab and EnergyPlus, by implementing a genetic algorithm, and it allows the evaluation of profitable and feasible packages of energy efficiency measures applied to buildings. Then, following the adoption of these packages, the global cost over the lifecycle of the building is calculated, in order to identify the cost-optimal solution. After the presentation of the methodology, the developed method is proposed for the optimization of the energy retrofit of an existing building. Furthermore, the method can be applied also for new architectures, by considering reference buildings...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{implemented}} to support wireless sensor networks, the lightweight mobile code daemons {{described in this}} article now work on wired networks as well. The authors have implemented them to run on multiple operating systems and architectures. The daemons use a peer-to-peer indexing scheme to find mobile code packages as needed. Calls to the daemons are automatically dereferenced to find the <b>proper</b> <b>package</b> for a node’s OS and hardware. Advances in network and embeddedprocessors make possible entirelynew classes of distributed applica-tions. These applications must not be vul-nerable to failures of single nodes or links, and the networks must be able to tolerate intrusion and the subversion of a small number of nodes. As part of a research agenda to create a secure adap-tive infrastructure, the lead author and his students have implemented systems com-bining mobile code and peer-to-peer net-working. Thus far, we have implemented applications for sensor networks, adapta-tion to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, dynamic battle management, and build-ing-control systems (BACNet). The mobile code daemon we present is based on a core network protocol called the Remote Execution and Action Proto-col (REAP), which is responsible for pass-ing messages between nodes within our network. On top of this packet protocol, we have developed a framework that allows objects to serialize themselves and travel across the network. At a higher abstraction layer, we’ve written messages to handle remote process creation and monitoring, simple file-system opera-tions, and resource-index operations. We’ve used the REAP daemon as mid-dleware for creating robust distributed infrastructures for applications interacting with chaotic environments. The first appli-cation is a battery-powered wireless sensor network in which nodes are fielded with a minimal software suite that is extended as needed by using mobile code. Classification methods assign targets to classes (trucks, motorcycles, and SUVs, for example) as they are detected; each classification method performs differently on various combinations of targets.

The absolute conservation of this unique genome structure within the Retroviridae family is strong evidence that a dimerized genome is of critical importance to the viral life cycle. An obvious hypothesis is that retroviruses have evolved to preferentially package {{two copies of}} genomic RNA, and that dimerization ensures the <b>proper</b> <b>packaging</b> specificity for such a genome. However, this implies that dimerization must be a prerequisite for genome encapsidation, a notion that has been debated for many years.

Selection of <b>proper</b> <b>packaging</b> material and design is essential to protect the device from moist fluidic environment in the body as well as not to cause any harm to the implanted tissue. In particular, packaging needs to be designed carefully when the device operates wirelessly through inductive coupling between two coils, since the packaging could degrade the power transmission due to the losses in the packaging itself. In this study, the influence of the proposed packaging methods on the magnetic power transmission was investigated using numerical simulations with the help of finite element analysis.

40|$|Vanilla is tropic {{plant that}} has high {{economic}} value. Indonesian vanilla {{is the most}} popular because of vanillin content. Vanillin is the major of flavor compound in vanilla. Vanillin is formed during processing fresh to dry vanilla benas. Decreasing vanillin content and moisture content of dry vanilla beans during storage cause degradation of quality. The objective of this research was determined permeability of plastic packaging, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry vanilla beans were packaged all types of plastic during the storage, and predicted dry vanilla shelf-life. In this research classified for 3 steps, determined water vapour permeability of plastic, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry vanilla beans during the storage, and determined dry vanilla shelf-life. Result value was analyzed descriptively. The result of research showed that permeability of polipropilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 4 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polipropilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 675 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. But permeability of polietilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 46 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polietilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 795 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. In the other, permeability of zaack plastic was 8, 14 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. Polipropilen was the most because vanilin content changes was longest time among polietilen and zaack plastic packages, for this reason the stability of vanilla beans quality could be controlled. Polipropilen plastic has Ea = 8 Kal/mol K with A value = 16085, 93; polietilen plastic has Ea = 7, 89 Kal/mol K with A value = 14433, 30; and bagor plastic has Ea = 7, 64 Kal/mol K with A value = 10544, 9.
