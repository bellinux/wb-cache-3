30|$|We have {{investigated}} an initial-boundary {{problem for the}} perturbation equations of rotating, incompressible, and viscous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluids with zero resistivity in a horizontally periodic domain. The velocity of the fluid in the domain is non-slip on both upper and lower flat boundaries. We switch {{the analysis of the}} initial-boundary problem from Euler coordinates to Lagrangian coordinates under <b>proper</b> initial <b>data,</b> and get a so-called transformed MHD problem. Then, we exploit the two-tiers energy method. We deduce the time-decay estimates for the transformed MHD problem which, together with a local well-posedness result, implies that there exists a unique time-decay solution to the transformed MHD problem. By an inverse transformation of coordinates, we also obtain the existence of a unique time-decay solution to the original initial-boundary problem with <b>proper</b> initial <b>data.</b>|$|R

Under-tested software will not only {{cost a lot of}} time and effort for customers but also incur huge expenses for the company. Two major causes for not generating <b>proper</b> test <b>data</b> are lack of skills and insufficient time to prepare. The aim of this project is to develop a tool called Test Data Generation Tool (TDGT) that assists software testers in generating <b>proper</b> test <b>data</b> with minimal efforts. It provides mechanisms to read company-specific data sources as well as generic data sources such as flat files, EXCEL spreadsheets, XML documents and SQL Server databases. In addition TDGT helps software testers generate test data quickly so that they can spend more time finding bugs in the software rather than preparing test data. TDGT provides a rich user interface to design and execute the data generation task, and hence even a new tester can use this tool with minimal effort. TDGT can also be used to transfer data from one data source to other data sources. Such move is quite common to satisfy day-to-day business needs of testing department in a software company. Another usage of this tool is to view Unicode data for all the supported data sources mentioned above. This project also provides primitive metrics to help testers understand the process of test data generation...|$|R
