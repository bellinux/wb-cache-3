5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the detected radial velocity {{was caused by the}} blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{investigated}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the transit signal detected by Kepler was actually {{due to a}} third star in the system that eclipsed its sister stars. However a bisector analysis of the spectra of KOI-98's star ruled out that hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{concerns}} over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various alleged human rights violations, its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in neighbouring areas, proposed boycotts, warnings of the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters, and religious persecutions.|$|E

5|$|According to Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Ricberht murdered Eorpwald of East Anglia {{in about}} 627, shortly after Eorpwald succeeded his father Rædwald as king and had then been baptised as a Christian. Following Eorpwald's death, Ricberht {{may have become}} king, a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> is not {{mentioned}} by Bede or any contemporary commentator. East Anglia then reverted to paganism for three years, before Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded jointly as kings of East Anglia and ended the kingdom's brief period of apostasy.|$|E
5|$|Although Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh remain {{convinced}} that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion is true, they confess to the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> all of Plantard's claims about a post-1956 Priory of Sion {{were part of an}} elaborate hoax to build a cult of personality and cult of intelligence around himself in French esoteric circles.|$|E

5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
