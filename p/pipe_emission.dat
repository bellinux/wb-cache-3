40|$|Soot {{emission}} of diesel engines {{is the result}} of soot formation and of soot oxidation. Experimental investigations showed that most of the soot is oxidized during combustion. Therefore soot oxidation has major influence on the tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emission.</b> In this thesis a simulation model has been developed which uses detailed gas phase reaction kinetics and a heterogeneous surface reaction model. The predicted con-centrations agree very well with the experimental results. Simulation of the surface reaction is done with a semi-global multi-disperse particle model which takes account for the transport processes between gas and particle phase. The effects of gas phase radicals are described with less simplification errors and give insight in the oxidation process. Soot oxidation under diesel engine like conditions could be described in comparison of analytical and experimental (fast sampling valve) time dependent behavior. Even the soot induction time could be considered in contrast to published models...|$|E

The addition of hybrid and electric vehicles in pas-senger car segment has got significant momentum to address the global challenges. This research investigates the performance of a group of hybrid vehicles from customers’ perspective. Among the different brands that are available in the hybrid vehicle market, smart customers have given pri-ority to vehicle cost, mileage, tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emission,</b> comfortness and high tank size volume for long drive. Considering these attributes, selection strategy for hybrid vehicles has been developed using entropy based multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method.

40|$|Measurements in a {{road tunnel}} in Stockholm, Sweden give the {{real-world}} traffic emission factors {{for a number}} of gaseous and particle pollutants. These include 49 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), CO, NOX, benzene, toluene, xylenes, aldehydes, elements and inorganic/organic carbon contained in particles, the sub-micrometer aerosol number size distribution, PM 2. 5 and PM 10. The exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>emission</b> factors are divided with the help of automated traffic counts into the two pollutant sources, the heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) and light-duty vehicles (LDV). The LDV fleet contains 95 % petrol cars and the total fleet contains about 5 % HDV. When data permitted, the emission factors were further calculated at different vehicle speeds. The current work shows that average CO, NOX and benzene emission factors amounted to 5. 3, 1. 4 and 0. 017 g veh(- 1) km(- 1), respectively. Since the mid- 90 s CO and benzene decreased by about 15 %, carbonyls by about a factor 2, whereas NOX did not change much. PAR emission factors were 2 - 15 times higher than found during dynamometer tests. Most particles are distributed around 20 nm diameter and the LDV fleet contributes to about 65 % of both PM and particle number. In general, the gaseous emissions are higher in Sweden than in USA and Switzerland, foremost due to the lower fraction catalytic converters in Sweden. The PM and number emissions of particles are also slightly higher in the Swedish tunnel. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand of petroleum in {{the transport sector}} has led to depletion of low cost/low risk reserves, increased levels of pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions that take a heavy toll on the environment {{as well as the}} national economy. There is an urgent need to use alternative energy resources along with an efficient and affordable energy conversion system to arrest environmental degradation. Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) show great promise in this regard - they use hydrogen gas as a fuel that electrochemically reacts with air to produce electrical energy and water as the by product. In a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), these zero tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emission</b> systems offer high efficiency and power density for medium-heavy duty and long range transportation. However, PEFC technology is currently challenged by its limited durability when subjected to harsh and adverse operating conditions and transients that arises during the normal course of vehicle operation. The hydrogen-based fuel cell power train for electric vehicles must achieve high durability while maintaining high power efficiency and fuel economy in order to equal the range and lifetime of an internal-combustion-engine vehicle. The technology also needs to meet the cost targets to make FCEVs a commercial success. In this dissertation, one of the degradation phenomena that severely impede the durability of the system has been investigated. In scenarios where the cell becomes locally starved of hydrogen fuel, “cell reversal” occurs, which causes the cell to consume itself through carbon corrosion and eventually fail. Carbon corrosion in the anode disrupts the original structure of the electrode and can cause undesirable outcomes like catalyst particle migration, aggregation, loss of structural and chemical integrity. A comprehensive study using advanced electrochemical diagnostics and high resolution 3 D imaging was performed and a new understanding to extend PEFC life time and robustness, by implementing engineered materials solutions, has been achieved. This will eventually help in making fuel cell systems more efficient, durable and economically viable, in order to better harness clean energy resources...|$|E

However, the market penetration of such vehicles is restricted by their limited range capabilities and {{by the lack of}} fast charging infrastructures. The Range Extended (R-EX) hybrid technology represents a valuable option to address these issues, since it offers the benefits of an EV, such as the electric driving for medium distances, while still maintaining the internal combustion engine, which can be operated at its optimal efficiency to recharge the battery, thus eliminating the Management System (EMS) of an R-EX Ultra-Light Vehicle (ULV), applying a heuristic approach based on the results obtained from the Dynamic Programming (DP) optimization, maximising the overall powertrain efficiency as function of trip information...|$|R
40|$|Establishing an {{environmental}} policy for industrial sources usually commences with a {{regulation of the}} large point sources. Attention is then focused on <b>piped</b> <b>emissions,</b> e. g. exhaust gases directed via a stack and wastewater through a discharge pipe. In general these piped missions are well regulated and have been reduced substantially, {{to such an extent}} that the other emissions have become more and more dominating. With respect to atmospheric emissions of volatile organic emissions (VOC) these other emissions comprise mainly leakage from equipment (fugitive emissions) and evaporation losses of storage, loading and unloading. These emissions are called diffuse emissions. Monitoring of diffuse emissions is more complex compared with monitoring of <b>piped</b> <b>emission</b> sources. Abatement and regulation of diffuse emissions is a relatively new issue in some member states of the European Union (EU). It is however not common practice in all EU member states, this contrary to the USA where it is common practice for about 10 - 20 years. The main environmental effect of VOC in general is their role in the formation of smog and ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxides. VOC in the ambient air are precursors to the formation of ground level (tropospheric) ozone, the primary constituent of smog. Smog and ozone cause respiratory damage, damage to property and vegetation (agriculture and ecosystems). Individual components of VOC are known for other negative effects such as toxic effects on health and ozone layer depletion in the stratosphere. Reduction of VOC emissions is not only beneficiary to the environment but also can lead to better workplace conditions, can reduce risks of fire, can reduce nuisance (odours) and can save money. IMPEL, the environmental inspectors network for the EU, has defined a project on diffuse emissions. The intention is to provide guidelines for implementing diffuse emissions regulations, both for licensing of industrial plants and for enforcement. The Netherlands Inspectorate for the Environment is in charge of the project and commissioned Tebodin to assist as consultant. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to determine the}} influence of diesel fuel composition on the ability of NOX adsorber catalyst (NAC) technology, in conjunction with diesel particle filters (DPFs), to achieve stringent emissions levels with a minimal fuel economy impact. The test bed for this project was intended to be a light-duty sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a goal of achieving light-duty Tier 2 -Bin 5 tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emission</b> levels (0. 07 g/mi. NOX and 0. 01 g/mi. PM). However, with the current US market share of light-duty diesel applications being so low, no US 2002 model year (MY) light-duty truck (LDT) or SUV platforms equipped with a diesel engine and having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) less than 8500 lb exist. While the current level of diesel engine use is relatively small in the light-duty class, there exists considerable potential for the diesel engine to gain a much larger market share in the future as manufacturers of heavy light-duty trucks (HLDTs) attempt to offset the negative impact on cooperate average fuel economy (CAFE) that the recent rise in market share of the SUVs and LDTs has caused. The US EPA Tier 2 emission standards also contain regulation to prevent the migration of heavy light-duty trucks and SUV's to the medium duty class. This preventive measure requires that all medium duty trucks, SUV's and vans in the 8, 500 to 10, 000 lb GVWR range being used as passenger vehicles, meet light-duty Tier 2 standards. In meeting the Tier 2 emission standards, the HLDTs and medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs) will face the greatest technological challenges. Because the MDPV is the closest weight class and application relative to the potential upcoming HLDTs and SUV's, a weight class compromise was made in this program to allow the examination of using a diesel engine with a NAC-DPF system on a 2002 production vehicle. The test bed for this project is a 2500 series Chevrolet Silverado equipped with a 6. 6 L Duramax diesel engine certified to 2002 MY Federal heavy-duty and 2002 MY California medium-duty emission standards. The stock vehicle included cooled air charge (CAC), turbocharger (TC), direct fuel injection (DFI), oxidation catalyst (OC), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that transport sources in developing countries contribute about 4 % of the global fossil carbon dioxide versus 18 % by industrialized countries. The cost of urban air pollution {{is estimated}} to be 2 % of GDP in developed countries and more than 5 % in developing countries. With an annual vehicle registration growth of over 30 % in 2008 and a population growth rate of 6 %, the number of automobiles in Kampala city of Uganda is expected to continue growing exponentially. Most of the vehicles used are imported into the country when quite old with worn out engines and low energy efficiencies. As a result, such vehicles profusely emit exhaust gases which may be harmful to both human health and the environment. Controlling pollution from the transport sector is vital to improving the quality of air and protecting public health. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the level of pollution from automobile exhaust gases in Kampala City and its impacts on human health and the environment. The study involved the analysis of tail pipe emissions using a gas analyser. It covered mini buses, motorcycles and personal vehicles which constitute 92 % of the Kampala vehicle parc. It was established that the main types of exhaust gases from the automobiles were CO 2,  NOx, CO, NO and HC. The findings estimated the highest level of NOx tail pipe emissions at 0. 15 mg/m 3, HC emissions at 2. 59 mg/m 3, CO at 110 mg/m 3 and 286. 6 mg/m 3 for CO 2. The reported ambient air emissions were estimated at 0. 18 ppm, 14000 ppm and 1. 3 ppm corresponding to NO 2, CO 2 and CO, respectively. The study further investigated the impact of four mitigation methods on emission levels using the LEAP model. The impact of increasing penetration of city buses, introduction of tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emission</b> standards and hybrid cars and improvement of vehicle fuel economy were investigated. It was found that if left unabated, the emissions will continue to grow with the increasing number of motor vehicles. Implementation of the proposed mitigation methods resulted in a reduction in the GWP reduced by 52 %, 51 %, 17 % and 8. 5 %, respectively. It is recommended that a comprehensive motor vehicle pollution control program be designed to implement the proposed NEMA vehicle emission standards. Establishment of an integrated transport system promoting the growth in number of city buses should be made a priority to reduce on emission levels and enable the decongestion of Kampala city...|$|E

The current UK-average diet is found to embody 8. 8 kg CO 2 e person− 1 day− 1. This figure includes both food eaten and food wasted (post-purchase). By far the largest potential reduction in GHG emissions is achieved by eliminating meat from the diet (35 % reduction), followed by changing from carbon-intensive lamb and beef to less carbon-intensive pork and chicken (18 % reduction). Cutting out all avoidable waste delivers an emissions saving of 12 %. Not eating foods grown in hot-houses or air-freighted to the UK offers a 5 % reduction in emissions. We show how combinations of consumer actions can easily lead to reductions of 25 % in food related GHG emissions. If such changes were adopted by the entire UK population this would be equivalent to a 71 % reduction in the exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2 from the entire UK passenger car fleet (which totalled 71 Mt CO 2 e year− 1 in 2009) ...|$|R

We calculate that the embodied GHG content of the current UK food supply is 7. 4 kg CO 2 e person− 1 day− 1, or 2. 7 t CO 2 e person− 1 y− 1. This gives total food-related GHG emissions of 167 Mt CO 2 e (1 Mt= 106 metric tonnes; CO 2 e being the mass of CO 2 that {{would have the same}} global warming potential, when measured over 100 years, as a given mixture of {{greenhouse gas}}es) for the entire UK population in 2009.

We calculate that potential GHG savings of 22 % and 26 % can be made by changing from the current UK-average diet to a vegetarian or vegan diet, respectively. Taking the average GHG saving from six vegetarian or vegan dietary scenarios compared with the current UK-average diet gives a potential national GHG saving of 40 Mt CO 2 e y− 1.

The sector recently turned to natural gas as an efficient substitute particularly in the more popular passenger cars that utilize spark ignition engines. It performs excellently with lesser tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emissions</b> when compared with petrol which emits lesser harmful products than diesel. Though readily available, with well-developed infrastructure, its fossil nature makes it a finite resource hence the need for a viable renewable replacement fuel. Many alternative fuels have been developed to power the spark ignition engine as stricter emission standards are being created and the need for improved fuel economy with better system efficiency. This paper highlights the popular alternative fuels been utilized in spark ignition engines which are hydrogen, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas and biogas looking at criteria such as performance, renewability, ease of integration into existing infrastructure and cost with the need to make a case for biogas as the right substitute for petrol in existing and future spark ignition engine applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferent {{techniques}} are being attempted {{over the years}} to use low pollution emitting fuels in diesel engines to reduce tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emissions</b> with improved engine efficiency. Especially, Biodiesel fuel, derived from different vegetable oils, animal fat and waste cooking oil has received a great attention in the recent past. Transesterification is a proven simplest process to prepare biodiesel in labs with little infrastructure. Application of thermal barrier coatings (TBC) on the engine components is a seriously perused area of interest with low grade fuels like biodiesel fuels. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are gaining popularity to predict the performance and emissions of diesel engines with fairly accurate results besides the thermodynamic models with considerably less complexity and lower computing time. In the present study, experiments have been conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine whose combustion elements are coated with an experimental thermal barrier coating material made from Lanthanum Zirconate. Biodiesel has been prepared from Pongamia Pinnata oil through transesterification process. A series of experiments are conducted on the engine with and without thermal barrier coating using diesel and biodiesel fuels. Performance and emissions data from the experiments is used to train the network with the load, fuel type and coating being the input layer and the brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, CO, HC and NOx emissions being the output layer. Results showed that the coating of engine components with lanthanum zirconate TBC resulted in improved engine efficiency with reduced emissions. ANN model is tested for its accuracy to predict the performance and emissions of the engine with the R values of 0. 99 for both the training and test data with a mean square error of 0. 002 and a mean relative error of 6. 8...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to collect and evaluate environmentally relevant data on mineral oil additives and their combustion products. In addition, their concentration ranges, chemistry and functions in the mineral oils are described. Lubricant and fuel additives belong to the quantitatively most important chemicals with a total quantity of 84600 tons estimated for Germany 1997 / 98 (57400 tons of lubricant additives, 27200 tons of fuel additives). They determine substantially the characteristic profile of engine oils, gasoline and diesel. Main lubricant additive families are detergents, dispersants, antioxidant/antiwear agents (ZDTP), inhibitors, and viscosity modifiers. Examples for fuel additives are detergents, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, cetane improvers (diesel), and wax crystal modifiers (diesel). Based on the information available in the literature and provided by the manufacturers the environmental fate of the additives is explored, and inventories (calculations of the input and output) are presented. Data for emission volumes and additional 'reasonable worst case' assumptions were calculated on this basis. But as measurement data in this area is very limited, the calculated emissions are uncertain. Comparison of the emitted additive combustion products (CO_ 2, CO, NO_ 2, NMVOC, particulate matter) with exhaust limit values for tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emissions</b> and total traffic emissions in Germany showed that the contribution of additive combustion products to particles is more significant than to other fractions. The results of the calculations indicate that the portion of mineral oil additives of the traffic-dependent particle emissions in Germany is approximately 7 % (ca. 3 / 5 from lubricant additives and ca. 2 / 5 from fuel additives).

40|$|International audienceElectric {{vehicles}} are gaining importance {{and help to}} reduce dependency on oil, increase energy efficiency of transportation, reduce carbon emissions and noise, and avoid tail <b>pipe</b> <b>emissions.</b> Because of short driving distances, high mileages, and intermediate waiting times, fossil-fuelled taxi {{vehicles are}} ideal candidates for being replaced by battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Moreover, taxis as BEVs would increase visibility of electric mobility and therefore encourage others to purchase an electric vehicle. Prior to replacing conventional taxis with BEVs, a suitable charging infrastructure has to be established. This infrastructure, which {{is a prerequisite for}} the use of BEVs in practice, consists of a sufficiently dense network of charging stations taking into account the lower driving ranges of BEVs. In this case study we propose a decision support system for placing charging stations to satisfy the charging demand of electric taxi vehicles. Operational taxi data from about 800 vehicles is used to identify and estimate the charging demand for electric taxis based on frequent origins and destinations of trips. Next, a variant of a set covering problem is formulated and solved, aiming at satisfying as much charging demand as possible with a limited number of charging stations. Already existing charging locations are considered in the optimization problem. In this work, we focus on finding regions in which charging stations should be placed, rather than exact locations. The exact location within an area is identified in a post-optimization phase (e. g., by authorities), where environmental conditions are considered, e. g., the capacity of the power network, availability of space, and legal issues. Our approach is implemented in the city of Vienna, Austria, in the course of an applied research project conducted in 2014. Local authorities, power network operators, representatives of taxi driver guilds as well as a radio taxi provider participated in the project and identified exact locations for charging stations based on our decision support system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{procedure and}} {{results of a}} study for Saechs. Landesamt fuer Umwelt und Geologie and for Senatsverwaltung fuer Stadtentwicklung, Berlin. It contains the results of silt load measurements of 2 streets in Germany and PM 10 emission factors for these streets, deducted from curb side and background PM 10 - and NOx-concentration measurements. The paper presents a first proposal for Germany for an operational method to deter-mine the “non exhaust <b>pipe</b> ” <b>emissions</b> of single streets. It is a modification of the AP- 42 model of the US-EPA, using as parameters: location of the street (city/open country), kind of street, traffic load, average weight of a fleet vehicle, yearly number of days with rain {{and quality of the}} street surface. It is shown that the quality of the street surface might have sig-nificant influence on the PM 10 emission and that the modelling is far from being satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{incidence}} of extensive roof greening {{structures in the}} contamination of roof runoff has been analysed for three families of organic micropollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], alkylphenols [APs], and bisphenol A [BPA]) by means of both laboratory leaching tests and field experiments. For PAHs, which {{do not have any}} local source on the green roof and originate only from atmospheric fallout, the green roof behaves as a sink and reduces by a factor 10 the emitted loads compared to a conventional flat roof. APs and BPA however can be emitted by the synthetic materials that constitute the roofing structure (e. g., roof sealing, drainage material, filter, evacuation <b>pipes).</b> Potential <b>emissions</b> of BPA and nonylphenol (NP) from the geotextile, the sealing membrane and PVC pipes have especially been identified. Field results confirm increased NP and octylphenol (OP) emissions in the green roof runoff. However, the concentrations and loads remain within the range of values observed for other types of urban surfaces...|$|R
