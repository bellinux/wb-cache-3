5|$|Rather {{than using}} a turn-based battle system like {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles with a <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> mechanic. The game {{has a unique}} Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a <b>power</b> <b>bar,</b> a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
50|$|Gambit, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Cyclops are {{available}} to play. Each character can jump and use various unlimited weapons (i.e. punch, kick) and a superpower which had a usefulness limited by a mutant <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> similar to a life meter, making the player rely more on standard attacks. The mutant <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> would slowly regenerate when depleted and when switching characters in mid-game, would revert {{to the status of}} the next characters mutant <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> from the last use (characters yet to be used would start off with a standard full bar of mutant power).|$|E
40|$|The use of GaN {{devices for}} {{microwave}} power amplifiers begins to be {{a reality in}} Europe. This paper describes two S-band (2. 7 - 3. 3 GHz) high power amplifier (HPA) designs; one discrete 100 W output stage and one 10 W MMIC power amplifier. The discrete power amplifier is designed using two GaN <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> with a total gate width of 19. 2 mm. The GaN <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> have been developed by Selex-SI, within the european co-project Korrigan. The MMIC power amplifier was designed using a 0. 25 ?m GaN HEMT process supplied and processed by Chalmers...|$|R

5000|$|Players {{have certain}} {{abilities}} {{based on their}} character class. The player has a <b>Power</b> <b>Bar</b> that provides [...] "power" [...] for their special abilities. The <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> regenerates slowly. Constructing the Command post speeds up the recharge rate though. Players have up to eight weapon slots, depending on character class. The classes that are available are engineer, soldier, field ops, medic, and covert ops.|$|E
50|$|Flyff {{features}} melee, ranged {{and magic}} combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> {{are able to}} be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic.|$|R
5000|$|In Extreme Rock Climbing, {{you choose}} {{from one of}} many {{different}} game modes. After that, you can choose from one of many different characters to play as. One you do that, you choose a map, all in which a bigger in height, {{then you get to}} the game. First you use your arrow keys and grab onto once of the rocks on the wall by clicking it. Generally, you spend the entire level clicking on different rocks on a wall. Once you do so, a bar comes up with a green bar bouncing up and down. Click exactly when the green bar gets to the top, then you continue to climb successfully. You can also use power-ups, such as [...] "Power Bars" [...] which increase your health. As you climb, your health goes down slowly and if you leave it too long you will have a heart attack then fall of the rock. Basically, you are required to have <b>Power</b> <b>Bars,</b> because without them you {{would not be able to}} succeed. The reason for the <b>Power</b> <b>Bars</b> is because the game is sponsored by the company who creates <b>Power</b> <b>Bars</b> (as seen on the front cover of the game.) Once you make it to the top of the wall, the game rewards you with a congratulations screen and simply returns you to the title menu.|$|R

25|$|In 2000 the new Honda <b>powered</b> <b>BAR</b> {{did show}} a {{significant}} improvement. It {{proved to be}} considerably more reliable than the team's previous effort, but the team still only had a best finish of 4th and the victory they had promised in 1999 still eluded them. At {{the end of the}} season the team finished 5th in the Constructors' Championship. The progression and improvement of the team was enough to convince Villeneuve to remain at the team.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{trade-off}} between performance and reliability for AlGaN/GaN transistors. It is shown that changes in epitaxial growth, transistor design and process may lead to an improvement in performance but are, at the same time, accompanied by a degradation of device reliability. As a result we show strategies in order to balance performance and reliability as both are linked. Based on these findings we have realized state-of-the-art <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> for mobile communication systems and X-band MMICs for radar applications...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{stopped playing}} live and {{recording}} in 1992. They got together again circa 1997 for a one-off {{show at the}} Roadhouse in Manchester. This line-up did not feature rhythm guitarist Simon Maguire or keyboard player Dave Drennan but did include Eldon Snelgrove (real name) on percussion and keyboards. They then re-formed briefly in 2012, playing four shows; at the North London Tavern (Kilburn, London), <b>Power's</b> <b>Bar</b> (Kilburn, London), Affstock (Chelmsford) and the Ruby Lounge (Manchester). The only absentee from the 2012 line-up was Simon Maguire.|$|R

The benefits of using silver diamond composite as base plate in packages for GaN <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> is demonstrated. A dramatic improvement in thermal management (as high as ~ 50 %) was obtained {{with respect to}} the existing packaging technologies based on CuW. Micro-Raman thermography measurements were carried out to determine the device temperature at a range of operating power levels. A finite element thermal model was built to assert the obtained experimental results and was found to be in good agreement...|$|R
5000|$|Gameplay {{involves}} {{selecting a}} character and then proceeding {{to battle the}} other characters, one at a time, in various locales. The three-dimensional fighting includes {{the ability to use}} special attacks as well as to pick up and fight with such objects as tables, chairs, rocks and bombs. During battle, [...] "Power Stones", resembling gems of different colors, appear in the arena. If a character collects three Power Stones, he/she transforms into a more powerful version of himself/herself. He/she will then be able to use one of two super special attacks: generally a massive long-range power attack and a grab or close-range move. The powered-up mode only lasts until the <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> is fully drained, during which the special attack can be executed (which completely depletes the <b>power</b> <b>bar)</b> or other, lesser special moves can be executed (which only use a small portion of power). Each match continues until the life bar of one of the two characters fighting is depleted.|$|E
50|$|In the DS version, {{there are}} 20 {{character}}s, and each character gets their own kart (the Powerpuff Girls have separate karts, unlike the PS2 version). The characters each have one toon power {{that can be}} used when their toon <b>power</b> <b>bar</b> is filled up. There are 1-8 players available in this version. Unlike the PlayStation 2 version, there are two mini-games and three cartoons.|$|E

The main world is the jungle, but there are also three other worlds including the jungle canopy, cavern, and underwater world. Each world has its own characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is split}} up into two segments, {{vehicles}} and third-person person Jedi fighting. The vehicle segments involve most vehicles from the Star Wars universe: STAPs, tanks, AATs, AT-XTs, and Republic gunships. The controls used involve {{primary and secondary}} fire, acceleration and a special ability that changes from vehicle to vehicle. The Jedi segments use basic lightsaber slashing and two force powers, which rely on a force <b>power</b> <b>bar,</b> lightsaber throw and force push.|$|E
5000|$|In Pangya, special {{shots are}} {{achieved}} by doing {{different combinations of}} keys. The standard [...] "perfect shot" [...] is performed by hitting a shot that lands in the white bar, causing a voice to cheer [...] "Pangya!". Under certain conditions, players can hit shots such as the Power Topspin, Power Backspin, and Power Curve, aiding them in avoiding obstacles or chipping {{the ball into the}} hole. More complicated shots can be achieved such as the Super Pangya, which adds 10-20 yards to a shot (depending on how many <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> are spent on the shot), as well as the Cobra, Tomahawk and Spike, which change the trajectory of the shot considerably.|$|R
5000|$|In the Dynasty Warriors: Gundam series, enemies will {{occasionally}} drop power-ups resembling Haro {{with open}} wing flaps, which refills the player's health and special <b>power</b> <b>bars</b> to maximum. Also in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2, new objectives are signalled by a [...] "Haro, haro" [...] sound (the voice differs depending on region), and the Pink-chan Haro {{appears on the}} Game Over screen saying [...] "Focus" [...] (in the English version). One of the random Submissions that appears during the game's regular missions is Lacus asking the player to find and rescue Haro for her, Haro never speaks directly but if the mission is completed he asks Lacus to join the players side.|$|R
40|$|Enron {{has brought}} about demands from many {{quarters}} to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) new powers. Among the powers the SEC now seeks is the <b>power</b> to <b>bar</b> or suspend securities law violators from serving as an oflicer or director of any public company. Currently, the law assigns this power only to federal district courts. In this Essay, Professor Barnard traces {{the history of the}} current law; examining why Congress has expressly withheld suspension and <b>bar</b> <b>powers</b> from the SEC. She then argues that the courts have exercised their suspension and <b>bar</b> <b>powers</b> wisely, and that recent developments do not compel any legislative change. Finally, recognizing that Congress may well be persuaded that new legislation is necessary, she provides model statutory language {{that could be used for}} such a change...|$|R
