40|$|Introduction VTT Automation and Euroshield Oy has {{developed}} a new concept for magnetically shielded rooms. For an enclosure size of 3 x 4 x 2. 5 m 3, the shielding factor exceeds 60 dB at low frequencies, increasing to above 90 dB at frequencies beyond 10 Hz. The concept, based on double aluminium and mumetal shields and an active shielding stage, incorporates several new techniques for increasing the costeffectiveness of traditional shielding. A magnetically shielded room based on this concept was constructed for MEG studies at the Low Temperature Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology in 1998. 2 Methods 2. 1 Passive shielding The passive shielding consists of two shells with 150 mm interspace. Each shell has a 2 mm mumetal and an 8 mm aluminium layer as shielding materials.

Using frame analysis, informed by discourse studies, the article analyzes how the project emerged and was established as a public phenomenon in the media coverage, including how it was made intelligible and which social actors were represented as having a say on the matter.

The new systems, which use belief models to improve the understanding of what the user really wants, need a practical text representation model that can make the extraction of beliefs easier. Profiling is an appropriate method for creating such a text representation. In this thesis we develop the details for a process of building basic profiles from reported speech in newspaper articles. This process recognizes and extracts reported speech, and determines the internal structure of reported speech clauses, fitting it within basic <b>profile</b> <b>frames.</b> In order to accomplish this, three building blocks are used: recognition of reporting verbs, punctuation analysis and the structure of the reported speech. We implemented a fully automated system which extracts basic profiles and analyzes them, differentiating between circumstantial information and primary information. Inside the primary information, a differentiation is made between direct quotes and paraphrases. The source, reporting verb and other circumstantial information are extracted. The reporting verb is analyzed, determining its tense, aspect, modality, mood, voice and polarity. The semantic dimensions of the reporting verb are also analyzed, paving the path for a future belief analysis based on reporting verbs...|$|R
50|$|The Baroque style {{added to}} the round-arched and {{rectangular}} light- openings those {{in the shape of}} a basket-handle arch and even of an oval shape, and sought to enrich them by drawing in the corners and by curving the sides in and out. This led to the appearance of a great variety of lines the number and lack of repose of which is characteristic of the Baroque. The framing which the Renaissance had given the windows remained customary during the Baroque period, but in agreement with the entire development of the style they were augmented, were more artificial, and had less repose. The most frequently used was the flat or <b>profiled</b> <b>framing,</b> in which the cornice no longer ran parallel to the light- opening, but assumed an independent arbitrary form; at times the frame was interrupted by quarry-faced ashlar. The support-framing was seldom used, the combined framing was changed so that the frames were no longer laid one by the other, but one over the other, only a small part of the under one being visible on the two sides. The part of the frame above the window received a rich development; it was generally either a horizontal cornice or a gable cornice; where the windows were arched it also followed the curved line, with the result of an unlimited variety of artistic forms.|$|R

Its treatment is controversial, and different options are available: traction, spica casting, internal fixation and external fixation. The {{aim of this study}} is to present our results with external fixation of subtrochanteric femoral {{fractures in}} children using Ilizarov frame. Between January 2012 and January 2014, 14 patients with closed subtrochanteric femoral fractures were treated in Cairo University School of Medicine Teaching Hospital. The average age at the time of injury was 6.4  years (range 3.8 – 11.5  years). Pathological fractures and fractures associated with neuromuscular diseases were excluded from this study. Two patients were multiply injured with abdominal injuries (as ruptured spleen). In all cases, a low <b>profile</b> Ilizarov <b>frame</b> was inserted using two half pins inserted proximally from greater to lesser trochanters parallel to the hip joint orientation line (line between tip of greater trochanter and femoral head centre) and secured to an arch, and another three half pins were inserted distally perpendicular to the femoral shaft and secured to an arch that was connected by three rods to the proximal arch. No post-operative spica was used. Average follow-up was 18  months (range 12 – 36  months). All fractures united with anatomical alignment within an average of 8  weeks (range 6 – 12  weeks). There were no deep infections and no significant limb length discrepancies. At the latest follow-up, no patient had any restriction of activities. External fixation with a low <b>profile</b> Ilizarov <b>frame</b> appears as a good treatment option for subtrochanteric femoral fractures in children.|$|R
40|$|The first {{surgical}} {{heart valve}} replacement was undertaken {{over half a}} century ago since when there has been a continuing quest to develop a prosthesis with the perfect combination of durability, haem-atological compatibility and haemo-dynamic performance. Early caged ball mechanical valves were robust but asso-ciated with red cell trauma and rapidly fol-lowed by introduction of mono-leaflet and bi-leaflet designs which remain in use today. Introduced later in the 1960 s, bio-prosthetic valves consisting of pericardial or valve tissue mounted on a frame and sewing ring were initially conceived for use in elderly patients unlikely to outlive the valve, or in other patients at risk of bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation. Until recently, mechanical valves have remained the logical choice in patients < 65 years of age given the minimal rates of primary valve failure. 1 However, advances in the longevity and haemodynamic performance of modern bioprostheses and the emerging potential for transcatheter treatment when they degenerate seem set to challenge this paradigm. 2 Stentless bioprosthetic valves offer the potential for (A) further improvements in the flow dynamics of cardiac output and consequent haemodynamic performance, (B) remodelling and dynamic adaptation to the anatomy of the aortic root with resulting progressive increase in the effect-ive orifice area, and (C) enhanced regres-sion of left ventricular hypertrophy with improved clinical outcomes. Although initial comparative studies demonstrated superior haemodynamics, prospective randomised controlled trials against modern stented bioprosthetic valves with lower <b>profile</b> <b>frames,</b> thinner sewing rings and excellent haemodynamic characteris-tics 3 have shown no major differences in clinical and echocardiographic endpoints at 1 -year follow up. ...|$|R
