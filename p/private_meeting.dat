5|$|Duhalde {{has largely}} retired from {{politics}} since his {{defeat in the}} 2011 elections. He sought to make amends with Menem for their past political rivalry, and met him during the 2013 Papal inauguration of Pope Francis.

They had previously met in similar circumstances in 2005, during the funeral of Pope John Paul II.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E

He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress. Fidel Castro also attended the Assembly, and MalcolmX met publicly with him {{as part of a}} welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders.

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{was first}} endorsed {{by a foreign}} government on 27 December 1917, when Serbian Zionist leader and diplomat David Albala announced the support of Serbia’s government in exile during a mission to the United States.

At a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> in London on 1 December 1918, Lloyd George and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau agreed to certain modifications to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, including British control of Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, {{a public}} spate arose between Ranariddh and his {{personal}} secretary, Noranarith Anandayath. Ranariddh accused Noranarith of badmouthing him, which prompted the latter to resign from the CRPP. Two months later, in December 2014, the Phnom Penh Post reported that several high-ranking FUNCINPEC officials defected to the CRPP, which included a former secretary of state, former provincial governor and former deputy national police chief. On 2 January 2015, Ranariddh announced his plan to return to FUNCINPEC, after being ousted from the party in 2006. The announcement was made after a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> with Prime Minister Hun Sen who had urged Ranariddh to rejoin his former party. The CRPP was subsequently dissolved when Ranariddh returned to FUNCINPEC later {{in the latter part}} of January 2015.|$|E
5|$|The two losses, piled {{upon the}} loss to Georgia Tech, left Clemson with a 2–3 record. An {{anonymous}} report said coach Swinney became involved in a shouting match with a position coach, while players called a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> {{in an effort to}} turn the team's season around. On October 17, The Tigers rallied from their losing streak by defeating Wake Forest, 38–3, and moved back {{into the middle of the}} competition for the Atlantic Division championship. One week after defeating Wake Forest, the Tigers traveled to Miami, Florida, to play the Miami Hurricanes, who were ranked No. 10 in the Bowl Championship Series Poll. The Tigers played the Hurricanes into overtime, then upset Miami with a touchdown, 40–37.|$|E

In times of crisis, the Security Council still meets primarily in consultations, {{but it also}} holds more public meetings.

5|$|At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo {{president}} Satoru Iwata {{announced that}} the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement {{was a surprise to}} Sakurai, who left HAL Laboratory in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another Smash Bros. game, despite the fact that Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new Smash game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> with him, where he was asked to be involved as Brawls director. Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Help from a variety of studios such as Monolith Soft and Paon was enlisted, with Game Arts as the main team in the preliminary development stages. In addition, several Smash Bros. staff members that resided {{in the area of the}} new office joined the project. Altogether, roughly 100 individuals worked on the project full-time, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Parker's {{finished}} script included 146 {{changes to}} the concept album's music and lyrics. In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber {{at his home in}} France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for Evita required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the United States Department of State and senator Chris Dodd, Parker arranged a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at the Casa Rosada, the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in the Casa Rosada. He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's production designer Brian Morris take photographs of the Casa Rosada, so that the production could construct a replica at Shepperton Studios in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and Budapest.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of the}} Indian Union {{took shape}} and Hume {{initially}} had some support from Lord Dufferin for this, although the latter wished to have no official link to it.

But the PEF executive board retroactively approved the sick leave buybacks in a <b>private</b> <b>meeting</b> in August 1999, forcing Benson to drop the lawsuit. Nonetheless, former PEF Secretary-Treasurer Patricia Ford was convicted of bribery in June 2003.|$|E
