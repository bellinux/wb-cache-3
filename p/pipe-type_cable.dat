40|$|Forced cooled {{systems for}} underground, oil filled, pipe-type {{electrical}} transmission cable systems {{are becoming increasingly}} common in large urban centers. In systems of this type there exist a number of electrical transmission cables in an oil filled conduit. These cables are wrapped with a semi-circular, protective skid wire, which increases the turbulence in the flow and up until now has prevented any accurate or realistic prediction of the pressure drop. An equation has been used which correlates the friction factor of the rough surface which has been developed which combines {{the effects of the}} rough and smooth surface on the flow to obtain a friction factor vs. Reynolds Number plot for the entire <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> system. This theory has been written {{in the form of a}} FORTRAN IV computer program which accepts as input the geometrical dimensions of a system and yields as output the friction factor and corresponding Reynolds Number for the entire <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> geometry. The results predicted from the theory are consistently 15 - 30 % above the experimentally determined values.

40|$|Cables. " Over the {{intervening}} 25 years this work has achieved {{the status of}} a handbook on the subject. During this period, however, there have been numer-ous developments in the cable art, and much theoretical and experimental work has been done with a view to obtaining more accurate methods of evaluating the parameters involved. The advent of the <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> system has emphasized the desirability of a more rational method of calculating the performance of cables in duct in order that a realistic comparison may be made between the two systems. In this paper the authors have en...|$|E
40|$|Forced-cooled {{systems for}} {{oil-filled}} <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> circuits {{have recently been}} considered. In such systems the conduction resistance through the paper insulation of the cables is the limiting thermal resistance. Assuming bilateral symmetry, steady-state conditions, and two-dimensional heat transfer, a FORTRAN IV computer program was written to solve the heat conduction problem in the cable insulation for arbitrary configurations of a three-cable system. For a steel pipe, a cable system is most susceptible to overheating in the equilateral configuration with the three cables touching. Proximity effects are very significant in forced cooling, especially when cables are not provided with a copper tape under the insulation moisture seal assembly, accounting {{for as much as}} 21 % of the total oil temperature rise between refrigeration stations. This figure, however, is reduced to 8 % when 0. 005 inch thick copper tape is present. Forced cooling of underground electric power transmission lines, pt. 2 Consolidated Edison Co. of New Yor...|$|E
40|$|The frequency-domain {{analysis}} of carrier channels on distribution cable networks is performed {{by means of}} an efficient procedure based on the nodal approach and modal theory. The multiconductor system may represent any configuration with multiple discontinuity points. The use of equivalent two-port PI-circuits allows the nodal admittance matrix to be defined in a new form. Very accurate frequency-dependent analytical models are developed to simulate systems of single-core <b>cables</b> or multiple-core <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cables,</b> buried or above a ground plane...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Southwire Company is to develop the {{technology}} necessary to proceed to commercialization of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) transmission cables. Power transmission cables are a promising near-term electric utility application for high-temperature superconductivity. Present HTS wires match the needs for a three-phase transmission cable: (1) the wires must conduct high currents in self-field, (2) there are no high forces developed, and (3) the cables may operate at relatively low current density. The commercially-available HTS wires, in 100 -m lengths, make construction of a full three-phase, alternating current (ac) transmission cable possible. If completed through the pre-commercialization phase, this project {{will result in a}} new capability for electric power companies. The superconducting cable will enable delivery with greater efficiency, higher power density, and lower costs than many alternatives now on the market. Job creation in the US is expected as US manufacturers supply transmission cables to the expanding markets in Asia and to the densely populated European cities where <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> is prevalent. Finally, superconducting cables may enable delivery of the new, diverse and distributed sources of electricity that will constitute the majority of new installed electrical generation in the world during the coming decades...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} {{utilized for}} the design of a forced-cooled pipe-type underground transmission system is presented. The material is divided into three major parts: (1) The Forced-cooled Pipe-Type Underground Transmission System Design Manual-Part I, (2) The Design Manual-Part II, and (3) the Forced-Cooled Pipe-Type Underground Transmission System Computer Program Design Manual. The Design Manual Part I provides the thermal and hydraulic design analyses required {{for the design}} of a forced-cooled cable system of specified geometry. The thermal design establishes the relationship between the cable amperage, oil flow, and the conductorto- oil temperature difference and provides a coolant loop energy balance which includes an analysis of the pipe-to-soil heat transfer. Combination of both permits the maximization of the cable amperage while maintaining the cable temperature below the maximum allowable value. The hydraulic design establishes the pressure-flow characteristics for <b>pipe-type</b> <b>cable</b> systems and a systematic analysis is provided which allows for calculation of the pressure drop in the cable line and rturn line of the flow circuit as well as the circuit absolute pressure profile. The pressure drop governs the selection of circulation pumps, pipe strength characteristics, and strongly influences coolant loop length. The Design Manual-Part II presents a description of the experimental and analytical research performed at M. I. T. 's Heat Transfer Laboratory which provides the relationships used in the design analysis of Design Manual-Part I. The Computer program design manual provides {{a detailed description of the}} forced-cooled system computer program and the necessary program documentation. The computer program is basically a straightforward computerization of the design procedure of Design Manual- Part I. Six different computer design options are provided which permit complete flexibility for the design and optimization of the forced-cooled system. Four of the design options allow for the selection of alternative independent and dependent design variables and two design options provide for the system optimization based on specified optimization criteria...|$|E
