Many of the Dinka use riverine pastures {{along the east}} bank of the White Nile, but in dry seasons can usually find alternative <b>pasturage</b> along the Khor Adal and Khor Wol and {{on the edges of}} the marshes.|$|E
5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them <b>pasturage</b> rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu <b>pasturage</b> had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E

5|$|This isle is for {{the most}} part arable, but rocky in other parts; the mould is brown and clayey, inclining to red; it is good for <b>pasturage</b> and cultivation. The corn growing here is oats and barley. The cattle bred here are cows, horses, and sheep. There is a church in this island called Kilchattan, it has an altar in the east end, and upon it a font of stone which is very large, and hath a small hole in the middle which goes quite through it. There are several tombstones in and about this church; the family of the Macneils, the {{principal}} possessors of this isle, are buried under the tombstones on the east side the church, where there is a plot of ground set apart for them. Most of all the tombs have a two-handed sword engraven on them, and there is one that has the representation of a man upon it... This isle affords no wood of any kind, but a few bushes of juniper on the little hills.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of <b>pasturage.</b> Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E

60|$|Rollo was {{extremely}} interested, as he sailed along, in viewing these mountain slopes, exploring the landscape carefully in every part, studying {{out all the}} objects of interest which it contained--the forests, the cultivated fields, the great Swiss cottages, the <b>pasturages,</b> the little chalets, the zigzag paths leading up and down, {{and all the other}} picturesque and striking characteristics of a Swiss landscape.|$|R
50|$|Later also Lutherans {{moved to}} Louisenthal, thus in 1867 the village counted 458 inhabitants, among them 227 Catholics. The Lutherans {{belonged to the}} Lutheran parish of Lübzin. Louisenthal {{consisted}} of 40 farm homesteads, two handicraft businesses and about 60 buildings forming the agricultural inventory in 1867. The village measured 321 ha of arable land, of which 103 ha were used as ploughlands, 195 ha as meadows and 20 ha of <b>pasturages.</b>|$|R
25|$|Of {{the total}} land area, about 20 percent is under cultivation, {{although}} {{the amount of}} potentially arable land is larger. Only about 10 to 15 {{percent of the land}} area is presently covered by forest as a result of rapid deforestation during the last 30 years. Of the remainder, a large portion is used as <b>pasturage.</b> Some land is too rugged, dry, or infertile for agriculture or any other use.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of honey vary, depending on water content, {{the type of}} flora used to produce it (<b>pasturage),</b> temperature, {{and the proportion of}} the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a supercooled liquid, in which the glucose will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The {{face of the}} {{countryside}} changes markedly as one moves from north to south. In the north and central coast, orchards and fields predominate; while in the central plains, <b>pasturage.</b> Overall, arable land is 17%–19%, with forest and woodland 4%, permanent crops 13%, irrigated lands at2.4%; about 20% is used for pasture. There are limited fresh water resources. In the south the environment grows increasingly arid, until the borderlands eventually reach into the Sahara desert. Roads total about 20,000km., two-thirds being paved, {{with most of the}} unpaved roads lying in the desert south.|$|E
25|$|The Sami {{crossed the}} borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. Sami were still free {{to cross the}} border between Sweden and Norway {{according}} to inherited rights laid down in the Lapp Codicil of 1751 until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany's occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer <b>pasturages</b> are today used by Sami originating in Kautokeino.|$|R
60|$|Thus far {{the road}} which the young gentlemen had {{travelled}} since leaving Interlachen {{had been quite}} level and smooth, its course having been {{along the bottom of}} the valley, which was itself quite level, though shut in on both sides by precipitous mountains. Now they were to leave the valley and ascend one of these mountain sides by means of certain zigzag paths which had been made with great labor upon them, to enable the peasants to ascend and descend in going to and from their hamlets and <b>pasturages.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "they can; for {{in almost}} all places where people wish to go there are {{excellent}} paths. Where it is too steep for roads the mountaineers make zigzag paths, not only for travellers, but for themselves, in order that they may {{go up and down}} to their chalets and <b>pasturages.</b> The people of the country have been making and improving these paths now for two thousand years or more, and they have got them at last in very excellent condition; so that, except the steepness, they are very easy and very comfortable." ...|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} problems in land use are soil erosion and salinization in improperly irrigated farmland. An estimated 60% of Kyrgyzstan's land {{is affected by}} topsoil loss, and 6% by salinization, both problems with more serious long-term than short-term effects. In 1994 the size of livestock herds averaged twice the carrying capacity of <b>pasturage</b> land, continuing the serious overgrazing problem and consequent soil erosion that began when the herds were at their peak in the late 1980s. Uncertain land tenure and overall financial insecurity have caused many private farmers to concentrate their capital in the traditional form—livestock—thus subjecting new land to the overgrazing problem.|$|E
25|$|In 1843, Catholic missionaries chose Dunwich as {{the site}} for the first Catholic mission to Australian Aborigines. The sand islands of Quandamooka did not support <b>pasturage</b> {{suitable}} for sheep and cattle, and thus there did not occur conversion of large tracts of land into farms and pastoral properties and the subsequent widespread annihilation and displacement of Aboriginal people. The very existence of the quarantine station on Stradbroke Island from 1850 to the 1870s led to the official discouragement of pastoralism or wider settlement for fear of spreading disease. Another reason for discouraging settlement was to reduce the likelihood of incoming vessels to the bay evading customs duty.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aim of the}} 1920 Land Commission was {{to promote}} European {{agriculture}} by curbing growing economic crops by Africans where this competed with Europeans, and by reserving for those Africans living outside the estates only as much land as was sufficient for them, making the remainder available to form small to medium size European plantations. The commission considered that 700,000 acres of Crown land was potentially available to create future estates. This was mainly outside the Shire Highlands, which contained many existing estates. The commission estimated that the African population of Nyasaland would double by 1950 but gave a very low estimate that 3.2 million acres of cultivable land and appropriate <b>pasturage</b> that would be sufficient to feed this anticipated future population.|$|E
60|$|This scene; at {{all times}} {{alluring}} and grand, was now beheld under its most favorable auspices. The glare of day had deserted all that belonged to what might be termed the lower world, leaving in its stead the mild hues, the pleasing shadows, and the varying tints of twilight. It is true that a hundred châlets dotted the Alps, or those mountain <b>pasturages</b> which spread themselves a thousand fathoms above the Leman, on the foundation of rock that lay like a wall behind Montreux, shining still with the brightness of a bland even, but all below was fast catching the more sombre colors of the hour.|$|R
50|$|As a {{frontier}} zone between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers, Ningxia {{was a frequent}} seat of war and incursions by non-Chinese tribes. To pacify the region, the imperial government established military colonies to reclaim land. In addition, horse <b>pasturages</b> were founded under the Imperial Stud to safeguard the supply of army horses, {{as early as the}} Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 9 CE). Ningxia and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the Qin Dynasty as early as the 3rd century BC. Throughout the Han Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty there were several large cities established in the region. The Liang Province Rebellion {{at the end of the}} Han Dynasty affected Ningxia.|$|R
5000|$|Marram grass {{has been}} widely used for thatch {{in many areas of}} the British isles close to the sea. The {{harvesting}} of marram grass for thatch was so widespread during the 17th century that it had the effect of destabilizing dunes, resulting in the burial of many villages, estates and farms. In 1695 the practice was banned by an Act of the Scottish Parliament: [...] Considering that many lands, meadowes and <b>pasturages</b> lying on sea coasts have been ruined and overspread in many places in this kingdom by sand driven from adjacent sand hills .... His Majesty does strictly prohibit and discharge the pulling of bent, broom or juniper off the sand hills for hereafter.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of domesticated chicken illustrates the site’s importance for {{trade between the}} Indian Ocean and the southern interior as a possible route of entry for the black-feathered variety of chicken resembling those of India. Thus, {{the inhabitants of the}} site made extensive use of their location along the southern Mozambican coast. The poor soil composition and inadequate rainfall only allowed variable agricultural output, causing the inhabitants to procure other means of sustenance. Chibuene inhabitants made use of domesticated animals from southern Africa and successful shark and turtle hunting practices from neighbors from the north in order to adequately exploit the resources of the particular region they inhabited with easy access to the coast and variable land for <b>pasturage</b> in addition to invaluable trade resources procured from the Indian Ocean trade network.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the Basotho kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. In the battles that followed, the Orange Free State {{tried unsuccessfully to}} capture Moshoeshoe's mountain stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, while the Sotho conducted raids in Free State territories. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics, with large swathes of <b>pasturage</b> and cropland being destroyed. Faced with starvation, Moshoeshoe signed a peace treaty on 15 October 1858, though crucial boundary issues remained unresolved. War broke out again in 1865. After an unsuccessful appeal for aid from the British Empire, Moshoeshoe signed the 1866 treaty of Thaba Bosiu, with the Basotho ceding substantial territory to the Orange Free State. On 12 March 1868, the British parliament declared the Basotho Kingdom a British protectorate {{and part of the}} British Empire. Open hostilities ceased between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. The country was subsequently named Basutoland and is presently named Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|Cilicia Pedias ("flat Cilicia"—; Assyrian Kue), to the east, {{included}} the rugged spurs of Taurus {{and a large}} coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (euthemia), filled with sesame and millet and olives and <b>pasturage</b> for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, {{and that the united}} rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.|$|E
60|$|This is a {{beautiful}} and very fertile valley, about twenty miles long and five or six broad; a bright cold stream called the Fourche de Glace, or Ice River, runs through it. Its sheltered situation, embosomed in mountains, renders it good <b>pasturaging</b> ground in the winter time; when the elk come down to it in great numbers, driven {{out of the mountains}} by the snow. The Indians then resort to it to hunt. They likewise come to it in the summer time to dig the camash root, of which it produces immense quantities. When this plant is in blossom, the whole valley is tinted by its blue flowers, and looks like the ocean when overcast by a cloud.|$|R
5000|$|Spanish Fork {{was settled}} by Mormon pioneers in 1851. Its name derives from {{a visit to}} the area by two Franciscan friars from Spain, Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez in 1776, who {{followed}} the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the Spanish missions in California, along a route later followed by fur trappers. They described the area inhabited by Native Americans as having [...] "spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and <b>pasturages,</b> for raising cattle and sheep and horses." ...|$|R

25|$|During the 1720s, the Qasami had {{emigrated from}} the Persian coast and {{established}} {{themselves as a}} force in Sharjah and Julfar (Ras al-Khaimah, now part of UAE). In the period 1747-59, {{a branch of the}} Qasemi from Sharjah established itself on the Persian littoral, but it was expelled in 1767. By 1780, the Qasemi branch was re-established on the Persian coast and began to feud with other coastal tribes over <b>pasturage</b> in the islands off Langeh. The Iranian argument for the ownership of the disputed islands is that the Qasami controlled the islands while they were located on the Persian coast, not when they later emigrated to the UAE coast. In April 1873, the islands were reported as a dependency of the Persian Fars province to the British Resident, which the Resident acknowledged. In the period 1786-1835 the official British opinion, surveys, and maps identified the Tonbs as part of Langeh, subject to the government of the province of Fars. Chief among them were the works of Lt. John McCluer (1786), political counselor John Macdonald Kinneir (1813), and Lt. George Barns Brucks (1829).|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} Smaïl-aga {{set in motion}} a series of attacks which left many Montenegrins and Turks dead. Anxious to conceal his role in the murder, Ali Pasha pretended to be outraged and ordered an attack on the Drobnjaci. More than seventy Drobnjaci warriors were killed, dozens of homes were torched, wells were {{poisoned}} and several women were raped. At the same time, Ali Pasha sought to shore up his own position by removing any pretext for intervention by the Porte. He contacted Njegoš and expressed a willingness to engage in peace negotiations. Njegoš was in a quandary; he knew that by failing to avenge the Drobnjaci he risked alienating a sizeable portion of his countrymen. At the same time, Njegoš realized that such negotiations could increase Montenegro's territory and bring about diplomatic recognition by Austria and the Ottomans, who wanted peace and an end to the continuous skirmishing on the Montenegrin–Turkish frontier. In 1841, in an attempt to legitimize his country and under Russian pressure to normalize relations with Austria, Njegoš reached an agreement with the Austrians defining the Austro–Montenegrin border. Despite the agreement, the Austrians failed to officially recognize Montenegro as a sovereign state, and demanded the Montenegrins' complete withdrawal from the coast in exchange for Montenegrin tribesmen being permitted to seek <b>pasturage</b> for their sheep and cattle in Kotor. The withdrawal required the Montenegrins to give up two historic monasteries (Podmaine and Stanjevići), which the Austrians subsequently purchased for a considerable sum. Despite these concessions, the agreement improved trading between the two sides.|$|E

60|$|In {{the middle}} ages the <b>pasturages</b> on the slope of these hills, {{especially}} on the other side, belonged to the rich republic of Amain, who built this tower as an exploratory gazeeboo from which they could watch the motions of the Saracens who were wont to annoy them with plundering excursions; but after this fastness [was built] the people of Amalfi usually defeated and chastised them. The ride over {{the opposite side of}} the mountain was described as so uncommonly pleasant as made me long to ride it with assistance of a pony. That, however, was impossible.

40|$|Scythians had {{expanded}} {{over a large}} area from the Great Wall of China in the east to the Danube River in the west. Hanging down through Caucasia they had even shown their effectiveness on the Frontal-Asia. They had founded a powerful steppe empire which subsisted {{for a long period}} of time. Like many similar examples Scythian Empire had experienced such periods as the foundation, rise, decline and collapse. There were several reasons of the decandence of Scythian Empire namely geographic, demographic, economical, political and military. The empire had gradually lost its sovereignty as the percentage of its founding element in the total population decreased. <b>Pasturages</b> and the main trade centers got out of hand; new military equipments could not be developed and as a result the breakdown of the empire was quickened...|$|R
60|$|So Rollo went to {{the window}} where Mr. George was standing, and his astonishment at what he saw was even greater than before.

At one place, through an opening or gap in the nearer mountains, there could be seen far back towards the horizon the broad sides and towering peak of a distant summit, which seemed to be wholly formed of vast masses of ice and snow, and which glittered with an inexpressible brilliancy under the rays of the morning sun.|$|R
