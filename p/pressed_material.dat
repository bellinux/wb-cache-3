40|$|Delamination is {{a typical}} defect of ceramic tiles. It {{originates}} from the presence of trapped air during pressing, and elastic recovery of the <b>pressed</b> <b>material,</b> which prevents the consolidation of the <b>pressed</b> <b>material.</b> Although delamination greatly reduces {{the quality of the}} final product, standard tests for ceramic tiles are not currently available. In this work the problem of detecting delamination of green and fired ceramic tiles is approached by using ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement, a non-destructive technique normally used to assess concrete structures and the density of ceramic tiles. It was assumed that an increase in travel time for a given thickness (i. e., decrease in travel velocity) would indicate the presence of delamination, as the sound wave has to travels around the flat pore. The problems connected with measurement uncertainty and repeatability are discussed in the paper, in particular concerning the standardisation of the measurement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

After hot pressing at 800 oC only Al and cBN could be observed by XRD, whereas higher hot pressing temperature result in the formation of AlN and AlB 2 which retard the densification. The microstructure of the hot <b>pressed</b> <b>material</b> was studied using scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that oxide layers exist at the interface between Al and cBN phases.

40|$|Mechanical and {{microstructural}} {{analysis of}} equal channel angular pressed copper was experimentally investigated.

Furthermore, the addition of 0. 1 % magnesium to the pure copper had a considerable effect on the distribution uniformity. In addition, the material fracture mode changed from ductile to brittle by the alteration of the dimples to cleavage planes mechanism. Moreover, the formability index was dramatically reduced after the first pass and slowly improved at the succeeding passes. Eventually, ECAP process led to the increment of low angle grain boundaries and the decrease of high angle grain boundaries at the initial passes and vice versa at the subsequent ones...|$|E

40|$|A {{metal matrix}} composite, {{consisting}} of an Al- 6061 matrix alloy reinforced with 10 vol. % of fine Al 2 O 3 particulates, was processed by equal-channel angular pressing for 1 pass {{at room temperature}} and an additional 11 passes at 473 K. Microstructural observations showed the grain size was reduced from ~ 3. 5 to ~ 1. 9 ?m but the average particulate size remained unchanged at ~ 270 nm. Tensile testing was conducted to failure at 873 K on samples cut from the as-received material and from as-pressed billets. Following fracture, quantitative measurements were taken to determine {{the size and shape}} of the internal cavities developed during tensile testing. The measurements show cavities form more readily in the as-received condition probably due to the higher flow stresses in this material. The <b>pressed</b> <b>material</b> contained several large cavities oriented parallel to the tensile axis.

These qualities make it suitable for study as a high temperature structural ceramic. Amorphous powders were synthesized by a novel sol-gel process in the Cs₂O-Al₂O₃-SiO₂ system. Gels were produced from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), Aluminum chelate, and Cs-acetate. Powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The glass transition and crystallization temperatures were determined to be 945 °C and 1026 °C, respectively, for the amorphous powders. Pollucite and mullite phases were observed by XRD of bulk glass-ceramics.

40|$|An {{aluminum}} 7034 alloy, {{produced by}} spray casting {{and with an}} initial grain size of ~ 2. 1 ?m, was processed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) at 473 K to produce an ultrafine grain size of ~ 0. 3 ?m. It is shown that the rod-like MgZn 2 precipitates present in the as-received alloy are broken into very small spherical particles during ECAP and these particles become distributed reasonably uniformly throughout the material. The presence of these fine MgZn 2 particles, combined with a distribution of fine Al 3 Zr precipitates, is very effective in restricting grain growth so that submicrometer grains are retained at elevated temperatures up to at least ~ 670 K. Tensile testing of the <b>pressed</b> <b>material</b> revealed high elongations to failure, including elongations of > 1000 % when testing at a temperature of 673 K at initial strain rates at and above 10 ? 2 s? 1.

The reasons for the variation of the thermoelectric properties were investigated by examining influences of following parameters; oxidation, mechanical deformation during pulverization and the hot pressing temperature. Thermoelectric properties of zone melted ingot were largely affected by dopants when composition is fixed, whereas thermoelectric properties of hot <b>pressed</b> <b>material</b> were mainly related with the variation of the carrier concentrations caused by the generation of electrically active defects from many sources.

40|$|Segregation and {{chemical}} inhomogeneity are well-known problems in powder metallurgy {{and are also}} an issue for new applications of powder mixtures, for example as starting materials for severe plastic deformation. In this study, Cu-coated Fe powder was prepared via immersion deposition, inductively hot-pressed and subsequently deformed using high-pressure torsion.

During severe plastic deformation, higher hardness was observed for the coated powder as compared to powder mixtures even after low strains. In the saturation state, the coated powder was found to result in a hardness of about 600 HV, which is significantly harder than for the powder mixtures. This is attributed to the greater amount of impurities introduced by the coating process.
