50|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} form the spherical-shaped nodules of graphite (called temper graphite nodules or temper carbon nodules) in the annealing process, {{care must be}} taken to ensure that the iron casting will solidify with an entirely white iron cross section. Thicker sections of a casting will cool slowly, allowing some <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> to form. This graphite forms random flake-like structures and will not transform to carbide during heat treatment. When stress is applied to such a casting in application, the fracture strength will be lower than expected for white iron. Such iron is said to have a 'mottled' appearance. Some countermeasures can be applied to enhance the formation of the all white structure, but malleable iron foundries often avoid producing heavy sections.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown {{repeatedly}} that many elements present as traces or at low level can affect graphite shape in cast irons. As part of a long term project aimed at clarifying the growth and the alteration of spheroidal graphite, {{a study on the}} effect of a few elements (Cu,Sn, Sb, and Ti) on <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> growth was undertaken and analysed with reference to an alloy without any such additions. This work was performed by remelting alloys in graphite crucibles thus saturating the melt in carbon and enabling <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> to grow by controlled cooling of the melt above the eutectic temperature. <b>Primary</b> <b>graphite</b> growth in the reference alloy was observed to be lamellar, while the added elements were found to affect bulk graphite and to modify its outer shape, with Sb leading eventually to rounded agglomerates together with wavy lamellae. Secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to analyze the distribution of elements, and no build-up of trace elements at the graphite surface could be observed. Instead, it is established that the perturbation of bulk graphite is associated with inhomogeneous distribution of metallic elements inside graphite precipitates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFive {{spheroidal}} graphite cast irons were investigated, a usual ferritic grade and four pearlitic alloys containing Cu and doped with Sb, Sn and Ti. These alloys were remelted in a graphite crucible, leading to volatilization of the magnesium added for spheroidization and to carbon saturation of the liquid. The alloys were then cooled down and maintained at a temperature above the eutectic temperature. During this step, <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> could develop showing various features {{depending on the}} doping elements added. The largest effects were that of Ti which greatly reduces graphite nucleation and growth, and that of Sb which leads to rounded agglomerates instead of lamellar graphite. The samples have been investigated with secondary ion mass spectrometry to enlighten distribution of elements in <b>primary</b> <b>graphite.</b> SIMS analysis showed almost even distribution of elements, including Mg and Al (from the inoculant) in the ferritic grade, while uneven distribution was evident in all doped alloys.

Graphite-filled PS plates were produced via an internal mixer and compression molding. Unhardened steel (1. 4401) and nylon (PA 66) balls were used for the tribological tests.

40|$|Analysis {{of cooling}} curves {{recorded}} at {{the centre of}} large blocks cast with near-eutectic spheroidal graphite cast irons prone to give chunky graphite has been checked against microstructure observations. It has been observed that solidification proceeds totally at temperatures lower than the stable eutectic temperature and the following solidification sequence could be proposed: 1) nucleation of <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> in the liquid; 2) initial eutectic reaction processing by growth of austenite-like dendrites encapsulating the primary nodules; 3) bulk eutectic reaction related to nucleation and then growth of CHG cells and of secondary nodules, these latter giving spheroidal graphite eutectic cells.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that if certain trace elements {{are present in}} cast iron melts the morphology of the graphite precipitates can be altered.

To obtain Fe–Ce alloys, metallic Ce was added {{at the bottom of a}} graphite crucible and covered with iron, and then heated as for the Fe–Sb charge. In both cases, the melt was then cooled and held slightly above the eutectic temperature so that <b>primary</b> <b>graphite</b> crystals, which had nucleated on the crucible walls and then detached from it, could grow freely in the melt.

40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} the study of the formation of chunky graphite (CHG) in heavysection castings of spheroidal graphite cast irons. To that aim, near-eutectic melts prepared in one single cast house were poured into molds containing up to four large cubic blocks 30 cm in size. Four melts have been prepared and cast that had a cerium content varying in relation with the spheroidizing alloy used. Postinoculation or addition of antimony was achieved by fixing appropriate amounts of materials in the gating system of each block. Cooling curves recorded in the center of the blocks show that solidification proceeds in three steps: a short <b>primary</b> deposition of <b>graphite</b> followed by an initial and then a bulk eutectic reaction. Formation of CHG could be unambiguously associated with increased recalescence during the bulk eutectic reaction.

40|$|Objective(s) : Graphene as {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{materials have}} attracted wide attention in different {{fields such as}} biomedical imaging. Ultra-small graphene nano-sheets (UGNSs) have been designated as low dimensional graphene sheets with lateral dimensions less than few nanometres (≤ 500 nm) in one, two or few layers. Several studies have proven that the process of acidic exfoliation and oxidation {{is one of the most}} effective methods to synthesize low dimensional graphene sheets. The band gap of graphene can be changed through changing the reaction temperature resulting in different photoluminescent colors. The aim of our study is synthesis of multi-color photoluminescent UGNSs for biomedical imaging. Materials and Methods: Two different UGNSs were synthesized from two different graphite sources via acidic treatment with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. The prepared UGNSs were characterized by UV-Vis, photoluminescent, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photoluminescence colors of the prepared UGNSs were detected under excitation wavelength of 470 nm using optical filters. Results: The results showed that the <b>graphite</b> <b>primary</b> source is a determinant factor in the synthesis of different UGNSs.

40|$|Absorbed dose {{to water}} {{calibrations}} of NE Technology Type 2561 chambers {{are carried out}} at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in both X-radiation from 4 - 19 MV and in " 6 " 0 Co #gamma#-radiation. Secondary standard ion chambers are calibrated against the <b>primary</b> standard <b>graphite</b> calorimeter by inserting these chambers at reference depths in a water phantom. The {{first part of this}} report describes the work which was undertaken in an attempt to reproduce the measured absorbed dose calibration factors for a secondary standard NE 2561 ion chamber for a range of NPL photon qualities under standard calibration conditions. This calculated data did not reproduce the observed variation in calibration factor with beam filtration in the measured results. However, had this data been reproducible, in particular at 4 and 6 MV, then the possible causes of the observed variation in the measured results such as effects on the calibration due to chamber components would have been investigated. By comparing calibration factors and depth dose curves for NPL X-ray beams with a simulated clinical quality the practical impact on clinical dosimetry of these observed differences will be looked at. The majority of this work was carried out using Monte Carlo techniques based on the EGS 4 code system. The simulations were validated in several ways. Firstly, comparisons of calculated and measured depth dose curves in water were made at energies from 4 - 19 MV and in " 6 " 0 Co #gamma#-radiation. Then, data calculated with codes used in this work was compared with data produced by more well tested and well-established codes. The final validation method involved calculating the air kerma calibration factor of a NE 2561 ion chamber in 2 MV X-rays and then comparing the calculated ratio of 2 MV air kerma calibration factor to " 6 " 0 Co absorbed dose calibration factor with the measured value. The calculated normalised absorbed dose to water calibrations were found to agree with measured values of k_Q, the ratio of absorbed dose calibration in quality Q to that in " 6 " 0 Co, to within 1. 0 % (which corresponds to 2 #sigma# in the total uncertainty). The observed discrepancies were primarily random in nature. However, {{it was not possible to}} distinguish between the results for light and heavy filtration. This could have been due to large uncertainties on the calculated absorbed dose to water calibrations or to an undetected problem in the calculations or measurements. It was therefore not possible at this stage to investigate the observed change in calibration factor with beam filtration. The calculated calibration factor for a 6 MV X-ray beam from a Varian 2100 C does, however, lie close to the NPL curve for heavily filtered beams (with a TPR_ 2 _ 0 _/_ 1 _ 0 and depth dose curve similar to that of a NPL 6 MV (H) photon quality). The calculated and measured ratio of 2 MV air kerma. calibration factor to " 6 " 0 Co absorbed dose calibration factor agreed within 0. 66 % (which corresponds to less than 2 #sigma# in the total random uncertainty).
