5|$|In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir had turned the <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|The British government's {{principal}} {{interest in}} Japan was to renew pre-war trade concessions, and to secure new ones; it was {{particularly interested in}} the <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Kobe.

Gairdner was nominally senior in rank to Robertson until March 1947, when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, backdated to January 1944. Robertson resisted Gairdner's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes.|$|E
