50|$|The Radomysl paper mill’s {{role was}} {{increased}} by metropolitan of Kyiv and Halych Peter Mohyla (1597-1647), who initiated {{reforms of the}} Orthodox education system in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. These reforms increased a demand {{for a lot of}} new books, not only religious ones, but also works on philosophy, dictionaries, historical chronicles, polemical books, works which studied nature etc. As a result, there was an increased demand for paper. Peter Mohyla invited German workers to Radomysl, who taught Lavra monks to work on new <b>paper-making</b> <b>machines.</b> Those Germans founded the German settlement which existed in Radomysl until the early 1930s.|$|R

50|$|Joshua Gilpin (1765 - 1840) was an American {{merchant}} and manufacturer who toured industrial Britain at {{the very}} end of the eighteenth century. On his return home (in 1801), he introduced to America the technique of chemically bleaching paper-stuff in 1804 and following his second trip, 1811-1815, his brother, Thomas Gilpin, jr, manufactured in 1817 the first <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> in America.|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} report, {{the method of}} calculating the fatigue strength of plastic gears using strain energy was proposed; however, the conditions only extended to gear life in the ordinary-temperature environment.

5000|$|In 1811, Gilpin and {{his family}} {{returned}} to England, where they became trapped by the War of 1812 and had to remain until it was over. They lived in Yealand Conyers, Lancashire, and Gilpin {{was able to get}} more information about new methods, this time the cylinder-mould <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine,</b> developed by John Dickinson.

50|$|At {{about the}} same time, Friedrich Voith decided to begin working on water-driven turbines, and in 1870, the first Voith turbine was delivered. In 1873, the first Francis turbine was produced, {{and in the same}} year Friedrich Voith was awarded a Medal of Achievement for his {{innovations}} at the World Fair in Vienna. Thereafter, Voith decided to move beyond the production of individual components for paper machines. In 1881, he built a new machining plant, the Maschinenfabrik J. M. Voith, and he delivered the first complete <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> to his customer Raitelhuber, Bezner & Cie. in Gemmrigheim, Germany.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the end of}} the 18th century Sealy and {{his brother}} were {{approached}} by John Gamble and Leger Didot, who were seeking financial support to develop an automatic paper making machine developed in Paris by Louis-Nicolas Robert, an employee of Didot. In 1801-02 the Fourdriniers entrusted engineer Bryan Donkin (then working with John Hall) with the development of Robert’s model into a prototype continuous <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine.</b> The world's first production machine was installed at Frogmore Mill in Apsley, Hertfordshire in 1803 and a second, much improved and larger machine installed the following year. By 1810 eighteen machines had been installed at various mills.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, Hannes Voith and Hugo Rupf {{served as}} Executive Board Chairman. The company's first post-war {{delivery}} was a Voith turbine for Norway in 1947. In 1949, eight Voith Schneider Propellers {{went to the}} United Africa Company, 46 Voith turbo-transmissions were shipped to Brazil, and in 1951, a new <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> was delivered to the Netherlands. At the same time, Voith released its new triple-converter transmission for motorised railcars, and its DIWA bus transmissions. In 1953, Voith produced Europe's fastest newsprint paper machine for the Feldmühle AG: running at speeds of 600 metres/min, and producing up to 200 tons of newsprint each day. At the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Voith was awarded a gold medal for developing the first turbo-transmission for the diesel-hydraulic locomotives of the Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Railways).|$|E
50|$|In 1801-2 Donkin was {{entrusted}} {{with the construction}} of a prototype of a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine,</b> the famous Fourdrinier machine, the perfection of which had caused some considerable problems. Donkin took premises at Bermondsey, London in 1802, thus starting the enterprise that became the Bryan Donkin Company, which still continues in business in the early 21st century. In 1804 he succeeded in producing a working machine. A second, improved one, was made the following year and in 1810 eighteen of the complex machines had been erected at various mills. Although the original design was not Donkin's, he received the credit for having perfected them and brought them into use. His company continued to make such machines, and by 1851 had produced nearly 200 machines for use across the world.|$|E
50|$|Yet, paper {{problems}} still {{plagued the}} publishers; paper was very expensive to haul from California or the East, and attempts at making {{paper in the}} valley were still, for the most part, futile. In 1860 a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> had been purchased, and set-up in the Deseret Manufacturing Company sugar house factory, but lack of available materials meant a lack of paper. As a result, Brigham Young called George Goddard on a rag-gathering mission. Goddard traveled through the territory collecting rags that would then be turned into paper, {{and was able to}} supply enough to keep the News in production. Other problems such as ice and drought on the stream, running out of Parley's Canyon, that ran the paper mill caused the paper to have short lapses in publication.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Johann Matthäus Voith {{transferred}} {{control of}} the company to his son Friedrich, which had 30 employees. In that same year, Friedrich Voith officially registered the company in the local trading register for the first time under the name: Maschinenfabrik (Engineering Works) J. M. Voith. In 1869, Voith received his first patent for a wood grinder. This wood grinder was a major step forward for paper mills: allowing them to use economical, renewable cellulose-fiber, while improving paper quality, and setting the cornerstone for modern newspaper publishing. In 1881, Voith delivered the first complete <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> to Raithelhuber, Bezner & Cie in Gemmrigheim, Germany. Voith's invention had opened an entirely new market, and a surge in new orders helped his company to rapidly expand. By the mid-1890s, Voith machines were available for every stage of the paper-making process.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{version of}} plywood {{was invented in}} the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, {{produced}} the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use {{in a wide variety}} of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships. The pulp and paper industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp & Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.|$|E

50|$|Bramah {{was a very}} {{prolific}} inventor, {{though not}} all of his inventions were as important as his hydraulic press. They included: a beer engine (1797), a planing machine (1802), a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> (1805), a machine for automatically printing bank notes with sequential serial numbers (1806), and a fountain pen (1809). He also patented the first extrusion process for making lead pipes and also machinery for making gun stocks (Patent No. 2652).His greatest contribution to engineering was his insistence on quality control. He realised that for engines to succeed, {{they would have to}} be machined to a much better standard than was the practice. He taught Arthur Woolf to machine engines to a close tolerance. This enabled Cornish engines to run with high-pressure steam, vastly increasing their output. Woolf became the leading Cornish steam engineer and his designs were adopted by all the engine designers of the day. The 15-HP engines of Watt and others of circa 1800 gave way to 450-HP engines by 1835. Bramah {{can be viewed as a}} founding father in industrial quality control.|$|E

40|$|Paper is {{a complex}} {{structure}} of composite biological fibers. The behavior of paper is time-dependent with respect to load, moisture content, or temperature, whether these control parameters are fixed or varied in combination. A key {{question is whether the}} time-dependent properties are a consequence of the fiber micro-structure, the interfiber bond, the fiber distribution in a sheet, or a combination of these. Hypotheses for the physical mechanisms responsible for stress-strain relations observed under constant, monotonic, and cyclic loading and, especially, for the role of moisture bonding in the time-dependent behavior are compared. The moisture accelerated creep phenomenon, due to varying ambient relative humidity, is an important time-dependent behavior which creates practical problems such as the wall collapse of stacked cartons in warehouses with non-constant humidity and control of the <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine.</b> For each type of loading and ambient control variation, after a discussion of possible physical mechanisms inducing the observed response, the mathematical models proposed in the literature are reviewed as tools for the design of both the paper-making process and applications...|$|E
