40|$|Although {{phytoplankton}} blooms {{are major}} events in aquatic systems, {{the importance of}} benthic resting stages in seeding planktonic blooms is still unclear. Using microcosms, we tested the influence of benthic versus planktonic inocula on the development and taxonomic composition of diatom communities in a temperate fjord. Experiments in early spring 2002, fall 2002, and late spring 2003 showed that the type and quantity of inoculum influenced bloom development and composition. Species composition was vastly different when seeded by cells from the benthos. Species such as Detonula confervacea and Thalassiosira minima showed strong dependence on benthic propagules. Populations of Chaetoceros debilis and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii were initiated by both benthic and planktonic cells, and benthic seeding was most successful when experiments were preceded by a <b>planktonic</b> <b>bloom.</b> Skeletonema costatum was abundant in all treatments but showed variations in size, {{depending on the type}} of inoculum. Species that do not have a resting stage, such as Pseudo-nitzschia spp., were present only in plankton-treated microcosms. Seasonal factors were especially important in determining the successful growth of newly seeded populations. Our results indicate that benthic resting stages provide an important source for some species. Because the introduction of benthic resting stages to surface waters can greatly influence species composition of the plankton, it is important that studies of plankton blooms include life-history stages from both the sediments an...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the formation of the potent neurotoxic methylmercury is needed to explain the large observed variability in methylmercury levels in aquatic systems. While it is known that organic matter interacts strongly with mercury, the role of organic matter composition in the formation of methylmercury in aquatic systems remains poorly understood. Here we show that phytoplankton-derived organic compounds enhance mercury methylation rates in boreal lake sediments through an overall increase of bacterial activity. Accordingly, in situ mercury methylation defines methylmercury levels in lake sediments strongly influenced by <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms.</b> In contrast, sediments dominated by terrigenous organic matter inputs have far lower methylation rates but higher concentrations of methylmercury, suggesting that methylmercury was formed in the catchment and imported into lakes. Our findings demonstrate that the origin and molecular composition of organic matter are critical parameters to understand and predict methylmercury formation and accumulation in boreal lake sediments...|$|R

An early and very marked bloom occurred in 2007, compared to a later and less abundant development in 2008. These distinct patterns in bloom timing corresponded with very different hydroclimatic scenarios in 2007 (hot spring and relatively cold summer) and 2008 (standard year compared to the median year profile estimated with data from 1995 to 2008). No clear impacts of summer seawater temperature, rainfall or nutrient concentrations were evident. Strong wind may favor the dispersal of benthic and planktonic cells.

In 2011, diel in-situ monitoring in monospecific blooms of this species revealed previously undetected negative impacts on endangered species habitat availability associated with conditions of low flow levels, recorded at the U. S. Geological Survey gage # 08169000 on Texas Commission on Environmental Quality river segment 1811 station 12655. During a period of low springflow {{in the summer of}} 2011, late afternoon and early morning measurements of dissolved oxygen and temperature and presence of dinoflagellate blooms were monitored at six sites. Significant differences in diel fluctuations were found in all of these parameters among sites with and without the planktonic blooms. These fluctuations increased risk of hypoxia and hyperthermia conditions at sites of <b>planktonic</b> <b>bloom</b> events. Arrays of in-situ continuous monitoring temperature/light probes were used inside and outside of blooms. Wildlife and human health implications are that hypoxia and hyperthermia are known to promote conditions favorable to harmful microbes which may be transported from springs to coastal bays.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the sea {{adjacent}} to a major MSF plant where a new 24 MGD SWRO plant is being commissioned. Data were collected on the topographical feature of the marine basin, water quality and plankton of the intake zone. The incidents of <b>planktonic</b> <b>bloom,</b> influx of invasive organisms like jellyfish and macrofouling organisms and ingress of marine algae were monitored regularly. The Intake Bay of the plant is a well designed man-made structure studded to the coast. The marine basin in Al-Jubail, is for geological reasons, a shallow gently sloping shelf while the bay proper is a dredged, deeper basin. The area outside the bay is a vast sea grass bed and the seafloor sediment is sandy. The drag of sea water maintained by the intake pumps facilitates the transport of sediment particles, uprooted algae and floating objects creating fouling problems inside the plant. Seawater temperatures, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and trace metals were found to be very much benign to the trouble free operation of the plant. Influx of jellyfish, noticed during the summer, was not found to be very severe. Data on plankton showed the presence of many phyto and zooplankton organism of biofouling potential in the plant. Total suspended solids indicated the possibility of the intake bay becoming a source of elevated Silt Density Index (SDI) for the new SWRO plant.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of major components (Fe, Ca, K, and organic carbon) and trace elements was analyzed in surface sediments and core {{samples from the}} Colorado River delta (CRD) and the Upper Gulf of California (UGC) using instrumental neutron activation analysis. The spatial distribution patterns of the elements studied {{are consistent with the}} model of sedimentary dynamics proposed for this area [Mar. Geol. 158 (1999) 125]: intense tidal resuspension of sediments in the delta with subsequent transport of suspended particulate matter in a southerly direction, followed by sedimentation of fine-grained material in a depocenter near the southwestern margin of the UGC. Concentrations of most of the elements are higher in the surface sediments of this depocenter. The gradual mixing of terrigenous and marine biogenic materials, normally expected for the estuarine sediments, was not detected in the CRD-UGC system because of homogenization of the sediments by tides and wind. Vertical profiles of element contents in samples of the sediment core collected in the depocenter area revealed (i) almost no anthropogenic contamination of the area by environmentally important trace elements such as Cr, Co, Sb, and As; (ii) a twofold decrease of Fe, Sc, Cr, and Co in upper core sediments; and (iii) the enrichment of the sediments at 60 - 62 cm depth in the core, in calcium carbonate, Ca, Sr, and the Eun/Smn shale-normalized ratio along with a depletion in this layer of Fe, Sc, Cr, Co, light rare-earth elements (REEs), and some other elements of terrigenous origin, presumably caused by the dilution of fluvial terrigenous material by biogenic carbonates, which were probably introduced at this level in the sediments by the action of a strong episodic winter storm, followed by the advective transport of shell fragments from the coastal clam banks or as a result of strong <b>planktonic</b> <b>bloom...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many diatom {{species have}} the ability to form benthic resting stages, but the {{importance}} of these stages as a supply for <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms</b> is uncertain. A mesocosm study was carried out in December 2005 to January 2006 in Mangalore, India. Mesocosms were inoculated with various combinations of benthic and/or planktonic cells, sampled from the coastal SE Arabian Sea, and the development of the planktonic community was followed. Diatoms dominated the phytoplankton community in all mesocosms, irrespective of inoculum. The most significant differences among inoculum types were altered species composition, and the timings of the maximum cell abundances, which lagged behind in the sediment mesocosms. Populations of Thalassiosira were initiated by both plankton and benthic propagules. Taxa known from temperate coastal areas to seed bloom by benthic propagules, such as Chaetoceros and Skeletonema, were predominantly seeded by planktonic cells in this experiment; this implies differential seeding strategy within the same species at different latitudes. The species assemblage encountered in the plankton and sediment was similar, which indicates that the benthic resting stages seed an autochthonous phytoplankton flora in the area. High species diversity in all inoculated mesocosms was maintained throughout the experimental period, although the actual number of species was fewer at the end. The hydrographic conditions and timing of formation, survival, and germination of diatom resting stages in SE Arabian Sea are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicrocystis colonies {{are known}} to overwinter {{on the surface of}} the {{sediment}} of freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known about the genotypic and toxicological dynamics of Microcystis populations during this benthic life stage. In this study, we report a two-year-long survey of benthic populations of Microcystis, which had spent from a few days to more than six years in the sediment. In order to avoid any interaction with the planktonic proliferations, we chose two deeply buried benthic populations, which could be easily dated. Quantitative PCR on mcyB gene and protein phosphatase inhibition assays were performed to measure their toxic potential, and their genotypic structure was assessed by Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (CE-SSCP), based on 16 S- 23 S Intergenic Transcribed Spacer (ITS). The microcystin content of the cells seemed to change sharply during the first few months of benthic survival, whereas this content was low and decreased steadily after several years of benthic life. No genetic selection was observed in either the proportion of potentially toxic clones or the ITS sequences for any of the populations considered. From these results, the benthic life stage of Microcystis appears to preserve the structure and the composition of the population over a far larger time scale than classical overwintering period. Finally, some genotypes were common in both of the benthic populations, even though they originated from <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms</b> that had developed five years apart, suggesting a major overlap of planktonic proliferations in successive years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{survey of}} the {{potentially}} harmful epiphytic microalgae {{along the coast of}} Alexandria was initiated since 2005 following an incident of mass mortality of the bottom feeding fish, Siganus rivulatus in the Eastern Harbour of Alexandria. S. rivulatus is known to feed on macroalgae specially Ulva sp. A total number of 132 samples were collected seasonally along Alexandria coast, from spring 2005 to summer 2010. Six cyanobacteria species are recorded; Oscillatoria acutissima, Oscillatoria nigroviridis, Oscillatoria limosa, Oscillatoria sp., Lyngbya sp. and Planktothrix c. f. agardhii. The causative organism responsible for the massive fish mortality is O. acutissima; with a standing crop reaching 1. 07 × 106 filamentsg− 1 wetwt. The qualitative observations showed that Oscillatoria spp. seem to prefer green macroalgae as host to red and brown algae. The correlation between O. acutissima, O. nigroviridis and Ulva spp. showed to be significant (p= 0. 002). While, no significant correlation was found between the other four species and the macroalgal species tested. The two species O. acutissima and O. nigroviridis as a result, were perennial and widespread during the present study. In the Egyptian coastal waters earlier dramatic events of harmful algae occurred on several occasions due to <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms</b> of dinoflagellates.

40|$|Gill {{diseases}} are common, especially in intensively reared fish; they result in respiratory distress, {{as well as}} impaired osmoregulation and excretion (1). Bacteria and parasites are common causes of gill disease, as is poor water quality, including <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms.</b> Swarms or blooms of jellyfish are increasingly and especially problematical (2), and can result in high mortality of farmed fish. Small species of jellyfish such as Philalella quadrata (13 mm diameter) are capable of passing through the mesh of sea-cages and of being sucked {{into the mouth of}} fish during respiration. Here we show that the initial damage to gills of farmed Atlantic salmon, likely produced by nematocyst-derived toxins from the jellyfish, was compounded by secondary bacterial infection with Tenacibaculum maritimum. We also demonstrate that these filamentous bacteria were present on the mouth of the jellyfish and that their DNA sequences were almost identical to those of bacteria present on the salmon gills. This suggests that the bacterial lesions were not the result of an opportunistic infection of damaged tissue as previously thought. Instead, P. quadrata is probably acting as a vector for this particular bacterial pathogen, and {{it is the first time}} that evidence to support such a link has been presented. We could find no prior literature describing the presence of bacteria associated with jellyfish, other than some studies about their decay. We do not know if all jellyfish of this and other species carry similar bacteria in a symbiotic relationship, nor do we know their source, the role that they play under other circumstances, or indeed whether the jellyfish were themselves diseased. The high proteolytic capabilities of T. maritimum mean that partially digested gill tissues were readily available to the jellyfish, which rely heavily on intracellular digestion for their nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Upper Paleocene (zone CP 8 b) cyclic {{sediment}} from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1051 on Blake Nose, western North Atlantic, alternates {{from white}} carbonate-rich to green carbonate-poor {{in response to}} precessional forcing. Compositional {{differences between the two}} bed types are minor: mineral and nannofossil composition of the beds vary subtly, but grain size of the terrigenous component and biogenic silica content remain constant. Iron content determined by sediment magnetic susceptibility and iron intensity determined by a core-scanning XRF correlates negatively with carbonate content and are higher in green beds. Kaolinite content of green beds is slightly higher as well. Green beds exhibit lower evenness values than white beds for nannofossil assemblages and are more dominated by the species Coccolithus. Dominance by Coccolithus indicates more mesotrophic conditions over Blake Nose during deposition of the green beds, which correlates with slightly higher iron and kaolinite contents. The absence of change in terrigenous grain size and the absence of any indication of <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms</b> indicate that there was a minor, most likely eolian, input of iron and kaolinite during deposition of the green beds. The source area was most likely northwest Africa, which supplied iron and kaolinite when source areas deflated under drier conditions. With this scenario, kaolinite is an indicator of drier climate and source area erosion, rather than the warmer and/or wetter conditions under which it forms in soils. During precessional minima or perihelion summer (the opposite of our current configuration), there was an increased range of seasonal temperatures and an increase in the intensity of summer and winter monsoon circulation. As a consequence, there was more rainfall in northern Africa and drier conditions in the continental interiors at mid-latitudes. Green bed deposition occurred during precessional maxima when the North Atlantic was cooler, northwest Africa drier, and the eolian flux to the western North Atlantic slightly increased...|$|R

30|$|Aeolian sand {{is mainly}} {{deposited}} on the lakeshore and in deserts. The sand dam on the lakeshore exhibits relatively low maturity, moderately poor sorting and roundness, and strong inheritance of provenance. In contrast, aeolian {{sand in the}} desert forms relatively thick layers and exhibits higher quartz content, high maturity and roundness and is well sorted. Based on the evidence listed, this paper infers that aeolian sands of the Qigequan Formation were deposited under aqueous conditions. Regional aeolian sediments are controlled by dynamic interactions between glacial, ice-margin fluvial, aeolian and volcaniclastic processes {{under the influence of}} a distinctive climatic regime (Mountney and Russell 2004). Aeolian landforms serve as a long-term integrator {{of the effects of the}} strongest wind regimes in a region (Koster 1988). According to the research results, it is speculated that there are mainly two reasons for the formation of aqueously deposited aeolian sandstones in the Quaternary. (1) Pollen data indicates that the Qaidam Basin experienced relatively humid conditions during the Oligocene. The ancient Qaidam Lake gradually formed in the west of basin, which lay at a relatively low elevation at the time. Two episodes of Himalayan tectonic movement uplifted the Qaidam Basin and cut the basin off from ancient sedimentary source areas. Climatic evolution caused the lake to contract and become saline. In the Quaternary, widespread glacial intervals imply low-temperature climate conditions. The nearby Kunlun Mountains and Qilian Mountains host middle to early Pleistocene glacial features and the freshwater-less saline fossils typified by the ostracod Qinghaicypris crassa (2.34 – 2.52  Ma), indicating that the Qaidam Basin experienced low temperature conditions during the Quaternary. The uplift of the Himalayas and the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau also blocked humid air travelling from the Indian Ocean to the basin (Harris 2006; Boos and Kuang 2010; Molnar et al. 2010). Abundant nutrients contributed to <b>planktonic</b> <b>blooms</b> and associated organic carbon accumulation (Zachos and Kump 2005). Draw down of carbon dioxide contributed to climate change in the Qaidam Basin, which provides the direct conditions for the aeolian sandstones. (2) In the early Oligocene, an ancient lake gradually formed in the western Qaidam Basin due to the warm climate. However, neo-tectonic movements led to the uplift and subsidence of the basin, and the ancient Qaidam Lake was segmented into two parts with one depocentre migrating from west to east. During the Quaternary, lacustrine sediments accumulated mostly in the Sanhu area. An extensive, semi-deep lacustrine depocentre formed in the Taijinar and Dabsan Lake regions. The present-day lake margin has also inherited layout and other sedimentary features from the early Pleistocene lake, including a northerly lakeshore primarily dominated by mud deposition and marshlands, and a southerly margin dominated by sand deposition. Uplifted sandy lacustrine deposits exposed over a large area provided ample sediment source for the observed aeolian deposits.|$|R

Heterocyst production is variable, and the responses of <b>planktonic</b> cyanobacterial <b>blooms</b> to N limitation differ markedly among systems. Temporal variations in cyanobacteria colony size may determine both heterocyst produc-tion and sensitivity to top-down control by zooplankton grazers. We promoted the development of cyanobacterial blooms through phosphorus additions and trophic manipulations in freshwater ponds, to test the role of colony size structure in regulating N-fixer bloom development. The in situ growth and heterocyst production of Anabaena spp. were strongly linked to variations in colonial filament size. Anabaena spp. initially recruited to the water column as short and poorly heterocysted filaments, exhibiting low (mean 5 0. 09 d 21) rates of population growth. The growth rate {{increased by more than}} fourfold (mean 5 0. 39 d 21) with the onset of colony elongation and heterocyst production, which resulted in rapid seasonal build-ups of cyanobacterial cells (. 105 cells ml 21). Size-dependent growth was also important in determining the outcome of zooplankton-cyanobacteria interactions. In microcosm experiments, zooplankton consumers directly grazed on Anabaena spp. colonies, reduced the mean filament size, and reduced the efficiency with which heterocysts fixed nitrogen.

Downward irradiance at 490 nm is used to calibrate chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and compute solar heating rates. Corrections for the diapycnal deviations provide a nearly continuous isopycnal time series of spice (a temperature and salinity combination nearly orthogonal to potential density) and chlorophyll. A new formulation of the diffusion equation in isopycnal coordinates is derived and used to test the accuracy of purely diapycnal mixing balances for spice and chlorophyll. On vertical scales of about 10 m and timescales of about 2 d, isopycnal spice variations are mostly controlled by diapycnal mixing, although other processes, presumably isopycnal mixing, are sometimes important. Processes other than diapycnal mixing control isopycnal chlorophyll variations on these scales. Likely candidates include isopycnal mixing with a nearby <b>bloom,</b> <b>planktonic</b> sinking out of this bloom, o...|$|R
