25|$|After being enlarged, Coldstream Mill {{was used}} for <b>preparing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> or meal, {{grinding}} linseed cake, beans, maize and barley. The mill had three sets of stones, two working whilst one was being dressed (serviced and sharpened). The mill never had an electricity supply and never needed any auxiliary power thanks to the mill pond. The mill was the last traditional working water mill in Ayrshire {{and one of the}} last in Scotland. Some of the items for the mill are on display at the nearby Dalgarven Mill museum near Kilwinning. The mill was converted to a private house and the waterwheel and mill pond have been preserved as part of this development.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{functions}} of rice straw {{can be used as}} ruminant feed requirements, rice straw potentially large enough {{to meet the needs of}} <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> despite relatively low-quality feed ingredients and high-fiber ballpark. Utilization of rice straw is very important to help farmers in the supply of <b>animal</b> <b>feed,</b> rice straw that has not been exploited farmers at harvest so that the straw is burned. Though rice straw at harvest could reach 10 - 15 tonnes per hectare, the results can be used as <b>animal</b> <b>feed.</b> While fodder in the dry season is very critical, farmers are very expensive to buy and look for <b>animal</b> <b>feed.</b> Through the feed processing technology is efficient, rice straw can be processed into highly nutritious feed. Rice straw can be given to ruminants in the form of fresh and processed straw. If straw is used as <b>animal</b> <b>feed,</b> the hay should be cut into pieces for further processing. To perform the cutting hay farmers still use the manual way so that the level of efficiency of time and energy wasted, then redesigned hay thrasher with a capacity of 750 kg / hr. So it can be produced hay cut up to a certain size. With the hay thrasher is the more it will simplify and speed up a process for <b>preparing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recovery {{of water}} and soluble {{substances}} from soybean soaking water (SSW) was carried out using an integrated membrane system consisting of ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO). It was found that even using the four-stage UF-UF-RO-RO process with pH adjustment, the quality of RO permeate did not satisfy the emission standard, while the RO permeate from the two-stage UF-RO treatment could be reused for soybean soaking. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of RO permeate from this process was 1700 - 2800 mg/L including acetic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, lactic acid, alcohol, and other unidentified soybean extract with -Ca center dot O or -N-H groups, which had negligible effect on the subsequent soybean soaking. The RO permeate was reused for five cycles with addition of tap water (RO permeate/tap water = 1 : 1. 5), and the soaked soybeans were used for Koji making, which showed the similar properties with Koji made from soybeans soaked by tap water. Furthermore, the concentrates in the integrated UF-RO system provided a raw material for culturing algae or <b>preparing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>feed.</b> This work demonstrated that through UF-RO treatment, the wastewater pollution from food industry could be eliminated by resource recovery and utilization. </p...|$|R
25|$|According to the Talmud, the {{requirement}} to separate Challah from the dough was imposed on {{the owner of the}} dough, not on the person who kneaded it; hence if the owner was not Jewish, even if the kneader was, Hafrashat Challah was not mandatory. The requirement does not apply to quantities of less than one omer, neither to bread <b>prepared</b> as <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> nor to dough prepared from a flour derived from other cereal grains, excepting wheat, barley, oat (var. goatgrass), spelt, or rye (var. wild barley), which grains are obligated. Although the Biblical expression when you eat of the bread of the land might be understood as applying only to bread eaten in the Land of Israel, Rabbinic sources interpret that Hafrashat Challah should be observed in the Diaspora as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis for this}} study is the proposition that certain measurable attributes of market structure are strategic variables determining competitive behavior in farm supply retailing and the performance of price as a guide to optimum use of marketing resources. The immediate practical problem is to discover opportunities to better coordinate the decision of sellers (retail firms) and buyers (farmers) of commercial fertilizer, <b>prepared</b> <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> and petroleum products to more nearly achieve optimum efficiency in retailing and the equitable treatment of large and small farmers. Empirical data are obtained from participants on both sides of key farm supply markets, from a sample of 190 Nebraska farmers stratified by size of farm, and from samples of 119 retail firms located in one-fourth to one-half of the estimated 100 - 135 farm supply markets in Nebraska. One of the major findings {{of this study is that}} in farm supply markets with few sellers and many buyers, uniform or flat prices generally prevail. The findings suggest that most farmers are not free to choose between a pricing system that encourages small volume buying at higher costs, or one in which economic incentives encourage larger volume buying at lower costs. For this reason it is misleading to infer from the widespread practice of uniform pricing that farmers are willing to pay prices which cover the added costs of these practices in retailing in order to conduct farming operations with a minimum of on-farm storage facilities and inventory capital, or in order to realize a degree of plurality in brand and dealer preference. Most farmers have no choice. Advisor: Richard G. Wals...|$|R

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>feed</b> {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of the food safety chain in the “farm-to-fork ” model. The emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has raised awareness of the importance of contaminated <b>animal</b> <b>feed,</b> but less attention has been paid to the role of bacterial contamination of <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> in human foodborne illness. In the United States, <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> is frequently contaminated with non-Typhi serotypes of Salmonella enterica and may lead to infection or colonization of food animals. These bacteria can contaminate animal carcasses at slaughter or cross-contaminate other food items, leading to human illness. Although tracing contamination to its ultimate source is difficult, several large outbreaks have been traced back to contam-inated <b>animal</b> <b>feed.</b> Improvements in the safety of <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> should include strengthening the surveillance of <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> for bacterial contamination and integration of such surveillance with human foodborne disease surveillance systems. A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point program should be instituted for the <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> industry, and a Salmonella-negative policy for feed should be enforced. Bacterial enteric pathogens are estimated to cause ∼ 5 million illnesses, 46, 000 hospitalizations, and 1458 deaths in the United States each year [1].

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Animal</b> <b>feeding</b> {{practices}} in the United States have changed considerably over the past century. As large-scale, concentrated production methods have become the predominant model for <b>animal</b> husbandry, <b>animal</b> <b>feeds</b> have been modified to include ingredients ranging from rendered animals and animal waste to antibiotics and organoarsenicals. In this article we review current U.

DATA SOURCES: We reviewed published veterinary and human-health literature regarding <b>animal</b> <b>feeding</b> practices, etiologic agents present in feed, and human health effects along with proceedings from <b>animal</b> <b>feed</b> workshops.
