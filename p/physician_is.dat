40|$|This study {{examines}} whether female emergency <b>physicians</b> <b>are</b> {{less likely than}} male emergency <b>physicians</b> to <b>be</b> recognized by patients as physicians. A convenience sample of adult patients seen while a trained observer was on duty in an academic Emergency Department constituted the study population. After the first physician contact, the observer asked the patient if a physician had seen the patient yet. The observer recorded the physician's sex, the patient’s response, sex, age, and race. The frequencies that male and female <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> recognized as <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> compared. For the 184 physician-patient contacts evaluated, 98 / 105 (93. 3 %) of males <b>were</b> recognized as <b>physicians</b> and 62 / 79 (78. 5 %) of females <b>were</b> recognized as <b>physicians.</b> Females <b>were</b> significantly less likely than males to <b>be</b> recognized as <b>physicians</b> (chi-square, p = 0. 003).

The Women Physicians' Health Study is the first large, national study of US women physicians, comprising a random sample (n = 4, 501 respondents) of women physicians aged 30 to 70. Data from the Women Physicians' Health Study showed that African-American and Latina or Hispanic <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> underrepresented, and Asian-American and foreign-born <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> overrepresented in proportion to their prevalence in the US female population. Women <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> {{more likely to be}} married and less likely to have never married and less likely to have never married or to be divorced or widowed than other US women. Younger <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> more likely to be residency trained and board-certified and to work more hours per week than older <b>physicians.</b> Younger <b>physicians</b> <b>were</b> also less likely to be in solo practice, government work, or inactive; they tended to be concentrated in group or hospital-based practices. We found that although US women physicians have some common characteristics that differentiate them from other US women, their practice and other characteristics vary substantially by age and specialty in ways that have not previously been reported. ...|$|R
