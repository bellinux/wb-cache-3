5|$|The {{traditional}} Mongolian {{script was}} adapted from Uyghur script probably {{at the very beginning}} of the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a <b>preparatory</b> <b>phase,</b> the Mongolian Cyrillic script was declared mandatory by government decree. It has been argued that the 1941 introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.|$|E

40|$|Cytolkinesis ensures proper {{partitioning}} of the nucleocytoplasmic contents {{into two}} daughter cells. It {{has generally been}} thought that cytokinesis is accomplished differently in animals and plants because {{of the differences in}} the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phases,</b> into the centrosomal or acentrosomal nature of the process, {{the presence or absence of}} rigid cell walls, and on the basis of 'outside-in' or 'inside-out' mechanism. However, this long-standing paradigm needs further reevaluation based on new findings. Recent advances reveal that plant cells, similarly to animal cells, possess astral microtubuies that regulate the cell division plane. Furthermore, endocytosis has been found to be important for cytokinesis in animal and plant cells: vesicles containing endocytosed cargo provide material for the cell plate formation in plants and for closure of the midbody channel in animals. Thus, although the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phases</b> of the cell division process differ between plant and animal cells, the later phases show similarities. We unify these findings in a model that suggests a conserved mode of cytokinesis...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{establish}} whether the activation of plasminogen into plasmin is necessary either for the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phases</b> to bone resorption, involving the recruitment of osteoclast precursors, their migration toward mineralized surfaces, and their final differentiation, or for the subsequent osteoclastic resorption phase. Ca- 45 -labeled fetal (17 day) mouse metatarsals were cultured under conditions in which they pursue their modeling for a few days. In this model, the resorption phase, monitored by the release of Ca- 45 into the medium, is entirely dependent on the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phases</b> affecting osteoclast precursors. It was, as expected, stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D- 3 and inhibited by calcitonin. PTH also enhanced the activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (PA) in extracts of metatarsals but not that of urokinase (which is, however, the main PA present in the mouse fetal metatarsal culture model). The resorption processes were not dependent on the presence of plasminogen in the media, even when the rudiments were precultured with tranexamic acid to remove their endogenous plasminogen. Moreover, they were not influenced by inhibitors of plasmin, either the plasma inhibitors alpha(2) -antiplasmin, alpha(2) -macroglobulin, and alpha(1) -antitrypsin, or aprotinin, which was tested under a variety of conditions. Aprotinin also did not influence the resorption (loss of calcium and hydroxyproline) of 19 day fetal mouse calvariae cultured with PTH in a medium devoid of plasminogen. It is concluded that the various steps implicated in the bone resorption processes that occur in the metatarsals and in the calvariae culture models are not dependent on the activity of plasmin. The function of PAs in bone, however, could be exerted through direct proteolysis of extracellular proteins other than plasminogen or be mediated by a molecular structural domain distinct from their catalytic domain...|$|R
500|$|The Operation Flax attacks {{merged into}} the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phase</b> of the Sicilian Campaign as air attacks were also helping to erode air defences on the island. While Flax {{continued}} {{on a smaller}} scale, the emphasis was on fighter operations. On 10 April, Flax was renewed. Some 75 P-38s of the 1st Fighter Group intercepted 20 Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 and around six Macchi C.200s. The battle resulted in 10 transports and two Italian fighters being shot down. Later that morning, 27 P-38s of the 82nd Fighter Group were escorting 18 B-25s of the 310th Bomb Group over Cape Bon when 30 Ju 52s were spotted with two Bf 110s, two Ju 87s and just three Ju 88s with them. At first, 11 P-38s stayed with the B-25s acting as escort, but then the bombers joined in, flying past the transports and firing on them using their gunners. Around 15 Bf 109s were scrambled from Tunisia to help the transports and they destroyed one P-38 and damaged three more. However, the Germans had already suffered heavy losses. One P-38 pilot was killed when he flew into a Bf 110 and some B-25s were shot up. The Americans claimed 25 victories. The Germans lost 10 Ju 52s, one Ju 88, one Bf 109 and one Bf 110. Some Ju 52s managed to ditch and their crews survived. A Spitfire patrol later shot down four more Ju 52s. It is likely the Bf 110s [...] "spotted" [...] in the formation were actually Me 210s from Zerstörergeschwader 1.

The abscission-inhibiting effect of auxin in interpretable as a retardation of pulvinar senescence.

During the attack the Japanese took several casualties to booby traps and trip wires that had been set up in front the Australian position and from heavy small arms fire, but they succeeded in pushing the Australians back slightly to the south. Meanwhile, the II Battalion attempted a flanking move to the west, where they came up against the 2/31st Infantry Battalion, which was occupying a position on the flank that the Japanese had thought was unheld. Heavy casualties in the centre of the Australian line were inflicted by Japanese artillery, but the depleted [...] composite unit managed to check the Japanese advance in their sector throughout the day. The following day, 15 September, the other half of the III Battalion attempted to find the eastern flank of the Australian position, but found that the line was much longer than expected there also due to the earlier movement made by the 2/33rd during the <b>preparatory</b> <b>phase</b> of the battle. Nevertheless, the Japanese found a gap in the Allied line in between the 3rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/33rd, seizing an opportunity to rush an Australian Militia section that had forgotten to post a sentry whilst expanding its pits. Seizing a vital position that allowed them to fire down on the Australians from the east, the Japanese had succeeded in a gaining a significant vantage point, but they were unable to exploit it further after the 2/25th counter-attacked from its depth position. The 2/25th's counter-attack was turned back and failed to dislodge the Japanese on the right of the Australian line. The Japanese were subsequently able to dig-in there, although the III Battalion was unable to exploit their position any further, being caught in between the two Australian infantry battalions. A stalemate developed on the left which the Australians and Japanese each attempted to break by launching flanking attacks that were subsequently countered each time. The 2/33rd also attempted a counter-attack on the right to attack the Japanese detachment from behind but was unable to locate the Japanese in the thick vegetation.|$|E
