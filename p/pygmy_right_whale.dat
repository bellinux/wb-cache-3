5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s of bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right whale, and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{is easily}} {{confused}} with minke whales {{because of their}} similar characteristics, such as their small size, dark gray tops, light gray bottoms, and light eye-patches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> shares several {{characteristics}} {{with the}} right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, {{and they have a}} very distinctive jaw configuration.

5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale).</b> Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale),</b> and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (<b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale),</b> and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
50|$|Baleen whales {{belong to}} the {{monophyletic}} lineage of Mysticeti order. Mysticeti are large filter-feeding cetaceansthat also included of largest animals on earth {{as well as some}} of the mostcritically endangered. Based on morphology and molecular data, four extant family-level cladesare recognized within Mysticeti: Balaenidae (bowhead and <b>right</b> whales),Neobalaenidae (<b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales),</b> Eschirichtiidae (gray whales), andBalaenopteridae (rorquals). Phylogenetic relationships of themysticeti order remain unclear due to legal and logistical challenges. However, recent morphological analysis,support Balaenidae as a monophyletic group that is the sister group toNeobalaenidae.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of dead <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> indicates that it feeds on copepods and euphausiids. The social and mating structures are unknown. The whale is typically seen alone or in pairs, sometimes associated with other cetaceans (including dolphins, pilot whales, minke whales, and once a sei whale cow and calf). Occasionally larger groups are seen — in 2001 a group of 14 were seen at 46°S in the South Pacific about 450 km southeast of New Zealand, while in 1992 {{a group of about}} 80 individuals were seen 320 nmi km southwest of Cape Leeuwin and another group of over 100 individuals were sighted in June 2007 about 40 km southwest of Portland, Victoria.|$|R
40|$|At present, {{there are}} 15 species of baleen whales {{that belong to}} the {{monophyletic}} suborder Mysticeti. The family-level designations of Balaenidae (<b>right</b> and bowhead <b>whales)</b> and Neobalaenidae (<b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales)</b> are strongly supported and well resolved. However, family-level designations and inter-relationships among the remaining species and genera of Balaenopteridae (rorquals) and Eschrichtiidae (grey whales) are less well resolved. Taxonomic relationships vary between studies, reconstruction methods and marker types, despite strong morphological support for the placement of Eschrichtiidae as a sister group to the Balaenopteridae. This phylogenetic uncertainty appears to have originated from a rapid Miocene radiation of both families, which has resulted in incomplete sorting of genetic lineages and therefore conflicting phylogenetic signals among nuclear and mitochondrial loci. The earliest radiation of baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti) occurred in the Late Eocene. The fossil record of subsequent species diversifications has been strongly correlated with changes in fossil diatom diversity and isotopic oxygen levels over time...|$|R
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale),</b> Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
500|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (Caperea marginata), a {{much smaller}} whale of the Southern Hemisphere, was until {{recently}} considered {{a member of the}} Family Balaenidae. [...] However, they are not right whales at all, and their taxonomy is presently in doubt. [...] Most recent authors place this species into the monotypic Family Neobalaenidae, but a 2012 study suggests that it is instead the last living member of the Family Cetotheriidae, a family previously considered extinct.|$|E
500|$|Baleen whales {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> to the [...] and [...] blue whale, which is also the largest {{creature}} on earth. They are sexually dimorphic. Baleen whales can have streamlined or large bodies, depending on the feeding behavior, and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as flexible and agile as seals, baleen whales can swim very fast, with the fastest able to travel at [...] Baleen whales use their baleen plates to filter out food from the water by either lunge-feeding or skim-feeding. Baleen whales have fused neck vertebrae, and are unable to turn their head at all. Baleen whales have two blowholes. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.|$|E
500|$|The lunge-feeders are the rorquals. To feed, lunge-feeders {{expand the}} volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself; to do this, the mouth inflates to expand the mouth. The inflation of the mouth causes the throat pleats to expand, {{increasing the amount of}} water that the mouth can store. Just before they ram the baitball, the jaw swings open at almost a 90° angle and bends which lets in more water. To prevent stretching the mouth too far, rorquals have a sensory organ located {{in the middle of the}} jaw to regulate these functions. Then they must decelerate. This process takes a lot of mechanical work, and is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. The skim-feeders, are <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> gray <b>whales,</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> and sei whales (which also lunge feed). To feed, skim-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape. The [...] "skimming" [...] may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies. Gray whales feed primarily on the ocean's bottom, feeding on benthic creatures.|$|R
50|$|In {{repeated}} {{attempts in}} the 1960s and 1970s, narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A breeding pair of <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> were retained in a netted area. They were eventually released in South Africa. In 1971, SeaWorld captured a California gray whale calf in Mexico at Scammon's Lagoon. The calf, later named Gigi, {{was separated from}} her mother using a form of lasso attached to her flukes. Gigi was displayed at SeaWorld San Diego for a year. She was then released with a radio beacon affixed to her back; however, contact was lost after three weeks. Gigi was the first captive baleen whale. JJ, another gray whale calf, was kept at SeaWorld San Diego. JJ was an orphaned calf that beached itself in April 1997 and was transported two miles to SeaWorld. The 680 kg calf was a popular attraction and behaved normally, despite separation from his mother. A year later, the then 8,164.7 kg whale though smaller than average, was too big to keep in captivity, and was released on April 1, 1998. A captive Amazon river dolphin housed at Acuario de Valencia is the only trained river dolphin in captivity.|$|R
500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of <b>pygmy</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death.
