5|$|In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court {{held that}} the section 30's {{allocation}} of <b>peremptory</b> challenges controlled, rather than an 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no <b>peremptory</b> challenges in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five <b>peremptory</b> challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of <b>peremptory</b> challenges unchanged.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a <b>peremptory</b> challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the <b>peremptory</b> challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of <b>peremptory</b> challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of <b>peremptory</b> challenges.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a <b>peremptory</b> challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} <b>peremptory</b> challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of <b>peremptory</b> challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (<b>peremptory</b> challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|Section 30, {{with regard}} to <b>peremptory</b> challenges, was re-enacted and {{supplemented}} in 1865. Section 30, {{with regard to}} a defendant's failure to enter a plea, was extended from capital to all crimes by § 14 of the Crimes Act of 1825.|$|E
5|$|More of Rupert's cavalry {{arrived at}} York to gain {{touch with the}} garrison. With York {{definitely}} relieved, Newcastle sent Rupert a fulsome letter of welcome and congratulations. Rupert replied, not in person but through Goring, with a <b>peremptory</b> demand for Newcastle to march his forces to Rupert's assistance on the following morning.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense <b>peremptory</b> strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|Still in January, Martindale {{applied to}} the Supreme Court for mandamus, and the court issued an {{alternative}} mandamus (essentially, an order to show cause why <b>peremptory</b> mandamus should not issue) on March 6, 1845, which was served March 25. On April 19, the deadline was extended to the first Tuesday in June. Before the Supreme Court, Martindale was joined by New York Attorney General John Van Buren and opposed by A. Taber and J. L. Brown.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Marchant (1827), the Court held thateven {{though a}} trial court has the {{discretion}} to sever {{the trials of}} co-defendantsa defendant {{has no right to}} insist upon being tried alone. The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their <b>peremptory</b> challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of <b>peremptory</b> challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used <b>peremptory</b> {{challenges}} to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on bail while {{awaiting}} a third trial and apparently {{in a highly}} intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of <b>peremptory</b> challenges to again prevent the court from empaneling a jury. The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who {{was present at the}} proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, {{the heads}} of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, {{continued}} to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a <b>peremptory</b> order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He retorted with the claim that {{had it not been}} for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by now. When his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the east bank. As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.|$|E
5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the <b>peremptory</b> challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
25|$|The Crimes Act of 1790 gave 20 <b>peremptory</b> {{challenges}} to capital defendants and 35 to treason defendants. An 1840 statute provided that federal jury selection should follow state {{procedures in the}} absence of a more specific federal statute. In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court held that—with regard to <b>peremptory</b> challenges by prosecutors in capital and treason cases—the Crimes Act controlled, and thus prosecutors were to be given no <b>peremptory</b> challenges, even if they would have such challenges under the laws of the relevant state. Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five <b>peremptory</b> challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of <b>peremptory</b> challenges unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Hayes v. Missouri (1887) {{rejected}} {{an equal}} protection challenge to a statute {{that provided the}} prosecution 8 <b>peremptory</b> challenges in small towns and 15 in large cities.|$|E
25|$|The term Batson {{challenge}} {{describes an}} objection to opposing counsel's {{use of a}} <b>peremptory</b> challenge to exclude a juror from the jury pool based on criteria the courts have found disqualifying, as race was the sole rationale for exclusion in Batson.|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{principles}} of Batson applied retroactively to anyone convicted previously by juries whose racial composition was influenced by <b>peremptory</b> challenges not consistent with this opinion was for a time uncertain. In Allen v. Hardy (1986), the Court held {{that it did not}} apply retroactively to collateral review of final convictions. In Griffith v. Kentucky (1987), it decided it would apply it in cases on direct review.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend <b>peremptory</b> norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a <b>peremptory</b> norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E
25|$|Piracy is of note in {{international}} law as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation {{of the concept of}} universal jurisdiction. The crime of piracy is considered a breach of jus cogens, a conventional <b>peremptory</b> international norm that states must uphold. Those committing thefts on the high seas, inhibiting trade, and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to be hostis humani generis (enemies of humanity).|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that, {{at least since}} World War II, genocide has been illegal under customary international law as a <b>peremptory</b> norm, as well as under conventional international law. Acts of genocide are generally difficult to establish for prosecution, because a chain of accountability must be established. International criminal courts and tribunals function primarily because the states involved are incapable or unwilling to prosecute crimes of this magnitude themselves.|$|E
25|$|Bugliosi {{criticized the}} {{prosecution}} for trying the murder in Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica. During the jury selection process, the defense {{made it difficult}} for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, {{on the grounds that it}} is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred <b>peremptory</b> challenges to jurors based on race in People v. Wheeler, years before the U.S. Supreme Court would do so in Batson v. Kentucky).|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} {{of crimes against}} humanity forms {{part of the body}} of <b>peremptory</b> norms (jus cogens) that bind the entire international community as a matter of customary international law. Individuals who commit crimes against humanity in the DPRK may therefore be held responsible, even though the DPRK has not yet included crimes against humanity in its domestic criminal law and is not a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The fact that perpetrators of these crimes have acted on superior orders does not relieve them of criminal responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Others {{involved}} the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Bush v. Kentucky (1883) reversed convictions because of racial exclusion {{in the jury}} system. In Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Court upheld an adultery prohibition that punished inter-racial fornication more than same-race fornication. Pace was overruled by McLaughlin v. Florida (1964). Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) struck down a discretionary laundry permitting system that disadvantaged Asians. Hayes v. Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute authorizing the prosecution more <b>peremptory</b> challenges in large cities.|$|E
25|$|During jury selection, the {{prosecutors}} used <b>peremptory</b> strikes {{to remove all}} four black prospective jurors from the jury pool, resulting in an all-white jury. Foster challenged these strikes, arguing that they were racially motivated in violation of Batson v. Kentucky. The trial judge dismissed the challenge and empaneled the jury, which convicted Foster of the murder and sentenced him to death. After sentencing, Foster filed a motion {{for a new trial}} {{on the grounds that the}} jury selection violated the US Supreme Court's Batson decision. The trial court denied the motion, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary {{the civil}} war, which had thundered {{at the gates}} of Vienna, was brought to a close by Russian intervention. Prince Schwarzenberg assumed the {{government}} of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic. Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston's attack on Greece. When Lajos Kossuth, the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a <b>peremptory</b> vote of the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili {{says that}} the Security Council manifestly lacks the {{competence}} to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the <b>peremptory</b> prohibition {{of the use of}} force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.|$|E
25|$|At {{about this}} time, Bragg {{also made a}} <b>peremptory</b> order based on {{incomplete}} information. Impatient that his attack was not progressing to the left, he sent orders {{for all of his}} commands to advance at once. Maj. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart of Longstreet's wing received the command and immediately ordered his division forward without consulting with Longstreet. His brigades under Brig. Gens. Henry D. Clayton, John C. Brown, and William B. Bate attacked across the Poe field {{in the direction of the}} Union divisions of Brannan and Reynolds. Along with Brig. Gen. S. A. M. Wood's brigade of Cleburne's Division, Stewart's men disabled Brannan's right flank and pushed back Van Cleve's division in Brannan's rear, momentarily crossing the LaFayette Road. A Federal counterattack drove Stewart's Division back to its starting point.|$|E
25|$|James Kirkland Batson was an African American man {{convicted of}} {{burglary}} and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court {{by a jury}} composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal {{was based on the}} jury selection, or voir dire, phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During voir dire the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of <b>peremptory</b> challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.|$|E
25|$|The fallout was swift. Gardiner, Higgs and Russell {{resigned}} from Cabinet {{and issued a}} press statement giving {{their views on the}} situation, which cleared the usually pro-government censors because Higgs temporarily held the Defence portfolio, due to George Pearce's absence in Western Australia, so Hughes was unable to prevent its publication. The government was threatened with collapse, with four of the nine members of the First Hughes Ministry having quit. The publicity about Hughes' <b>peremptory</b> move and its consequences was a disaster, coming {{on the eve of the}} poll, and the veneer of a unified and strong government under Hughes was destroyed. Hughes, distraught and overwrought, called the Governor-General at midnight, saying he had no one else to talk to, and the two men in the wee-hours of the morning, with Lord Novar offering sympathy and support to his old colleague, but ultimately both understood that the cause was probably lost.|$|E
25|$|According to Michael Lynk, {{there are}} three schools of thought {{concerning}} the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved {{have suggested that the}} indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in <b>peremptory</b> norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.|$|E
500|$|Section 30 {{provided}} treason {{and capital}} defendants with <b>peremptory</b> challenges and provided for a {{plea of not guilty}} {{in the case}} that the defendant refused to enter a plea: ...|$|E
500|$|In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a {{violation}} of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use <b>peremptory</b> challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race. If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror's race (a process known as a [...] "Batson challenge"), trial courts will conduct a three-part analysis of the <b>peremptory</b> challenge in question: [...] "irst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a <b>peremptory</b> challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties’ submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination." [...] A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied. On appeal, a trial court's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed clear error. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor's explanation of the reasons for their use of <b>peremptory</b> challenges is [...] "entitled to 'great deference'".|$|E
500|$|... {{lower the}} number of peremptories to force {{attorneys}} to use them only on the most clearly biased jurors and severely curtail their ability to [...] "shape" [...] the jury with <b>peremptory</b> challenges.|$|E
500|$|Hector Ayala {{was charged}} with three counts of murder that {{allegedly}} occurred during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California in April 1985. During jury selection, the prosecution used <b>peremptory</b> challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service. Ayala, who was of Hispanic descent, filed a series of Batson challenges to contest the prosecution's use of <b>peremptory</b> challenges. The trial judge permitted the prosecution to explain {{the basis of their}} <b>peremptory</b> challenges in a closed hearing, outside the presence of Ayala's counsel, [...] "so as not to disclose trial strategy". The trial court ultimately concluded that the <b>peremptory</b> challenges were based on race-neutral criteria, and Ayala was convicted of the three counts of murder in August 1989. The jury returned a sentence of death for the three murder convictions, and the trial judge entered a judgment consistent with the jury's sentence. On direct appeal, the California Supreme Court upheld Ayala's conviction and sentence, noting that even if the trial judge committed an error when considering the defense's Batson challenges, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Ayala subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus, which was denied by a district court judge in 2006. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted Ayala's habeas petition in 2013, holding that Ayala was denied due process at trial and that the trial court's error was not harmless. In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling.|$|E
