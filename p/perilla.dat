The hydrophobicity and anti-adhesion characteristics were quantitatively measured meanwhile. Results showed that they all had non-smooth surface morphologies mounted with cilia and demonstrated favorable antiadhesion features. Folium <b>perillae</b> which showed hydrophilicity, had the surface compactly pieced together by jigsaw-like plates, with stomas embedded. On the other hand, corn husk showing hydrophilicity, had the surface appeared longitudinal undulated ripples with sags and crests, and had grains on secondary microscale...|$|R

25|$|Poppyseed oil {{has been}} used for {{painting}} for at least 1500 years—one of the oldest known oil paintings, found in caves of Afghanistan and dated to AD 650, was likely drawn using poppyseed oil. It is most often found in white paints, and as a varnish. Painters prepared poppyseed oil by hand until the late 19th century, when oil paints became available prepared in tubes. While poppyseed oil does not cause as much yellowish tinting of paints as linseed oil, it dries slower and is less durable than linseed oil because the fat responsible for the yellowing also provides durability. <b>Perilla</b> oil, which causes yellow tinting even more than linseed, is even more durable than linseed.|$|E

500|$|Zhang's long lyrical poems also {{revealed}} {{a great amount}} of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody [...] "Sir Based-On-Nothing" [...] provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of Chang'an, the Western Han capital. Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, <b>perilla,</b> evodia, and purple ginger. Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400li (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8m, or 1,364ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320m, or 545,600ft). Along with Sima Xiangru (179–117BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from: northern or southern China. Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of [...] along Chang'an's Kunming Lake. The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization. In his poem [...] "Xijing fu", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism, introduced via the Silk Road, as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDental caries is {{considered}} to be a preventable disease, and various antimicrobial agents have been developed for the prevention of dental diseases; however, many bacteria show resistance to existing agents. In this study, 14 medicinal herbs were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against five common oral bacteria as a screen for potential candidates for the development of natural antibiotics. MethodsAqueous extracts of medicinal herbs were tested for activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. A broth microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). A disk diffusion assay was performed by inoculating bacterial cultures on BHI agar plates with paper disks soaked in each of the medicinal herb extracts. Inhibition of the synthesis of water-insoluble glucans by S. mutans was also investigated. ResultsThe aqueous extracts of many of the 14 medicinal herbs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the five types of pathogenic oral bacteria. The extracts of Sappan Lignum, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Psoraleae Semen effectively inhibited the growth of oral bacteria and showed distinct bactericidal activity. The extracts of Notoginseng Radix, <b>Perillae</b> Herba, and Psoraleae Semen decreased the synthesis of water-insoluble glucans by the S. mutans enzyme glucosyltransferase (GTase). The present study is the first to confirm the antimicrobial activity of the extract of Sappan Lignum against all five species of oral bacteria strains. ConclusionThese results suggest that certain herbal medicines with proven antimicrobial effects, such as Sappan Lignum and Psoraleae Semen, may be useful for the treatment of dental diseases...|$|R

The mice in the OVA-Needle-Prink(NP) group were treated with single prick with an injection needle at ST 36 for the later 8 weeks(3 times a weeks). Results : 1. The lung weight of the mice treated with PF-HA at St 36 were decreased significantly compared with that of the control group. 2. The total leukocytes and eosinophils in BALF of the group treated with PF-HA were decreased significantly compared with those of the control group. 3.
