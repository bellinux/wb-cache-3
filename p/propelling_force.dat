25|$|New York based Machito's Afro-Cubans was {{the first}} band to make the triumvirate of congas, bongo, and timbales the {{standard}} battery of percussion in Cuban-based dance music. The three drums are used together in most salsa bands and function in ways similar to a traditional folkloric drum ensemble. The timbales play the bell pattern, the congas play the supportive drum part, and the bongos improvise, simulating a lead drum. The improvised variations of the bongos are executed {{within the context of}} a repetitive marcha, known as the martillo ('hammer'), and do not constitute a solo. The bongos play primarily during the verses and the piano solos. When the song transitions into the montuno section, the bongo player picks up a large hand held cowbell called the bongo bell. Often the bongocero plays the bell more during a piece, than the actual bongos. The interlocking counterpoint of the timbale bell and bongo bell provides a <b>propelling</b> <b>force</b> during the montuno. The maracas and guíro sound a steady flow of regular pulses (subdivisions) and are ordinarily clave-neutral.|$|E

50|$|Cable jetting is {{the process}} of blowing a cable through a duct while {{simultaneously}} pushing the cable into the duct. Compressed air is injected at the duct inlet and flows through the duct and along the cable at high speed. (Preferably, no suction pig is used at the cable head.) The high speed air propels the cable due to drag forces and pressure drop. The friction of the cable against the duct is reduced by the distributed airflow, and large forces that would generate high friction are avoided. Because of the expanding airflow, the air <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> are relatively small at the cable inlet and large at the air exhaust end of the duct. To compensate for this, an additional pushing force is applied to the cable by the jetting equipment. The pushing force, acting mainly near the cable inlet, combined with the airflow <b>propelling</b> <b>forces,</b> increases the maximum jetting distance considerably. Special lubricants have been developed for cable jetting to further reduce friction.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of gauge widening is usually gradual and relatively slow, {{but if it}} is undetected, the final failure often takes place under the effect of some additional factor, such as excess speed, poorly maintained running gear on a vehicle, misalignment of rails, and extreme traction effects (such as high <b>propelling</b> <b>forces).</b> The crabbing effect referred to above is more marked in dry conditions, when the coefficient of friction at the wheel to rail interface is high.|$|R

Inspired of the flexible shape and motion of undulating fin of “Nilotic Ghost ” fish, a Hydraulic-driven Bionic Undulating Robot (HBUR) is developed and {{studied in the}} paper based on CFD method, to investigate the flexible characteristics of shape adaptation and hydrodynamics of HBUR fin, which has great significance for the propelling safety of HBUR underwater. In this paper, a mathematical model is brought forward to indicate the undulating motion of HBUR, which is formed by sequentially and periodically swing motions of Hydraulic Swing Actors (HSAs), and then the CFD method is introduced to calculate the hydro-forces when undulating shape of HBUR fin are distorted, because of distraction underwater. Results show that HBUR could produce <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> even {{when some of the}} HSAs are restricted from swinging, and shape adaptation ability of different part on HBUR fin is different, where the middle part is worse than the two sides. The <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> generated by undulating motion the rest of HBUR fin could be used to get the underwater robot out of trouble itself, and then undulating shape will restore to normal state...|$|R

Mr. Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill. But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, {{it was found that the}} operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight. The only <b>propelling</b> <b>force</b> it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion--a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend. This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support--in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice. He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution. The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution. These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power. The whole project was thus a complete failure.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to Brownian transport, the active motility of microbes, cells, animals and even human soften follows another random {{process known as}} truncated Levy walk(1, 2). These stochastic motions are characterized by clustered small steps and intermittent longer jumps that often extend towards {{the size of the}} entire system. As there are repeated suggestions, although disagreement, that Levy walks have functional advantages over Brownian motion in random searching and transport kinetics(3 - 8), their intentional engineering into active materials could be useful. Here, we show experimentally in the classic active matter system of intracellular tracking(9 - 15) that Brownian-like steps self-organize into truncated Levy walks through an apparent time-independent positive feedback such that directional persistence increases with the distance travelled persistently. A molecular model that allows the maximum output of the active <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> to fluctuate slowly fits the experiments quantitatively.

40|$|Max Weber's {{concept of}} the iron cage has become a byword in the {{scholarly}} world since the publication in 1930 of Talcott Parsons’ translation of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. What is less well-known is that Jules Verne had earlier used the iron cage metaphor in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869) to reveal the paradoxes of modernity. Roland Barthes criticized Verne's vision of modernity as bourgeois and positivistic, pointing out his narrow-minded enthusiasm for futuristic technology. In this essay, I argue that Verne's originality lies precisely in his equivocal attitude towards modernity with its high technology. Verne, I suggest, does not reject technological modernity, but by dissecting it he reveals its <b>propelling</b> <b>forces,</b> high demands and price. He shows that the Enlightenment's Rule of Reason is, in the end, governed by the ancient passions of fear, bitterness and the thirst for revenge.

40|$|In 1999 Indonesia {{held its}} first free {{elections}} since 1955. The transition to democracy started with the Asian Crisis, which led Indonesia into a period of deep economical, social and political unrest that forced President Suharto {{to give up his}} presidency on May 21 st 1998. After 32 years with a sovereing one-party rule under president Suharto, the process of making new election laws for the new democracy lasted for only eight months until the end of January 1999. This thesis concentrates on the drafting process of the three new election laws that were adopted on January 28 th 1999. These laws formed the framework for the elections that were held later on the same year. The laws regulate both the general election of the national parliament called the People’s Representative Assembly (DPR) and the elections of the two local levels which are the provincial assemblies (DPRD I) and the district assemlies (DPRD II). My main agenda in the thesis is to make an analysis on the drafting process of the new laws and to explore the main <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> behind the laws. Allthough the new election laws were debated in media and among the same opposition that forced Suharto to withdraw, the final decision on the new election laws was to be taken by a parliament elected in the Suharto-era in 1997. Nevertheless, the members of parliament and the new president Habibie had to seek support outside parliament in order of getting support for the new laws. By focusing on theories on election laws and theories on transition I have discussed the different aspects of the new laws. The new laws were formed {{in such a way that}} for instance regional based parties and small NGO’s would have no chance to form political parties and to contest the election. On the other side, the laws made it possible for large NGO’s to form parties. I have argued that the main <b>propelling</b> <b>forces</b> behind the election laws were the members of the parliament with the support of the military and the moderate middle class opposition who joined in a pact to form the new political system. The impact of the smaller NGO’s, the students and radical opposition was very little, allthough they had been among the most active forces demonstrating against Suharto the previous year...|$|R
