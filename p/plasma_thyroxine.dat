40|$|It is {{well known}} that an acute {{myocardial}} infarction is accompanied by a rise in levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which may lead to a subsequent increase in cardiac arrhythmias. Administration of heparin to patients after an acute myocardial infarction gives rise to an increase both in plasma FFA levels and <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> levels. If administered without a fatty meal the rise in FFA is not accompanied by an increase in arrhythmias. The effect of the heparin-induced rise in <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> on cardiac rhythm has never been investigated. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate a possible arrhythmic effect of a heparin induced increase in <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> in a group of patients with acute myocardial infarction. We were able to confirm a significant heparin-induced rise in <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> levels, as measured by the effective thyroxine ratio. Although a slightly significant increase in ventricular premature beats could be demonstrated after heparin administration when using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for statistical analysis (but not when the paired t-test was utilized), no significant correlation with free thyroxine levels could be found.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Premature {{infants who}} have {{transient}} hypothyroxinemia {{in the first}} weeks of life may have developmental delay and neurologic dysfunction. Whether thyroxine treatment during this period results in improved developmental outcomes is not known. METHODS: We carried out a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of thyroxine supplementation in 200 infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation. Thyroxine (8 microg per kilogram of birth weight) or placebo was administered daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after birth, for six weeks. <b>Plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> concentrations were measured weekly for the first eight weeks after birth. Scores on the Bayley Mental and Psychomotor Development Indexes and neurologic function were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months of age (corrected for prematurity). RESULTS: Mortality and morbidity up {{to the time of}} discharge from the hospital were similar in the study groups. At 24 months of age, 157 infants were evaluated. Overall, neither mental nor psychomotor scores differed significantly between the study groups at any time, nor was the frequency of abnormal neurologic outcome significantly different. In thyroxine-treated infants born at gestational ages of less than 27 weeks, the score on the Bayley Mental Development Index at 24 months of age was 18 points higher than the score for the infants with similar gestational ages at birth in the placebo group (P= 0. 01); for thyroxine-treated infants born at 27 weeks or later, the mental-development score was 10 points lower than that of their counterparts in the placebo group (P= 0. 03). There was no relation between the initial <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> concentration and the effect of treatment.

The birds were fed fish spiked with PCB 126 alone or in combination with PCB 153 (1 : 1, 000), resulting in concentrations in the food ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 2 ng toxic equivalents (TEQs) /g wet weight. The most sensitive effect parameter was induction of hepatic CYP 1 A-associated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activity, and a nonlinear concentration–effect relationship could be determined with the TEQ concentration (r = 0. 967, p < 0. 001). Induction of pentoxyresorufin-O-depenthylation and methoxyresorufin-O-demethylation activities was observed at dose levels {{similar to those that}} induced EROD activity. The estimated lowest-observed-effect level for induction of CYP 1 A in the common tern was approx. 25 ng TEQ/g liver lipid, which was caused by concentrations in the food of approx. 0. 6 ng TEQ/g fish wet weight. At these concentrations, a 50 ␛eduction in <b>plasma</b> total <b>thyroxine</b> compared with controls also was observed. Concentrations of <b>plasma</b> total <b>thyroxine</b> were negatively correlated with hepatic TEQ concentrations (r = 0. 523, p < 0. 01), but the shape of the nonlinear concentration–effect relationship did not allow determination of a lowest-observed-effect level. No changes were found for hepatic hydroxylation of testosterone. Bursa weight decreased proportionally to hepatic concentrations of TEQs (r = 0. 433, p < 0. 05) and showed a similar sensitivity as that observed for EROD activity. Concentrations of TEQs in The Netherlands are approx. 0. 1 ng TEQ/g wet weight fish, which is approximately six times lower than the lowest-observed-effect level for CYP 1 A induction in terns as estimated in this study.

Animals in Group I were kept in hot humid condition where as Group II was maintained in cold condition providing gunny bags and fine sand on the floor. Control animals (Group III) were kept in loose housing system fodder and water were provided ad. libitum. to all the three groups of animals.

40|$|Chloride cell {{morphology}} and density in the gill and opercular membrane of coho salmon (Oncorhynehus kisutch) were examined during the 1982 and 1983 smolt-seasons for structural correlates to smoltification-associated changes in hypoosmoregulatory ability and plasma hormone levels. Although not synchronous {{in the two}} years, <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> levels displayed two peaks each year. In 1982, changes in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity were preceded by elevations in <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine.</b> In 1983, the increase in enzyme activity corresponded with the April increases in <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> and prolactin. Seawater (SW) acclimation experiments showed discrete increases in SW tolerance which coincided with changes in gill enzyme activity. Although these data suggest a relationship between SW tolerance and <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> levels, the patterns {{in the two years}} were different. A significant peak in plasma prolactin levels in April suggests possible involvement in the parr-smolt transformation. Chloride cells were studied in the opercular membrane, a chloride cell-containing epithelium lining the branchial side of the operculum, and the gill epithelium. Opercular membrane chloride cells (1982), marked with a mitochondrion-specific fluorescent stain, increased nearly two-fold in late May, concurrent with the second increase in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and SW tolerance. Gill morphology was examined (1983) with scanning and transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. Initially, the gill filament surface appeared rough but became smoother during smoltification and rough again toward the end of smoltification. Two mitochondrion-rich (chloride) cell types were present in the gill epithelium during smoltification. The electron-lucent type I cell contained large, circular mitochondria while the electron-dense type II cell contained thin, elongate mitochondria. Ultrastructurally, many type I cells appeared disrupted which may indicate cellular degeneration or a special response of type I cells to fixation. However, it was unusual to find either intact or disrupted type I cells after March. Chloride cell density (type I plus type II) remained constant during smoltification. The inability to distinguish between these cell types with the light microscope may have obscured changes in their individual densities. The data from both the opercular membrane and the gill epithelium and their relationship with gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity suggest that the development of SW tolerance during smoltification is partially due to changes in chloride cell enzyme activity and density. The presence of two mitochondrion-rich cell types is discussed with regard to their possible role in the hypoosmoregulatory changes which occur during smoltification...|$|E

SLC 26 A 4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc 26 a 4 (Slc 26 a 4 −/−). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> levels were found in Slc 26 a 4 −/− and sex-matched Slc 26 a 4 +/− littermates between postnatal day 5 (P 5) and P 90.

Thirty-six euthyroid newborns with decreased thyroxine-binding globulin levels were compared with 157 hypothyroid patients, 54 due to thyroid agenesis and 103 due to thyroid dysgenesis.

In conclusion, healthy, euthyroid, term newborns excreted more iodine in their urine than newborns with thyroid agenesis.

Feeding T 3 decreased <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> but elevated plasma T 3 concentrations compared to CON. The KI diet {{had no effect on}} plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, but feeding THIO depressed <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> with no effect on T 3, resulting in an elevated ratio of the two hormones compared to the CON ratio. Feeding KI decreased egg volume and T 3 increased egg density compared to CON, but no effects on egg weight, surface area, width, or length were noted. Dietary T 3 depressed eggshell water vapor conductance compared to CON. Dietary iodine resulted in thinner eggshells with fewer pores than the CON, whereas THIO caused significantly more pores in eggshells than CON but had no effects on shell thickness. Dietary KI had no effects on maternal plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, suggesting that the effects were due to iodine availability rather than to thyroid hormones.

All these effects are reversed by injections of thyroxine at a dose which raises the <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> concentration to normal values for 7 days in spite of the continued administration of cortisol. These results suggest that, in the unweaned thyroidectomized calf, daily injections of cortisol reduce the sensitivity of the insulin release mechanism, which may provide an explanation for the severe diabetic syndrome which is known to develop under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cunicu-lus) living in Zembra Island (North Tunisia) {{is dependent on}} an external factor, the photoperiod: the gonads are inhibited by long days and stimulated by short days or melatonin implants. Here we studied {{the role of an}} internal factor, thyroid hormones and the possible thyroid-gonadal interrelationships, in animals captured on Zembra Island and maintained in natural conditions of photoperiod and temperature. We determined the seasonal profile of the thyroid and testis cycles and investigated the ef-fects of castration and thyroidectomy on the seasonal testoster-one and thyroxine cycles. <b>Plasma</b> <b>thyroxine</b> and testosterone lev-els followed similar, parallel seasonal patterns, with a peak in autumn (October) and low values from January to August.

40|$|The {{response}} of the brown trout to a single, short (c. 1 min) incidence of handling stress was monitored {{for a period of}} 1 month post-stress. Significant changes were found in feeding behaviour, in the levels of plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate, in the concentration of circulating lymphocytes and in the degree of epidermal mucification. No changes were detected in the growth rate and coefficient of condition, in the levels of <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroxine,</b> in the concentrations of circulating erythrocytes, neutrophils and thrombocytes or in the thickness of the epidermis. The time-course for recovery of each parameter was examined and from this it was concluded that a minimum of 2 weeks was required for complete recovery and a return to normality...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether thyroxine treatment would improve nerve conduction in infants with Down syndrome. METHODS: A single-center, nationwide, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was performed. Neonates with Down syndrome were assigned randomly to thyroxine (N = 99) or placebo (N = 97) treatment for 2 years. Daily thyroxine doses were adjusted regularly to maintain plasma thyrotropin levels in the normal range and free thyroxine concentrations in the high-normal range. The outcome measures were nerve conduction velocity and central conduction time, determined through median nerve somatosensory evoked potential recording, at the age of 24 months. RESULTS: At the age of 24 months, somatosensory evoked potential recordings for 81 thyroxine-treated and 84 placebo-treated infants were available for analysis. Nerve conduction velocity and central conduction time did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups (nerve conduction velocity: thyroxine: 51. 0 m/second; placebo: 50. 1 m/second; difference: 0. 9 m/second; central conduction time: thyroxine: 8. 83 milliseconds; placebo: 8. 73 milliseconds; difference: 0. 1 milliseconds). CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal thyroxine treatment of infants with Down syndrome did not alter somatosensory evoked potential-measured peripheral or central nerve conduction significantly. The absence of favorable effects suggests that pathologic mechanisms other than mild postnatal hypothyroidism underlie the impaired nerve conduction. The absence of adverse effects suggests that longstanding <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> concentrations in the high-normal range are not harmful to nerve maturatio...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} perinatal hypothyroidism on auditory function in rats using a prepulse inhibition paradigm. Pregnant rats were treated with the antithyroid drug methimazole (1 -methyl- 2 -mercaptoimidazole) from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 21 via drinking water at concentrations (w/v) of 0 (control), 0. 002 (low dose), or 0. 02 % (high dose). Rats from methimazole-treated mothers were tested at ages 1, 6, and 12 months using techniques to examine prepulse inhibition and startle response. The startle stimulus consisted of 40 ms of white noise at 115 dB, whereas the prepulse, which preceded the startle stimulus by 30 ms, consisted of 20 ms of white noise at 75, 85, or 95 dB. When the prepulse intensity was 75 or 85 dB, the high-dose group showed decreased prepulse inhibition percentages compared with the control and low-dose groups. The reduced percentages of prepulse inhibition {{did not return to}} control levels over the 12 -month study period. In contrast, no differences in prepulse inhibition were observed among the three dose groups when prepulse intensity was 95 dB. Moreover, the high-dose group displayed excessive reaction to auditory startle stimuli compared with the other groups. Reductions in <b>plasma</b> free <b>thyroxine</b> and body weight gain were observed in the high-dose group. We conclude that perinatal hypothyroidism results in irreversible damage to auditory function in rats...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{plasma volume}} and protein {{concentration}} {{have been reported}} when normal subjects are bedrested or centrifuged. Since thyroid hormones are transported by specific plasma proteins, each of these procedures {{could be expected to}} change plasma levels of these hormones. In this study centrifugation of normal healthy human subjects produced an increased concentration of total protein and albumin. When these same subjects were bedrested for six days, no change in total protein, albumin or thyroxine binding globulin were found although there was an eight per cent decrease in plasma volume. Centrifugation and, to a lesser extent, bedrest produced changes in serum T- 4 levels and the T- 3 test results. The direction of these changes (decreased % T- 3 values and increased T- 4 levels) indicate that these two situations produce an increased <b>plasma</b> concentration of <b>thyroxine</b> binding sites...|$|R
