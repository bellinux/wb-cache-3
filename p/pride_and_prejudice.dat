5|$|The {{reception}} {{history of}} Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), {{the author of}} such works as <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> (1813) and Emma (1815), {{has become one of}} the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.|$|E
5|$|Casson {{set up a}} {{residential}} clinic for women with mental disorders at Dorset House in Bristol in 1929 with enough residential space for 800 patients, and she opened the first school of occupational therapy in the UK {{in the same building}} the following year. She took {{an active role in the}} therapeutic activities at Dorset House, even playing a part in the patient's production of <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice.</b>|$|E

50|$|His personality, {{while it}} lacks the flash of Marianne Dashwood's romantic {{interest}} Willoughby, indicates more fortitude. Despite the good common sense that links him to Elinor, {{he is able to}} attach himself to other people and form bonds of friendship and love with ease. He exemplifies great loyalty when he sacrifices his potential happiness with Elinor to honor a promise he made to another girl when he was younger. He and Marianne's future husband Colonel Brandon are both models of great character under unimpressive exteriors. This simplicity makes them rather less three-dimensional than <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudices</b> Fitzwilliam Darcy <b>and</b> Emmas Mr. Knightley.|$|R
5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|Between 10 and 11million people {{watched the}} {{original}} six-episode broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The episodes were repeated each week on BBC Two. The final episode of <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> had a {{market share of}} about 40 percent in Britain, by which time eight foreign countries had bought {{the rights to the}} serial. 3.7million Americans watched the first broadcast on the A Network, which aired the serial in double episodes on three consecutive evenings beginning 14 January 1996.|$|E
5|$|Books and scripts {{that use}} the general story line of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became popular {{at the end of}} the 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice.</b>|$|E

5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused {{to allow her to}} join Olivier in <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then {{at the peak of his}} success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars.
