40|$|Diagnosing and <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> nurses is {{expedient}} {{given the}} context of Cameroon which has severe economic constraints, acute shortages of doctors and varying demographic, epidemiological and socio-cultural factors. There is scarcity of research on diagnosing and <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> nurses in developing countries where {{a majority of the}} world’s population live. This study examined the extent to which nurses diagnose and prescribe and explored the perceptions of key stakeholders on factors affecting diagnosing and <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> nurses in different health care settings. Nurses diagnose and prescribe in all health care settings in Cameroon. However, {{the extent to which they}} do so depended on level of resources, and influence of different key stakeholders. Diagnosing and <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> nurses have the potential to enhance accessibility to care and maximise the use of limited resources. There is evidence of good practice by nurses during patient consultation. On the other hand, some patients reported consultations with nurses which were perceived to lack compassion and care. All key stakeholders felt that some nurses were overstepping their professional boundaries and carried out patient consultation which they are not adequately trained for, potentially putting patient’s health at risk...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{implementation}} of supplementary <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> pharmacists within primary care trusts (PCTs) and secondary care trusts (SCTs) in England was studied. METHODS: A survey {{was developed and}} sent to pharmacists in PCTs and SCTs in England who would oversee the {{implementation of}} supplementary <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> pharmacists. RESULTS: The response rate was 68 % for both surveys. The majority of SCTs and PCTs intended to implement supplementary <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> pharmacists {{by the end of}} 2005 (57 % and 56 %, respectively). The majority of SCT respondents did not believe that it would be more difficult to recruit designated medical practitioners to supervise supplementary prescribing training for pharmacists as opposed to nurses (67 %, n = 43), whereas the largest group of PCT pharmacists believed it would be (47 %, n = 86). Within secondary care, the clinical areas in which pharmacists were intending to work as supplementary prescribers were those where they already had established roles. Within primary care, the main clinical areas for pharmacists were influenced by those areas in the new General Medical Services contract Quality and Outcomes Framework for general practitioners. CONCLUSION: A survey investigating the implementation of supplementary <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> pharmacists in England found that there were significantly more barriers to its establishment within primary care than secondary care settings. Within primary care, supplementary prescribing is being implemented to develop new services. Within secondary care, the supplementary prescribing model is more often used to legitimize services already being provided...|$|R

40|$|In {{their recent}} {{qualitative}} study of factors influencing antimicro-bial <b>prescribing</b> <b>by</b> non-consultant hospital doctors De Souza et al. 1 found that undergraduate education, hospital guidelines {{and concerns about}} emerging resistance were minor influences on prescribing practice.
