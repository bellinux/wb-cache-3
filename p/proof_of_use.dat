Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte.

50|$|CAS criticised the FIS Doping Panel {{that their}} {{decision}} excluded any consideration of Kowalczyk's defence {{that she did}} not use the substance to enhance her sport performance. According to CAS, Kowalczyk had disclosed and substantiated her defence that Dexamethason was not intended to enhance performance. She had submitted corresponding medical certifications to the FIS Doping Panel as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in alleviating an Achilles tendon condition. Upon Kowalczyk's prima facie showing that her use of the substance was for medical reasons, the burden of proof shifted to FIS to prove the contrary.|$|E

50|$|Most {{rooms are}} {{currently}} being interpreted from {{the late eighteenth century}} to the early nineteenth century Regency era. The room off the dining room is being interpreted as the master bedroom because it is known that later in life, the Smiths did sleep in this room. However, there is no proof that it was built and utilized as such originally. The room immediately above is being used as an exhibit room because there is no <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The room where the dormers had been is extremely dark. It is being interpreted as a slave quarter at this time. In total, visitors are able to view all eight rooms in the house today.|$|E

The {{subject of}} this commentary – the acquired distinctive character of a trade mark {{as a consequence of}} its use – is a very practical issue. Especially with regard to the grounds, dates and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> necessary to establish the acquired distinctive character of a trade mark which was devoid of inherent distinctive character. The Author provides an interpretation of the appropriate regulations laid down in the Industrial Property Act of 2000. He also takes into consideration the newest judgments of the EU Court of Justice based on a reference for a preliminary ruling. Discussing the criteria for establishing the acquired distinctiveness and the methodology for its correct evaluation. Another issue addressed is the evaluation of the provision of the Polish law where the distinctive character of the trade mark was acquired {{as a consequence of the}} use of that trade mark after the date of its application for registration. Article 165 (1) (3) of the Industrial Property Act, which addresses the issue of acquired distinctiveness, raises considerable doubts as to its accordance with EU law. Therefore, the Author suggests that a reference for a preliminary ruling should be raised. However until such a judgment is made the current meaning of the said Article needs to be applied. It should, nevertheless, be subject to very strict interpretation, especially with regard to trade marks which were applied for registration under the currently applicable law.

40|$|Hypomethylation of DNA is a {{hallmark}} of cancer and its analysis as tumor biomarker has been proposed, but its determination in clinical settings is hampered by lack of standardized methodologies. Here, we present QUAlu (Quantification of Unmethylated Alu), a new technique to estimate the Percentage of UnMethylated Alu (PUMA) as a surrogate for global hypomethylation. QUAlu consists in the measurement by qPCR of Alu repeats after digestion of genomic DNA with isoschizomers with differential sensitivity to DNA methylation. QUAlu performance has been evaluated for reproducibility, trueness and specificity, and validated by deep sequencing. As a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> QUAlu {{has been applied to}} a broad variety of pathological examination specimens covering five cancer types. Major findings of the preliminary application of QUAlu to clinical samples include: (1) all normal tissues displayed similar PUMA; (2) tumors showed variable PUMA with the highest levels in lung and colon and the lowest in thyroid cancer; (3) stools from colon cancer patients presented higher PUMA than those from control individuals; (4) lung squamous cell carcinomas showed higher PUMA than lung adenocarcinomas, and an increasing hypomethylation trend associated with smoking habits. In conclusion, QUAlu is a simple and robust method to determine Alu hypomethylation in human biospecimens and may be easily implemented in research and clinical settings.
