Jupiter's rapid rotation brought the impact sites into view for terrestrial observers a few minutes after the collisions.|$|E
500|$|Several astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and {{its various}} modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury {{across the face}} of the sun {{provided}} sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the <b>predicted</b> <b>date.</b> [...] Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction. This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury. However, his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables. Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe, including Paris. [...] Jeremiah Horrocks, who observed the 1639 Venus transit, had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model, predicted the transit, and then built apparatus to observe the transit. He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model.|$|E

40|$|Dating {{violence}} {{among college students}} has become a pressing concern. However, to date, {{the bulk of the}} research in this area has attempted to discern correlates of marital violence. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the isolation of predictors of violence that occurs early in the relationship. This paper demonstrates the utility of several risk factors identified among male college students in <b>predicting</b> <b>dating</b> violence. Factors included are history of abuse in the family of origin, insecure attachment style as measured by parental attachment and girlfriend attachment; attributional style; anger; and depression. Though it is likely that many other factors <b>predict</b> male <b>dating</b> violence, this study aims to isolate those factors which operate within the framework of history of abuse and insecure attachment. Results indicated the following: 1. History of abuse accounts for a substantial portion of the variance in <b>predicting</b> <b>dating</b> violence. 2. The interaction of attachment to family and partner was related to verbal aggression and abuse toward and from the partner. 3. Attributional style did not significantly <b>predict</b> <b>dating</b> violence beyon...|$|R

2500|$|In June 1951, {{following}} {{the receipt of}} advice that the Australian aircraft carrier [...] would not be completed until at least March 1954, the Australian Defence Committee recommended that Australia request that the RN loan a carrier to the RAN. The new <b>predicted</b> <b>date</b> of completion for Melbourne was 21 months later than previous predictions, on which the establishment of two-carrier naval aviation in the RAN had been dependent. The Navy sought a four-year loan of an aircraft carrier from late 1952 to late 1956, to cover both the delays with Melbourne and the planned upgrading of [...] once Melbourne was in service. The Australian government proposed that the loaned carrier be modified to operate both Sea Venom and Gannet aircraft, so that Melbourne and the loaned carrier could both see active service while Sydney was upgraded, but withdrew the suggestion when informed by the Admiralty that providing such capability would require the installation of a new arrestor cable system, prevent the loaned carrier from entering service until at least March 1954, and would be paid for entirely by Australia. Several smaller modifications were approved and paid for by Australia, including the installation of additional aircrew accommodation.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of when {{critical}} crop stages {{occur and}} how the environment affects them should provide useful information for crop management decisions and crop production models. This research evaluated two sources of data for <b>predicting</b> <b>dates</b> of silking and physiological maturity of corn (Zea mays L.). Initial evaluations were conducted using data of an adapted corn hybrid grown on a Typic Agriaquoll at the Purdue University Agronomy Farm from 1979 to 1981. The second phase extended the analyses to large areas using data acquired by the Statistical Reporting Service of USDA for crop reporting districts (CRD) in Indiana and Iowa from 1969 to 1980. Several thermal models were compared to calendar days for <b>predicting</b> <b>dates</b> of silking and physiological maturity. Mixed models which used a combination of thermal units to predict silking and days after silking to predict physiological maturity were also evaluated. At the Agronomy Farm the models were calibrated and tested on the same data. For each CRD the models were calibrated using 4 or 5 years of data and tested using 7 different years of data. The thermal models were significantly less biased and more accurate than calendar days for <b>predicting</b> <b>dates</b> of silking. Differences among the thermal models were small. Significant improvements in both bias and accuracy were observed when the mixed models were used to <b>predict</b> <b>dates</b> of physiological maturity. The results indicate that statistical data for CRD {{can be used to}} evaluate models developed at agricultural experiment stations...|$|R

Community violence predicts physical and psychological dating violence for males and physical dating violence for females. In addition, attitudes toward <b>dating</b> violence <b>predict</b> <b>dating</b> violence for both genders. Specifically, males and females justify physical dating violence under conditions of self defense and humiliation. For males, self defense and humiliation <b>predict</b> psychological <b>dating</b> violence. Results indicate support for using gender specific models to study dating violence.
