He is also the most decorated serviceman from Rhode Island. In 1961 he was appointed by John F. Kennedy as the postmaster of Providence, becoming (at age 36) one of the youngest postmasters in the United States. During his <b>postmastership,</b> Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office in the country, which made the Providence post office an operational model for the United States and worldwide.|$|E
500|$|John Clive Ward {{was born}} in East Ham, London, on 1 August 1924. He {{was the son of}} Joseph William Ward, a civil servant who worked in Inland Revenue, and his wife Winifred [...] Palmer, a schoolteacher. He had a sister, Mary Patricia. He {{attended}} Chalkwell Elementary School and Westcliff High School for Boys. In 1938 he sat for and won a ₤100 scholarship to Bishop Stortford College.

[...] He applied next to Merton College, Oxford for a classical <b>postmastership.</b> [...] His application proved successful and Creighton arrived in Oxford in October 1862. [...] He continued to take great interest in the Durham Grammar School. [...] In a hand-me-down family story, he is said, in 1866, to have walked from Oxford to Durham in three days to hear speeches at a school function.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} {{distribution}} of [...] "spoils" [...] after the 1896 Presidential election, the McKinley administration appointed hundreds of blacks to <b>postmasterships</b> across the Black Belt. These recess appointments were resisted by local whites who resented any black officeholders, and feared that the increased political power that accompanied them would embolden black men to proposition white women.|$|R
5000|$|Federal {{offices in}} the South: With no {{professional}} civil service in operation {{during this period of}} American history, Lincoln promised that he would not use the spoils system to appoint Northern office-holders to federal offices, such as <b>postmasterships,</b> located in the Southern states. Instead, he said he would [...] "forego the use of such offices" [...] rather than force [...] "obnoxious strangers" [...] upon the South.|$|R
50|$|The Post Office in the 19th {{century was}} {{a major source of}} federal patronage. Local <b>postmasterships</b> were rewards for local politicians—often the editors of party newspapers. About 3/4 of all federal {{civilian}} employees worked for the Post Office. In 1816 it employed 3341 men, and in 1841, 14,290. The volume of mail expanded much faster than the population, as it carried annually 100 letters and 200 newspapers per 1000 white population in 1790, and 2900 letters and 2700 newspapers per thousand in 1840.|$|R
2500|$|Creighton's <b>postmastership</b> of £70 a {{year was}} enough to cover his tuition at Merton, but not much more. [...] For his other {{expenses}} he had to ask his father, whose gruff manner made asking difficult. [...] Under the circumstances, Creighton lived economically in college attic rooms {{for most of his}} time at Merton. [...] In his last year he moved out of college to share rooms with George Saintsbury (1845-1933), the future authoritative critic of English and French literature, prolific author, and wine critic.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{enforced}} the Tenure of Office Act, signed {{earlier by}} President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized {{the president to}} remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will. Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was [...] "a leading principle in the republican creed". Jackson noted, [...] "In a country where offices are created solely {{for the benefit of}} the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another." [...] Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. Jackson, however, did use his image and presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a <b>postmastership</b> Jackson stated [...] "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me." ...|$|E

My conclusion is that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better right and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier, deceased soldier's family.|$|R

After 1900, William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer and other big city politician-publishers discovered they could make far more profit through advertising, at so many dollars per thousand readers. By becoming non-partisan they expanded their base to include the opposition party and the fast-growing number of consumers who read the ads but were less and less interested in politics. There was less and less political news after 1900, apparently because citizens became more apathetic, and shared their partisan loyalties with the new professional sports teams that attracted larger and larger audiences.|$|R

60|$|The curtain {{had risen}} again, indeed, {{and the action}} was soon fast enough for the most {{impatient}} that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated breath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of the post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds. Mr. Worthington had other and {{more important things to}} think about than minor postmasters, and after his anger and--yes, and momentary fear had subsided, he forgot the incident except to make a mental note to remember to deprive Mr. Prescott of his <b>postmastership,</b> which he believed could be done readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of the way. Then he had stepped into the bank, which he had come to regard as his own bank, as he regarded most institutions in Brampton. He had, in the old days, been president of it, as we know. He stepped into the bank, and then--he stepped out again.|$|E

60|$|I {{suppose that}} may have been why it was that in Mariposa the results came out at first in such a {{conflicting}} way. Perhaps that was how it was that the first reports showed that Edward Drone the Independent candidate was certain to win. You should have seen how the excitement grew upon the streets when the news was circulated. In the big rallies and meetings of the Liberals and Conservatives, everybody had pretty well forgotten all about Drone, and when the news got round at about four o'clock that the Drone vote was carrying the poll, the people were simply astounded. Not that they were not pleased. On the contrary. They were delighted. Everybody came up to Drone and shook hands and congratulated him and told him that they had known all along that what the country wanted was a straight, honest, non-partisan representation. The Conservatives said openly that they were sick of party, utterly done with it, and the Liberals said that they hated it. Already three or four of them had taken Drone aside and explained that what was needed in the town was a straight, clean, non-partisan post-office, built on a piece of ground of a strictly non-partisan character, and constructed under contracts that were not tainted and smirched with party affiliation. Two or three men were willing to show to Drone just where a piece of ground of this character could be bought. They told him too that in the matter of the <b>postmastership</b> itself they had nothing against Trelawney, the present postmaster, in any personal sense, and would say nothing against him except merely that he was utterly and hopelessly unfit for his job and that if Drone believed, as he had said he did, in a purified civil service, he ought to begin by purifying Trelawney.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} paper was [...] "The Plunkville Patriot," [...] a page each week--or at least with the regularity of the somewhat uncertain paper itself--purporting to be reprinted from a contemporary journal. The editor of the Plunkville Patriot was Colonel Aristotle Jordan, unrelenting enemy of his enemies. When the Colonel's application for the <b>postmastership</b> in Plunkville is ignored, his columns carry a bitter attack on the administration at Washington. With the public weal at heart, the Patriot announces that [...] "there is a dangerous hole in {{the front steps of}} the Elite saloon." [...] Here, too, appears the delightful literary item that Mark Twain and Charles Egbert Craddock are spending the summer together in their Adirondacks camp. [...] "Free," [...] runs its advertising column, [...] "a clergyman who cured himself of fits will send one book containing 100 popular songs, one repeating rifle, two decks easywinner cards and 1 liver pad free of charge for $8. Address Sucker & Chump, Augusta, Me." [...] The office moves nearly every week, probably in accordance with the time-honored principle involving the comparative ease of moving and paying rent. When the Colonel publishes his own candidacy for mayor, he further declares that the Patriot will accept no announcements for municipal offices until after [...] "our" [...] (the editor's) canvass. Adams & Co., grocers, order their $2.25 ad. discontinued and find later in the Patriot this estimate of their product: [...] "No less than three children have been poisoned by eating their canned vegetables, and J. O. Adams, the senior member of the firm, was run out of Kansas City for adulterating codfish balls. It pays to advertise." [...] Here is the editorial in which the editor first announces his campaign: [...] "Our worthy mayor, Colonel Henry Stutty, died this morning after an illness of about five minutes, brought on by carrying a bouquet to Mrs. Eli Watts just as Eli got in from a fishing trip. Ten minutes later we had dodgers out announcing our candidacy for the office. We have lived in Plunkville going on five years and have never been elected anything yet. We understand the mayor business thoroughly and if elected some people will wish wolves had stolen them from their cradles [...] ." ...|$|E
