Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed <b>preliminary</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E

40|$|A <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> {{approach}} using shrinkage {{technique is}} {{proposed for the}} estimation of a Poisson parameter. In this article, an a priori value of the parameter {{is assumed to be}} available in the form of realistic guessed value based on the experimenter's knowledge and experience to increase the precision of estimators by using a <b>preliminary</b> <b>test.</b> It is to be noted that this approach differs from the Bayesian approach since we do not assume a prior distribution for the parameter. Three possible estimators, namely the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimator (UMLE), the shrinkage restricted maximum likelihood estimator (SRMLE) and the shrinkage <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> maximum likelihood estimator (SPTMLE), are presented. Asymptotic mean squared errors of the estimators are derived and compared analytically and numerically. The relative dominance picture of the estimators is presented. It is shown that the range in the parameter space which SPTMLE dominates the UMLE is wider than that of usual <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> maximum likelihood estimator (PTMLE).

25|$|Research {{continues}} on saturation decompression modelling and schedule testing. In 2015 a concept named Extended Oxygen Window {{was used in}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>tests</b> for a modified saturation decompression model. This model allows a faster rate of decompression {{at the start of}} the ascent to utilise the inherent unsaturation due to metabolic use of oxygen, followed by a constant rate limited by oxygen partial pressure of the breathing gas. The period of constant decompression rate is also limited by the allowable maximum oxygen fraction, and when this limit is reached, decompression rate slows down again as the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced. The procedure remains experimental as of May 2016. The goal is an acceptably safe reduction of overall decompression time for a given saturation depth and gas mixture.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels {{were ordered}} {{and shipped to}} Europe {{for use by the}} 1st Canadian Division. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>tests,</b> however, {{revealed}} that the shovel’s blade was incapable of stopping even small caliber bullets. Its value as a digging tool was also questioned as soldiers commented against the shovel’s weight, its inability to be easily carried, {{and the fact that the}} blade was poor for shoveling loose soil as it contained a large sight-hole. With such a reputation, several high-ranking Canadian and British military officials refused to press the instrument into service. With these developments, an executive order was eventually issued for the shovels to be reduced to scrap. A total sum of $1,400 was recovered in the salvage; a figure far less than the original contract price, which tagged each MacAdam shield-shovel at $1.35. Despite being condemned by the military, a small following of Canadian snipers continued to use the shovel. Aware of the tool’s limitations, they preferred to use them in a collective series for added protection.|$|E

500|$|Atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy (AAS) is a destructive technique that {{is able to}} determine the elements {{that make up the}} analyzed sample. [...] AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the atomic bonds of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. [...] Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. [...] For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after <b>preliminary</b> <b>tests</b> have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. [...] The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. [...] AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. The concentration of the substance in the sample can indicate whether heavy metals were the cause of death.|$|E
