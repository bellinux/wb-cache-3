Large areas of inkjet color, such as in graphics and photographs, soak the paper fibers with so much moisture that they swell and return to their original shape before pressing, resulting in a wavy buckling of the paper surface.|$|R

The corrugations are formed by <b>pressing</b> the <b>mats</b> between corrugated <b>pressing</b> plates. Corrugated bamboo roofing sheets are an excellent alternative to asbestos, iron, zinc or plastic roofing sheets.

30|$|As a next step, a hand-formed mat (15  cm ×  15  cm) was made, using a metal frame. Wire screens {{were placed}} on the upper and lower {{surfaces}} of the mat to accelerate water transfer during <b>pressing.</b> The <b>mats</b> were pressed for 10  min at 120  °C and 0.85  MPa, using a hot press (Tabletop Test Press SA- 302; Tester Sangyo Co., Ltd., Japan). Wood flour boards (15  cm ×  15  cm ×  0.3  cm) were manufactured with a targeted density of 1.00  g/cm 3. It is possible to make boards with lower density, {{but it is difficult to}} use the lower density boards. As a result, we selected the density of 1.0  g/cm 3.|$|R
30|$|This study {{involved}} direct measurement of both temperature and vapor pressure change using PressMAN Lite. A previous study reported temperatures inside the <b>mat</b> during hot <b>pressing</b> at various <b>mat</b> moisture levels, resin types and <b>pressing</b> temperatures [9]. <b>Mat</b> permeability, which depends on furnish type, {{has an important}} impact on temperature and heat conductivity. Furthermore, as heat is transferred by conduction and convection, {{the structure of the}} mat is important. Furnish type is not the only variable affecting the porous structure of the mat; density also plays an important role. Furnish type and density affect mat permeability and, consequently, the rate of heat and mass transfer, i.e., heat transfer from the mat surface to the center and vapor escaping {{from the center of the}} mat to the edges. This study was designed to examine the effect of furnish type and density on the relationship of temperature and vapor pressure behaviors inside the mat of wood-based panels during pressing. Mechanical properties of manufactured panels were also investigated to confirm the effects of those behaviors on panel performance.|$|R
30|$|As a next step, a hand-formed mat (15  ×  15  cm) {{was made}} using a metal frame. Wire screens (100 meshes) {{were placed on}} the upper and lower {{surfaces}} of the mat to accelerate water transfer during hot <b>pressing.</b> The <b>mats</b> were pressed for 10  min at 120  °C and 0.85  MPa using a hot press (Tabletop Test Press SA- 302; Tester Sangyo Co., Ltd., Japan). In this study, to discuss the reinforcement effect of LCNF on board densities, three different board densities (0.60, 0.75, and 1.00  g/cm 3) were selected. Board densities were controlled by board thickness. Fiberboards (15  ×  15  ×  0.5  cm) were manufactured with a target density of 0.60  g/cm 3. For target densities of 0.75 and 1.00  g/cm 3, board thickness was set at 0.4 and 0.3  cm, respectively.|$|R
30|$|The Miscanthus/wood {{particle}} {{ratio was}} found to have a significant influence on the improvement of board properties, particularly for boards with a density of 0.65  g/cm 3 and 11  % resin content. In a whole, increasing wood particles proportion contributed to increased MOE for HB boards but no obvious effect for LB boards. When the Miscanthus/wood particle ratio was below 60 / 40, the enhancements were more obvious despite HB board experienced more spring-back, resulting in higher TS. Taking making full use of Miscanthus into consideration, approximately 50 / 50 of Miscanthus/wood ratio, further investigation for better mechanical properties is necessary. Current composite board properties are not satisfactory and must be improved. The vertical density profiles study shows that during hot <b>pressing</b> the <b>mats</b> were well densified, which is related to the good permeability of the composite boards.|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} <b>pressing</b> a <b>mat</b> to {{be formed}} into board {{in a hot}} plate press for a first press phase period of 20 - 90 s. The mat is over-compressed to a thickness of 0. 80 - 0. 98 of the desired final thickness. The pressure {{is applied to the}} mat at least for long enough to allow 50 - 100 g of water to be sprayed on to the outer surfaces of the mat and for the water to reach the point where steam is starting to form. The energy of the water is such that when the plates are moved apart in a second press phase to a distance equal to the final thickness of the board, there is a secondary steam shock effect causing a spontaneous increase of temperature within the mat of at least 15 deg.. ADVANTAGE - The secondary steam shock effect reduces the pressing time to below that of conventional steam shock processes...|$|R

30|$|If hot {{pressing}} occurred without desiccation, {{it was difficult}} to safely make fiberboard. When the mat moisture content was over 300  %, it was impossible to produce uniform boards because excessive steam pressure would accumulate, and moisture inside the mat would not completely evaporate during hot <b>pressing,</b> causing the <b>mat</b> to burst. Therefore, the mixture was compounded and dried with a compounding machine with vacuum drying function (Trimix, Inoue Mfg., Inc, Japan) to less than 30  % moisture content. Compounding and drying were performed at 40  rpm and 80  °C for 15  min. The compounding machine was applied to mix the LCNF and wood fiber homogeneously and extract water from each compound.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the work was to {{evaluate}} a possibility of using various hyperelastic material mo­dels implemented into ANSYS computational system for the numerical analysis of wood-strand <b>mat</b> <b>pressing</b> or wood-based composites. Subsequently, the most suitable hyperelastic model {{was used as a}} material model in compression simulation. Pressing itself was modelled as a contact transient ana­ly­sis with wood-strand mat being defined as a homogenous and isotropic continuum with the chosen material model. In the analysis only displacement degrees of freedom are considered. Output of the simulation is a contact pressure, which is necessary to apply to compress the mat on the required height. The analysis serves as a take-off platform for further research in wood-based com­po­si­tes pressing process...|$|R
30|$|Cai et al. [4] {{reported}} that several parameters affect hot pressing, such as press temperature, mat moisture content, press-closing speed and resin characteristics. These parameters affect the rate {{and degree of}} adhesive cure, the density gradient, bond quality and, consequently, the physical and mechanical properties of the board [5]. Additionally, these parameters influence energy consumption and manufacturing cost [6]. The moisture content of the mat panels {{plays an important role}} during the hot <b>pressing</b> stage. <b>Mat</b> moisture content {{is one of the most}} important factors that affect heat transfer in the mat, and the rate of heat penetration into the mat determines press time, which is critical for productivity [7]. The rate of temperature increase has a significant effect on the rate of adhesive cure. This is a critical factor not only for total press time but also in the development of the vertical density gradient [8]. Dai and Wang [9] noted that the combination of high temperature, moisture content and time occasionally lead to excess gas pressure inside the mat and cause a blow upon press opening. Some studies have been conducted for preventing this blow during particleboard production [10, 11].|$|R
30|$|The {{method of}} {{inoculation}} significantly impacted how the fungi performed within the logs, and fungi with different types of pigmentation appeared to prefer different methods of inoculation. Zone line producing fungi produced more zone lines when introduced into the logs in sterile plugs, while pink staining fungi performed better when sprayed onto the logs. Both methods are based in past literature, which includes <b>pressing</b> fungal <b>mats</b> against log ends [14, 15], spraying a mixture of distilled water and fungi on the logs [16 – 18], packing inoculated sawdust into drilled holes in the log [19], and using inoculated plugs to deliver active cultures directly into the wood [20]. Although spray inoculation was more effective with S. cuboidea, {{it is possible that}} the opening of the sapwood for spray inoculation also partially inhibited the pink stain production. As noted by Leatham [20], inoculum generally performs better when the bark is retained, as the bark helps maintain moisture content, insulates against temperature changes, and can inhibit the colonization by airborne contaminants. An inoculation method which enables entire surface coverage without exposing large portions of the internal wood would be ideal, but would be exceptionally difficult to achieve.|$|R
30|$|Boards were {{produced}} by using SP adhesive, which contains styrene-butadiene rubber and polyethylene glycol as major constituents. The use of polyethylene {{in place of}} clay, {{which is also a}} generally used constituent of SP adhesive, was confirmed to improve board properties. In general, the properties of boards are poorer when produced by two-stage <b>pressing,</b> in which <b>mats</b> are first processed by temporary adhesion and then processed into boards by permanent adhesion; however, the properties of boards produced by two-stage pressing were improved when polyethylene was added to the SP adhesive. In addition, internal bond strength and thickness swelling was greatly improved when boards {{were produced}} from ozonized wood and by sealed pressing. Thus, the properties impaired by two-stage pressing were improved by ozonization and sealed pressing.|$|R
30|$|Wood {{particles}} {{obtained in}} Japan from demolished construction materials {{were used for}} the board manufacturing. The particles consisted of untreated, mixed wood species having a moisture content of 6 – 7 %. Finely powdered NaF (99 % purity, from Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) was introduced into the blender. Four different target retentions (0, 1, 1.5 and 3 %) of the total particle weight were chosen for this study. The wood particles and finely powdered NaF were mixed for 60  s and then a polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI) resin at the level of 10 % of the total wood-particle weight was sprayed onto the mixture. A 300  ×  300  mm forming box was used to prepare the board <b>mats</b> before hot <b>pressing.</b> Single-layer <b>mats</b> were hot pressed at 160  °C for 10  min. The target thickness and density of the boards were 15  mm and 700  kg/m 3, respectively. No other chemical was used during manufacturing and three replicates were conducted for each retention level, totaling 12 boards including 0 % NaF controls. The specimens for the bending, decay and termite tests were cut from those boards after 3 weeks of conditioning at 22  °C and 60 % relative humidity (RH).|$|R
30|$|WF boards {{were made}} from {{mixtures}} of WF and the 16 CNF slurries noted above. This was done to study the effect of CNF form on the physical and mechanical properties of the WF boards. A single composition was examined, i.e., 80  wt% WF +  20  wt% CNF. WF (54  g, dry weight) was mixed with a CNF slurry (CNF 13.5  g + distilled water 200  g) in a polyethylene bag, and a hand-formed mat (15  cm ×  15  cm) was made using a metal frame. Wire screens {{were placed on the}} upper and lower surfaces of the formed mat to accelerate water transfer during subsequent <b>pressing.</b> The hand-formed <b>mats</b> were pressed for 15  min at 120  °C at 2.4  MPa using a hot press (Tabletop Test Press SA- 302; Tester Sangyo Co., Ltd., Japan). WF boards 15  ×  15  ×  0.3  cm having a density of 1.00  g/cm 3 were manufactured.|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality of model oriented strand board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size of strands, the distribution of strands and bending properties. A batch of commercial strands was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size of strands was quantified. The strands were categorised into five strand types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, strand shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in strand dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area strands had low aspect ratios and small strands had high aspect ratios. Half of the commercial strands were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot <b>pressing</b> strand <b>mats</b> formed from each of the five strand types. Strands were laid up by hand into the forming <b>mat</b> and following <b>pressing</b> the orientation and shape of strands was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) strands with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum strand orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from strands dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the delivery of strands to the forming line under factory conditions. As the height of strand delivery increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation of strands in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution of commercial strand shapes and the relationship between strand geometry, strand orientation and the mechanical properties of oriented strand board...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to compare}} {{competitive}} activity of highly skilled freestyle wrestlers after making {{adjustments to the}} wrestling rules. Material: the analysis involved 80 bouts performed by high skilled wrestlers at 2011 World Wrestling Championships (Ankara, Turkey) and 2012 Olympic Games in London (weight categories 84 and 96 kg). Results: the resultant technical actions have been analyzed in the standing position performed by highly skilled freestyle wrestlers in major events of the annual cycle {{for the last three}} years. The characteristic changes in a competitive activity of highly skilled freestyle wrestlers in the weight categories 84 and 96 kg have been determined. We identified the techniques which were used most frequently in different periods of bout by elite athletes: spurt moving, throwing by knock, <b>pressing,</b> pushing the <b>mat,</b> etc. Conclusions: the competitions in the training of athletes are not only a means of controlling the level of preparedness, the process for deciding the winner, but also an important means of improving fitness and sports mastership. In the future, specialists can use these features of competitive activity in determining the overall training strategy of freestyle wrestlers to competitions at various levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} suitable materials and techniques {{for the elimination}} of hand backing of mats was undertaken. A thermosetting resin of the resorcinol type, ad-mixed with 15 to 25 per cent short-fiber asbestos, was applied to the mats both as a paste and {{in the form of a}} partially cured resin sheet. Its use was discontinued since its inherent insulating properties and warpage were found to be undesirable. After experimenting with several other backing materials and methods, the following procedure was concluded to be feasible: (1) Spraying sodium silicate solution upon a sheet of blotting paper. (2) Pressing the glue-coated blotting paper to the <b>mat</b> during the <b>pressing</b> of the <b>mat</b> upon the chase. (3) Warming to set the glue. (4) Sanding excess blotting paper off high portion of mat back. (5) Final drying in 2 ̆ 2 Sta-hi 2 ̆ 2 vacuum driers. A sanding unit was designed and constructed to remove the backing from the raised portions of the mat. In an effort to replace the present day dry mat with one requiring no backing, the following materials were chosen and tried as mat substitutes: Aluminum sheet, lead-aluminum laminates, Teflon, ethyl cellulose, resorcinol, and several layers of the moistened, conventional mat...|$|R
50|$|The {{visitor to}} the Bullenkuhle comes across a basin-shaped hollow with steep sides of 30 to 60° in places. At {{the foot of the}} slopes of glacial sands is a marsh {{covering}} about 0.5 ha that on closer inspection {{turns out to be a}} 'quaking bog' (Schwingrasen or Schwingmoor) - a floating mat of moss and other plants, under which there is presumably no homogeneous layer of peat, but at least in places just a body of water. The floating mat covers at least 80% of the wetland or marsh, only in the northeast is there stretch of open water about 0.1 ha in area and several metres deep; a so-called bog pond. With an electrolytic conductivity of 24 µS/cm this wetland is very oligotrophic, it is rich in humus and, with a pH value of 5.0, moderately acidic. It is populated by typical marsh plants like peat mosses, bladderworts and the rare Dwarf White Water Lily (Nymphaea candida). In addition to peat mosses, the floating <b>mat</b> <b>pressing</b> in on the bog pond consists mainly of Hare's-tail Cottongrass, Cross-leaved Heath, Common Heather and Crowberry; as well as White Beak-sedge and Cranberry.

On its periphery is a ring-shaped bog, which is slightly better supplied with nutrients from precipitation running down the slopes than the centre of the marsh. Bottle Sedge reeds thrive particularly well here.|$|R
40|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} nail and screw fasteners {{has been studied}} in rice straw fibre-thermoplastic composites. Two types of thermoplastic, virgin polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), were selected as separate composite matrices. Three levels of dry rice straw fibre, 45 %, 60 % and 75 %, based on the composition by weight and passed through a 40 -mesh size screen was mixed with the polymeric matrices without and with 2 % (based on weight) maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) as Coupling agent. A dry-blending method was used for compounding the materials. The 12 formulations for the polymer composites were used to prepare samples with dimensions 25 cm by 15 cm by I cm. The final composites were made by <b>pressing</b> the prepared <b>mats</b> between the hot plates of a compression press by employing combinations of temperature and pressure in three stages. After keeping the composites {{at room temperature for}} 15 days, the withdrawal strengths of nails and screws were measured according to BS Standard (CEN/TS 15534 - 1 : 2007) for dry composites. Withdrawal strengths were also measured after immersion of the composites for 24 h in distilled water (wet condition). The results showed that the withdrawal strength of screws is more than that of nails. Also, irrespective of the type of polymer, the percentage of rice straw fibre may significantly influence the withdrawal strength of fasteners, especially at the higher fibre to polymer ratios. Furthermore, it was found that in the wet condition the withdrawal strengths of the flail fasteners are reduced more (73. 66 %) than for the screws (28. 9 %) ...|$|R
