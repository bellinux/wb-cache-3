40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the effect of}} the {{parasitic}} or leakage current, I, which {{is the result of the}} ethanol crossover through the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) from the anode to the cathode side of the cell, on both the cathode activation overpotential and the fuel cell operation is investigated. A one-dimensional (I-D), isothermal mathematical model is developed in order to describe the operation of a Direct Ethanol PEM Fuel Cell (DE-PEMFC) in steady state. The equations used describe the mass transport of both ethanol and humidified oxygen at the anode and the cathode compartment of the cell respectively. The mathematical model is validated against experimental data and a relatively good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results is found. The direct correlation that exists between the ethanol crossover rate and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> formation is graphically depicted. Moreover, when the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> is enabled and disabled, the calculation of the cathode activation overpotential shows that the mixed overpotential for a DE-PEMFC poses a serious problem hindering the fuel cell operation. According to the model results, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> is greater at low current density values due to the greater amounts of the crossovered ethanol. Finally, the effect of both the oxygen feed concentration and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> formation on the fuel cell operation is also presented and discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

This current is a drain on the array power that can be significant for high-power arrays. In addition, this current influences the current balance that determines the floating potential of the spacecraft. One of the objectives of the Air Force (PL/GPS) PASP Plus (Photovoltaic Array Space Power Plus Diagnostics) experiment is an improved understanding fo <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> collection. We have done computer modeling of <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> collection and have examined current collection flight data from the first year of operations. Prior to the flight we did computer modeling to improve our understanding of the physical processes that control <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> collection. At high potentials, the current rapidly rises due to a phenomenon called snapover. Under snapover conditions, the equilibrium potential distribution across the dielectric surface is such that part of the area is at potentials greater than the first crossover of the secondary yield curve. Therefore, each incident electron generates more than one secondary electron. The net effect is that the high potential area and the collecting area increase. We did two-dimensional calculations for the various geometries to be flown. The calculations span the space of anticipated plasma conditions, applied potential, and material parameters. We used the calculations and early flight data to develop an analytic formula for the dependence of the current on the primary problem variables. The analytic formula was incorporated into the EPSAT computer code. EPSAT allows us to easily extend the results to other conditions. PASP Plus is the principal experiment integrated onto the Advanced Photovoltaic and Electronics Experiments (APEX) satellite bus. The experiment is testing twelve different solar array designs. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>current</b> collection is being measured for eight of the designs under various operational and environment conditions. We examined the current collected {{as a function of the}} various parameters for the six non-concentrator designs.

40|$|Methanol {{crossover}} on the cathodes causes significant performance loss {{in direct}} methanol fuel cells, and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> {{induced by the}} electrochemical oxidation of methanol on the cathodes {{is believed to be}} the cause. Palladium cathodes are known to bear resistance to methanol but not platinum cathodes. By means of the density functional theory (DFT), the distorted molecular structure of the adsorbed methanol on platinum was revealed, and this distorted molecular structure indicates that platinum makes methanol has a tendency toward the elimination of the first hydrogen (involved in the first step of electrochemical oxidation of methanol) in electric neutrality, and loss of an electron can reinforce this tendency. However, palladium cannot distort the molecular structure of the adsorbed methanol, even in the loss of electron condition. The activation energies and the reaction energies calculated by means of DFT also show that after losing an electron, the elimination of the first hydrogen on platinum is more kinetically and thermodynamically favourable than that on palladium. These computational results can explain the experimental findings that no <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> is induced at palladium cathodes, but not at platinum cathodes; therefore, palladium cathodes have a methanol-resistance property.

40|$|CMOS {{technology}} {{provides an}} attractive {{alternative to the}} currently dominant CCD technology for implementing low-power, low-cost imagers {{with high levels of}} integration. Two pixel configurations are possible in CMOS technology: active and passive. The active pixel requires a minimum of three transistors to convert light to voltage. The passive pixel, on the other hand, consists of a single transistor, and its output {{is in the form of}} charge. Column-parallel opamps are used to amplify the charge to a voltage output. The main advantage of the passive pixel is a higher fill factor in a given pixel geometry. This advantage becomes increasingly important as we scale to smaller pixel sizes. The higher fill factor comes at a high cost as the charge output on the high impedance node of the column line is susceptible to disturbances, namely a <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> and temporal noise. The goal of this thesis is to determine the source and effects of the disturbances on the image sensor characteristics and the repercussions for scaling to high-density arrays. A signal-dependent <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> composed of optically-generated carrier diffusion, blooming and subthreshold currents contaminates the pixel output. This <b>parasitic</b> <b>current</b> is detrimental to the imager because a few bright pixels can affect the rest of the pixels on the column line, resulting in bright vertical stripes on the image. A correlated-double sampling circuit in a differential architecture is used to remove the effects of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>current.</b> Column fixed-pattern noise is maintained below 1. 5 % for the linear illumination range of the imager. A noise analysis reveals the opamp read noise is the dominant source of temporal noise. (cont.) The effects of the sample-and-hold readout circuit on the output-referred opamp read noise are modeled and closely match the measured noise. The output read noise power is directly proportional to the vertical resolution of the imager and inversely proportional to the pixel area, resulting in a strong dependence between noise and pixel density. This co-dependence is further analyzed in a scaling model where the fill factor, noise and dynamic range are observed for varying pixel size and vertical resolution over three fabrication technologies. The fill factor decreases with pixel size, and is highest for the technology with the smallest feature size, 0. 18 [mu]m. The noise increases with decreasing pixel size and increasing vertical resolution and has the best performance in the 0. 18 pm technology. The dynamic range decreases with pixel density, but has a strong dependence on the power supply voltage of the technology. by Iliana L. Fujimori. Thesis (Ph. D.)
