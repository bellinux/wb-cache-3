40|$|A basal {{animal model}} is {{described}} as an organism similar to a Limpet that {{is attached to the}} sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community. They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed in its environment. The logic units evolve to store <b>permanent</b> <b>memories,</b> and add plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using <b>permanent</b> <b>memories</b> that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero. So, information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic) connections between cells.

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is most {{marked for}} events {{occurring}} in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was [...] "virtually complete" [...] by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the treatment. Anterograde memory loss is usually limited to the time of treatment itself or shortly afterwards. In the weeks and months following ECT these memory problems gradually improve, but some people have persistent losses, especially with bilateral ECT. One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29% and 55% of respondents believed they experienced long-lasting or <b>permanent</b> <b>memory</b> changes. In 2000, American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently impaired memory of public events as compared to RUL ECT.|$|E

5000|$|NGF can {{indirectly}} {{stimulate the}} expression of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) by increasing Vasopressin secretion. ACTH binds to the MC2 receptor in the Zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, and stimulates secretion of the stress hormone cortisol. This rapid increase of cortisol in the blood plasma can induce feelings of euphoria, which may explain the initial [...] "rush" [...] of falling in love. Studies show that ACTH can in turn stimulate NGF secretion in both the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus. It is possible that this NGF-ACTH interaction may form a recursive cycle, maintaining the [...] "feeling of love" [...] for a certain length of time. Because NGF modulates nerve plasticity, neurogenesis, and axonal outgrowth, this may form <b>permanent</b> <b>memories</b> associating the loved one with the feeling of love {{during the course of}} the cycle. However, it has been shown that cortisol, whose secretion is directly upregulated by ACTH, shows inhibitory effects over NGF expression in the cerebral cortex. This may be the cause of the eventual deterioration of NGF levels after 12 months. It may also explain why plasma NGF levels were significantly lower in individuals who have maintained a long-lasting romantic relationship beyond 12 months, than those who weren't in a romantic relationship at all.|$|R
