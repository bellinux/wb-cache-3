50|$|A common {{explanation}} for this supposed phenomenon is that manufactured goods have a greater income elasticity of demand than <b>primary</b> <b>products,</b> especially food. Therefore, as incomes rise, the demand for manufactured goods increases more rapidly than demand for <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> have a low price elasticity of demand, so a decline in their prices tends to reduce revenue rather than increase it.|$|R

5000|$|To {{determine}} equilibrium, we {{need only}} {{to look at the}} market for one of the goods, as per Walras' law. We consider the market for the South's goods: <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b> The demand for imports, M, from the South is a positive function of per capita consumption in the North and a negative function of the terms of trade, , (higher [...] means relative price of <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> is high and less will be demanded). The supply side comes from export of <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> by the South, X, and is a positive function of the terms of trade and the South’s aggregate consumption of <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the Prebisch hypothesis that <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> prices {{relative to the}} price of manufacturers fall during cyclical downturns by more than they rise during cyclical upturns and that this is an independent explanation of the secular tendency of the net barter terms of trade to move against primary commodities. An important distinction is made between <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> exported by less developed countries and those exported by developed countries. The greater cyclicality of <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> prices, and the long-run deterioration in their terms of trade since 1954 are confirmed, but there is little support for the Prebisch thesis that <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> prices relative to manufacturers are move sensitive on the downswing than the upswing...|$|R

The <b>Primary</b> <b>Product</b> Unismoke is obtained from a specified mixture of oak (Quercus alba) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). The production of Unismoke comprises the following steps: (i) preparation of the correct oak/beech ratio and drying, (ii) pyrolysis of the wood mixture in a rotating drum kiln in an inert atmosphere, (iii) cleaning and condensing of the pyrolysis vapours, (iv) separation of tar and conditioning of the supernatant phase to the <b>Primary</b> <b>Product.</b> The applicant has provided essential parameters of the manufacturing process...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{identifies}} {{and compares}} the energy balance of winter wheat, spring barley and white mustard – all grown in crop rotation under different tillage conditions. The field trial included the conventional tillage (CT) method, minimum tillage (MT) {{and a system}} with no tillage (NT). The energy inputs included both the direct and indirect energy component. Energy outputs are evaluated as gross calorific value (gross heating value of phytomass dry matter) of the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and the total harvested production. The energy effectiveness (energy output: energy input) was selected for evaluation. The greatest energy effectiveness for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> was established as 6. 35 for barley, 6. 04 for wheat and 3. 68 for mustard; {{in the case of}} total production, it was 9. 82 for barley, 10. 08 for wheat and 9. 72 for mustard. When comparing the different tillage conditions, the greatest energy effectiveness was calculated for the evaluated crops under the MT operation and represented the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of wheat at 6. 49, barley at 6. 69 and mustard at 3. 92. The smallest energy effectiveness for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> was found in wheat 5. 77 and barley 6. 10 under the CT option; it was 3. 55 for mustard under the option of NT. Throughout the entire cropping pattern, the greatest energy effectiveness was established under the minimum tillage option – 5. 70 for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and 10. 47 for the total production. On the other hand, the smallest values were calculated under CT – 5. 22 for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and 9. 71 for total production...|$|R
