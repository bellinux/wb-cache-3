R'esum'e Dans ce papier, on consid`ere la conception d'un controlleur PID "anti-windup" `a partir des in'egalit'es matricielles lin'eaires. Keywords: Nonlinear control, anti-windup, actuator saturation. Acknowledgements This research was partially supported by NSERC. 1 Introduction The introduction of integral action to a controller to eliminate steady state tracking errors {{is an old}} technique in control. This is done in both classical PID controllers, {{as well as in}} modern control techniques which incorporate integral weighting terms (possibly multivariable). However, it has been long observed that controller performance/stability deteriorates dramatically due to actuator saturation especially when such integral action is added. (The destabilising effect is known as integrator or reset windup.) As this problem was quite <b>pressing,</b> <b>means</b> to deal with it were also developed quite ear [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Disturbed {{synaptic}} transmission {{contributes to}} the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Post mortem studies reported reduced expression of the synaptic vesicle protein (SVP) complexins I and II in depression. Antidepressants were found to induce the expression of these genes. Since animals with congenital susceptibility to learned helplessness provide a valid animal model of depression, we investigated the expression of different SVPs in this system by semiquantitative in situ hybridization. Rats bred for congenital learned helpless behavior (cLH, N= 6) failed to interrupt foot shock currents by lever <b>pressing</b> (<b>mean</b> 12. 3 failures out of 15 trials). These animals showed significantly lower expression of complexins I and II mRNA in hippocampal, limbic and cortical brain areas compared to not helpless animals (cNLH, N= 6) with a mean failure rate of 0. 83 out of 15 trials. Expression levels of complexins I and II significantly correlated with the failure rate in the test paradigm. In contrast, the expressions of synaptotagmin I and synaptophysin were found unchanged. This investigation provides a further validation of the LH model of depression. The experimental data fit well into current pathogenetic concepts of mood disorders and support the hypothesis, that complexins are pivotal players in the pathophysiology of depression and tentative targets of antidepressants...|$|R

40|$|Creases are marks {{that are}} created {{and left in}} a fabric during gament wear. Pressing is a process to flatten garment panels and sharpen garment edges and pleats. To {{minimize}} crease, the fabric should recover after pressing without creating a creased edge. Whereas, good <b>pressing</b> performance <b>means</b> the creased edge stays sharp after pressing. Good crease recovery and pressing performance appear contradictory. However, crease recovery and pressing performance are different as creases are formed during waer and pressing is carried out using equipment such as iron, pressing machines, etc. The condition, i. e. temperature. The latter has much higher temperature, pressure and humidity. This paper reports on an experimental investigation {{on the relationship between}} the crease recovery and pressing performance of wood and other fabrics. It was found that there are only generally weak to moderate relationships between the crease recovery as measured by the Shirley Crease Recovery Tester and the pressing performance as measured by the Siro-Press Tester. The characteristics of wood fabrics, which have both crease recovery and pressing performance, are identified. This study is a step toward fabric engineering. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|High-performance Nb 3 Sn {{conductors}} {{are intended}} {{to be used in}} large-scale magnets like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and in the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Due to the occurrence of high electromagnetic forces, a detailed knowledge of the response of the critical current to the three-dimensional mechanical loads acting on the wires inside the cables is required. A detailed analysis of transverse stress effects on the critical current for powder-in-tube and bronze route Nb 3 Sn wires is presented. In an earlier publication, we have described the effect of transverse stress exerted on a Nb 3 Sn wire by means of two parallel plates. In the present paper, we analyse the effect of transverse stress exerted simultaneously by four walls on a wire being confined in a U-shaped groove. In order to get a more realistic picture of the situation of wires embedded in a Rutherford cable, the compression by four walls was also performed after impregnating the wire with epoxy in the same U-shaped groove. The result {{is very different from the}} case of <b>pressing</b> by <b>means</b> of two walls: the effect of pressure on Ic is now strongly reduced, which is attributed to the almost hydrostatic pressure in the U-shaped groove. This is further confirmed by the comparison between the effects of axial and transverse loads on the upper critical field and the pinning force. The present data are also compared against the effects of mechanical load on the critical current of cables in large-scale magnet...|$|R
30|$|The most {{well-known}} commercial methods of Si 3 N 4 production are a {{hot isostatic pressing}} (HIP) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). SPS {{which is one of}} the most innovative and promising methods of producing silicon nitride means sintering and sinter-bonding at low temperatures and short periods by charging the intervals between powder particles with electrical energy and effectively applying a high-temperature spark plasma. SPS systems offer many advantages over conventional systems using hot press (HP) sintering, HIP, or atmospheric furnaces, including ease of operation and accurate control of sintering energy as well as high sintering speed, high reproducibility, safety, and reliability. It is well known that an important role is played by the type of structure obtained by SPS. For instance, Peng have shown that using conventional hot pressing Y- and Yb-stabilized monophasic α-SiAlONs with stoichiometric composition retains the equiaxed morphology even at very high temperatures [1]. Peng also note that conditions suitable for elongated grain growth have never been established in such systems because of the lack of the formation and subsequent decomposition of intermediate phases during sintering. It should also be noted that the elongated morphology formation of structure is strongly controlled by such factors as a temperature and/or an extra liquid. However, there are two main points. First of all, in the absence of nitrogen overpressure, the silicon nitride dissociation begins above 1900  °C, and secondly, a large amount of liquid which later becomes the glass phase may reduce high-temperature properties of silicon nitride [1]. The spark plasma sintering is a modified method of hot <b>pressing.</b> SPS <b>means</b> a direct transmission of electric current directly through the mold and the pressed workpiece, and not through the external heater in comparison with the HP. Fast heating and short cycle times are achieved by a pulsed electric current and a so-called spark plasma effect.|$|R

Various microstructures of the alloy were produced: the one with a coarse-grained (CG) structure after T 6 heat treatment; the one with a homogeneous ultrafine-grained (UFG) structure and the one with a bimodal (mixed) structure, both processed by equal-channel angular <b>pressing</b> (ECAP). The <b>mean</b> grain size and morphology of precipitates were studied by transmission electron microscopy. The ultimate tensile strength and the fatigue endurance limit were determined using the tensile and fatigue tests of standard specimens. It is established that {{the formation of a}} homogeneous UFG structure and of a bimodal (mixed) structure alloy contributes to a significant increase in microhardness by 16 % and 60 %, and an increase of the ultimate tensile strength by 20 and 52 %, respectively, as compared to the samples subjected to T 6 heat treatment. Fatigue tests show that the alloy with a bimodal (mixed) structure has the highest fatigue endurance limit, 45 % higher than in the sample subjected to T 6 heat treatment. In contrast, the formation of a homogeneous UFG structure enables increasing the fatigue endurance limit by 15 % only...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{fabric of}} flags is {{inextricably}} woven into our cultural heritage. Throughout civilization flags have heralded national identity in war and peace, {{as symbols of}} both victor and defender. Research into the origins of early 1800 flag fabrics wove a fascinating tie to England, where the wool fabric was made, and why it survived while the weaving industry was mechanized during the industrial revolution. Bunting fabric provided the canvas for the flag {{as a symbol of}} a nation and its people. This makes the history of bunting and its struggle for survival into the nineteenth century, an integral facet of our history. In England the fabric trade was being driven by the new economics and scale of production brought about by the industrial revolution. Bunting was used almost exclusively for flags, and its survival through this period was aided by the very structure of the fabric itself. Heavier fabrics were woven by men, but the lightweight character and smaller dimensions of bunting meant it could be woven by women and children. This provided not only a welcome but a necessary contribution to the economic wellbeing of working class households. The manufacture of bunting was a cottage industry based in the region around the village of Sudbury in Suffolk, a manufacturing town dating back to medieval times. With changes in transportation and the availability of new routes, the proximity of Sudbury to London allowed local clothiers easier access to principal buyers of bunting, and consequently close access to import trade in bunting. Textile Manufacture in Early Modern England While the woolen industry had been prevalent in England for centuries, a colony of Flemish worsted weavers settled in Sudbury, Suffolk during the reign of Edward III (1312 - 1377). The Flemings also introduced the jersey tammy that was being made in Norwich in the 1570 s. Jersey bunting was a variety of tammy suitable for flags as its wool yarns were opaque even in the strongest light. The first unequivocal record of worsted tammy manufacturing was in Norwich, Norfolk in 1605. There was a gradual spelling change from estamet to tammy to tamett, and by 1633 this became tammett. A stammet or tammy yarn was one that had been shrunk and smoothed by scouring and a tammy cloth the cloth woven from these yarns. The worsted tammies were lightweight, plain-weave fabrics, thinly warped so they were strong and stringy. They were often highly glazed by hot <b>pressing</b> and other <b>means.</b> A special form of the tammy called bunt or bunting was sold for making flags...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of the {{accidental}} varieties of man, which would occur {{among the first}} few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa,' he wrote, 'some one would be better fitted than the others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply, while the others would decrease; not only from their inability to sustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours.... The same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race would {{in the course of}} time occur; and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate, this would at last become the most prevalent, if not the only race in the country.' Here we have not merely the radical concept of natural selection, but also the subordinate idea of its exertion upon what Darwin calls 'spontaneous variations.' What is wanting in the paper is the application of the faintly descried law to the facts and circumstances of general biology: Wells saw only a particular instance, where Darwin and Wallace more vividly perceived a universal principle. Again, in 1831, Mr. Patrick Matthew in that singular appendix to his book on naval timber actually enunciates the same idea, applied this time to the whole of nature, in words sometimes almost identical with Darwin's own. 'As nature in all her modifications of life,' says this unconscious discoverer, 'has a power of increase far beyond what is needed to supply the place of what falls by Time's decay, those individuals who possess not the requisite strength, swiftness, hardihood, or cunning, fall prematurely without reproducing--either a prey to their natural devourers, or sinking under disease, generally induced by want of nourishment, their place being occupied by the more perfect of their own kind, who are <b>pressing</b> on the <b>means</b> of existence.... The self-regulating adaptive disposition of organised life may, in part, be traced to the extreme fecundity of nature, who, as before stated, has in all the varieties of her offspring a prolific power much beyond (in many cases a thousandfold) what is necessary to fill up the vacancies caused by senile decay. As the field of existence is limited and preoccupied, it is only the hardier, more robust, better-suited-to-circumstance individuals, who are able to struggle forward to maturity, these inhabiting only the situations to which they have superior adaptation and greater power of occupancy than any other kind; the weaker and less circumstance-suited being prematurely destroyed. This principle is in constant action; it regulates the colour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts; those individuals in each species whose colour and covering are best suited to concealment or protection from enemies, or defence from inclemencies and vicissitudes of climate, whose figure is best accommodated to health, strength, defence, and support; whose capacities and instincts can best regulate the physical energies to self-advantage according to circumstances--in such immense waste of primary and youthful life those only come forward to maturity from the strict ordeal by which nature tests their adaptation to her standard of perfection and fitness to continue their kind by reproduction.' Of the ideas expressed in these paragraphs, and others which preceded them, Darwin himself rightly observes, 'He gives precisely the same view on the origin of species as that propounded by Mr. Wallace and myself. He clearly saw the full force of the principle of natural selection.' ...|$|R
