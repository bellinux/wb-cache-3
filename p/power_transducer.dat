40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the characterization of}} nonlinearities in a Langevin-type ultrasonic <b>power</b> <b>transducer</b> using pulse excitations and a time reversal focalization technique. The nonlinear behavior of this <b>power</b> <b>transducer</b> is evaluated analyzing the signal obtained after focalization in time reversal process. In a linear regime, time reversal produces a focused pulse which amplitude and width depends only on the transducer’s transfer function. When the supplied power is increased, three non-linear effects appear in the systems response. First, the focus shape loss symmetry respect to center; second, the focus amplitude increases without proportionality to input voltage, and finally, in the frequency spectrum appears harmonics of the thickness mode resonance frequency. The displacement at the end transducer surface was measured by an optical fiber vibrometer. Traditional frequency domain methods are also used to show phase variations close to each resonance frequency.

40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of automated monitoring, control and optimization systems for mineral processing applications require accurate online mass flow measurements from the processes. The mass flow sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. Belt scale {{is the most common}} online bulk material mass flow sensor used in the mineral processing. The belt scale provides an accurate online mass flow measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online mass flow measurements of the belt scales, offline mass flow measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline mass flow sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline mass flow sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online mass flow sensors against the reference mass flow measurement of the belt scale. The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three mass flow estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online mass flow sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online mass flow sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online mass flow sensors used in this work are a <b>power</b> <b>transducer,</b> laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant.

Large changes in building power such as those due to central heating and cooling systems, water heaters, or banks of lights can easily be discriminated from total building power profiles collected by the system. Smaller loads, less than 1 or 2 kW, can be resolved when there is little ``noise`` in the power profile. Very small loads, less than 100 W, can be resolved in a residential application. Resolution becomes more difficult as larger and more frequent fluctuations occur. The ability of the system to easily collect valuable, short-term building power profiles, which permit individual loads to be determined (resolved), makes the system attractive for a number of applications. The system could prove very useful for measuring short-term energy use and demand, assisting building energy auditors in assessing building deficiencies, providing short-term performance data for validating engineering-based savings estimates and calibrating computer-based building performance models, and for validating, developing, and/or improving building and building system operating strategies...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the design and construction of high <b>power</b> ultrasound <b>transducers</b> {{as well as some}} of the effects of high power ultrasound. The two design approaches that are researched and applied are the equivalent circuit method and Finite Element Method (FEM). These methods are used in conjunction with each other to design three different transducers, which are then built and tested at low and high powers...|$|R
40|$|For high <b>power</b> {{ultrasound}} <b>transducers,</b> the poling {{condition of}} the piezoceramic is crucial for stable and continuous operation. In this investigation, poling during the temperature-timepaths heating and cooling in addition to poling at constant temperatures were investigated and evaluated regarding the achieved poling result. The planar coupling factor and large signal loss factor are used for characterization. From the results, poling process parameters can be derived, minimizing losses while maximizing the electromechanical coupling...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{processing}} of acoustic signals introduces pulses to measurement of impedances and transfer functions of ultrasonic systems. Digital impulse measurements of electroacoustic transducers {{described in the}} paper are based on comparison between the Fourier transforms of the input signals and {{the responses of the}} ultrasonic systems. Measuring signals consisting of two separate parts have been used where the <b>power</b> piezoelectric <b>transducer</b> is the input part of the system. Similarly, the output response also has two parts...|$|R
