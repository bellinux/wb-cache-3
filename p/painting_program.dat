5|$|The United States Navy {{implemented}} a camouflage <b>painting</b> <b>program</b> in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each {{identified with a}} number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. Not all United States Navy measures involved dazzle patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false bow wave on traditional Haze Gray, or Deck Blue replacing grey over part {{or all of the}} ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). Dazzle measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use dazzle, ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific.|$|E

50|$|James McGarrell began {{painting}} {{in the basement of}} his parents' house at age 20. His first formal art studies were at Indiana University and at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine. He then entered the graduate <b>painting</b> <b>program</b> at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1955 McGarrell had his first solo exhibition at the Frank Perls Gallery in Beverly Hills and received a Fulbright grant to the State Academy of Art in Stuttgart, Germany. After returning from Germany in 1956, McGarrell began a long distinguished academic career at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Three years later he returned to Indiana University to direct the graduate <b>painting</b> <b>program.</b> In 1981 he accepted a position in the School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, where he remained until his retirement from teaching in 1993. He has also been an artist in residence at many institutions for short periods, most notably at Skowhegan, the International School in Umbria, Rice University, the University of Utah, Arizona State University, and Dartmouth College.|$|E
