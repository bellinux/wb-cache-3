5|$|On February 17, 2012, Thaddeus McMichael {{was arrested}} by the FBI for child <b>pornography</b> charges, after posting {{comments}} on Facebook claiming that he possessed child <b>pornography.</b> According to the official criminal complaint filed against Thaddeus, he admitted to obtaining child <b>pornography</b> from the /b/ board on 4chan.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or <b>pornography.</b> While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, <b>pornography</b> is subject to little regulation. However, the definitions of obscenity and <b>pornography</b> have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} <b>pornography</b> range from {{condemnation}} of <b>pornography</b> {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of <b>pornography</b> as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Williams (2008), the Court {{upheld the}} PROTECT Act of 2003, ruling that prohibiting offers to provide and {{requests}} to obtain child <b>pornography</b> {{did not violate}} the First Amendment, even if a person charged under the Act did not possess child <b>pornography.</b>|$|E
5|$|Collin Campbell, a U.S. Navy Machinist's Mate, {{was arrested}} in February 2011 after a fellow seaman found child <b>pornography</b> on his iPhone that he {{downloaded}} entirely from 4chan.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Keating's {{national}} {{reputation on}} the issue led President Nixon to appoint him to the President's Commission on Obscenity and <b>Pornography,</b> which had been begun under Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson. The majority on the commission issued a report which concluded that <b>pornography</b> does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime and recommended that all federal, state, and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed. Keating, Nixon's only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissenter from the report.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child <b>pornography</b> (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child <b>pornography</b> that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, a 21-year-old {{man from}} Virginia, whose {{computer}} coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underaged girls {{with whom he}} had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by ransomware purporting to be an FBI message accusing him of possessing child <b>pornography.</b> An investigation discovered the incriminating files, and the man was charged with child sexual abuse and possession of child <b>pornography.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{discovered}} that Howard Cotterman boarded {{a flight to}} Mexico on April 9, 2007, with a final destination of Sydney, Australia. On April 11, 2007, Agent Owen was able to break the computer security and discovered 378 more images of child <b>pornography.</b> Cotterman was indicted on June 27, 2007 for several charges related to child <b>pornography</b> and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He was arrested by Australian law officials and delivered to the U.S. Marshals Service on March 31, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses sell {{food and}} drinks, cigarettes, <b>pornography,</b> sex toys, lubricants, and toiletries. Some bathhouses also provide non-sexual {{services}} such as massage and reflexology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pornography</b> ranks higher {{because it}} is {{considered}} a perversion of the sexual act that is intended for distribution to third parties for viewing.|$|E
5|$|Ronald Ohlson, 37, was raided April 2011 at his upstate New York {{home by the}} Department of Homeland Security {{after he}} {{obtained}} child <b>pornography</b> from 4chan.|$|E
5|$|After 4chan {{reported}} a 15-year-old boy in California who posted child <b>pornography,</b> the United States Department of Homeland Security raided {{his home on}} June 7, 2011, and took all his electronic items.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss civil rights litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating <b>pornography.</b> In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on <b>pornography,</b> where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on <b>pornography</b> into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some <b>pornography</b> {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as <b>pornography</b> distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child <b>pornography</b> or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Keating was a {{champion}} swimmer for the University of Cincinnati in the 1940s. From the late 1950s through the 1970s, {{he was a}} noted anti-pornography activist, founding the organization Citizens for Decent Literature and serving as a member on the 1969 President's Commission on Obscenity and <b>Pornography.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined <b>pornography</b> as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from <b>pornography</b> to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Ronald Reagan as {{president}} in 1981, ushered in an eight-year period of conservative {{leadership in the}} U.S. government. Under his leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda, including outlawing abortion, inserting prayer in schools, banning <b>pornography,</b> and resisting gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, {{there were no}} federal laws {{specifically}} addressing the production, distribution or possession of child <b>pornography,</b> and it was readily available to those who sought it. While most was imported from European countries where it was legally produced in large quantities {{there was also a}} domestic industry.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} friends browse the {{internet}} for <b>pornography,</b> finding a live stream of a woman bound to a chair. Behind her a number is painted on the wall; when the feed's web counter reaches the painted number, a masked man appears and cuts the girl's throat. The boys quickly print {{an image of the}} feed as proof of what they have seen, just before the website disappears.|$|E
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as <b>pornography.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside from wrestling, Martinez is {{also known}} for her acting and {{modelling}} work. She was a contestant on the reality television show, The Search for the Next Elvira, and has also appeared in films. She starred in The Notorious Jewel De'Nyle & Shelly Martinez, a softcore <b>pornography</b> video alongside Jewel De'Nyle, and has also posed nude on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Beirut, Khalifa {{moved to}} the United States in 2000. She began acting in <b>pornography</b> in October 2014, and by December was ranked the number 1 {{performer}} on the website Pornhub. Her career choice was met with controversy in the Middle East, especially for a video in which she performed sexual acts while wearing the Islamic hijab. She was nevertheless disillusioned with the pornographic industry and left it after three months.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in <b>pornography)</b> have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Flyers {{distributed}} to recruit participants said {{the attack was}} to begin at 8pmAEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers. Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received {{a large amount of}} traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon <b>pornography,</b> female ejaculation, and small-breasted <b>pornography.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) {{contemporary and}} historical <b>pornography</b> {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, The New York Times Book Review {{published}} a lengthy letter of hers {{in which she}} describes the origins of her deeply felt hatred of prostitution and <b>pornography</b> ("mass-produced, technologized prostitution") as her history of being violently inspected by prison doctors, and battered by her first husband and numerous other men.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Dworkin {{published}} {{a collection of}} her speeches and articles from the 1990s in Life and Death: Unapologetic Writings on the Continuing War on Women, including a long autobiographical essay on {{her life as a}} writer, and articles on violence against women, <b>pornography,</b> prostitution, Nicole Brown Simpson, the use of rape during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Montreal massacre, Israel, and the gender politics of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540 (1992), {{is a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Supreme Court {{regarding}} the criminal procedure topic of entrapment. A narrowly divided court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child <b>pornography</b> through the mail, ruling that postal inspectors had implanted a desire to do so through repeated written entreaties.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching <b>pornography,</b> and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan has {{recently}} begun {{a relationship with}} an old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be too dangerous an occupation. Jonathan {{is still in the}} employment of the magician Adam Klaus, whose television series is receiving heavy criticism from viewers. To Jonathan's bemusement, Klaus invests in the 3D <b>pornography</b> industry and begins dating the porn actress Candy Mountains (Jemma Walker).|$|E
5|$|Keith Jacobson {{was offered}} only two {{opportunities}} to buy child <b>pornography</b> through the mail. Both times, he ordered. Both times, {{he asked for}} opportunities to buy more. He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or suggested that his committing the crime would further a greater good. In fact, no Government agent even contacted him face to face.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lois urges Peter {{to watch}} {{relationship}} videos with her, but the videos {{turn out to}} be <b>pornography</b> hosted by Dr. Amanda Rebecca, who strips after asking the women to leave the room. Peter becomes addicted to the videos, much to Lois's chagrin. She gets herself on the end of one of the tapes in black lingerie and entices Peter. While kissing, Peter rewinds the tape, playing the part of Lois taking her robe off over and over.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector {{to be on the}} lookout for child <b>pornography</b> and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E
5|$|Samson {{has gained}} {{mainstream}} recognition with appearances on television {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live, The Daily Show and 30 Rock. Her wide range of activities outside <b>pornography</b> include working as a sex-advice columnist, a radio presenter and a political correspondent. She also produces her own line of wines, has a recording contract with E1 Music and is a trained ballerina.|$|E
