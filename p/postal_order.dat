5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by <b>postal</b> <b>order</b> from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E

The Epitaph reported on February 27, 1882 that S. Mansfield of Tombstone was returning from the west with other passengers, passing through Colton, California. In March 1882, Sadie sent a postal money order to her mother, Mrs. H. Marcus, in San Francisco. She didn't use either Marcus or Behan as her name, but asked a friend to send the <b>postal</b> <b>order</b> for her.|$|E

In July 2006, a set of 3 British <b>postal</b> <b>orders</b> overprinted [...] "Canada" [...] and the word [...] "Specimen" [...] turned up and were sold on eBay for £7,123.

50|$|In 1881, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland {{included}} Ireland but in 1922, {{three-quarters of}} the island became independent as the Irish Free State and began its own independent issues of <b>postal</b> <b>orders.</b> Since 1922, British <b>postal</b> <b>orders</b> have been issued in the four parts of the UK (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales). In the 1880s and 1890s, the issue of British <b>postal</b> <b>orders</b> spread to most parts of {{what was then the}} British Empire. As time went on, the issue of British <b>postal</b> <b>orders</b> declined {{in most parts of the}} British Empire, later the British Commonwealth.

60|$|DEAR UNCLE:--I was {{disappointed}} at not {{hearing from you}} this morning, but conclude you are very busy. I don't want Hope's books, but I think I'll rather have a football. We played Gloucester on Tuesday and beat them all to sticks (five goals two tries to one try!!!). It would cost 7s. 6d., and I'll make up the one-and-six myself out of my pocket-money; but you can pay it all just now, and then I'll pay you later when I am more flush than I am at present. I'd better buy it myself, or you might not get the right kind, so you might send the money in a <b>postal</b> <b>order</b> by return. You get the postal orders at the nearest postoffice, and inclose them in a letter. I want the football at once. (1) Not a book of any kind whatever; (2) a football, but I'll buy it myself; (3) price 7s. 6d.; (4) send <b>postal</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
