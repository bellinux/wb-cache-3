2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many {{technical}} jobs were seen as nerdy.

A 1998 seismic safety study on the California campus gave the stadium a [...] "poor" [...] rating (meaning that the building represents an [...] "appreciable life hazard" [...] in an earthquake), and estimated the cost of making the structure safe at $14 million. Because the stadium is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and because of the nostalgia that surrounds the site, the university decided that a retrofit and renovation (as opposed to building a new stadium elsewhere) would be the best scenario for the California football program. In February 2005, Chancellor Robert Birgeneau announced plans to renovate Memorial Stadium, improving the existing facilities and creating a safer environment for the fans as well as the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> at the stadium.
