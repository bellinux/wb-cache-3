5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to <b>play</b> <b>along.</b> The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to <b>play</b> <b>along,</b> except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E
5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with the {{discount}} that they {{decided to make the}} company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, <b>play</b> <b>along</b> with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E

5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, <b>play</b> <b>along.</b> This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then <b>play</b> <b>along</b> with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E
5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, {{although no one}} saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and {{reported that he had}} seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to <b>play</b> <b>along</b> when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.|$|E

5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches <b>play</b> <b>along</b> the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the film's $225 {{million budget}} (almost $100 million {{of which were}} spent on the effects), Disney also spent $175 million on {{promoting}} the film. <b>Play</b> <b>Along</b> Toys created a playset of Miraz's castle, a series of 3¾-inch and 7-inch action figures, and roleplaying costumes. Weta Workshop's Collectibles unit also created statues, busts and helmets based on their props for the film, {{and there was also}} a Monopoly edition based on the film. In the UK, Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools, which are available from the official UK Narnia website. In June 2008, the Journey into Narnia: Prince Caspian Attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios, featuring a recreation of the Stone Table, behind-the-scenes footage, concept art, storyboards, props and costumes from the film. The tone of the film's marketing focused on the film's action, and unlike The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible-based study guides in North America.|$|E
5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to <b>play</b> <b>along</b> and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be the first to get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 Mitchell-Innes {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team. The side lacked the batting {{strength}} of the previous years, and {{he was forced to}} move himself from his preferred position of batting at number three or four, to open the batting during the season. The batting suffered a further blow just prior to the University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to <b>play.</b> <b>Along</b> with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led the batting averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as unremarkable.|$|E
5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. He presents a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't do it without rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead the one from the parallel universe. Olivia continues to <b>play</b> <b>along,</b> explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E

When Kanchana rejects the proposal, Viswanathan asks Nirmala, who happily accepts. Sachidanandam, who is buying a nearby estate, is referred to Viswanathan and arrives in Chinnamalai. They meet and discover that they are childhood friends. Thinking {{it would be inappropriate}} to marry off his younger daughter while the elder one is still unmarried, Viswanathan arranges Kanchana's marriage to Vasu, who meets his father is unable to reveal his true identity to prevent getting caught. When Sachidanandam returns to Chennai to make the wedding preparations, he finds that there has been no word from his son, who left for Coimbatore weeks before. Sachidanandam almost cancels the marriage when Vasu makes a telephone call {{in the nick of time}} and approves the marriage.|$|E

5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to <b>play</b> <b>along</b> behind your scratching.|$|E
