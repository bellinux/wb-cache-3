25|$|Suitable and {{manageable}} {{models are}} needed for the propagation of electromagnetic signals (or waves) through various media, such as air, taking into account multipath propagation (due to reflection, refraction, diffraction and dispersion) caused by signals colliding with obstacles such as buildings. The <b>propagation</b> <b>model</b> is a building block of the stochastic geometry wireless network model. A common approach is to consider propagation models with two separate parts consisting of the random and deterministic (or non-random) components of signal propagation.|$|E
25|$|Papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans, Foschini and Emre Telatar {{have shown}} that the channel {{capacity}} (a theoretical upper bound on system throughput) for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in information theory is what led to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel <b>propagation</b> <b>model</b> and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.|$|E
25|$|A {{wireless}} network consists of nodes (each {{of which is}} a transmitter, receiver or both, depending on the system) that produce, relay or consume data within the network. For example, base stations and users in a cellular phone network or sensor nodes in a sensor network. Before developing stochastic geometry wireless models, models are required for mathematically representing the signal propagation and the node positioning. The <b>propagation</b> <b>model</b> captures how signals propagate from transmitters to receivers. The node location or positioning model (idealizes and) represents the positions of the nodes as a point process. The choice of these models depends {{on the nature of the}} {{wireless network}} and its environment. The network type depends on such factors as the specific architecture (for instance cellular) and the channel or medium access control (MAC) protocol, which controls the channels and, hence, the communicating structures of the network. In particular, to prevent the collision of transmissions in the network, the MAC protocol dictates, based on certain rules, when transmitter-receiver pairs can access the network both in time and space, which also affects the active node positioning model.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{variety of}} <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> have been {{reported}} in the literature that approximate characteristics of a radio channel, including path loss, shadowing, and multipath effects. These models provide some insight into the effects of different channel characteristics on wireless communication systems. Models can be used for preliminary evaluation of system alternatives before investing in prototype hardware. Current <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> do not consider the polarization of transmitted signal, depolarization introduced by the channel, or polarized multipath. <b>Propagation</b> <b>models</b> that include polarization effects will be useful for evaluating the performance of polarization-sensitive adaptive arrays and diversity reception techniques.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveOur {{goals were}} {{to study the}} <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> in a {{situation}} of persistent temporal epileptic seizures with varying degrees of bitemporal excitability and to analyze which <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> were found at times of high temporal excitability and which occurred with lower levels of excitability. MethodsA patient with super-refractory status arising from the temporal lobes was studied daily using video-electroencephalography (VEEG), with a large number of electroclinical seizures recorded. The analysis focused on the method and type of seizure propagation and classified them either according to the <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> described in the literature or as undetermined. ResultsVideo-EEG monitoring was carried out daily for 310 days. A total of 990 electroclinical seizures were recorded; 135 seizures were recorded during the first week, and 523 were recorded in the first month. From the beginning, the interictal recording showed independent discharges over both temporal lobes. The seizures showed independent onset in both temporal lobes. During periods of the highest number of seizures, certain <b>models</b> of <b>propagation</b> begin to predominate through switch of lateralization, temporal asynchrony, early remote propagation, total contralateral propagation, seizures with nonlocalized onset, or models that are difficult to classify. Conversely, when the condition was brought relatively under control, we observed fewer <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> with predominantly simple patterns: only hemispheric propagation or graduated sequential propagation with a few nonlateralized onset seizures. ConclusionsUpon analyzing the seizures, we found that the <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> vary as the status evolved, with the change reflecting the degree of excitability in the mesial temporalâ€“limbic network at a given time. In clinical practice, these changes in <b>propagation</b> <b>models</b> {{are more likely to be}} observed in temporal status that extends over time and with an onset of the seizures in both temporal lobes.
