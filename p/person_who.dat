40|$|AIDS among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs, first {{identified}} in December 1981, {{has become a}} global epidemic. Injecting drug use {{has been reported in}} 148 countries and HIV infection has been seen among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs in 61 countries. Many locations have experienced outbreaks of HIV infection among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs, under specific conditions that promote very rapid spread of the virus. In response to these HIV outbreaks, specific interventions for <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs include needle/syringe exchange programs, medicated-assisted treatment (with methadone or buprenorphine) and antiretroviral therapy. Through a 'combined prevention' approach, these interventions significantly reduced new HIV infections among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs in several locations including New York City, Vancouver and France. The efforts effectively ended the HIV epidemic among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs in those locations. This review examines possible processes through which combined prevention programs may lead to ending HIV epidemics. However, notable outbreaks of HIV among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs have recently occurred in several countries, including in Athens, Greece; Tel-Aviv, Israel; Dublin, Ireland; as well as in Scott County, Indiana, USA. This review also considers different factors that may have led to these outbreaks. We conclude with addressing the remaining challenges for reducing HIV infection among <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs...|$|R

Significant lymphocyte transformation induced by this soluble antigen occurred with cells from <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> had recovered from blastomycosis as much as 16 years previously, indicating long-lasting cell-mediated immunity to B. dermatitidis.
