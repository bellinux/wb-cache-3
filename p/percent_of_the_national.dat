5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s {{also saw}} the growth of several authoritarian and fascist {{political}} parties in both Wallonia and Flanders. In the 1936 elections, one of these, the French-speaking Rexist party, gained 11.6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> vote. By 1939 however, extremist parties lost many of the seats that they had previously gained in new elections and political stability seemed to be returning.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade or two, an {{increasing}} number of migrants from countries neighboring Thailand have moved to Thailand temporarily or permanently in search for jobs and life security, causing an increase in the labor supply in the Thai labor market. This paper attempts to find economic contribution of these migrant workers to Thailand using various data sources and a collection of related findings. We find that capital gains from migrant workers show an increasing trend from around 0. 03 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>national</b> income (880 million baht) in 1995 to around 0. 055 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>national</b> income (2, 039 million baht) in 2005.

5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs {{and its ability}} to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E
