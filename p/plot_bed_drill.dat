40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} during two years (2007 - 2009) in Shawoor Agricultural Research Station on a silty-clay soil. Experiment conducted in split plots in a Randomized Complete Blocks Design in three replications. Main plots were planting methods including centrifugal broadcaster (P 1), centrifugal broadcaster + furrower (P 2), seed drill (P 3), seed drill + furrower (P 4), three lines <b>bed</b> <b>drilling</b> (P 5) and four lines <b>bed</b> <b>drilling</b> (P 6). Subplots were included seed rates of 120, 160, 200 and 240 kg. ha- 1. The results showed that P 2 method with 14. 91 litter. ha- 1 and P 3 method with 5. 02 litter. ha- 1 had the highest and lowest fuel consumption respectively. P 3 method with 1. 462 h. ha- 1 and P 5 method with 0. 620 h. ha- 1 required maximum and minimum total operation time respectively. P 2 method with 0. 684 ha. h- 1 had minimum field capacity. Field capacity of P 5 and P 6 with averagely 1. 67 ha. h- 1 was maximum. Field capacity of all drilling methods (P 3, P 4, P 5 and P 6) was significantly more than that of broadcasting methods (P 1 and P 2). The highest seed spacing uniformity (87. 2 %) was belonged to P 6 method and the lowest value (54. 7 %) was for P 1 method. By using drilling methods of P 3 and P 5 (or P 6) instead of P 1 method total cost was reduced 41 % and 29 % respectively.

40|$|Accessing and {{sampling}} subglacial environments deep {{beneath the}} Antarctic Ice Sheet presents several challenges to existing drilling technologies. With {{over half of}} the ice sheet believed to be resting on a wet <b>bed,</b> <b>drilling</b> down to this environment must conform to international agreements on environmental stewardship and protection, making clean hot-water drilling the most viable option. Such a drill, and its water recovery system, must be capable of accessing significantly greater ice depths than previous hot-water drills, and remain fully operational after connecting with the basal hydrological system. The Subglacial Lake Ellsworth (SLE) project developed a comprehensive plan for deep (greater than 3000 ?m) subglacial lake research, involving the design and development of a clean deep-ice hot-water drill. However, during fieldwork in December 2012 drilling was halted after a succession of equipment issues culminated in a failure to link with a subsurface cavity and abandonment of the access holes. The lessons learned from this experience are presented here. Combining knowledge gained from these lessons with experience from other hot-water drilling programmes, and recent field testing, we describe the most viable technical options and operational procedures for future clean entry into SLE and other deep subglacial access targets. <br/...|$|R

The gravel from Core 316 -C 0007 c- 17 H is from a 1. 7 m thick layer, whereas the gravel from Core 316 -C 0007 D- 12 R is from a layer 4. 55 m thick. The upper parts of both layers are normally graded. The gravel is clast-supported, polymictic, of granule to pebble size, moderately to poorly sorted, and with subrounded to angular fragments. Clast types are similar from both cores with abundant fine-grained sedimentary clasts that are well cemented, and many clasts contain small quartz veins indicative of a source with a very low metamorphic grade. The main sedimentary clast types are chert of various colors (black, gray, light yellow-brown, clear and rare red and purple), siltstone, and sandstone. Other clast types are vein quartz and igneous clasts of mainly intermediate volcanic composition, minor plutonic rock fragments, and minor metamorphic rock fragments.

5000|$|When {{the river}} courses over {{resistant}} bedrock, erosion happens slowly and {{is dominated by}} impacts of water-borne sediment on the rock, while downstream the erosion occurs more rapidly. As the watercourse increases its velocity {{at the edge of}} the waterfall, it may pluck material from the riverbed, if the bed is fractured or otherwise more erodable. Hydraulic jets and hydraulic jumps at the toe of a falls can generate large forces to erode the bed, especially when forces are amplified by water-borne sediment. Horseshoe-shaped falls focus the erosion to a central point, also enhancing riverbed change below a waterfalls. A process known as [...] "potholing" [...] involves local erosion of a potentially deep hole in bedrock due to turbulent whirlpools spinning stones around on the <b>bed,</b> <b>drilling</b> it out. Sand and stones carried by the watercourse therefore increase erosion capacity. This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it. The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one and half meters per year.|$|R

It was developed at the MARUM Research Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at Bremen University. The complete system – comprising the drill rig, winch, control station, and the launch and recovery system – is transported in six containers and can be deployed worldwide from German and international research ships. It was the first remote-controlled deep sea drill rig to use a wireline coring technique. Compared to drilling vessels this technology {{has the advantage of}} operating from a stable platform at the sea bed, which allows for optimal control over the drilling process.

The MeBo has been successfully operated, retrieving high-quality cores at the sea bed for a variety of research fields, including slope stability studies and palaeoclimate reconstructions.

40|$|AbstractBecause of {{high cost}} and {{pollution}} of oil-based drilling fluid, the water-based drilling fluid is increasingly used now. However, bedding planes and micro-cracks {{are rich in}} shale formation. When water-based drilling fluid contacts formation rock, it causes the propagation of crack and invasion of drilling fluid, which decrease shale strength and cause wellbore instability. In this paper, we analyzed influence of water-based drilling fluid on shale strength and failure mode by mechanics experiment. Based on those experimental results, considering the effect of <b>bedding</b> plane and <b>drilling</b> time, we established modeling of wellbore stability for shale formation. The result from this model indicates that in certain azimuth of horizontal well, collapsing pressure increases dramatically due to shale failure along with <b>bedding</b> plane.

A number of bridges have failed due to clear water local scouring of piers. This research paper presents a numerical model study in which an attempt has been made to explore the flow variables which exist in and around a scoured bridge pier. A finite volume based model of bridge pier was developed using 3 D (Three Dimensional) numerical code FLUENT and GAMBIT. After validation process, different discharge values were considered and its impact on three dimensional characteristics of flow such as stream-wise velocities on longitudinal and transverse sections, turbulance circulation cells, and boundary shear stresses was investigated. It was observed that increasing the discharge results in more turbulance around the pier on its downstream side and turbulence properties are intensified in such a situation.

40|$|The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), {{located in}} the central East Antarctica, were {{discovered}} by the Soviet team of the 3 rd Complex Antarctic Expedition in 1958 - 1959. The GSM has highly dissected Alpine topography reaching maximum elevations of 3000 m. The mechanism driving uplift of the young-shaped GSM {{in the middle of}} the old East Antarctic Shield is unknown. With only limited constraints available on the topography, geology, and lithospheric structure, the origin of the GSM has been a matter of considerable speculation. The latest interpretation suggested that the GSM were formed during Permian and Cretaceous (roughly 250 - 100 Ma ago) due to the combination of rift-flank uplift, root buoyancy and the isostatic response. Later on the Antarctic Ice Sheet covered the range and protected it from erosion. However, this theory cannot explain lack of erosion process during many millions years in between uplifting and beginning of glaciation. The next step of the GSM exploration focuses on the direct observation of ice sheet <b>bed</b> by <b>drilling.</b> In order to penetrate into subglacial bedrock in the GSM region the development activity already has been started in China.

40|$|Coal-bed methane (CBM), also {{referred}} to as Coal seam gas (CSG), relates to the production of methane from coal <b>beds</b> by <b>drilling</b> wells, hence lowering formation pressure, and triggering methane release. While the potential of this resource is significant, the assessment of the quantity and the producibility of methane from coal seams is highly variable. For this reason the objective of this work is to investigate the assessment of gas content, gas-in-place and coal permeability through petrophysical of analysis and by gaining a better understanding of coal bulk properties,. In this study 17 cored production wells were analysed from the Walloon Sub-group coal seams fairway in the Surat Basin in Queensland Australia, which is today the most ambitious investment in CSG worldwide. A total of 2374 coal beds were investigated to understand how the nature of the different coal lithotypes are reflected in core analysis, wireline logs measurements and DST test results, and how they affect coal quality, and control gas content, fracture development and reservoir permeability. High-resolution studies involving fine scale are required to estimate volumes and CSG formation evaluation turns to the interpretation of standard wireline tools readings in hundreds of coal seam wells. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous thin-bedded nature of coal seams, together with the fact that methane within coal is mainly stored by adsorption, create several difficulties in wireline log petrophysical analysis. Consequently core description is used to validate the combination of the density log with the shallow focused electric and induction resistivity measurements, benefitting the recognition and thickness estimation of thin coal beds and coal laminae rich mudstones. This observation, and a refined coal quality and gas content estimation methodology, are presented and tested against previously published workflows and provide an improved and tested strategy for petrophysical analysis of CSG...|$|R

Four wired sensor strings were successfully installed in three of the boreholes. These included a thermistor string to obtain the englacial temperature profile installed in the same borehole as a string of tilt sensors to measure borehole deformation, and two sets of combined water pressure, electrical conductivity and turbidity sensors installed just above the bed in separate, adjacent boreholes. The boreholes made a strong hydrological connection to the <b>bed</b> during <b>drilling,</b> draining rapidly to ? 80 m below the ice surface.

The experimental bed tested in the present study has several unique design features configured as cold flow, axially symmetric, counter-current flow to simulate a filter operating at high temperatures (1088 K) and elevated pressures (10 atmospheres). The granular filter is evaluated in two separate performance studies: (1) optimization of particle collection efficiency and bed pressure drop in a factorial study at near-atmospheric operating pressures through appropriate use of granular bed materials, particle sizes, and feed rates; and (2) high temperature and high pressure model simulation conducted at above-atmospheric pressures and room temperature utilizing dust and granular flow rates, granular size, system pressure, and superficial velocity. The factorial study involves a composite design of 16 near-atmospheric tests, while the model simulation study is comprised of 7 above-atmospheric tests. Similarity rules were validated in tests at four different mass dust ratios and showed nearly constant collection efficiencies ({approx} 99. 5 {+-} 0. 3 %) for operating pressures of 160 kPa gage (23. 2 psig) at room temperature (20 C), which simulates the hydrodynamic conditions expected for typical gasification streams (1088 K, 10 atmospheres).

When soil particles become detached and entrained in runoff, the soil particles can be transported to rivers, lakes and streams. Increasing levels of sediment in rivers, lakes, and streams can cause eutrophication, decreased light penetration, decreased biological diversity and altered channel dynamics. Conservation practices, such as grassed waterways and vegetated filter strips, are put in place to intercept overland flow and cause sediment deposition to decrease the amount of sediment delivered to bodies of water. A goal of the United States is to replace 30 % of fossil fuels with biofuels by 2030. To accomplish this goal, biomass may have to be removed from conservation practices, including grassed waterways and vegetated filter strips. The goal of this dissertation was to determine the impact of biomass removal from vegetated channels during low intensity storms and to improve the methodology used to study sediment dynamics during run off experiments. The first study in this dissertation evaluated the effects of grass species and biomass removal in vegetated channels during low intensity-short duration storms. In June 2006, 24 channels were created that measured 2 m x 10 m. The treatments of grass species (big bluestem, corn, smooth bromegrass, and switchgrass) and biomass removal (removed, not removed) were applied to the channels in a split plot arrangement. Three times in 2007 and 3 more times in 2008, a 787 L load of water with suspended sediment was drained on the head and sides of each experimental unit and the entire load of water that ran off was collected, weighed, and sampled for sediment concentration. Biomass removal increased runoff and sediment by an average of 15 % over the two years of the study. The channels planted to perennial C 4 grasses were most effective at reducing runoff and sediment export, while the corn was consistently the least effective at reducing runoff and sediment export. The second objective {{of this study was to}} apply sediment fingerprinting techniques to small-plot runoff experiments to determine the relative contribution of the plot and applied sediment to sediment exported from small plots. Sediment-free water was applied to the head and sides of constructed vegetated channels in March and September of 2008. A 10 L sample of the runoff was collected, the water was evaporated from it, and the remaining sediment was ground and analyzed for total C. Water mixed with soil material obtained from a different part of the landscape and with a higher soil C content than that of the plot soil was applied to the head and sides of the vegetated channels, the mixture was sampled as it was applied, and the resulting runoff from the plot was sampled. These runoff samples were processed and analyzed for total C similarly to those collected when sediment-free water was introduced to the upper end of the plot. Based on differences in total C of the plot soil and the introduced soil material, a linear relationship was developed allowing the sediment exiting the plot to be partitioned between that soil material introduced with the inflow and that soil coming from the <b>plot</b> <b>bed.</b> The sediment C content was entered into the linear equation to determine the percent plot-derived sediment in the runoff. When soil material mixed with water was introduced to the plots, on average 20. 5 % of the sediment in runoff was derived from within the plot. The sediment trapping efficiency of the vegetated channels was very high (over 90 %) and, accounting for percent plot-derived sediment, had little effect on sediment trapping efficiency...|$|R
