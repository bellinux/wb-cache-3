25|$|This {{technique}} uses {{a combination}} filament–cathode {{at each end}} of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic) switch (see circuit diagram to the right) that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to <b>preheat</b> them; when the arc is struck the filaments are disconnected. This system is described as <b>preheat</b> in some countries and switchstart in others. These systems are standard equipment in 200–240V countries (and for 100–120V lamps up to about 30watts).|$|E
25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for <b>preheat</b> flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better <b>preheat</b> balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to <b>preheat</b> the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to <b>preheat</b> the filaments.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>preheating</b> {{treatment}} on NiAl compacts was systematically investigated. The <b>preheating</b> treatment of green compacts at 575 degrees C preserves their original shapes. The formation of porous NiAl alloys usually accompanies with the volume expansion {{due to the}} formation of Ni(2) Al(3) during the <b>preheating</b> treatment. The pore structures of porous NiAl alloys strongly depended on the <b>preheating</b> duration. The volume expansion, porosity and the maximum pore size increased with prolonged <b>preheating</b> treatment duration. Whereas the maximum pore size of final product decreased with increased <b>preheating</b> treatment duration. It has been found that the pore structures especially the maximum pore size strongly depend on the volume expansion determined by the intensity of exothermic reaction from the <b>preheating</b> temperature to the finally sintering temperature.

40|$|AbstractPowder bed <b>preheating</b> is a {{promising}} development in {{selective laser melting}} (SLM), mainly applied to avoid large thermal stresses in the material. This study analyses the effect of in-process <b>preheating</b> on microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stresses during SLM of H 13 tool steel. Sample parts are produced without any <b>preheating</b> and are compared to the corresponding parts made with <b>preheating</b> at 100 °, 200 °, 300 °, and 400 °C. Interestingly, internal stresses at the top surface of the parts evolve from compressive (- 324 MPa) without <b>preheating</b> to tensile stresses (371 MPa) with <b>preheating</b> at 400 °C. Nevertheless, application of powder bed <b>preheating</b> results in a more homogeneous microstructure with better mechanical properties compared to H 13 SLM parts produced without <b>preheating.</b> The fine bainitic microstructure leads to hardness values of 650 - 700 Hv and ultimate tensile strength of 1965 MPa, which are comparable to or even better than those of conventionally made and heat treated H 13 tool steel...|$|R

25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} fuel-air mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark.

25|$|The most {{important}} technological innovation in mid 19th century pig iron production was {{the adoption of}} hot blast, which was developed and patented in Scotland in 1828.

This ballast applies {{power to the}} filaments first, then after a short delay to allow the cathodes to <b>preheat,</b> applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc.

40|$|A clear {{dependence}} of the micro-cracking susceptibility on the base <b>preheating</b> temperature is observed for stellite coatings prepared by direct laser melting of metal-powder on the <b>preheated</b> chromium steel. The number of cracks decreases with the <b>preheating</b> temperature and for <b>preheating</b> above 650 °C no cracks are observed. This behaviour is consistent with numerical calculations. The observed deterioration of the corrosion and wear resistances of the coating with increase of the base <b>preheating</b> temperature is ascribed to the temperature dependent migration of Fe from the substrate into the coating. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Two potato cultivars {{representing}} extremes {{with regard}} to the texture of the cooked product were divided into subcategories based on size and dry matter (DM) content. The effects of the <b>preheating</b> temperature and time on both the instrumentally determined firmness and the sensory-perceived firmness were measured and compared. Increasing the <b>preheating</b> time at 60 C followed by cooking resulted in greater force required to fracture the tissue, an increase in perceived firmness, and a less mashable product. A principal component analysis showed that with higher DM contents of the potato samples, <b>preheating</b> resulted in a larger force required to fracture the tissue and a firmer product. The changes in fracture force were not linearly related with the changes in perceived firmness. The effects of <b>preheating</b> on the pectin methylesterase (PME) activity, the enzyme assumed to be responsible for the firming effect upon <b>preheating,</b> showed that the activity of this enzyme remained rather constant during <b>preheating</b> at 60 C for 1 h. <b>Preheating</b> at 78 C for 10 min abolished virtually all PME activity. To obtain insight into the consequences of <b>preheating</b> and <b>preheating</b> followed by steam cooking on the yield and composition of the cell wall material (CWM) of potatoes, a cell wall isolation followed by a pectin fractionation study was performed. Attention was also paid to the consequences of the processing conditions applied on the chemical composition of the CWM and the sequentially extracted pectic fractions. <b>Preheating</b> resulted in an increase in yield of the CWM of cooked potatoes and, as a consequence, all of the sequentially extracted fractions, including the residue. <b>Preheating</b> did not have a pronounced effect on the composition of the pectin of the sequentially extracted fractions. This altogether strongly indicates that <b>preheating</b> causes a PME-based firming effect, resulting in an decrease in pectin degradation and, as a consequence, a larger yield of CWM. It seems reasonable to assume that this increase in amount of CWM results in a firmer texture. The contribution of starch-based degradation products to the texture after <b>preheating</b> can, however, not be excluded...|$|R

25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} <b>preheat</b> the electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to <b>preheat</b> the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} bosonic trilinear interactions in <b>preheating</b> after chaotic inflation. A trilinear interaction term allows for the complete decay of the massive inflaton particles, which {{is necessary for the}} transition to radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is subdominant during early stages of <b>preheating,</b> but it actually amplifies parametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the trilinear term does dominate during <b>preheating,</b> the process occurs through periodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective that <b>preheating</b> completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an analytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also study numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics after <b>preheating.</b> The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate after <b>preheating,</b> leading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it. Finally, we {{investigate the}} role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during <b>preheating.</b> We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while still in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. <b>Preheating</b> due to these terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance.

40|$|The {{perturbation}} {{of a light}} field {{might affect}} <b>preheating</b> and hence generate {{a contribution to the}} spectrum and non-gaussianity of the curvature perturbation ζ. The field might appear directly in the <b>preheating</b> model (curvaton-type <b>preheating)</b> or indirectly through its effect on a mass or coupling (modulated <b>preheating).</b> We give general expressions for ζ based on the δ N formula, and apply them to the cases of quadratic and quartic chaotic inflation.
