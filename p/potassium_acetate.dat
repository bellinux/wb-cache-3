5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path.

40|$|The {{conformation}} of a hydrophobic, weak cationic poly(2 -diisopropylamino) {{ethyl methacrylate}} (PDPA) brush was studied using neutron reflectometry {{as a function}} of aqueous solution pH, ionic strength, and anion identity. In pH 4, 10 mM potassium nitrate the brush is highly charged, resulting in an extended, dilute conformation; at pH 9 the uncharged brush collapses to a single, dense layer. The brush response to added salt at constant pH (4. 5) for varying concentrations of the <b>potassium</b> salts of <b>acetate,</b> nitrate, and thiocyanate revealed ion-specific conformations of the brush. At low ionic strength (0. 1 mM) the brush was collapsed, independent of salt identity, while at higher ionic strengths (up to 500 mM) the conformation was dependent on counterion identity. The brush exhibited extended conformations in the presence of kosmotropic acetate counterions, while collapsed conformations were retained in the presence of strongly chaotropic thiocyanate counterions. The brush showed a richer set of behaviors in the solutions containing the weakly chaotropic nitrate anion, being similar to acetate (swollen) at intermediate concentrations but similar to thiocyanate (collapsed) at high salt concentrations. Numerical self-consistent field (nSCF) simulations indicate that the response of the brush to pH changes is dominated by the hydrophobicity of the polymer at pH values near the pK a. Furthermore, the simulations reveal that the addition of a single Flory-Huggins interaction parameter analogous to the hydrophilicity of the counterion is sufficient to replicate the observed specific anion response of a hydrophobic weak polyelectrolyte brush...|$|R
40|$|A {{completely}} novel {{approach to}} iron extraction was investigated, based on reductive leaching of iron by anaerobic bacteria. Microorganisms {{were collected from}} an anaerobic bog where natural seepage of dissolved iron was observed. This mixed culture was used to reduce insoluble iron in a magnetite ore to the soluble ferrous (Fe{sup + 2 }) state. While dissolution rates were slow, concentrations of dissolved iron as high as 3487 mg/l could be reached if sufficient time was allowed. A factorial study {{of the effects of}} trace nutrients and different forms of organic matter indicated that the best dissolution rates and highest dissolved iron concentrations were achieved using soluble carbohydrate (sucrose) as the bacterial food source, and that nutrients other than nitrogen, phosphorus, <b>potassium,</b> sodium, and <b>acetate</b> were not necessary. A key factor in reaching high levels of dissolved iron was maintaining a high level of carbon dioxide in solution, since the solubility of iron carbonates increases markedly as the quantity of dissolved carbon dioxide increases. Once the iron is dissolved, it has been demonstrated that the ferrous iron can then be electroplated from solution, provided that the concentration of iron is sufficiently high and the hydrogen ion concentration is sufficiently low. However, if the leaching solution is electrolyzed directly, organic matter precipitates at the cathode along with the metallic iron. To prevent this problem, the ferrous iron should be separated from the bulk solution in a more concentrated, purified form. One route to accomplishing this is {{to take advantage of the}} change in solubility of ferrous iron as a function of carbon dioxide concentration.
