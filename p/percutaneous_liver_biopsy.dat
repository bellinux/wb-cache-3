Traditionally, this has been performed by trained practitioners using a nonimage-guided percutaneous technique at the bedside. Recent literature suggests an expanding role for radiologists in obtaining biopsies using an ultrasound (US) -guided technique.

40|$|Preoperative {{cardiovascular}} hemodynamics and <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{were used}} to evaluate the pathophysiologic factors determining the operative prognosis of patients with cirrhotic liver disease and bleeding esophageal varices. These studies confirm the observations of Siegel that the greater the magnitude of the peripheral abnormalities in vascular tone and oxygen consumption the better must be the capability of the ventricular function, if the cirrhotic is to survive emergency or urgent portal decompressive surgery. These studies also show that the cardiovascular hemodynamics are directly correllated with the nature and degree of the abnormalities in the <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy,</b> and that pathologic and physiologic features of this disease which impact on surgical prognosis can be expressed through the easily obtained Survival Index. Bleeding cirrhotic patients with poor quality hemodynamics and poor histologic characteristics should be treated non operatively, since the operative mortality appears greater than that produced by a strategy of medical supportive therapy and delayed surgery if stabilization occurs...|$|R
40|$|Background. Transjugular <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy</b> (TJLB) is {{frequently}} {{used to obtain}} liver specimens in high-risk patients. However, TJLB sample size possibly limits their clinical relevance. Methods. 102 patients that underwent TJLB were included. Clinical parameters and outcome of TJLB were analyzed. Control samples consisted of 112 minilaparoscopic <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> (mLLBs) and 100 <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> (PLBs). Results. Fewer portal tracts were detected in TJLB (4. 3 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 3) in comparison with PLB (11. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 5) and mLLB (11. 0 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 6).

40|$|Gene {{expression}} technologies {{allow the}} analysis of gene networks whose expression is associated with specific pathological conditions compared with normal tissue. We hypothesized that histologically normal tissue obtained in different ways (<b>percutaneous</b> or surgical <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies),</b> usually used as normal controls in gene expression studies, could have different gene expression patterns. Group A comprised <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> in 14 patients with mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase in whom all causes of liver disease had been ruled out. Group B comprised 14 surgical <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> of nontumoral <b>livers.</b> All 28 specimens were histologically normal. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were {{used to compare the}} messenger RNA expression of 240 selected genes in these two groups. Expression of 26 of the 240 genes was significantly different between groups A and B; 23 genes were up-regulated in group A, while three were down-regulated in group B. The most notable changes occurred in the inflammatory response family genes. Eight genes discriminated perfectly between groups A and B: seven up-regulated genes (PAI 1, THBS 1, IL 8, PTGS 2, CXCR 4, JUN, and FOS), and one down-regulated gene (IHH). In chronic hepatitis C liver samples, a lower or higher expression of a IL 8 was found depending on whether the controls were obtained percutaneously or surgically. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that histologically normal liver tissue obtained in two different ways (percutaneous or surgical) has different gene expression patterns emphasizing the importance of an adequate selection of histologically normal controls to prevent discordant results in gene expression studies.

40|$|Abstract. Diseases {{associated}} with metabolic syndromes are of major concern in developed countries. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) {{is one of}} the manifestations of meta-bolic syndrome in the liver. Previous studies have shown that NASH is also caused by malnutrition. In the present study, a case of malnutrition-associated NASH in a 66 -year-old female with anorexia nervosa is reported. The patient had a body mass index (BMI) of only 11. 1 kg/m 2 and serum alanine aminotransferase levels of 1, 495 IU/l. Steatohepatitis with fibrosis was confirmed by <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> needle <b>biopsy.</b> Total parenteral nutrition was conducted at first, followed by the administration of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (a glycyrrhizin-containing preparation), ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisolone. The abnormal elevation of aminotrans-ferase levels of the patient was prolonged and total bilirubin levels increased. Pioglitazone (15 mg/day), which has been identified to be effective for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, was then administered. This resulted in marked reductions in aminotransferase and bilirubin levels within three months.

However, the characteristics of young patients incidentally detected with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B {{is yet to be}} studied in this country. Methods: We did <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> in 36 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) aged between 8 and 20 years. They were all HBeAg-negative with persistently normal or raised serum ALT values. Results: 56 % of patients had significant necro-inflammation. Significant fibrosis was seen in 17. 6 % of patients. Serum ALT was raised in 38. 2 %. A high HBV DNA load was observed only in 26. 5 % of patients. HBeAg-negative CHB is assumed not to be present in the age group studied, since this is the age group that represents immunotolerance to CHB. Immunotolerant CHB patients are positive for HBeAg, have normal ALT with high HBV DNA load. However, our study not only documented that HBeAg-negative CHB is common in our young population, but the data were also in contrary to what was expected in such age group of CHB patients.

40|$|Background: Pathogenesis and {{factors for}} {{determining}} progression of alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatosis to steatohepatitis with risk of further progression to liver cirrhosis and cancer are poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to identify potential molecular signatures for discrimination of steatohepatitis from steatosis. Methodology and Results: Global microarray {{gene expression analysis}} was applied to unravel differentially expressed genes between steatohepatitis compared to steatosis and control samples. For functional annotation {{as well as the}} identification of disease-relevant biological processes of the differentially expressed genes the gene ontology (GO) database was used. Selected candidate genes (n = 46) were validated in 87 human liver samples from two sample cohorts by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The GO analysis revealed that genes down-regulated in steatohepatitis were mainly involved in metabolic processes. Genes up-regulated in steatohepatitis samples were associated with cancer progression and proliferation. In surgical liver resection samples, 39 genes and in <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies,</b> 30 genes were significantly up-regulated in steatohepatitis.

DiscussionThe use of fibrin glue as a haemostatic agent in trauma is an important adjunct to perihepatic liver packing and finger fracture exploration of injuries. It may have exceptional utility in patients with penetrating trauma to the liver by direct intraparenchymal injection. This case illustrates that fibrin glue can be used to arrest bleeding from vascular tumours such as haemangiomas. It may help to minimise bleeding for all <b>percutaneous</b> <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies...</b>|$|R
