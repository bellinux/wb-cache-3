Doyle {{assembled}} a small team of researchers to work on developing better software infrastructure for computational modeling in systems biology. Hamid Bolouri {{was the leader of}} the development team, which consisted of Andrew Finney, Herbert Sauro, and Michael Hucka. Bolouri identified the need for a framework to enable interoperability and sharing between the different simulation software systems for biology in existence during the late 1990s, and he organized an informal workshop in December 1999 at the California Institute of Technology to discuss the matter. In attendance at that workshop were the groups responsible for the development of DBSolve, E-Cell, Gepasi, Jarnac, StochSim and The Virtual Cell. Separately, earlier in 1999, some members of these groups also had discussed the creation of a <b>portable</b> <b>file</b> format for metabolic network models in the BioThermoKinetics (BTK) group. The same groups who attended the first Caltech workshop met again on April 28–29, 2000, at the first of a newly created meeting series called Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology. It became clear during the second workshop that a common model representation format was needed to enable the exchange of models between software tools as part of any functioning interoperability framework, and the workshop attendees decided the format should be encoded in XML.|$|E

It is sharply different from FAR Manager and Norton Commander because it is GUI-based application with tabbed interface which made it possible to manipulate more than one directory or file view at the time and it has both types of file managers: orthodox two-panelled manager with two file windows side by side and native explorer emulator.|$|E

50|$|The HDFS is a distributed, scalable, and <b>portable</b> <b>file</b> system {{written in}} Java for the Hadoop framework. Some {{consider}} it to instead be a data store {{due to its}} lack of POSIX compliance and inability to be mounted, but it does provide shell commands and Java application programming interface (API) methods {{that are similar to}} other file systems. A Hadoop cluster has nominally a single namenode plus a cluster of datanodes, although redundancy options are available for the namenode due to its criticality. Each datanode serves up blocks of data over the network using a block protocol specific to HDFS. The file system uses TCP/IP sockets for communication. Clients use remote procedure calls (RPC) to communicate with each other.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, {{work began}} {{to enhance the}} file system to be more {{scalable}} and to support machines that {{had more than one}} processor. Another goal was to have a more <b>portable</b> <b>file</b> system, capable of running on multiple operating systems. After several years of designing, coding, and testing, the new JFS was first shipped in OS/2 Warp Server for eBusiness in April 1999, and then in OS/2 Warp Client in October 2000. In December 1999, a snapshot of the original OS/2 JFS source was granted to the open source community and work was begun to port JFS to Linux. The first stable release of JFS for Linux appeared in June 2001. The JFS for Linux project is maintained by a small group of contributors known as the JFS Core Team. This release of sources also worked to form the basis of a re-port back to OS/2 of the open-source JFS.|$|E
