I did not find in Gold's book an explanation to the concept 'national poet' but in the first place, this concept appears in her book she is pointing to my article (1997) that says: [...] "of all the poets who began to at the time of Amichai, or in later years, since Alterman there was not a poet more popular than Amichai. In this he is unique. He is probably the only canonic poet read by so many, also by <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not belong to the Literary Community. In this matter he has no rivals.

There will be a final assessment to test the comprehensive knowledge of the student.

6000|$|If {{we attempt}} now to fix Tennyson's {{permanent}} place in literature, {{as the result}} of his life and work, we must apply to him the same test that we applied to Milton and Wordsworth, and, indeed, to all our great poets, and ask with the German critics, [...] "What new thing has he said to the world or even to his own country?" [...] The answer is, frankly, that we do not yet know surely; that we are still too near Tennyson to judge him impersonally. This much, however, is clear. In a marvelously complex age, and amid a hundred great men, he was regarded as a leader. For a full half century he was the voice of England, loved and honored as a man and a poet, not simply by a few discerning critics, but by a whole <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not easily give their allegiance to any one man.

Wherefore to show them in others, what they find not in themselves, God worketh faith, hope, love, &c., in a generation that shall serve him; and by them they shall see what they cannot find in themselves; and by this means they shall be convinced, that though sin, and the pleasures of this life, be sweet to them, yet there is a people otherwise minded; even such a <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> indeed see the glory of that which others read of, and from that sight take pleasure in those things which they are most averse unto.
