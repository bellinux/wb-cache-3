5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and <b>pricking</b> of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by <b>pricking</b> {{him with}} a {{metallic}} stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} aetiological allergens identifiable by skin <b>prick</b> test alone in patients suffering from chronic rhinitis in Hong Kong, and also compare the clinical history and symptoms of skin <b>prick</b> test-positive versus skin <b>prick</b> test-negative patients. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Otorhinolaryngology clinic in Queen Mary Hospital of Hong Kong. PATIENTS: A total of 977 patients suffering from chronic rhinitis were recruited into the study. Skin <b>prick</b> test was performed with a panel of allergens including house dust mites, cockroach, cat, dog, moulds, and pollens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Skin <b>prick</b> test results and their correlation with symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 977 patients, 651 (67 %) had positive skin <b>prick</b> test reactions. The commonest allergen was house dust mite which was positive in 63 % of the 977 patients and 95 % of those 651 skin <b>prick</b> test-positive patients. The other allergens were in order of cockroach (23 %), cat (14 %), dog (5 %), pollen (4 %), and mould (3 %). Compared with skin <b>prick</b> test-negative patients, skin <b>prick</b> test-positive patients {{were more likely to}} have earlier age of onset of the chronic rhinitis, association with asthma, more severe symptom in the morning, more severe symptoms of itchy nose, sneezing, nasal discharge, itchy eye, and watery eye. CONCLUSIONS: Identifiable aeroallergens could be detected in 67 % chronic rhinitis patients by skin <b>prick</b> test alone. House dust mites were the most prevalent causative allergen.

25|$|Mistakes are {{sometimes}} made by even a skilled farrier, {{especially if the}} horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming {{too close to the}} sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or nail <b>pricking.</b> This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall and hits the sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of lameness or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These mistakes are made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the hoof wall is particularly thin (common in Thoroughbreds), or if the hoof wall is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, manufacturing defects in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.|$|E

40|$|Background: Being {{exposed to}} house dust mites intensifies atopic dermatitis. This study has {{investigated}} the con­tamination rate with Dermatophagoides mites in patient's residential home with atopic dermatitis. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 40 patients took part with atopic dermatitis (positive or negative for mites by <b>prick</b> Dermal Test). Samples {{were collected from}} 3 locations (living room, bedroom and bed) by vacuum cleaner. Dust samples (transferred to freezer - 20 ˚C) were examined by direct method and flotation.

500|$|Scottish {{witchcraft}} {{trials were}} notable {{for their use}} of <b>pricking,</b> in which a suspect's skin was pierced with needles, pins and bodkins as {{it was believed that}} they would possess a Devil's mark through which they could not feel pain. Professional prickers included John Kincaid and John Dick, whose actions helped set off the outbreak of witch-hunting in [...] 1661–62, and whose exposure as frauds, and subsequent imprisonment, helped end the trials. Judicial torture was used in some high-profile cases, like that of John Fine, one of the witches accused of plotting the death of the king in 1590, whose feet were crushed in a shin press, known as the boots. However, these cases were relatively rare. Confessions, considered the best evidence for conviction, were more usually extracted by [...] "waking" [...] the witch, keeping the suspect sleep deprived. After about three days individuals tend to hallucinate, and this provided some exotic detail in witchcraft trials. In Scotland, convicted witches were usually strangled at the stake before having their bodies burned, although there are instances where they were burned alive.|$|E
500|$|Upon consumption, both {{in humans}} and other species, the {{symptoms}} of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity {{may be the first}} sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic–clonic. Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium, tingling, <b>pricking,</b> or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, [...] and coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.|$|E
50|$|Skin <b>prick</b> {{tests can}} be used to confirm {{specific}} food allergies. Skin <b>prick</b> tests are designed to identify specific IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells. During the test, a glycerinated allergen extract drop is placed on the patient's skin. The patient's skin is then <b>pricked</b> through the drop. This procedure is repeated with two controls: a histamine drop designed to elicit an allergic response, and a saline drop designed to elicit no allergic response. The wheal that develops from the glycerinated extract drop is compared against the saline control. A positive allergic test is one in which the extract wheal is 3mm larger than the saline wheal. A positive skin <b>prick</b> test is about 50% accurate, so a positive skin <b>prick</b> test alone is not diagnostic of food allergies.|$|R

500|$|With {{the rise}} of scholasticism {{and the decline of}} the Roman Empire, the atomic theory was {{abandoned}} for many ages in favor of the various four element theories and later alchemical theories. The 17th century, however, saw a resurgence in the atomic theory primarily through the works of Gassendi, and Newton. Among other scientists of that time Gassendi deeply studied ancient history, wrote major works about Epicurus natural philosophy and was a persuasive propagandist of it. He reasoned that to account for {{the size and shape of}} atoms moving in a void could account for the properties of matter. [...] Heat was due to small, round atoms; cold, to pyramidal atoms with sharp points, which accounted for the <b>pricking</b> sensation of severe cold; and solids were held together by interlacing hooks.

[...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked."

40|$|The yeast Malassezia furfur {{belongs to}} the normal {{cutaneous}} flora, but is also a triggering allergen that can contribute to atopic dermatitis. To illuminate the effect of circulating allergen-specific T cells in atopic dermatitis, the peripheral mononuclear cell response was correlated with the in vivo skin <b>prick</b> test and atopy patch test reactivity to M. furfur. None of 16 healthy controls showed any positive in vivo reaction. The 40 atopic dermatitis patients, of whom 18 had serum IgE reactivity to M. furfur, were subdivided according to their in vivo reaction to M. furfur extract into three groups: skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive (n[*]=[*] 12), skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative (n[*]=[*] 12), and skin <b>prick</b> test negative/atopy patch test negative (n[*]=[*] 16). The skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive and the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative groups had a significantly higher peripheral mononuclear cell stimulation index than the healthy controls. Interestingly, the stimulation index values in the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive group {{were significantly higher than}} in the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative group. In the M. furfur skin <b>prick</b> test positive atopic dermatitis patients (n[*]=[*] 24) a correlation was found between stimulation index and the M. furfur atopy patch test reactions, but not between stimulation index and M. furfur-specific serum IgE levels. Skin <b>prick</b> test positive and/or atopy patch test positive reactions to the recombinant M. furfur allergens rMal f 1, rMal f 5, and rMal f 6 were observed in 7, 14, and 16 of the 40 atopic dermatitis patients, respectively. Further, there was a correlation between production of the T helper 2 -related cytokines interleukins 4, 5, and 13 and stimulation index to M. furfur extract, but not between the T helper 1 -related interferon-γ and stimulation index to M. furfur extract.
