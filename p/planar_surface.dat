25|$|Typically, folding {{is thought}} to occur by simple {{buckling}} of a <b>planar</b> <b>surface</b> and its confining volume. The volume change is accommodated by layer parallel shortening the volume, which grows in thickness. Folding under this mechanism is typically of the similar fold style, as thinned limbs are shortened horizontally and thickened hinges do so vertically.|$|E
25|$|The {{hinge points}} along an entire folded surface form a hinge line, {{which can be}} either a crest line or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear hinge line gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the axial surface. The axial surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the axial surface is a <b>planar</b> <b>surface</b> then it is called the axial plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An axial trace is the line of intersection of the axial surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E
25|$|The playfield is a <b>planar</b> <b>surface</b> {{inclined}} upward {{from three}} to seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble {{down the center of the}} playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Man-made {{real-world}} environments {{are dominated}} by <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> many of which constitute behaviorrelevant entities. Thus, the ability to perceive <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> is vital for any embodied system operating in such environments, be it human or robotic. In this paper, we present an architecture for detection and estimation of <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the scene from calibrated stereo images. They are represented in a behavior-oriented way, focusing on geometrical properties that are relevant for enabling basic interaction between a robot and the <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> it perceives. Ego-motion of the robot is compensated for by transforming the representations into a global coordinate system using the kinematics of the robot. Our architecture is able to detect and estimate arbitrary <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces,</b> regardless of their visual appearance, their geometrical properties other than planarity and their being static or arbitrarily moving. The latter is achieved by processing each frame independently of the others. Stable representations are obtained by establishing spatio-temporal coherence between the single-frame representations of subsequent frames. Based on a RANSAC approach to plane fitting, our method is robust to unreliable 3 D data such as obtained by local stereo correlation, for example. In our experiments using the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO, we show that our method is able to provide a robot in real-time with representations of <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> in its environment that are sufficiently accurate for basic interaction.

40|$|Accuracy of {{geometric}} {{measurement of}} object environments for robotic vision tasks is of increasing importance as these tasks become more sophisticated. This paper {{is concerned with}} the accurate measurement of orientations of lines and <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> from two camera stereo. Most existing stereo algorithms build up geometric descriptions from absolute position information about points. We emphasize in this paper the accuracy advantages of determining orientation of lines and <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> using the correspondence of linear features instead of point features. Intuitively, the determination of only orientation from absolute position measurement of points uses too much information which requires the unnecessary accurate calibration of certain camera parameters. Orientation information is invariant to knowledge about absolute positional information. If the orientation of lines are computed from the intersection of planar sheets of projection from a stereo pair of cameras, in the absence of all camera errors, the result is independent of baseline. Orientation of <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be determined from the cross product of the orientations of at least two coplanar linear features. It is shown that even in the presence of typical camera errors that measurement of the orientations of lines and surfaces using line correspondence stereo is relatively insensitive to baseline errors. Even more, the measurement of orientation from line correspondence stereo is relatively insensitive to typical localization error on the image plane. As a result orientations of lines and <b>planar</b> <b>surfaces</b> far from the baseline can be measured much better using line correspondence stereo rather than point correspondence stereo. ...|$|R
