5000|$|There {{is an even}} broader {{sense of}} the word [...] "defence". Sometimes the defence will raise an issue capable of leading either to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proceedings</b> or the {{exclusion}} of evidence. For example, in a drug case the accused might argue that the search warrant by which the police entered his house and seized the drugs was defective and that his constitutional rights were therefore violated. If he is successful in establishing such a violation, the evidence can be excluded, and usually the Crown cannot otherwise prove its case. When this sort of thing happens, it is not really a defence at all, since the accused must establish it in a separate pre-trial application. Nevertheless, lawyers often refer to such applications as a [...] "Charter defence" [...] in reference to the Charter of Rights.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Tyrolean Termination Tool (T_ T in the sequel), the successor <b>of</b> the Tsukuba <b>Termination</b> Tool [12]. We describe {{the differences between}} the two and explain the new features, some of which are not (yet) available in any other termination tool, in some detail. T_ T is a tool for automatically proving <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> rewrite systems based on the dependency pair method of Arts and Giesl [3]. It produces high-quality output and has a convenient web interface. The tool is available at [URL] T_ T incorporates several new improvements to the dependency pair method. In addition, it is now possible to run the tool in fully automatic mode on a collection of rewrite systems. Moreover, besides ordinary (first-order) rewrite systems, the tool accepts simply-typed applicative rewrite systems which are transformed into ordinary rewrite systems by the recent method of Aoto and Yamada [2]. In the next section we describe {{the differences between the}} semi automatic mode and the Tsukuba Termination Tool. Section 3 {{describes the}} fully automatic mode.

[...] The federal constitutional right to appointed counsel in <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> parental rights <b>proceedings</b> is on a case-by-case basis. [...] For civil contempt proceedings related to failure to pay child support, the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal constitutional right to counsel even if the litigant is being jailed, provided that all of the following is true: a) the state is providing sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure the person actually has the ability to pay but is refusing to do so; b) the matter is not [...] "unusually complex"; and c) the plaintiff is neither the government nor represented by counsel. [...] Federal statutory law provides for a right to counsel in certain types <b>of</b> federal court <b>proceedings,</b> such as civil forfeiture of a primary residence or proceedings involving those in active military service. [...] Finally, all states provide a right to counsel by either statute, court decision, or court rule in at least some civil proceedings, with the most commonly covered <b>proceedings</b> being <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> parental rights, abuse/neglect, civil commitment, paternity, and civil contempt.
