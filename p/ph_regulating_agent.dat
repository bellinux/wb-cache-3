40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that asymmetric membrane capsules can be used to deliver a poorly water soluble drug with a pH dependent solubility, such as carvedilol, for extended periods of time by modulating solubility with acid. In this study, the effect of the concentration of <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>agent</b> and osmotic agents on the release rate of the active material was investigated. For this purpose, asymmetric membrane capsules of carvedilol were prepared using cellulose acetate as a semi-permeable membrane, containing glycerol as plasticizer, and fructose and fumaric acid were used as osmotic agent and <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>agent,</b> respectively. In osmotic systems, the release rate of an excipient relative to the release rate of the drug is an important factor that determines the duration of drug release. Owing to high acidic strength and low aqueous solubility, fumaric acid resulted in simultaneous release and maintained a constant micro-environmental condition for the dissolution of the weakly basic drug. Finally, it was observed that the release rate of carvedilol was influenced by the concentration of fumaric acid and fructose. The optimal formulation was found to be able to deliver carvedilol at the rate of approximate zero-order up to 20 h, independent of release media and agitation rate...|$|E
40|$|Access to decent {{sanitation}} {{remains a}} problem in developing countries. At the same time, sanitation technology is constantly evolving specifically regarding resource recovery solutions. Some chemical elements found in human excreta derived from non-renewable resources, and the recycling of phosphorous from sewage in particular is a possible solution to the growing issue of resource scarcity. A potential way to recover phosphorous from urine or water-borne sewage is through struvite precipitation. Struvite (MgNH₄PO₄. 6 H₂O) is a mineral {{that can be used}} as a slowrelease magnesium, ammonium and phosphate based fertilizer and can be produced from urine by adding magnesium to the ammonium and phosphate rich urine. Usually, magnesium is dosed chemically using salts such as MgCl₂, MgO, MgSO₄ or bittern, together with <b>pH</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>agents</b> but these reactants produce unfavourable chemical by-products and the process tends to be expensive. Previous studies have proven that electrochemical dosing of magnesium is a feasible and reliable method of struvite precipitation. It not only produces high grade struvite that is valuable and marketable, but it also eliminates the need for alkalinity dosing in order to create a suitable pH environment for struvite precipitation. Further to that, electrochemical precipitation does not produce any harmful chemical by-products. Previous work shows that one main challenge that is associated with this method is the formation of a mineral layer on the magnesium anode called nesquehonite (MgCO₃ · 3 H₂O). This leads to increased electrode potentials and hence high energy consumptions and may also lead to system failures of the reactor. Further to that, struvite generally precipitates as small crystals that are difficult to separate from the solution, leading to low mass recoveries of the product. These small crystals are formed as a result of the high supersaturation, which generally occurs for most processes that are employed to make struvite. In view of these problems, this dissertation presents an investigation of the potential improvements to the electrochemical precipitation of struvite from source-separated urine. The main aim is to minimise or eliminate the formation of mineral precipitates on the anode surface. It also looks into ways of increasing the crystal sizes of the struvite being precipitated in the electrochemical system. The methodology for this investigation involved modelling and experimental work. The specific objectives for this study were to: a) Investigate how thermodynamic modelling of struvite precipitation compares to the experimental results from an electrochemical precipitation reactor, b) Employ the aspect of seeding in an electrochemical reactor for struvite production and determine the technical feasibility of the proposed process, c) Establish how to minimise the formation of nesquehonite so that the quality of struvite produced in the electrochemical reactor is not compromised, d) Investigate how the crystal sizes of the struvite particles produced in the seeded electrochemical precipitation batch reactor setup compare to those produced in the continuously stirred reactor setup with a recycle that gives the particles a longer residence time, e) Investigate the economics and energy requirements of the SEP (Seeded electrochemical precipitation reactor) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Escherichia coli, <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> {{genes for}} amino-acid and sugar catabolism, {{electron}} transport, oxidative stress, periplasmic and envelope proteins. Many pH-dependent genes are co-regulated by anaerobiosis, {{but the overall}} intersection of pH stress and oxygen limitation has not been investigated. Results The pH dependence of gene expression was analyzed in oxygen-limited cultures of E. coli K- 12 strain W 3110. E. coli K- 12 strain W 3110 was cultured in closed tubes containing LBK broth buffered at pH 5. 7, pH 7. 0, and pH 8. 5. Affymetrix array hybridization revealed pH-dependent expression of 1, 384 genes and 610 intergenic regions. A core group of 251 genes showed pH responses {{similar to those in}} a previous study of cultures grown with aeration. The highly acid-induced gene yagU was shown to be required for extreme-acid resistance (survival at pH 2). Acid also up-regulated fimbriae (fimAC), periplasmic chaperones (hdeAB), cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (cfa), and the "constitutive" Na+/H+ antiporter (nhaB). Base up-regulated core genes for maltodextrin transport (lamB, mal), ATP synthase (atp), and DNA repair (recA, mutL). Other genes showed opposite pH responses with or without aeration, for example ETS components (cyo, nuo, sdh) and hydrogenases (hya, hyb, hyc, hyf, hyp). A hypF strain lacking all hydrogenase activity showed loss of extreme-acid resistance. Under oxygen limitation only, acid down-regulated ribosome synthesis (rpl, rpm, rps). Acid up-regulated the catabolism of sugar derivatives whose fermentation minimized acid production (gnd, gnt, srl), and also a cluster of 13 genes in the gadA region. Acid up-regulated drug transporters (mdtEF, mdtL), but down-regulated penicillin-binding proteins (dacACD, mreBC). Intergenic regions containing regulatory sRNAs were up-regulated by acid (ryeA, csrB, gadY, rybC). Conclusion <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> a core set of genes independently of oxygen, including yagU, fimbriae, periplasmic chaperones, and nhaB. Under oxygen limitation, however, pH regulation is reversed for genes encoding electron transport components and hydrogenases. Extreme-acid resistance requires yagU and hydrogenase production. Ribosome synthesis is down-regulated at low pH under oxygen limitation, possibly due to the restricted energy yield of catabolism. Under oxygen limitation, <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> metabolism and transport so as to maximize alternative catabolic options while minimizing acidification or alkalinization of the cytoplasm. </p...|$|R

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is an intracytosolic {{bacterial}} pathogen. Among {{the factors}} contributing to escape from vacuoles are a phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and a metalloprotease (Mpl). Both enzymes are translocated across the bacterial membrane as inactive proproteins, whose propeptides serve in part to maintain them {{in association with the}} bacterium. We have shown that PC-PLC maturation is regulated by Mpl and pH and that Mpl maturation occurs by autocatalysis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Mpl activity is <b>pH</b> <b>regulated.</b> To synchronize the effect of pH on bacteria, the cytosolic pH of infected cells was manipulated immediately after radiolabeling de novo-synthesized bacterial proteins. Immunoprecipitation of secreted Mpl from host cell lysates revealed the presence of the propeptide and catalytic domain in samples treated at pH 6. 5 but not at pH 7. 3. The zymogen was present in small amounts under all conditions. Since proteases often remain associated with their respective propeptide following autocatalysis, we aimed at determining whether <b>pH</b> <b>regulates</b> autocatalysis or secretion of the processed enzyme.
