An {{important question is}} whether {{this is due to}} agglomeration effects or whether cities simply attract those who are more productive.

It is thus possible that agents locate in cities in order to benefit from these agglomeration effects.|$|E
40|$|We {{scrutinize the}} impact of {{international}} <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> (spillovers) induced by imports and exports on optimal tariffs. First, we solve a stylized 2 x 2 trade model of a large open economy and show that (a) <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> via exports and imports both reduce the strategically optimal tariff, (b) there exists a certain strength of <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> such that the incentive to manipulate the terms of trade strategically vanishes, (c) the welfare gain {{that can be achieved}} via a tariff is lower in the presence of <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> than in their absence, and (d) these results even hold without power on international markets. Second, we apply this model to a panel data set covering 40 countries, 29 sectors and the years 1995 to 2009. We find that importdriven <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> are stronger than export-driven <b>productivity</b> <b>gains.</b> Third, we extend our 2 x 2 model to a multi-region, multi-sector model that we calibrate to the data set used in the econometric analysis and to the econometrically estimated <b>productivity</b> <b>gains.</b> Optimal tariffs are reduced by 17 % for the US and China and 40 % for Brazil when taking trade-induced <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> into account. The USA are the only model region that gains from European optimal tariff policy. Thus, trade-induced <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> have empirically relevant effects on optimal tariffs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{to what extent}} differences in competition intensity (assessed through estimated markups) between economic sectors explain international differences in hourly labour <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> at the sector level {{in a set of}} OECD countries.

This negative effect seems however fragile as it is no more significant when the sample is restricted to the most competitive sectors. Besides, in the manufacturing sectors characterized by relatively high competition and sunk costsmore intense competition would slow <b>productivity</b> <b>gains.</b> This result is in line with the European Commission view (Roeger et al., 2008) that margins need to reach a certain level in order to stimulate innovation in these sectors.

The possibility of forgone <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> puts an upper bound on management opposition against organizing drives of the workers, even if management opposition is cost-less.

3000|$|We {{may then}} {{consider}} the industry’s productivity using the per-yen standardized output (measured {{by the number}} of Rabbits). Suppose that we observe a very attractive car (quality level of 1.2) called Weasel, which costs 1169 Kyens. Because the ex-post standardized price of a car is 1169 / 1.2 = 974 Kyens, Weasel is Rabbit-proportionate. The <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> can be calculated by the ratio of reciprocals of the standardized prices for two periods, i.e., (1 / 974)/(1 / 1130)= 1.160. However, because the standardized price of a car is reduced to the standardized unit cost, we know that there have been no innovations within the car industry. A relevant measure of innovation should not change in this case. When assessing the <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> for only the car industry, we should eliminate any contribution from the factor inputs. In this regard, we should only consider the per-yen output change between the standardized unit cost and the standardized price, which is (1 / 974)/(1 / 974)= 1.000. We distinguish the <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> that reflects the local innovation of an industry (in this case, the car industry) from the ordinary <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> estimated via the standardized price change of the output.|$|E
30|$|More importantly, in {{contrast}} to previous research, we {{are concerned with the}} economy-wide propagation of innovation. <b>Productivity</b> <b>gain</b> reduces the marginal cost of production, and the corresponding price change influences the selection of technologies (substitution of inputs) for other industries, because of technological interdependencies between industrial sectors.
