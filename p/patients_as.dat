5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill <b>patients,</b> <b>as</b> accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately £1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about the tower and the risk that it might fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the <b>patients.</b> <b>As</b> an alternative to demolition, it was taken into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E

This human-centered purpose defines the fundamental nature of quality in health care settings. Traditional perspectives of quality and familiar views of customer satisfaction are inadequate to manage the complex relationships between the health care delivery firm and its patients. Patients play four roles in health care systems that must be reflected when defining and measuring quality in these settings: <b>patient</b> <b>as</b> supplier, <b>patient</b> <b>as</b> product, <b>patient</b> <b>as</b> participant, and <b>patient</b> <b>as</b> recipient. This article presents a conceptual model of quality that incorporates these diverse patient roles. The strategic and managerial implications of the model are also discussed. peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|The Helen Rollason Cancer Charity was {{established}} in her name in 1999. The charity funds and operates three cancer support centres – in Essex, Hertfordshire and London. Lord Coe, who had known Rollason since her days in radio broadcasting, is the charity's patron. The first Helen Rollason Cancer Care Centre was opened in Chelmsford, Essex in April 2002. in 2011, a new research centre named after Rollason and offering treatment for <b>patients</b> <b>as</b> part of clinical trials of new cancer therapies was opened at Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping <b>patients,</b> <b>as</b> 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their <b>patients.</b> <b>As</b> of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to <b>patients</b> <b>as</b> quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their <b>patients</b> <b>as</b> asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved.

When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) looks through her autopsy scan, she notices Elena had brain surgery and gets a shock when she realizes that Elena {{was one of her}} <b>patients</b> <b>as</b> she used to be a neurosurgeon, however she cannot {{remember}} her, just the procedure. Megan speaks with Elena's father Armando (Tony Plana), who remembers Megan from the surgery, and tells her that Elena saw Megan as a role model, due to Elena's mother early death. After speaking with Elena's boss Jeremy Nicholls (Edoardo Ballerini), he states that he cannot understand why Elena was in a motel, as she had no appointments near that location. Traces of breast milk are found on Elena's shirt, showing she was near a baby when she died, which leads them to Holly Bennett (Yaya DaCosta), one of Elena's clients. She reveals that her baby nearly got taken away due to her drug addicted boyfriend, and that whilst Elena was visiting her baby vomited on her, but left in a hurry before she could clean it up. Megan and Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) visit Armando to ask if Elena was in a relationship; hence why she was in a motel. They find out that it is Jeremy, but he says that Elena ended their relationship hours before she died.|$|E
