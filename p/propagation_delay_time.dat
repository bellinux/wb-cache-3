50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{does not}} specify {{the length of}} the bus. However, the maximum length of bus is {{directly}} related to the gauge of the cable conductor and time delay of the transmitted signal. A smaller conductor attenuates the signal more than a larger conductor. Typical propagation delay for a 1553B cable is 1.6 nanoseconds per foot. Thus, the end-to-end 100 ft would have a 160 nanosecond propagation delay, which is equal to the average rise time of a 1553B signal. According to MIL-HDBK-1553A, when a signal's <b>propagation</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is more than 50% of the rise or fall time, it is necessary to consider transmission line effects. This delay time is proportional to the distance propagated. Also, consideration must be given to the actual distance between the transmitter and receiver, and the individual waveform characteristics of the transmitters and receivers.|$|E

The effects of action potential (AP) <b>propagation</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> and the absolute refractory period upon the synchronization index are analysed for the integrate and fire neuron model, and the results are compared with recordings from auditory ganglion neurons and cochlear nucleus neurons.

Test calculations has shown that the relative short distances of less than a few meters complicated the ability to clearly differentiated between the start of the p-wave and the subsequent arrival of the s-wave. Typical wheel impact pulse frequencies are below 2 kHz.The wave <b>propagation</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> between the p-wave and s-wave over a distance of 1 meter is smaller than half the wavelength of the typical average frequency of the wheel impact impulse. This condition makes the method of measuring p-wave vs s-wave propagation delays virtually impossible since the s-wave will be superimposed on the p-wave before the ADC had the chance to even capture one full wavelength. Since seismic sensor calibration to KIPS are very critical it is important to capture at least a number of full wave cycles in order to establish whether the wheel exceeds allowed compression levels.|$|E
