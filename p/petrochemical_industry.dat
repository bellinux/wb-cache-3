5|$|Stenungsund is {{one example}} of a {{municipality}} that, having no historic city arms, created wholly new arms in the 1970s. This device, displaying a hydrocarbon molecule, alludes to the area's <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry,</b> and is also an example of distinctly modern arms. The arms, registered with the PRV in 1977, display: Argent, a hydrocarbon molecule of three pellets conjoined with six bezants gules, over a base wavy azure.|$|E
5|$|The trihalides adopt a planar {{trigonal}} structure. These compounds are Lewis {{acids in}} that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F−) and boron trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. Boron trifluoride {{is used in the}} <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry</b> as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry</b> to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

25|$|Synthetic zeolites {{are widely}} used as {{catalysts}} in the <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry,</b> for instance in fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking. Zeolites confine molecules in small spaces, which causes changes in their structure and reactivity.

25|$|There was {{no single}} {{approach}} to the metrication of the engineering industry: in some areas soft metrication was applied and in others hard metrication. In certain branches metrication was achieved by adopting the equivalent European or international standard, {{but this was not}} always possible as certain standards, such as BS1363 which defined electric plugs were peculiarly British while the <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry</b> had standardised on API and ANSI standards.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{charging}} mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine {{as fast as}} they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant.

25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the <b>petrochemical</b> <b>industry,</b> where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
