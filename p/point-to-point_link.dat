30|$|<b>Point-to-point</b> <b>links</b> {{require a}} {{line-of-sight}} (LOS) between the transmitter and the receiver, {{as shown in}} Figure 5 a. Such a link topology permits the use of highly directional transmitters with low beam divergence and narrow field-of-view (FOV) receivers. Thus, <b>point-to-point</b> <b>links</b> are able to reject the majority of ambient light that interferes with communications. In addition, the directionality of the link removes the impact of multipath dispersion since any reflected transmitter energy is essentially rejected by the receiver. Still, a disadvantage of this link topology {{is the fact that}} precise alignment and pointing are required, making the realization of mobile links difficult.|$|R

50|$|The Egli {{model is}} a terrain model for radio {{frequency}} propagation. This model, which was first introduced by John Egli in his 1957 paper, was derived from real-world data on UHF and VHF television transmissions in several large cities. It predicts the total path loss for a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>link.</b> Typically used for outdoor line-of-sight transmission, this model provides the path loss as a single quantity.|$|E
50|$|In a {{partially}} connected network, certain nodes {{are connected to}} exactly one other node; but some nodes are connected to two or more other nodes with a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>link.</b> This {{makes it possible to}} make use of some of the redundancy of mesh topology that is physically fully connected, without the expense and complexity required for a connection between every node in the network.|$|E

High-speed data transmission lines are designed using copper-polyimide flexible bus tapes rather than cable harnesses to minimise radiation length.
