40|$|As the {{telecommunications}} industry evolves towards a converged IP-Core network the role of cellular/wireless broadband technologies in achieving Long Term Evolution (LTE) must be greatly evaluated. This would in effect provide lessons for improvement and blueprints for final adoption in NGN (Next Generation Networks). The emergence of BWA (broadband wireless access) as a reliable player, in some cases a substitute for fibre/ADSL, maybe attributed to poor or non-existent copper/fibre, largely inefficient telecommunications management and/or ineffective telecommunications policies in mostly underserviced areas. In this paper, video streaming over existing 3 G high-speed packet networks is evaluated against WiMAX as alternatives to fibre/ADSL. Simulation results show WiMAX {{was found to be}} a viable and better alternative barring capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) considerations. HSDPA was found to achieve rates per user equipment (UE) that meet QoS needs for codec streaming Q-levels of 16 and 64 kbps. The 16 kbps codec rarely requires extensive <b>preroll</b> buffer requirements. However, WiMAX was found to perform better by at least three times for throughput and capacity. Â© 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|In {{a rolling}} element system, {{the period of}} {{transition}} between motion commencement and the attainment of steady state, gross rolling, and termed <b>prerolling</b> is of common concern to many engineering applications. This region is marked by hysteresis friction behavior, with a characteristic friction-displacement curve, which is in particular relevant to motion characterization and control issues. In a previous paper, the authors carried out a theoretical analysis of tractive <b>prerolling,</b> leading to a model for simulating this phenomenon. The present paper {{is dedicated to the}} experimental investigation of tractive <b>prerolling</b> friction behavior, including validation of the theoretical model. Firstly, a kinematic analysis of the rolling motion in V-grooved tracks is carried out. Secondly, the influence of the normal load on the frictional behavior, in <b>prerolling</b> up to the attainment of gross rolling, is investigated on a dedicated test setup. Finally, the newly developed theoretical model is validated by comparison with the experimental results. Satisfactory agreement is obtained between theory and experiment...|$|R
40|$|When {{an elastic}} body of {{revolution}} rolls tractively over another, the period from commencement of rolling until gross rolling ensues is termed the <b>prerolling</b> regime. The resultant tractions in this regime are characterized by rate-independent hysteresis behavior with nonlocal memory in function of the traversed displacement. This paper {{is dedicated to the}} theoretical characterization of traction during <b>prerolling.</b> Firstly, a theory is developed to calculate the traction field during <b>prerolling</b> in function of the instantaneous rolling displacement, the imposed longitudinal, lateral and spin creepages, and the elastic contact parameters. Secondly, the theory is implemented in a numerical scheme to calculate the resulting traction forces and moments on the tractive rolling of a ball. Thirdly, the basic hysteresis characteristics are systematically established by means of influence-parameters simulations using dimensionless forms of the problem parameters. The results obtained are consistent with the limiting cases available in literature and they confirm experimental <b>prerolling</b> hysteresis observations. Furthermore, in a second paper, this theory is validated experimentally for the case of V-grooved track...|$|R

40|$|Local {{rolling and}} other {{mechanical}} tensioning techniques {{can be highly}} effective at reducing residual stress and distortion in thin plate welds prone to buckling. However, the issues of high capital cost and low scalability currently prevent wider adoption of such processes. Pre-weld rolling aims {{to address these issues}} and can be applied easily to each component prior to fabrication. The results of an initial trial are presented, and indicate that post-weld distortion can be reduced by an average of 38 % when correct rolling parameters are used. Finally, the mechanism by which <b>prerolling</b> acts to modify the state of residual stress around a weld line is discussed...|$|R

A brief overview of the production process in the plate mill and the problems that motivate the development of DESPLATE are provided. The goal of DESPLATE is to locate the possible causes (such as electrical failures, mechanical breakdowns or wear, operational errors, and <b>prerolling</b> conditions) for a particular abnormal shape and to suggest appropriate remedies. A number of issues have arisen {{in the course of}} developing DESPLATE. Some of these issues are addressed, including the use of graphics for user interface, forward and backward chaining techniques, and knowledge acquisition methodologies from multiple experts from different disciplinary backgrounds. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report the}} {{development}} of a diagnostic expert system, DESPLATE, to assist less experienced operators to diagnose the off-square, camber, and taper shapes of plates. The system also incorporates graphics and animation routines written in Turbo-Pascal to provide a more user-friendly interface. DESPLATE has been found by experienced operators to be capable of providing systematic guidance in searching for faults. The authors first provide a brief overview of the production process in the plate mill and describe the problems that motivate {{the development of}} DESPLATE. The goal of DESPLATE is to locate possible causes for abnormal shapes, such as electrical failures, mechanical breakdowns, wear, operational errors, or <b>prerolling</b> conditions. They describe the knowledge base architecture and user interface and examine the control structure of the system.

40|$|Thermomechanical {{treatment}} (TMT) is {{the simultaneous}} use of work hardening, and grain refinement along with solid solution and precipitation strengthening. In this investigation, four alloys, with a base composition of 2 center dot 8 %C, 1. 0 %Mn, 4 center dot 2 %Cr, 1 center dot 0 %Mo, 0 center dot 34 %V, were prepared by electroslag refining (ESR) and by addition of {{small amounts of}} Ti and Nb and by increasing Cr and V to 4 center dot 8 and 0 center dot 48 % respectively. In two of the alloys a yield strength in excess of 1550 Wa was obtained in the as cast quenched and tempered condition. Attempts were made to further increase the yield strength by thermomechanical treatment. The process parameters for thermomechanical treatment were optimised by adopting procedures such as calculation of stability of precipitates, hot compression test, determination of cooling rates in different coolants, and modelling of TTT and CCT diagrams. The process involved <b>prerolling</b> of the ESR ingot to a bar at 1200 degrees C, followed by hot rolling in two passes starting from 950 degrees C and finishing at 850 degrees C with equal deformation of 25 % in each pass to convert the bar into plates. These were immediately cooled {{in one of the}} cooling media: air, polymer-water solution (1 : 1 center dot 5) and oil. Yield strength in excess of 1750 Wa was obtained in oil cooled specimens of the alloy with titanium addition and that where Cr and V were increased. The niobium added specimen gave strengths, similar to that obtained for the base alloy, {{in spite of the fact}} that the as cast alloy had shown very high strengths, presumably because of the high soaking temperatures and grain growth. Air cooling gave the lowest strengths and oil cooling the highest...|$|R
