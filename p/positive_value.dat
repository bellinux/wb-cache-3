5|$|The {{standard}} reduction {{potential of}} the E°(No3+→No2+) couple was estimated in 1967 to be between +1.4and+1.5V; it was later found in 2009 to be only about +0.75V. The <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> shows that No2+ is more stable than No3+ and that No3+ is a good oxidizing agent. While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, the accepted standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V. It has been predicted that the value for the E°(No4+→No3+) couple would be +6.5V. The Gibbs energies of formation for No3+ and No2+ {{are estimated to be}} −342and−480kJ·mol−1, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

25|$|Paul's {{theology}} of the gospel accelerated {{the separation of the}} messianic sect of Christians from Judaism, a development contrary to Paul's own intent. He wrote that faith in Christ was alone decisive in salvation for Jews and Gentiles alike, making the schism between the followers of Christ and mainstream Jews inevitable and permanent. He argued that Gentile converts did not need to become Jews, get circumcised, follow Jewish dietary restrictions, or otherwise observe Mosaic laws to be saved. Nevertheless, in Romans he insisted on the <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> of the Law, as a moral guide.|$|E
25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory cues are {{widespread}} within {{parental care}} {{to assist in}} the dynamic of the mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of amniotic fluid. For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own amniotic fluid, rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own amniotic fluid because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to amniotic fluid is eliminated after birth, breast fed babies have continued contact with cues from the mother’s nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while amniotic fluid loses its <b>positive</b> <b>value.</b> Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring.|$|E
25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E

If the quadratic form f yields only non-negative <b>values</b> (<b>positive</b> or zero), the symmetric matrix is called positive-semidefinite (or if only non-positive values, then negative-semidefinite); hence the matrix is indefinite precisely {{when it is}} neither positive-semidefinite nor negative-semidefinite.|$|R

500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just remember that it is not chess and it has no <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E
500|$|The poem uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with the pastoral elegy; a meditative lyric genre derived from the poetic tradition of Greek and Roman antiquity. Literary scholar Harold Bloom writes that [...] "Elegies often {{have been used for}} political purposes, as a means of healing the nation". A pastoral elegy uses rural imagery to address the poet's grief—a [...] "poetic response to death" [...] that seeks [...] "to transmute the fact of death into an imaginatively acceptable form, to reaffirm what death has called into question—the integrity of the pastoral image of contentment." [...] An elegy seeks, also, to [...] "attempt to preserve the meaning of an individual's life as something of <b>positive</b> <b>value</b> when that life itself has ceased." [...] A typical pastoral elegy contains several features, including [...] "a procession of mourners, the decoration of a hearse or grave, a list of flowers, the changing of the seasons, and the association of the dead person with a star or other permanent natural object." [...] This includes a discussion of the death, expressions of mourning, grief, anger, and consolation, and the poet's simultaneous acceptance of death's inevitability and hope for immortality.|$|E
