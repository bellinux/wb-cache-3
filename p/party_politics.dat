5|$|This put Romany King {{into the}} lead, which he {{held on to}} until being passed at the final fence and {{finishing}} third. The horse had been narrowly beaten by <b>Party</b> <b>Politics</b> in the previous year's National but had won just one of his six races since, a moderate event at Exeter in November. He shared pre-race favouritism with <b>Party</b> <b>Politics</b> until shortly before the start when he drifted to 15/2 joint-second favourite. His Irish jockey, Adrian Maguire, was one of nine riders making their debut in the race.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} {{as president}} of Duke University in 1985, Sanford remained active in <b>party</b> <b>politics.</b> He made an unsuccessful run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1985, {{in which he was}} supported by future House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Sanford lost to Paul G. Kirk by a vote of 203–150.|$|E
5|$|Born in Buckfield, Maine, Long {{was educated}} {{as a lawyer}} at Harvard University, later {{settling}} in Hingham, Massachusetts. He became active in Republican <b>Party</b> <b>politics</b> in the 1870s, winning election for the state legislature in 1874. He rose rapidly in prominence, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1879 and governor in 1880. He advocated modest reforms during his three years as governor, which were relatively uneventful.|$|E
5|$|Datta (2005) shows that, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from <b>party</b> <b>politics</b> and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E

50|$|The English {{speaking}} {{countries of}} the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from Great Britain have become two <b>party</b> systems. The <b>politics</b> of Jamaica are between the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labour <b>Party.</b> The <b>politics</b> of Guyana are between the People's Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller <b>parties.</b> The <b>politics</b> of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People's National Movement and the People's Partnership {{which is also a}} coalition. The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People's United <b>Party.</b> The <b>Politics</b> of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement. The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party.|$|R

5|$|Lie {{remained}} {{active as}} a public commentator and in politics after his retirement from <b>party</b> <b>politics,</b> and even after his centenary. He led the losing campaign for Norwegian membership in the EEC in the early 1970s, and in 2000 he led a battle to prevent the privatisation of the national oil company Statoil. His preferred method of staying updated on current international events was through weekly readings of The Economist.|$|E
5|$|On Baker's retirement, Gould was {{unanimously}} elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to {{keep the}} Senate representative of the states' interests and free from <b>party</b> <b>politics,</b> and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance. Gould, appointed Knight Bachelor in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British influence. With {{the election of the}} Fisher Labor Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by Harry Turley for the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The Tories (or Abhorrers) and Whigs (or Petitioners) {{originated}} in the Court and Country parties {{that emerged in the}} aftermath of the civil war, although it is more accurate to describe them as loose tendencies, both of which might be regarded as conservative in modern terms. Modern <b>party</b> <b>politics</b> did not really begin to coalesce in Great Britain until at least 1784.|$|E

5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a Whig household, Harrison {{initially}} favored that <b>party's</b> <b>politics,</b> but joined the Republican Party shortly after its formation in 1856 and campaigned on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate, John C. Frémont. In 1857 Harrison was elected as the Indianapolis city attorney, a position that paid an annual salary of $400.|$|R
25|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{element of}} the <b>party's</b> <b>politics</b> was that it advocated cooperation with Israel. While there were several other movements on the Christian side in Lebanon that cooperated with Israel during the war, the LNR was the only organization openly and ideologically committed to this, regarding a Lebanese-Israeli axis as the best protection against Arabism and the Palestinians.|$|R
5|$|After his {{football}} career ended, he operated a sporting good store in Grand Rapids. He officiated football {{games for the}} Big Ten Conference for 16 years and also served in the U.S. Navy on an aircraft carrier in World War II. He was active in Republican <b>Party</b> <b>politics</b> in Grand Rapids, Michigan, {{and was one of}} the organizers of a reform movement to oust the city's political boss, Frank McKay. As an anti-McKay reform candidate, Goebel was three times elected mayor of Grand Rapids in the 1950s. He was later elected to the University of Michigan Board of Regents, where he served from 1962 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because <b>party</b> <b>politics</b> required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|Long {{returned}} to Massachusetts, where he resumed his law practice and remained interested in <b>party</b> <b>politics.</b> He {{sat on a}} few corporate boards and {{served as president of}} the Puritan Trust Company. He continued to advocate for women's suffrage, and served on the boards of several private schools, include his alma mater, Hebron Academy. He regularly spent time in Maine (having in 1882 repurchased the family home in Buckfield), and fell ill there in August 1915. He returned home to Hingham, where he died on August 28.|$|E

5|$|On 28 January 2014, the DA {{announced}} that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted {{an invitation to}} stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based <b>party</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Party</b> <b>Politics,</b> {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled up after the water jump when in a good position. Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April he had run unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British <b>party</b> <b>politics</b> in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the Referendum Party was not a major factor.|$|E

50|$|The Workers Party (WP) was a Third Camp Trotskyist {{group in}} the United States. It was founded in April 1940 {{by members of the}} Socialist Workers Party who opposed the Soviet {{invasion}} of Finland. They included Max Shachtman, who became the new group's leader, Hal Draper, C. L. R. James, Martin Abern, Joseph Carter, Julius Jacobson, and Irving Howe. The <b>party's</b> <b>politics</b> are often referred to as Shachtmanite.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} in Regina struggled to deliver {{services to the}} vast territory. The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike, as well as constant fighting {{with the federal government}} over limited legislative powers and minimal revenue collection, hampered the effectiveness of government. The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members. In 1897, after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant-Governors, a short-lived period of <b>party</b> <b>politics</b> evolved that challenged the consensus model of government that had been used since 1870.|$|E
5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal <b>party</b> <b>politics,</b> the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he could}} not {{convince}} Congress to outlaw the spoils system, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in <b>party</b> <b>politics.</b> Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince {{by a vote of}} 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired.|$|E
