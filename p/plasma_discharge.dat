5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E

25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge,</b> which is seen as a flash.|$|E

In this paper, the oxidation and bio-decontamination effects of impulsive <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> which propagate across a liquid sample/air interface (surface discharges), and through the bulk of a liquid sample (direct discharges), have been investigated. The oxidising capability was analysed by measuring the degree of decolourisation of indigo carmine dye in water solutions. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, were used as model microorganisms in the investigation of the biocidal effects of <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges.</b> Surface and direct <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> were generated by high-voltage impulses of both polarities, with magnitudes of 20 kV, 24 kV and 28 kV, the chemical oxidation and bio-decontamination capabilities of such discharges have been obtained and analysed. It has been established that the defining factor in the chemical and biological effects of <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> is the normalised delivered charge (dose). The results obtained in this study show that surface discharges have greater bio-decontamination capability as compared with direct transient <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges.</b> Also, it was shown that the decontamination rate of E. coli is more than double than that of S. aureus...|$|R

Initially disregarding orders from Sisko not to carry out the honor killing, Worf failed in his first attempt to perform the ritual and later found he could not bring himself to do so again, as he had taken on a human feature of morality and would consider it murdering his brother.

40|$|Low-pressure <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> can {{be applied}} to remove various biomolecules from surfaces. However, the {{knowledge}} on the interaction between plasma and biomolecules and the kinetics of their removal is still rather poor, which is a major limiting factor for the optimization of this type of plasma treatment.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} low {{temperature}} hydrogen radio frequency (rf) <b>plasmas</b> <b>discharges</b> are modelled numerically by using both a global model and a Particle- In-Cell (PIC) simulation. Such plasmas {{are of interest}} because of their industrial applications and {{for the development of}} negative ion sources for fusion plasmas. The global model technique was adapted and then implemented to model rf inductively coupled hydrogen <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> created in the DENISE experiment, with particular attention to the negative ion chemistry. For negative ions, assumed to be mainly produced by dissociative attachment, the densities obtained are always far less than 0. 1 of the electron density even under the most favourable assumptions. A new numerical scheme coupling the PIC and the global model methods was devised and implemented to model rf capacitively coupled hydrogen <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges,</b> including the effects of the chemistry in the discharge. In the scheme a PIC code and a suitably modified version of the global model code are made interact by exchanging information. The global model adds the ability to handle the neutral species kinetics to the self-consistent simulation of the charged species particles of the PIC model. The scheme was used to calculate the energy cost per electron-ion pair created in plasmas with non-Maxwellian electron energy distributions. The energy losses obtained are much less than the values calculated by assuming a Maxwellian distribution with the same electron average thermal energy. The scheme was also used to obtain the energy distribution function of positive ions arriving at the electrodes. Some distributions are compared with the energy distributions measured in the CIRIS experiment, giving a reasonable agreement. Finally, negative ions were included in the simulation of rf capacitively coupled H 2 <b>plasma</b> <b>discharges</b> and the numerical scheme was used to model self-consistently their production by dissociative attachment of H 2 (0 < v < 9) ...|$|R
