40|$|Background/Aims: Nutcracker {{esophagus}} and non-specific motility {{disorders are}} the main causes of non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP), with gastroesophageal reflux in 60 % of cases. Achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm are the most frequent anomalies described in patients with dysphagia. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the occurrence of esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter motor abnormalities in patients with dysphagia, NCCP, or both. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of 716 patients with NCCP and/or dysphagia tested between January 1994 and December 2010. 1023 functional studies were performed, 707 of which were esophageal manometries, 225 esophageal <b>pH-meters,</b> and 44 bilimetries. We divided the patients into three groups: group 1 was composed of patients affected with dysphagia, group 2 with NCCP and group 3 with NCCP and dysphagia. Results: Manometric anomalies were detected in 84. 4 % of cases (p< 0. 001). The most frequent esophageal motility alteration was achalasia (36 %). The lower esophageal sphincter was normal in 45. 9 % of patients (p< 0. 001). In all 3 groups, 80. 9 %, 98. 8 %, and 93. 8, respectively, of patients showed normal upper esophageal sphincter (p= 0. 005). Conclusion: Our data differs from those of other studies because they were collected from and analyzed by a single tertiary level referral center by a single examiner. This could have eliminated the variability found in different hands and different experiences. The high percentage of symptomatic patients with non-pathologic esophageal motility pattern suggests an unclear origin of the disease, with possible neuromuscular involvement. As a result, these patients may need more-detailed diagnostic studies...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit über dünne CNT-Netzwerke befasst sich sowohl mit den grundlegenden elektronischen und optischen Eigenschaften, als auch mit neuen Möglichkeiten der Anwendungen. Grundsätzlich lassen sich die optischen Eigenschaften von CNT-Netzwerken als geeignete Mittelung über alle spektroskopisch erfassten Moleküle verstehen. Die Charakterisierung mittels der Absorptionsspektroskopie an freistehenden CNT-Netzwerken erlaubt einen {{maximale}}rn Wellenlängenbereich (UV/VIS/NIR/-MIR) ohne limitierende Substrate. Aussagen über den Dotierungsgrad (FIR-Bereich) und zur chemischen Funktionalisierung (IR) sind genauso möglich, wie die Beobachtung optischer Übergänge zwischen den van-Hove-Singularitäten (VIS/NIR) und des Absorptionsmaximums der Plasmonen (UV). Die Ramanstreuung hingegen wurde als bereits bewährtes Werkzeug zur Bestimmung des mittleren Durchmessers der CNTs und zum Nachweis vorhandener Defekte eingesetzt. Dabei zeigte sich, dass eine maximale Leitfähigkeit des CNT-Netzwerkes bei einer Defekt-Konzentration von etwa 2 % erreicht wird, was dem Dotierungsgrad entspricht und dementsprechend auch durch p-Dotierung erklärt werden kann. Weiterhin konnte demonstriert werden, dass die Transparenz der CNT-Netzwerke ein sehr geeignetes Mittel zur Beschreibung der Dichte darstellt und sich durch ein modiflziertes Beer'sche Gesetzes auch quantitativ ausdrücken lässt. Diese erstmalig aufgezeigte Möglichkeit machte auch die Kombination mit der Perkolationstheorie möglich, was zu einer neuen Beziehung führte, mit der sich die Abhängigkeit der Leitfähigkeit von der Transparenz durch einfach zu messende Parameter sehr gut beschreiben lässt. Die Überprüfung verschiedener vorgeschlagener Modelle auf den temperaturabhängigen elektrischen Transport ergab, dass diese Eigenschaften am besten über fluktuierende Ladungsschwankungen an den Tunnelkontakten zwischen 1 -dimensionalen metallisch leitenden Bereichen (1 D-FAT. Modell) beschreiben lässt. Die Schwächen aller untersuchten Modelle liegt darin, dass die halbleitenden CNTs nicht berücksichtigt werden. Bei die Anwendungen stellen einfache dünne CNT-Netzwerke bereits transparente, flexible und leitfähige Schichten dar, die in Konkurrenz mit herkömmlichem Zinn-dotierten Indiumoxid (ITO) stehen könnten. Zwar konnte die absolute Leitfähigkeit des ITO bislang nicht erreicht werden, allerdings reicht der erzielte Oberflächenwiderstand (1 kOhm bei 90 % Transparenz) bereits für viele Anwendungen aus, sodass zumindest teilweise auf das teure ITO verzichtet werden könnte. Erstmalig konnten auch transparente und flexible Transistoren auf Basis dünner CNT-Netzwerke realisiert werden. Das gelang durch Stapeln von CNT-Netzwerken unterschiedlicher Dichte, die sich auch elektronisch unterschiedlich verhalten (halbleitend bzw. metallisch leitend) und welche durch eine dünne isolierende Schicht getrennt sind. Die Mobilität des dadurch enstehenden transparenten und flexiblen Transistors ist deutlich höher als die von organischen Dünnschicht-Transistoren. Anwendungstechnisch erscheint das vor allem für das wachsende Gebiet der sog. Plastik-Elektronik interessant zu sein. Strukturierte CNT-Netzwerke weisen aufgrund ihrer geringen Dimensionen aber auch besondere Diffusionsverhältnisse in elektrochemischen Anwendungen auf (Ultramikroeletroden). Das konnte erstmalig an freistehenden Bündeln aus CNTs demonstriert werden können, die sich durch isolierende Beschichtungen prinzipiell noch weiter strukturieren lassen. Die hohe Transparenz dünner CNT-Netzwerke kann aber auch dazu genutzt werden, auf den CNTs aufgebrachte Materialien optisch zu charakterisieren. Dazu wurde im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erstmalig die elektrochemische Abscheidung eines Polymers (Polyanilin) auf einem dünnen CNT-Netzwerk demonstriert. Die anschließenden pH-abhängigen UV/VIS-Spektren stimmten sehr gut mit bereits bekannten Spektren des Polyanilins überein. Anderseits diente das CNT-Netzwerk auch zur elektrischen Kontaktierung des Polymers, sodass die Sensoreigenschaften des Polymers ausgenutzt werden konnten (pH-Sensor). Es zeigte sich, dass der potentiometrische pH-Response dieses CNT/Polyanilin-Sensor mit dem eines herkömmlichen <b>pH-Meters</b> aus brüchigem Glas durchaus vergleichbar ist. Die statistische Verteilung von Metallclustern erscheint für die Katalyse im allgemeinen und für Niedertemperatur-Brennstoffzellen im besonderen interessant. Bisher konnten CNTs aber lediglich als mengenmäßig geringes Additiv auf der Oberfläche kommerzieller Elektroden aus amorphem Kohlenstoff (etwa als Trägermaterial für den Katalysator) eingesetzt werden. Die morphologischen Eigenschaften der CNTs erlauben aber die Konstruktion einer kompletten neuartigen Gasdiffusionselektrode, die ausschließlich aus CNTs besteht, was im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erstmalig demonstriert werden konnte. Das stellt insbesondere für mobile Applikationen, in denen Gewicht und Volumen eine größere Bedeutung zukommen, eine interessante Alternative dar. This work {{deals with}} both basic properties and new applications of thin carbon nanotube (CNT) networks. In general, the optical properties display an average response of all CNTs whereas the electronic properties {{are limited by}} the contacts between the CNTs. The well known Raman scattering on CNT is {{the most widely used}} method. In this work, a quantitative correlation of the influence of functional oxide groups on the conductivity of CNT networks is presented. From additional EDX data, it can be concluded that up to a defect concentration of about 2 %, the conductivity increases, which can be explained by electron acceptor properties of the covalent bond oxide groups. Absorption spectroscopy on freestanding CNT networks without the use of wavelength range limiting substrates. Has been applied to observed all known optical features of CNT on the very same sample. In the UV region, the spectrum is dominated by the absorption maximum of the pi-plasmons whereas in the VIS/NIR region, one can observe transitions between the van-Hove-Singularities. Features in the far IR region are due to intraband transitions which are influenced by the doping level of the material investigated. In addition, absorption features in the mid IR region are due to vibrations of covalently bound hetero atoms and can be used to detect certain functional groups on CNT. Important tools to characterize the density of a CNT network are both, the transparency and the surface resistivity. They can be described by Beer's law and the percolation theory, respectively. Combining both, Beer's law and percolation theory yields a new equation which fits a transparency versus resistivity plot very accurately. The temperature dependence of the conductivity of thin CNT networks can be described by different models. Such models most often used for thin networks are either 'variable range hopping' (VRH) or fluctuated assisted tunneling' (FAT) between metallic islands. From measurements on several CNT networks of different density can be concluded that for all densities used, the temperature dependence of the conductivity is best described by the FAT model for quasi one dimensional metallic islands (quasi 1 D-FAT model). But {{it should be noted that}} all models can't describe the dependence at very low temperatures sufficiently since they neglect the T-behavior of semiconducting CNTs. Thin CNT networks are transparent and conductive and can be used as transparent electrodes. The advantage over commercial transparent electrodes such as tin doped indium oxide (ITO) is their flexibility and cheap manufacturing. In contrast to the brittle ITO, CNT networks remain conductive upon heavy mechanical treatments. Although the conductivity at a given transparency is not as high compared to ITO, CNT networks have a considerable potential to substitute ITO in many applications in which high onductivity is not absolutely required. The fact that CNTs are either semiconducting or metallic with a ratio of roughly 2 : 1 results in density dependent electronic properties of the CNT networks. In very thin networks, the electronic properties of semiconducting CNTs become whereas in thicker networks, the CNT network behaves rather metallic. Using networks of different density, separated by a thin insulating layer, one can realize transparent and flexible transistors which even operate under bending. The mobility of such devices can be more than 100 cm²/Vs which is significantly higher than that of organic thin film transistors and which is already competitive with crystalline silicon. Structured networks are not only interesting in terms of a general miniaturization but also for new devices. In electrochemistry, such structured CNT networks show typical features of radial diffusion, the characteristic behaviour of low dimensional electrodes (ultra micro electrodes, UME). Furthermore, such CNT-UMEs can be partially coated to define even smaller electrochemically active areas. Chemical modifications have been used to extend possible applications of CNT networks. One example is the electrochemical coating with polyaniline. In this work, the electrochemical deposition of a conducting polymer (polyaniline) on a thin CNT network has been demonstrated. This method yields a flexible and transparent pH Sensor, which allows the measuring of pH either optically or potentiometrically and which is competitive with commercial pH sensors made of brittle glass. For metal deposition onto CNT networks, enhanced catalytic activity at the CNT surface is the primary focus. In this work, a complete gas diffusion electrode for low temperature fuel cells based only on CNTs is evaluated and its functionality demonstrated in a real fuel cell. The main advantage over commercial electrodes based on amorphous carbon is higher mechanical stability with significantly less material. This might be interesting in mobile applications where low weight is an important factor...|$|R
