40|$|We use {{population}} {{data from}} the U. S. Census to track regional <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> from 1790 through 1990. At the county level, we find that an initial general tendency towards population convergence lasting roughly through the 1800 s becomes reversed: particularly in the post-WWII period, regional populations have diverged. The finding of divergence hinges on two factors: the exclusion of transition dynamics {{and the level of}} aggregation. Regarding the former, state-level populations exhibit consistent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> transitional population <b>growth</b> over roughly two- to six-decade periods surrounding the admission of states to the union, followed by long periods <b>of</b> relatively steady <b>growth.</b> When transitional periods are included in our county-level analysis, divergent steady state <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> become masked. Regarding the latter, when we aggregate to the state level, divergent county-level <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> are again masked: even when transitional periods are excluded, state-level populations exhibit tendencies towards convergence. ...|$|R

Genetic factors are thought to specify <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> and other behaviors to drive morphogenesis.

These findings demonstrate the existence <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> mechanical forces that originate from the contraction of cells, emerge from their multicellular organization, and result in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> Thus, tissue form {{is not only a}} consequence but also an active regulator <b>of</b> tissue <b>growth...</b>|$|R
5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E

500|$|Trees do {{not usually}} grow {{continuously}} {{throughout the year}} but mostly have spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced {{at the tip of}} a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the eucalyptus, have [...] "naked buds" [...] with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.|$|E
500|$|All {{volcanic}} seamounts {{follow a}} particular <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> activity, subsidence and eventual extinction. The {{first stage of}} a seamount's evolution is its early activity, building its flanks and core up from the sea floor. This {{is followed by a}} period of intense volcanism, during which the new volcano erupts almost all (e.g. 98%) of its total magmatic volume. The seamount may even grow above sea level to become an oceanic island (for example, the 2009 eruption of Hunga Tonga). After a period of explosive activity near the ocean surface, the eruptions slowly die away. With eruptions becoming infrequent and the seamount losing its ability to maintain itself, the volcano starts to erode. After finally becoming extinct (possibly after a brief rejuvenated period), they are ground back down by the waves. Seamounts are built in a far more dynamic oceanic setting than their land counterparts, resulting in horizontal subsidence as the seamount moves with the tectonic plate [...] towards a subduction zone. Here it is subducted under the plate margin and ultimately destroyed, but it may leave evidence of its passage by carving an indentation into the opposing wall of the subduction trench. The majority of seamounts have already completed their eruptive cycle, so access to early flows by researchers is limited by late volcanic activity.|$|E
