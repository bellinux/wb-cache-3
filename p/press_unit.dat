In this paper workplace environmental climatic parameters were measured and then evaluated by Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, Corrected Effective Temperature, Heat Stress Index, and Allowable Exposure Time indices among 40 workers in a glass manufacturing unit in Tehran. Also, the effect of available heat control devices on heat stress indices was investigated. The {{results of this study}} showed that the obtained heat stress index in individual section and <b>press</b> <b>units</b> is exceeded from 100 (in individual section unit: 302. 6, in press unit: 283. 6).

40|$|The {{technical}} features in manufacturing press non-ferrous metal articles {{have been considered}} via the Conform continuous pressing. Based on an analysis {{of different types of}} press equipment, the absence of a connection between the system for fastening the two-part container fixed part (the shoe) and the working wheel shaft has been revealed as a shortcoming specific to many Conform installations. This does not allow observation of a controlled gap between the shoe and the groove bottom during the operation of the installation, which, in turn, breaks the stable feed of the bar billet into the die. The purpose of this operation is to develop a system for fastening the shoe that ensures the stable continuous metal extrusion process. Meanwhile, the task has been set of creating a tough and strong connection between the shoe and the working wheel shaft with the levers and drafts system that reduces the load of the bearings in the housing posts in which the wheel shaft rotates. As a result, the original technical solution of the Conform installation <b>press</b> <b>unit</b> has been developed.

A process model plays {{a very important role}} to design, evaluate and tune the control system. However, much less attention has been made to develop a validated control relevant model for tablet compaction process that can be systematically applied for design, evaluation, tuning and thereby implementation of the control system. In this work, a dynamic tablet compaction model capable of predicting linear and nonlinear process responses has been successfully developed and validated. The nonlinear model is based on a series of transfer functions and static polynomial models. The model has been applied for control system design, tuning and evaluation and thereby facilitate the control system implementation into the pilot-plant with less time and resources. The best performing control algorithm was used in the implementation and evaluation of different strategies for control of tablet weight and breaking force. A characterization of the evaluated control strategies has been presented and can serve as a guideline for the selection of the adequate control strategy for a given tablet compaction setup.

There are no published studies on the feasibility of contraceptive self-injection in sub-Saharan Africa to date. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess feasibility of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate self-injection in Uganda, with specific objectives to (a) measure the proportion of participants who self-injected competently, (b) measure the proportion who self-injected on time 3 months after training (defined conservatively as within 7 days of their reinjection date) and (c) assess acceptability. Study designIn this prospective cohort study, 380 18 – 45 -year-old participants completed self-injection training by licensed study nurses, guided by a client instruction booklet, and practiced injection on prosthetics until achieving competence. Nurses supervised participants' self-injection and evaluated injection technique using an observation checklist. Those judged competent were given a Sayana® <b>Press</b> <b>unit,</b> instruction booklet and reinjection calendar for self-injection at home 3 months later. Participants completed an interview before and after self-injection. Nurses visited participants at home following reinjection dates; during the follow-up visit, participants demonstrated self-injection on a prosthetic, injection technique was reevaluated, and a postreinjection interview was completed. ResultsOf 368 participants followed up 3 months posttraining, 88 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) = 84 – 91] demonstrated injection competence, and 95 % (95 % CI= 92 – 97) reinjected on time, while 87 % (95 % CI= 84 – 90) were both on time and competent. Nearly all (98 %) expressed a desire to continue. ConclusionsSelf-injection is feasible and highly acceptable among most study participants in Uganda. ImplicationsThe first research results on contraceptive self-injection in sub-Saharan Africa indicate initial feasibility and acceptability of the practice 3 months after women received one-on-one training and a highly visual training and memory aid.

Inevitably, water consumption in this sector is very crucial to be analyzed. One of the methods that {{can be used as a}} tool for sustainable appropriation of fresh water resources is water footprint analysis. The primary aim of this study was to formulate the strategies to reduce the water footprint in the palm oil production based on the best practice criteria. Both quantitative and qualitative research was conducted to get the value blue water (volume of surface or groundwater evaporated) and grey water (dilution volume to dilute pollutants according to agreed water quality standards). The values of water footprint in palm oil production obtained were used to represent the existing water use and were utilized as the basis for formulating strategies in reducing water use in the palm oil milling processes which was compared with the best practice criteria. The result showed that the blue water of CPO was 109. 6 m 3 /ton and the grey water was 537. 7 m 3 /ton, while the blue water of palm kernel was 62, 4 m 3 /ton and grey water was 306, 2 m 3 /ton. The value indicated that there was an inefficient use of water in the production of palm oil.
