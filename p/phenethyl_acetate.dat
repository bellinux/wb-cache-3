40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in {{winemaking}} {{has been}} increasing due to their positive contributions to wine quality. The non-Saccharomyces yeast Hanseniaspora vineae is an apiculate yeast that has been associated with the production of wine with good aromatic properties. However, {{little is known about the}} fermentation dynamics of H. vineae in natural must and its interaction with autochthonous yeasts. In the present study, we performed semi industrial fermentations of Macabeo and Merlot musts inoculated with either H. vineae or S. cerevisiae.

The results obtained with these techniques show that H. vineae was able dominate the autochthonous microbiota in Macabeo must but not in Merlot must, which exhibited a larger, more diverse yeast population. The presence of H. vineae throughout most of the Macabeo fermentation resulted in more fruity and flowery wine, as indicated by the chemical analysis of the final wines, which demonstrated a strong presence of <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> at concentrations higher than the threshold of perception and approximately 50 times more than that produced in wines fermented with S. cerevisiae.

This study investigated the effect of nitrogen source addition on volatile compounds during bog bilberry syrup wine fermentation. The syrup was supplemented with 60, 90, 120 or 150 mg/L dibasic ammonium phosphate (DAP) before fermentation. Results showed that an increase of DAP amounts accelerated fermentation rate, increased alcohol content, and decreased sugar level. Total phenol and total flavonoid content were also enhanced {{with the increase of}} DAP amounts. A total of 91 volatile compounds were detected in the wine and their concentrations were significantly enhanced with the increase of DAP.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{different}} {{tropical fruit}} {{species have been}} used in the development of fermented beverages, there are only few references in the literature to the production of natural sparkling wines from fruits other than grapes. In this sense, the objective of the present research was the development and physicochemical and volatile characterization of a natural sparkling guava wine produced by the champenoise method. Volatile compounds were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using the headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique on samples. Eighty-nine volatile compounds were detected, of which 51 were identified. Esters were the predominant class of volatile compounds (a total of 26), followed by alcohols (10), terpenes (9), ketones (3), and acids (3). Volatile compounds with possible odoriferous activity were reported in the beverage, including ethyl octanoate, ethyl 5 -hexenoate, <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> (E) -β-damascenone, (E) -ethyl cinnamate, 2 -methyl butyl acetate, 3 -methylbutanol, ethyl 3 -(E) -hexenoate, and methyl 5 -hexenoate.

Furthermore, the use of the champenoise method, traditionally applied to grapes, enabled the manufacture of a natural sparkling guava wine with physicochemical characteristics equivalent to those of sparkling wines made from grapes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPonkan (Citrus poonensis hort.) {{juice and}} ponkan pulp {{were used as}} raw {{materials}} {{for the production of}} ponkan wines fermented with six different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that ponkan wines fermented with S. cerevisiae BCRC 22332 and commercial yeast HF- 08 had higher alcohol contents (10. 70 – 11. 86 %), lower contents of residual sugar (0. 64 – 1. 14 %), lower degrees of browning (OD 420  =  0. 20 – 0. 34), higher clarity (OD 660  =  0. 07 – 0. 17), and higher sensory scores (5. 15 – 6. 25 points). Flavor analysis revealed that, in addition to the citrus flavor characters of α-pipene, limonene, and α-terpineol, ponkan wine contained the yeast-generated characteristic aromatic components of isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, 2, 3 -butandiol, ethyl acetate, diethyl succinate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl 3 -hydroxybutyrate, ethyl caproate, ethyl 4 -hydroxybutanoate, ethyl caprylate, <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> ethyl caprate, and ethyl 3 -methylbutyl butanedioate.

The published article is copyrighted by the Entomological Society of America and can be found at: [URL] screening bioassays and field trapping experiments of spotted wing drosophila flies, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), were conducted to determine the attractiveness of 17 compounds as well as to compare attractant efficiency during peak fruit ripeness and postharvest captures late in the season. Compounds structurally related to each of the fermentation products acetic acid, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 2 -phenethyl alcohol were screened for attractiveness compared with a soap water control in greenhouse cage bioassays. The compounds determined to be attractive in the greenhouse bioassay (methanol, ethanol, propanol, formic acid, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> phenethyl propionate, and phenethyl butyrate) were individually tested in the field added to apple cider vinegar (ACV). The acids were also tested individually in neutralized ACV (NACV; pH ≈ 7). Combinations of the compounds were tested in NACV. The capture numbers in ACV traps were not significantly increased by the addition of any of the compounds tested, although significant deterrent effects of some of the compounds allowed differences between treatments to be observed. Compounds that are most prevalent in wine and vinegar (methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate) as well as phenethyl propionate and phenethyl butyrate were less deterrent than the other compounds tested in the field. Captures during peak fruit ripeness were compared with the postharvest period when fruit hosts were not available or were overripe. Although the total number of flies captured late in the season was lower, the trends in treatment performance were similar, indicating a consistent performance of these baits from peak fruit ripeness through postharvest...|$|E
40|$|Maize plants {{under attack}} by {{caterpillars}} emit a specific blend of volatiles that is highly attractive to parasitic wasps. The release of these signals is induced by elicitors in the caterpillar regurgitant. Studies suggest that plants respond differently to different herbivore species and even to different herbivore stages, thus providing parasitoids and predators with specific signals. We tested {{if this is the}} case for different larval instars of the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis when they feed on maize plants. Cut maize plants were incubated in diluted regurgitant from second, third, or fifth instar caterpillars. There were no differences in total amount released after these treatments, but there were small differences in the release of the minor compounds <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and α-humulene. Regurgitant of all three instars contained the elicitor volicitin. To test the effect of actual feeding by the larvae, potted plants were infested with caterpillars of one of the three instars, and volatiles were collected the following day. The intensity of the emissions was correlated with the number of larvae feeding on a plant, and with the amount of damage inflicted, but was independent of the instar that caused the damage. We also used artificial damage to mimic the manner of feeding of each instar to test the importance of physical aspects of damages for the odor emission. The emission was highly variable, but no differences were found among the different types of damage. In olfactometer tests, Microplitis rufiventris, a parasitoid that can only successfully parasitize second and early third instar S. littoralis, did not differentiate among the odors of maize plants attacked by different instar larvae. The odor analyses as well as the parasitoid's responses indicate that maize odors induced by S. littoralis provide parasitoids with poor information on the larval developmental stage.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Wine {{volatile}} {{composition is}} one of the most important constitutes of wine quality, and it is greatly influenced by number of factors. The studies herein were conducted to evaluate the grape and wine aroma affected by different vine nutrient status, vigor and crop levels of Oregon Pinot noir. In the first study, aroma potentials in early and late maturity Pinot noir grapes were investigated in two consecutive vintages. The grape samples were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions and the released odorants were studied by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). Forty-nine main odor-active compounds were detected in the AEDA. The odorants released with high flavor dilution values were 1 -hexanal, β-damascenone, guaiacol and vanillin, together with C₆ aldehydes and alcohols, 4 -vinylguaiacol, 4 -vinylphenol and 1 -octen- 3 -one. The concentrations of aroma-active compounds were further quantitated by SPME-GC-MS and SBSE-GC-MS. Comparing with early harvest grapes, late harvest grapes released more β-damascenone, vanillin, 4 -vinylguaiacol and 4 -vinylphenol in both years according to both AEDA and quantitation results, suggesting they were important aroma compounds that contribute to the characteristic of mature Pinot noir grapes. The second study evaluated the volatile composition of grape berries subjected to varying levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) supply. Pinot noir grapevines were grown in a pot-in-pot system for three years (beginning when they were 4 -years-old) and fertigated with either complete nutrition (Control) or with reduced levels of either N, P, or K supply while holding all other nutrients constant. Nitrogen was varied from 7. 50 mM total N supply (Control) to 1. 13 mM in five discreet treatments, while P and K supply were each varied in four discreet treatments with the lowest rate of 0 mM during fertigation events. Aroma volatiles in berries were determined in each year using SPME-GC-MS technique. Results showed that reducing N supply resulted in lower concentrations of C₆ compounds and total β-damascenone in berries across all three years. Low N supply had little impact on monoterpenes. Reducing N supply resulted in higher bound form α-terpineol in two of the three years. Compared to P and K, N supply showed a more profound influence on the volatile profiles of the grape berries, indicating the important role of N in the biosynthesis of berry volatile and volatile precursors. The volatile composition of resulting wines from the same study was also investigated. Results showed that reducing N supply increased the total phenolic content in wine across all years. N supply has a profound impact on wine volatiles with the greatest effect on yeast-derived esters and higher alcohols. In general, reducing N supply decreased straight-chain esters and many straight chain alcohols, but increased the branched-chain esters, and phenethyl ester and phenethyl alcohol in wine across all years. The effect of N supply on monoterpenes in wine was not consistent from year to year. Low N wines also had reduced levels of volatile sulfur compounds in 2 of 3 years. Compared to the Control, reducing N and K supply resulted in lower quantities of total β-damascenone across all years. Altering P supply did not have reproducible effects on wine volatiles from year to year. The third study investigated the composition of Pinot noir wines produced from vines with varying vegetative vigor levels and two crop levels over three vintages (2011, 2012, and 2013) in the cool climate viticulture region of western Oregon. Wine was produced from grapes grown with two inter-row floor management treatments (tilled or grass) and two crop levels, including full crop and half crop achieved through cluster thinning. Crop thinning treatments didn’t alter the wine volatile composition. Certain wine volatiles were affected by the vineyard floor management treatments. Wines produced from grapes grown in the Grass treatment (lower vigor) had higher levels of grape-derived compounds such as α-terpineol, β-citronellol, vitispirane and TDN compared to wines produced from the Tilled treatment. Wines from Grass treatment also had higher isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, and <b>phenethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> but lower levels of linalool, 1 -propanol and 1 -octanol. A subproject of this study investigated the carotenoid breakdown and C₁₃-norisoprenoids synthesis in Pinot noir grapes from vines of differing vigor and crop levels (yield). Carotenoid degradation and C₁₃-norisoprenoid synthesis during berry development with different vine balance was monitored from véraison to harvest in year 2013. Our data suggests that vineyard floor management had a greater influence than did cluster thinning on carotenoids composition in grapes. Grape berries from Tilled treatment vines have higher carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids than the grapes from Grass treatment vines. Multivariance analyses also showed some interactions between the vineyard floor treatments and cluster thinning treatments on the composition of carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids...|$|E
