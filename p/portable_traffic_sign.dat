This paper is motivated to efficiently survey <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> while mapping the road network and the roadside landscape. Inspired by the manual delineation of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign,</b> a drawing strategy is proposed to quickly approximate the boundary of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Both the shape and color prior of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are simultaneously involved during the drawing process. The most common speed-limit sign circle and the statistic color model of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are studied in this paper. Anchor points of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> edge are located with the local maxima of color and gradient difference. Starting with the anchor points, contour of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is drawn smartly along the most significant direction of color and intensity consistency. The drawing process is also constrained by the curvature feature of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> circle. The drawing of linear growth is discarded immediately if it fails to form an arc over some steps. The Kalman filter principle is adopted to predict the temporal context of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Based on the estimated point,we can predict and double check the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> in consecutive frames.

In order to avoid this condition, a novel method of recognizing <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> is developed which take into consideration the color and shape of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> A algorithm called as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used for classification of different groups of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> which are predefined by a particular set of features after the process of Image Segmentation.

40|$|Abstract—The robust {{identification}} of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> represents the first {{and one of the}} most important steps in the development of a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> recognition (TSR) system. <b>Traffic</b> <b>signs</b> detection usually involves a color segmentation process that uses the information related to the chromatic properties of the road <b>signs.</b> Since the <b>traffic</b> video data is captured in diverse road and weather conditions, the problem relating to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection is quite challenging. Among several issues that need to be addressed during this processing stage, the problem generated by mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> (mutual occlusion occurs when one <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> partially occludes the surface of other road signs) that are attached to the same pole require special attention. In these situations the color segmentation process fails to correctly identify the regions that are associated with the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> These <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection failures compromise the performance of other stages of the TSR system and in this paper we propose two approaches that address the segmentation of mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> The first approach uses the information associated with the inner parts of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs,</b> while the second approach applies the watershed transform to identify the signs that have their borders in contact or are mutually occluding...|$|R

However, among damaged <b>signs,</b> dirty <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are unique since their damage is not permanent and they just can be cleaned instead of replaced. This study aimed to identify the most important factors contributing to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt. To do so, a large number of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in Utah were measured by deploying a vehicle instrumented with mobile LiDAR imaging and digital photolog technologies. Each individual daytime digital image was inspected for dirt. Location and climate observations obtained from official sources were compiled using ArcGIS throughout the process. To identify contributing factors to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt, the chi-square test was employed. To analyze the data and rank all of the factors based on their importance to the sign dirt, Random forests statistical model was utilized. After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that ground elevation, sign mount height, and air pollution had the highest effect on making <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> dirty. The findings of this investigation assist transportation agencies in determining <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> with a higher likelihood of sign dirt.

A camera fitted in the car captures the video and sends the data to an in-vehicle computing device. We propose a four stage algorithm that detects the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> using YCbCr colour space and shape based filtering. The detected <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are tracked and recognized using interest point descriptors. The algorithm is robust and can detect signs even when the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> board is rotated. The <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> template database can be updated easily.

We proposed a timely visual recognizability quantitative evaluation method for <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in large-scale transportation environments. To achieve this goal, we first address the concept of a visibility field to reflect the visible distribution of three-dimensional (3 D) space and construct a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> Visibility Evaluation Model (VEM) to measure the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> visibility for a given viewpoint. Then, based on the VEM, we proposed the concept of the Visual Recognizability Field (VRF) to reflect the visual recognizability distribution in 3 D space and established a Visual Recognizability Evaluation Model (VREM) to measure a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> visual recognizability for a given viewpoint. Next, we proposed a <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Timely Visual Recognizability Evaluation Model (TSTVREM) by combining VREM, the actual maximum continuous visual recognizable distance, and traffic big data to measure a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> visual recognizability in different lanes.

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} investigated whether different training methods had {{any effect}} {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> training and whether there were any relationships between <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> characteristics and effectiveness of the training. Methods: Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned into 4 equal-sized groups (control, paired-associate learning, recall training, and recognition training) to study the learnability of Mainland China <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> In paired- associate learning, participants studied each <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> along with a referent describing its meaning. In addition to being informed of the meaning of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs,</b> both recall training and recognition training provided participants with questions and feedback. For recall training, the questioning process was a recall task in which participants had to produce a meaning for a given <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> from memory. For recognition training, the questioning process was a recognition task that required participants to identify the most appropriate referent corresponding to a given <b>sign.</b> No <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> training was given to the control group. Results: Each training method significantly improved comprehension of the meaning of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> Participants from recall training performed better in a posttraining test than those from paired-associate learning and recognition training, indicating that the recall training elicited a deeper level of learning. In addition, questioning and feedback had a positive influence on training effectiveness. Performance in the posttest was found to be better when the questioning process matched the test process. Regarding the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> characteristics, semantic closeness had a long-lasting effect, in terms of the timescale of this experiment on <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension, and <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> were perceived as more meaningful after their intended meanings were studied. Conclusions: Recall training is more effective in enhancing comprehension of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> than paired-associate learning and recognition training. The findings of this study provide a basis for useful recommendations for designing symbol-training programs to improve road safety for road users. School of Desig...|$|R

To detect <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> accurately from in-vehicle camera images, various training samples of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are needed.

Therefore, the proposed method simultaneously obtains both <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> images and background images from in-vehicle camera images. Especially, to reduce false alarms, the proposed method gathers back-ground images that were easily mis-detected by a previously constructed <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detector, and re-trains the detector by using them as negative samples. By using retrospectively tracked <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> images and background images as posi-tive and negative training samples, respectively, the proposed method constructs a highly accurate <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detector auto-matically.
