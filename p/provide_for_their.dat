5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E

5|$|Metcalfe {{received}} only a rudimentary education, and at age sixteen, he was apprenticed {{to his brother}} and learned the craft of stonemasonry. Three years later, their father died, leaving the brothers to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mother and younger siblings. Metcalfe {{became one of the}} most prominent stonemasons and building contractors during the settlement period of Kentucky. A number of his stone houses survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including his first home in Robertson County. Other structures built by the Metcalfe brothers are the state's first governor's mansion and the Green County courthouse, known as the oldest courthouse in Kentucky, and the Presbyterian church at West Union in far southern Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{concerned}} property bequeathed in {{the will}} of Alfred's father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that {{all of it was}} to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
