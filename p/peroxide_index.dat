40|$|The {{maintenance}} {{of the quality of}} oil is a very complex operation, due to the storage conditions of the oil after the extraction step. The storage of oil must ensure the conditions necessary to avoid the increase of acidity, and consequently the onset of rancidity, or problems related to the anaerobic fermentation of suspended matter in the oil or deposited on the bottom of storage vessels. This work describes the development of a prototype integrated storage system. The storage system consists of a nitrogen gas generator, three stainless steel tanks, and a feedback controller of nitrogen concentration and tank temperature. In the experimentation, three tanks were used in order to test the functionality of the system. The experimental design is based on the creation of different modified atmospheres on the head space of steel tanks, using the nitrogen gas generator and feedback controller of head space composition of each tank. The results show that the prototype performs well in terms of its ability to detect and adjust the atmosphere of tank headspace. The oxygen percentage in the headspace of the three tanks remained between 0. 7 and 0. 9 %. Chemical analyses of acidity, total phenol content and <b>peroxides</b> <b>index</b> show that the controlled headspace maintained acidity levels within the range 0. 32 - 0. 36 % during the experiment, total phenol content in the range 152 - 146 ppm (gallic acid equivalent) and <b>peroxides</b> <b>index</b> values in the range 7. 9 - 8. 2 meq O 2 /kg of oil. The proposed prototype performs a function of effective control and regulation of the concentration of the headspace of tanks and can help to maintain the chemical characteristics of extra virgin olive oil over time.

The olive oil quality is defined by many parameters, among which acidity and <b>peroxide</b> <b>index</b> and according to international regulations, these two determinations are carried out in laboratory environment, by means of manual titration. This kind of method, however, cannot be used on oil production sites, where, instead, it would be desirable to know the main characteristics of the oil for proper product classification. In this paper, a new technique to measure olive oil acidity by electrical conductance is presented that allows for fast, cost-effective, and on-site measurements. Such a technique has been validated with a set of 55 olive oil samples. Two different oil emulsions have been used and compared for the measurements : based on a hydro-alcoholic solution (60 % ethanol 40 % distilled water) and distilled water, respectively. The data show that the electrical conductance of the emulsion with hydro-alcoholic solution is a strong function of the olive oil acidity, that can be estimated with good accuracy (R 2 = 0. 9308). The experiments with distilled water, instead, exhibit no significant correlation between oil acidity and emulsion conductance that, however, is found to provide information about <b>peroxide</b> <b>index,</b> polyphenols content, and filtration technique.

The antioxidant action of the active films was evaluated by analyzing the <b>peroxide</b> <b>index,</b> total carotenoids, and total polyphenol. The same analysis also evaluated unpacked butter, packed in films without additives and butter packed in LDPE films, as controls. The results suggested that incorporation of the antioxidants extracts tensile strength and water vapor barrier properties (15 times lower) compared to control without additives. A lower <b>peroxide</b> <b>index</b> (231. 57 %), which was significantly {{different from that of the}} control (p< 0. 05), was detected in products packed in film formulations containing average concentration of green tea extracts and high concentration of colorant. However, it was found that the high content of polyphenols in green tea extract can be acted as a pro-oxidant agent, which suggests that the use of high concentration should be avoided as additives for films. These results support the applicability of a green tea extract and oil palm carotenoics colorant in starch films totally biodegradable and the use of these materials in active packaging of the fatty products...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} extra-virgin olive oils (EVOO) from organic and {{conventional}} farming {{was investigated in}} this 3 -year (2001 – 2003) study. The oils were extracted from Leccino and Frantoio olive (Olea europaea) cultivars, grown in the same geographical area under either organic or conventional methods. Extra-virgin olive oils (EVOO) were produced with the same technology and samples were analyzed for nutritional and quality parameters. Volatile compounds were measured with solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (SPME–GC–MS). Sensory evaluation was also completed by a trained panel. Significant {{differences were found in}} these parameters between organic and conventional oils in some years, but no consistent trends across the 3 years were found. The acidity of organic Leccino oils was higher than conventional oils in 2001 and 2002 but not in 2003; Frantoio oils were never different. Organic Leccino oils had higher <b>peroxide</b> <b>index</b> than conventional oils in 2001 and 2002 but it was the reverse in 2003. Organic Frantoio oils had lower <b>peroxide</b> <b>index</b> in 2001, but values were not statistically different in the other years. The concentrations of phenols, o-diphenols, tocopherols, the antioxidant capacity and the volatile compounds showed differences in some years and no difference, or opposite differences, in others. Sensory analysis showed only slight differences in few aromatic notes. Our results showed that organic versus conventional cultivation did not affect consistently the quality of the high quality EVOO considered in this study, at least in the measured parameters. Genotype and year-to-year changes in climate, instead, had more marked effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study we have {{determined}} some characteristics (aspect, odor, solubility, emulsion type, water and volatile substances content, total fatty matter, saponification index, ester index) for three pharmaceutical ointments belonging {{to the group of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory: Diclac, Ketonal, Indometacin and one antibiotic ointment for ophthalmic use: Ophtagram. In order to achieve stability study of studied ointments, the pH, the acidity index, the <b>peroxide</b> <b>index</b> and the iodine index were determined over a year every three months. After 9 months from the opening of the tubes, analytical determinations have shown that pH values, acidity, peroxide and iodine indexes no longer fit to the values recommended for medical use, which confirms the directions available on the package...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A micromachined battery {{based on}} liquid {{electrolyte}} and metal electrodes for on-demand and disposable usages {{has been successfully}} demonstrated. The microbattery uses gold as the positive electrode and zinc as the negative electrode and is fabricated by using the standard surface micromachining technology. Two kinds of electrolytes have been tested, including the combination of sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide. The operation of the battery can be on-demand by putting a droplet of electrolyte to activate the operation. Theo-retical voltage and capacity of the microbattery are formulated and compared with experimental results. The experimental study shows that a maximum voltage of 1. 5 V and maximum capacity of 122. 2 W-min have been achieved by using a single droplet of about 0. 5 l of sulfuric acid/hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> [848] <b>Index</b> Terms—Battery, disposable micropower, MEMS, micro-machines, microsystems...|$|R
30|$|Chemical indexes such as acid, <b>peroxide</b> and iodine <b>indexes</b> were {{obtained}} following AOAC (1997) methods. Specific gravity (35 – 65  °C) and refractive index (40  °C) of melted butters were determined following IUPAC (1979) method {{by using a}} pycnometer and a refractometer (Metller Toledo, Switzerland), respectively. Viscosity was determined at different temperatures (35 – 65  °C) by using a viscometer apparatus (SVM 3000, Anton Paar GmbH, Austria) equipped with a syringe filled with 1  mL of melted butter sample. Values of viscosities were automatically recorded after temperature programming.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the influence of frying time on the alterations of sunflower, corn and soybean oils during deep fat frying of potato chips. The analytical methods used to evaluate the oil alterations are: free fatty acids, <b>peroxide</b> value, refractive <b>index</b> and total polar compounds. An increase of free fatty acids, refractive index and total polar compounds with frying time were observed. The different behaviors observed for the three vegetables oils can be explained by the differences in the initial composition and quality of them...|$|R
