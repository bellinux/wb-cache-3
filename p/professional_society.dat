Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by {{the publication of a}} Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the American <b>Professional</b> <b>Society</b> on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue. In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.|$|E

25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the <b>professional</b> <b>society,</b> the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E
