40|$|The {{development}} of peck orders in mixed sex groups of domestic chickens was observed {{to determine how}} linearity occurred. Based on threats, head-pecks and submission, dominance relationships emerged in a virtual <b>peck</b> <b>right</b> form. Leaping by males, however, did not closely conform to dominance relationships. There were no rank reversals in 50 % of male-male and 80 % of female-female relationships, and only single changes occurred {{in most of the}} others. These resulted from the movements of individuals up the hierarchy rather than from any general reorganization of relationships. Reversals did not necessarily occur between rank neighbours, and stable triangles were sometimes introduced. The initial status of males and females depended upon the age at which they first showed aggression, while the final, stable status of males depended upon the age at which they were first submitted to. Sexual maturity of the males produced a number of changes, with earlier-maturing birds tending to rise in status above their later-maturing companions. Linear hierarchies therefore appear to result from birds developing at different rates...|$|E

40|$|Seventeen pigeons {{were exposed}} to a three-key discrete-trial {{procedure}} in which a peck on the lit center key produced food if, and only if, the left keylight was lit. The center key was illuminated by a peck on the lit right key. Of interest was whether subjects <b>pecked</b> the <b>right</b> key {{before or after the}} response-independent onset of the left keylight. <b>Pecks</b> on the <b>right</b> key after left-keylight onset suggest control of behavior by the left keylight—an establishing stimulus. In three experiments, the strength of center-keylight onset as conditioned reinforcer for a response on the right key was manipulated by altering the size of the reduction in time to food delivery correlated with its onset. Control of pigeons' key pecks by onset of the left keylight occurred on more trials per session when the center keylight was a relatively weak conditioned reinforcer and on fewer trials per session when the center keylight was a relatively strong condtioned reinforcer. Differences across conditions in the degree of control by onset of the establishing stimulus were greatest when changes in conditioned reinforcer strength occurred relatively frequently and were signaled. The results provide evidence of the function of an establishing stimulus...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} determined whether pigeons minimize {{number of}} key pecks per food delivery and maintain their baseline intake of food while key pecking on a three-component chain schedule. Pigeons at either 80 % or 100 % body weight obtained all their food during baseline and contingency sessions. During baseline sessions, pecks {{on the left and}} center keys had no consequences; each <b>peck</b> on the <b>right</b> key activated the feeder. During contingency sessions, pigeons key pecked on a three-component chain schedule simulating components of a foraging chain. In the search component either 3, 9 or 15 key pecks (varied parametrically across blocks of sessions) on the left key produced a stimulus on the middle key, indicating an encounter with either the low-cost prey (3 key pecks) or an equally probable high-cost prey (21 key pecks). In the procurement component the pigeon pecked either: (a) the left key once, thus returning to the search component, or (b) the middle key either 3 or 21 times, which activated the right response key. In the handling component one <b>peck</b> on the <b>right</b> key operated the feeder. The pigeons always procured the low-cost prey and minimized the {{number of key}} pecks per hopper by procuring the high-cost prey when the search-cost ratio was high (15 key pecks) but not when it was low (3 key pecks). All pigeons maintained their baselines of eating during contingency sessions by key pecking more frequently and eating more efficiently. The 80 % body-weight birds produced higher overall rates of key pecking and eating. These results have implications for ecological theories of optimal foraging and for psychological theories of learned performance...|$|R

40|$|Although newborns have {{surprised}} scientists with their learning skills, proficiency on concurrent schedules of reinforcement requires (in effect) {{the ability to}} integrate and compare behavior–consequence relations over time. Can very young animals obey the quantitative relation that applies to such repeated choices, the generalized matching law? The provenance of the skill is not well understood, and this study provides the first investigation of matching in neonates. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) hatchlings <b>pecked</b> left and <b>right</b> targets on a touchscreen for heat delivery on a concurrent variable-interval reinforcement schedule. Within 5  days after hatching, the chicks showed sensitivity levels significantly greater than zero, but short of typical adult levels. However, stable sequential patterns emerged almost immediately, including a consistent choose-rich tendency after unreinforced responses, one that entails some degree of temporal integration. These exploratory {{data suggest that the}} basic ability to match develops quickly in this precocial species, but that more extensive experience may be required to achieve the higher sensitivities typically seen in adults...|$|R
40|$|Pigeons {{responded in}} a successive-encounters {{procedure}} {{that consisted of}} a search state, a choice state, and a handling state. The search state was either a fixed-interval or mixed-interval schedule presented on the center key of a three-key chamber. Upon completion of the search state, the choice state was presented, in which the center key was off and the two side keys were lit. A pigeon could either accept a delay followed by food (by <b>pecking</b> the <b>right</b> key) or reject this option {{and return to the}} search state (by pecking the left key). During the choice state, a red right key represented the long alternative (a long handling delay followed by food), and a green right key represented the short alternative (a short handling delay followed by food). In some conditions, both the short and long alternatives were fixed-time schedules, and in other conditions both were mixed-time schedules. Contrary to the predictions of both optimal foraging theory and delay-reduction theory, the percentage of trials on which pigeons accepted the long alternative depended on whether the search and handling schedules were fixed or mixed. They were more likely to accept the long alternative when the search states were fixed-interval rather than mixed-interval schedules, and more likely to reject the long alternative when the handling states were fixed-time rather than mixed-time schedules. This pattern of results was in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the hyperbolic-decay model, which states that the value of a reinforcer is inversely related to the delay between a choice response and reinforcer delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the performance of}} 6 pigeons trained to detect luminance differences in two different signal-detection procedures. Exposed to a three-key array, the pigeons were trained to peck the left key when the brighter of two light intensities had been presented on the center key and to <b>peck</b> the <b>right</b> key when the dimmer of two light intensities had been presented on the center key. Procedure A was a standard signal-detection procedure in which left/bright and right/dim responses produced food reinforcement and left/dim and right/bright responses produced periods of timeout. Procedure B was designed to simulate some of the contingencies operating in a prey-detection situation. Left-key responses produced reinforcement following the brighter center-key stimulus and a period of timeout following the dimmer center-key stimulus. Right-key responses always produced {{a short period of}} timeout irrespective of the stimulus. Within each procedure, the duration of timeout arranged for false alarms (left/dim responses) was varied between 3 s and 120 s. Measures of accuracy and response bias were compared between the two procedures. The timeout manipulation produced systematic, but relatively small, changes in these measures when right/dim responses (i. e., correct rejections) produced reinforcement (Procedure A). Arranging timeout for right/dim responses in Procedure B produced greater variability in accuracy and response bias than did arranging reinforcement, but this variability was not related to timeout duration. Overall, discrimination accuracy was considerably higher when right/dim responses produced timeout than when they resulted in reinforcement, and accuracy was accompanied by a large bias toward the response associated with reinforcement. These results are consistent with a recently proposed model of signal detection...|$|R
40|$|Bower's (1961) all-or-none {{model of}} human paired-associate {{learning}} {{was applied to}} individual data supplied by three pigeons. When the center one of three keys was illuminated with red light or with three white dots in a vertical array on a black ground, pecking on the left key was reinforced. When the center key was lighted green or with a horizontal array of three white dots on a black ground, <b>pecking</b> on the <b>right</b> key was reinforced. The left and right keys were illuminated with white light. The task {{was considered to be}} analogous to learning a paired-associate list of four pairs involving four stimulus items and two response items. The model was evaluated by comparing the following model predictions with values obtained from each animal: trials-to-criterion, standard deviation of trials-to-criterion, standard deviation of errors-to-criterion, mean error runs, mean error runs of lengths one to four, and autocorrelations of errors of lags one to three. Most of the predictions based upon the model were in close agreement with the obtained data...|$|R
40|$|The discriminative {{control over}} a spatial choice {{response}} exercised by prior behavior was studied using a procedure involving discrete exposures to a two-member chained schedule. The initial member (red key) was either a smaller or larger fixed ratio (Mix FR:FR), the completion of which produced, after a 1 -sec delay, two white response keys. If the larger FR had been completed as the initial chain member, a single <b>peck</b> on the <b>right</b> white key was reinforced; after the smaller FR, a peck on the left white key was reinforced. Frequencies of unreinforced responses (SΔ responses) were determined with several pairs of red-key FRs: 95 - 5, 75 - 25, 65 - 35, 60 - 40, 58 - 42 and 50 - 50. The SΔ response frequencies were low through the FR pair 65 - 35; sharp increases were obtained with pairs 60 - 40 and 58 - 42. Later, curves analogous to stimulus generalization functions were obtained using a probe procedure. Finally, the delay interval between completion of a red-key FR and the white-key choice response was manipulated: results were variable, but SΔ response frequencies tended to increase with increasing delays...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the pigeon}} {{is a popular}} model for {{studying}} visual perception, relatively {{little is known about}} its perception of motion. Three experiments examined the pigeons' ability to capture a moving stimulus. In Experiment 1, the effect of manipulating stimulus speed and the length of the stimulus was examined using a simple rightward linear motion. This revealed a clear effect of length on capture and speed on errors. Errors were mostly anticipatory and there appeared to be two processes contributing to response locations: anticipatory peck bias and lag time. Using the same birds as Experiment 1, Experiment 2 assessed transfer of tracking and capture to novel linear motions. The birds were able to capture other motion directions, but they displayed a strong rightward peck bias, indicating that they had learned to <b>peck</b> to the <b>right</b> of the stimulus in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 used the same task as Experiment 2 but with naÃ¯ve birds. These birds did not show the rightward bias in pecking and instead pecked more evenly around the stimulus. The combined results indicate that the pigeon can engage in anticipatory tracking and capture of a moving stimulus, and that motion properties and training experience influence capture.

40|$|Five pigeons {{were trained}} to detect {{differences}} in light intensity. Two stimuli, S 1 and S 2, differing in intensity, were arranged on the center key of a three-key chamber according to set probabilities. A peck on the center key turned on the two side keys. When S 1 was presented on the center key, a peck on the left key was "correct" and when S 2 was presented, a <b>peck</b> on the <b>right</b> key was "correct. " Correct responses produced reinforcement and incorrect responses produced 3 -second blackout. Detection performance was measured under three procedures. The first was a standard signal-detection design in which the probability of S 1 was varied {{and the number of}} reinforcements obtained for correct responses to S 1 was allowed to covary. In the second procedure, the probability of S 1 was again varied but the distribution of reinforcements between the two choices was kept equal. In the third procedure, probability of S 1 was held constant while the distribution of reinforcements was varied between the two choices. Changes in response bias were a function of variations in the relative reinforcement ratio for the choice responses and not a function of variations in the probability of stimulus presentation. Discriminability remained constant across the three procedures...|$|R
40|$|A within-subjects {{comparison}} {{was made}} of pigeons' performance on two temporal discrimination procedures that were signaled by differently colored keylight samples. During stimulus trials, a peck on the key displaying a slanted line was reinforced following short keylight samples, and a peck on the key displaying a horizontal line was reinforced following long keylight samples, regardless of {{the location of the}} stimuli on those two choice keys. During position trials, a peck on the left key was reinforced following short keylight samples and a <b>peck</b> on the <b>right</b> key was reinforced following long keylight samples, regardless of which line stimulus appeared on the correct key. Thus, on stimulus trials, the correct choice key could not be discriminated prior to the presentation of the test stimuli, whereas on position trials, the correct choice key could be discriminated during the presentation of the sample stimulus. During Phase 1, with a 0 -s delay between sample and choice stimuli, discrimination learning was faster on position trials than on stimulus trials for all 4 birds. During Phase 2, 0 -, 0. 5 -, and 1. 0 -s delays produced differential loss of stimulus control under the two tasks for 2 birds. Response patterns during the delay intervals provided some evidence for differential mediation of the two delayed discriminations. These between-task differences suggest that the same processes may not mediate performance in each...|$|R
40|$|Two pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} a grating stimulus from a blank stimulus of equivalent luminance in a three-key chamber. The stimuli and blanks were presented behind a transparent center key. The procedure was a conditional discrimination in which pecks on the left key were reinforced if the blank had been present behind the center key and <b>pecks</b> on the <b>right</b> key were reinforced if the grating had been present behind the center key. The spatial frequency of the stimuli was varied in each session from four to 29. 5 lines per millimeter in accordance with {{a variation of the}} method of constant stimuli. The number of lines per millimeter that the subjects could discriminate at threshold was determined from psychometric functions. Data were collected at five values of stimulus luminance ranging from [...] 0. 07 to 3. 29 log cd/m 2. The distance from the stimulus to the anterior nodal point of the eye, which was determined from measurements taken from high-speed motion-picture photographs of three additional pigeons and published intraocular measurements, was 62. 0 mm. This distance and the grating detection thresholds were used to calculate the visual acuity of the birds at each level of luminance. Acuity improved with increasing luminance to a peak value of 0. 52, which corresponds to a visual angle of 1. 92 min, at a luminance of 2. 33 log cd/m 2. Further increase in luminance produced a small decline in acuity...|$|R
40|$|Ten pigeons <b>pecked</b> {{left and}} <b>right</b> keys in a discrete-trials {{experiment}} in which access to food was contingent upon changeovers {{to the right}} key after particular runs of left-key pecks. In each of three sets of conditions, two run lengths were reinforced according to a concurrent variable-interval schedule: reinforcement followed runs of either 1 or 2, 1 or 4, or 2 or 4 left-key pecks preceding changeovers. The intertrial interval separating successive pecks was varied from. 5 to 10. 0 sec, and the relative frequency of reinforcement for the shorter of the two reinforced runs was varied from 0 to. 75. The contingencies established local behavioral patterning that roughly approximated that required for reinforcement. For a fixed pair of reinforced run lengths, preference for the shorter of the two frequently increased as the intertrial interval increased and therefore as the minimum temporal durations of both reinforced runs increased. Preference for the shorter of the two also increased as its corresponding relative frequency of reinforcement increased. Both of these effects on preference were qualitatively similar to corresponding effects in previous research with two different kinds of reinforced behavioral patterns, interresponse times and interchangeover times. In all these experiments, analytical units {{were found in the}} temporal patterns of behavior, not in the behavior immediately contiguous with a reinforcer. It is suggested that a particular local temporal pattern of behavior is established {{to the extent to which}} it is repeatedly remembered when reinforcers are delivered, regardless of whether the delivery of a reinforcer is explicitly contingent upon that pattern...|$|R
