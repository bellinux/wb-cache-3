The kidnapping of family members may be used to coerce co-operation, the provision of information, use of a property as a safe house, a copy of a key etc. High value hostages may be taken in order to force the release of captured comrades and as media spectaculars. At all levels creating a fear of kidnapping reinforces a message that the state and its security forces cannot <b>protect</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king.

She really stands out due to the dark background." [...] He believed that New Cutie Honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters' expositions, and that Honey instead [...] "makes her own moves, and she carries the whole story". On the relative weakness of male characters in the series, he said, [...] "Honey-chan is like a mother, and she loves to protect weak men.

The song first began as a demo and was recorded as early as April 1984 for her second studio album, Like a Virgin.

She had decided to release [...] "Angel" [...] as the initial single from the album, but changed her mind, after the recording of the title track [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was complete. [...] "Angel" [...] was an ode to [...] "a heavenly love" [...] and inspired from Madonna's Catholic upbringing with the singer saying, [...] "I think it's important to call angels to you to <b>protect</b> <b>you...</b> That's part of the ritualistic moment. The calling of angels." [...] The track was ultimately released as the third single, and included the song [...] "Into the Groove", from Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan, on the B-side of the 12-inch maxi-single.|$|E

[...] When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, [...] "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of the}} garden." [...] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will <b>protect</b> <b>you,</b> that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.|$|E
