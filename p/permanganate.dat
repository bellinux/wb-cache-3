5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air. <b>Permanganate</b> (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium <b>permanganate,</b> sodium <b>permanganate,</b> and barium <b>permanganate</b> are all potent oxidizers. Potassium <b>permanganate,</b> also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium <b>permanganate</b> were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>permanganate</b> {{exhibits}} a higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the <b>permanganate</b> is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium <b>permanganate</b> (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} used must be dilute; {{reactions}} of <b>permanganates</b> with concentrated sulfuric acid yield the anhydride, manganese heptoxide.|$|R
50|$|It {{contains}} manganese in {{its highest}} oxidation state. This oxidation state, +7, {{is shared by}} <b>permanganates,</b> which are more stable compounds.|$|R
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep acetic acid away from chromic acid, ethylene glycol, nitric acid, perchloric acid, <b>permanganates,</b> peroxides and hydroxyls.|$|R
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium <b>permanganate</b> dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium <b>permanganate</b> {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to <b>permanganate,</b> a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{catalysts}} for decomposing {{hydrogen peroxide}} in rocket engines have certain advantages over conventional gauzes or pellets. The most potent liquid agents for achieving this decomposition are the <b>permanganates.</b> However, <b>permanganates</b> {{have a tendency}} to precipitate at the outlet to the injector and this militates against their use for multiple engine restarts. Against this background, the authors have investigated the feasibility of using different liquid agents to achieve the rapid decomposition needed for use in both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket applications. The results to date suggest that it is unlikely that any of the candidate agents considered will match the performance of the <b>permanganates.</b> However, {{at least one of the}} agents (sodium iodide) was found to initiate a very high decomposition rate, albeit with an undesirable initial delay. It was found that ferrous chloride tetrahydrate had no such delay and was capable of producing useful decomposition temperatures...|$|R

50|$|The {{decomposition}} of T-Stoff into hot steam and oxygen {{caused by the}} addition of the catalyst Z-Stoff (an aqueous solution of <b>permanganates)</b> was used to drive the split-tube steam catapults which launched the V-1 flying bomb.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide Mn2O7, compounds of the intensely purple <b>permanganate</b> anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter <b>permanganate,</b> pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple <b>permanganate</b> ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent, and {{is illustrated by the}} fact that it oxidizes Mn2+ ions to <b>permanganates.</b> When the pyridine ligands were removed, the transient square planar Ag(H2O)42+ remains, which spontaneously oxidizes water to oxygen.|$|R
5000|$|Oxygenated anions such as {{chlorates}} (...) , perchlorates (...) , chromates (...) , dichromates (...) , <b>permanganates</b> (...) , and nitrates (...) {{are strong}} oxidizing agents. Oxygen forms heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate ions with tungsten, molybdenum {{and some other}} transition metals, such as phosphotungstic acid (...) and octadecamolybdophosphoric acid (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Per{{chlorates}}, chlorates and nitrates are {{the most}} commonly used oxidizers for flash powders. Other possibilities include <b>permanganates,</b> chromates, and some oxides. Generally, the less the oxidizer, the slower the burning and the more light produced. For use at very high temperatures, sulfates can be used as oxidizers in combination with very strongly reducing fuels.|$|R
25|$|China fully {{participates in}} the DEA's Operations TOPAZ and PURPLE, which are {{international}} monitoring initiatives that target acetic anhydride and potassium <b>permanganate,</b> respectively. Acetic anhydride is used to synthesize morphine base into heroin, and potassium <b>permanganate</b> is used as an oxidizer in cocaine production. Both chemicals are targeted {{because they are the}} chemicals most often preferred, and most widely used, by illicit drug manufacturers. However, the effectiveness of Operation PURPLE has been declining recently, since participant nations are exporting significant amounts of potassium <b>permanganate</b> to non-participant countries.|$|E
25|$|In histology, {{potassium}} <b>permanganate</b> {{was used}} as a bleaching agent.|$|E
25|$|In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using {{potassium}} <b>permanganate</b> {{is considered}} undesirable {{because of the}} low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium <b>permanganate</b> can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with chromium (VI) compounds.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The <b>permanganates</b> of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|R
5000|$|Condy had an {{interest}} in disinfectants and marketed products such as [...] "ozonised water". He developed and patented [...] "Condy's fluid" [...] in 1857. Condy’s fluid was a disinfectant solution of alkaline manganates and <b>permanganates</b> that could be taken internally or used externally. It had various indications including the treatment and prevention of scarlet fever. A more stable crystalline version of Condy’s fluid was subsequently developed and marketed as Condy’s Crystals or Condy’s powder. The fluid and crystals were both manufactured at the company’s works in Battersea between 1867 and 1897. The factory was taken over by Morgan Crucible.|$|R
50|$|Paraffin {{oxidation}} is {{a historical}} industrial process {{for the production of}} synthetic fatty acids. The fatty acids are further processed to consumer products such as soaps and fats as well as to lubricating greases for technical applications. Coal slack wax, a saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbon mixture and by-product of the Fischer-Tropsch process was used as raw material. Side products were a wide range of carboxylic acids and oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters, or ketones. The oxidation of paraffins was carried out in the liquid phase by molecular oxygen in the presence of catalysts such as <b>permanganates,</b> at temperatures in the range of about 100 to 120 °C and under atmospheric pressure.|$|R
25|$|Oxidative {{cleavage}} of olefins by ozonolysis, potassium <b>permanganate,</b> or potassium dichromate.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{manganate}} is {{the precursor}} to potassium <b>permanganate,</b> a common oxidant.|$|E
25|$|Oxalic {{acid and}} oxalates can be {{oxidized}} by <b>permanganate</b> in an autocatalytic reaction.|$|E
50|$|The metal is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} the oxide with sodium, magnesium, aluminium, or by electrolysis. Pyrolusite is extensively used for the manufacture of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese and of various alloys such as manganese-bronze. As an oxidizing agent it {{is used in the}} preparation of chlorine; indeed, chlorine gas itself was first described by Karl Scheele in 1774 from the reaction products of pyrolusite and hydrochloric acid. Natural pyrolusite has been used in batteries, but high-quality batteries require synthetic products. Pyrolusite is also used to prepare disinfectants (<b>permanganates)</b> and for decolorizing glass. When mixed with molten glass it oxidizes the ferrous iron to ferric iron, and so discharges the green and brown tints (making it classically useful to glassmakers as a decolorizer). As a coloring material, it is used in calico printing and dyeing; for imparting violet, amber, and black colors to glass, pottery, and bricks; and in the manufacture of green and violet paints.|$|R
40|$|Hexavalent chromium-based {{passivation}} treatments {{have been}} successfully used as promoters of conversion coatings for many years. Their effectiveness is without question {{although there are many}} problems with regard to their environmental suitability. Hexavalent chromium compounds are carcinogenic and toxic. These problems have lead researchers to evaluate other potential systems, with lower toxicity, to ascertain if they can replace chromates as effective passivators. Researchers have proposed several alternative passivation treatments; these are processes based on molybdates, <b>permanganates,</b> titanates, rare earth metal and Cr 3 + (considered to be non-carcinogenic) compounds. In this work, zinc coatings obtained from free-cyanide alkaline bath and submitted to a Cr 3 + based passivation treatment with different colors were studied. The corrosion behavior was studied by polarization measurements and mainly by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 0. 6 N NaCl solution. Morphological observations on the coatings surface were also performed. The results indicate that the green-colored Cr 3 + passivated coatings have a good corrosion resistance followed by yellow and blue-colored passivation respectively. They could be a less polluting alternative to the traditional chromated coatings...|$|R
30|$|The {{liquid phase}} {{oxidation}} of benzyl alcohol {{is a widely}} investigated reaction by both academics and engineers as it provides benzaldehyde and benzoic acid [1]. Both products can act as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals or perfume [2 – 7]. In the past few years, numerous catalytic systems {{have been developed to}} perform this chemo-selective oxidation of alcohols [6]. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts can perform this benzyl alcohol oxidation. Traditional homogeneous catalytic systems for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols use stoichiometric chemicals such as chromium (VI) reagents, dimethyl sulfoxide, hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), nitric acid, and <b>permanganates</b> or other inorganic oxidants [6, 8]. Homogeneous catalysis normally has excellent reactivity and selectivity in a small scale reaction since in homogeneous catalysts every single catalytic entity can act as a single active site [9 – 12]. But on an industrial scale and considering environmental and ecological issues, the drawback of homogeneous catalysis is evident, such as catalyst leaking, poisoning, toxic metal waste, difficulty in separation, and recovery of the catalyst from the reaction mixture as well as limited recyclability [12 – 16].|$|R

25|$|Potassium {{dichromate}} is an {{oxidising agent}} in organic chemistry, and is milder than potassium <b>permanganate.</b> It {{is used to}} oxidize alcohols. It converts primary alcohols into aldehydes and, under more forcing conditions, into carboxylic acids. In contrast, potassium <b>permanganate</b> tends to give carboxylic acids as the sole products. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified dichromate. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{residues}} {{of persistence}} potentially toxic organic compounds polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in 13 species of edible vegetables collected from Great Cairo governorate (Egypt). And the efficient role of washing by oxidizing agents hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), potassium <b>permanganates</b> (KMnO 4) and midribs of cabbage leaves solutions on {{the elimination of}} PAHs from contaminated vegetables was investigated. Vegetable samples were all soxhlet-extracted in triplicate, cleaned up by open chromatography and analysed using gas chromatography with mass selective detection. It was observed that all tested vegetables have been contaminated with PAHs. The total content of 16 PAHs ranged from 1. 22 to 12. 63 ppb with the highest PAHs found in leafy vegetables. PAHs (3 - 4 rings) were dominant in all vegetable samples. The results also indicates the efficient role of washing by oxidizing agent in elimination of PAHs from naturally contaminated carrots. Midribs of cabbage leaves solution is the most efficient in removing PAHs followed by H 2 O 2 and KMnO 4. the removal percentages of the total PAHs ranged from 65. 5 to 97. 8 % and from 79. 4 to 99. 9 % at 4 and 8 % concentrations of oxidizing reagents, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEven if {{photochemical}} {{deposition of}} nearly all types of materials {{has been used for}} decades to pattern almost any kind of substrate for various applications catalysis, chemical sensing, magnetic data storage, optoelectronics, spin-dependent electron transport, and solar cells, a rationalized description is still missing. This paper aims at fulfilling this lack by presenting a unified approach of the photodeposit growth initiated by a onephoton photochemical reaction. We experimentally investigate the robustness of growth scalings predicted for photochemical deposition driven by a continuous laser wave. Three types of one-photon photochemical reactions photoexcitation of chromates, photodissociation of <b>permanganates,</b> and photocondensation of colloidal selenium and three parameters solvent pH variations, concentration in photoactive reagent, and influence of the exciting optical wavelength were cross analyzed. In all the cases, including data taken from the literature, the same dynamic master behavior emerges from the data rescaling of measured deposit growth laws. The nice agreement observed between system-independent predictions and the whole data set strongly supports a universal description of the photodeposit growth whatever the photosensitive medium and the involved onephoton chemical reaction. Such an approach also points out the quantitative sorting of photochemical reactions in terms of deposition efficiency. This rationalization of the kinetics of photodeposition anticipates new methodologies to predict, design, and control substrate micropatterning for chemical, lithographic, and optoelectronic applications...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la XXXII Conference Expert Group Meeting on Organometallic Chemistry celebrada en Tarragona (España) del 17 al 19 de septiembre de 2014. [Work {{hypothesis}} and objective]: The {{catalytic oxidation}} of olefins to give oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes, ketones or ethers {{are some of}} the most important transformations in the industry due to the high impact that these products have in our daily life. Despite the enormous efforts of the chemists, some of these processes are still dangerous or contaminant. For example, ozonolysis is a good method for the synthesis of aldehydes; however ozone can be explosive under the drastic reaction conditions used. Other oxidizing agents such as <b>permanganates,</b> iodates or dichromates are toxic. Therefore, the search of alternative systems able to cleanly and safetly oxidize C=C bonds is a priority goal in current chemistry. In this sense, the use of oxygen from the air as a friendly oxidant in the oxygenation of organic compounds is a challenge that remains unsolved nowadays. [Results]: In this communication we will show that rhodium complexes bearing robust bidentate N,O-ligands are able to activate oxygen and transfer it to olefins to give a variety of oxygenated species Thus, ketones, ethers or aldehydes can be isolated from a fine tuning of the reaction conditions. Mechanistic features directing the selectivity to one or other type of products will be discussed. In addition, one complex derived from the regioselective hydroxylation of one of the C=C bonds of cod (1, 5 - cyclooctadiene) has also been isolated and its formation will be discussed in the overall scheme.
