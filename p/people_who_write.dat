25|$|I see <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>write</b> {{characters}} who are loonies {{and make them}} convincing and believable, and I envy them tremendously. I don’t really understand them. It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s a very strange place for somebody who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|E

500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{experience}} of making Che, Soderbergh {{has said that he}} now wishes that he had not made the film and remarked, [...] "Literally I'd wake up and think, 'At least I'm not doing that today.'" [...] The director blamed piracy for the film's financial failure and felt that [...] "It's a film that, to some extent, needs the support of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>write</b> about films. If you'd had all these guys running around talking in accented English you'd [...] your head taken off".|$|E

2500|$|She {{has written}} {{critical}} studies of Dame Iris Murdoch, {{who was a}} friend, mentor and a significant influence on her own writing. In those books and other works, Byatt alludes to, and builds upon, themes from Romantic and Victorian literature. She conceives of fantasy as an alternative to, rather than an escape from, everyday life, and {{it is often difficult}} to tell when the fantastic in her work actually represents the eruption of psychosis. [...] "In my work", she notes [...] "writing is always so dangerous. It's very destructive. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>write</b> books are destroyers." [...] Possession (1990) parallels the emerging relationship of two contemporary academics with the past of two (fictional) nineteenth century poets whom they are researching. It won the Booker Prize in 1990 and was made into a film in 2002. Byatt's novella Morpho Eugenia, included in Angels & Insects (1992), was turned into the successful film with this same title (1995), nominated for an Academy Award. Her novel [...] The Children's Book was shortlisted for the 2009 Man Booker Prize and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.|$|E

40|$|Self-focused {{attention}} {{is difficult to}} measure. Two studies developed an im-plicit measure of self-focus based on word recognition latencies. Self-focused attention activates self-content, so self-focused people should recognize self-relevant words more quickly. Study 1 measured individual-differences in self-focused attention. People scoring high in private self-consciousness rec-ognized self-relevant words more quickly. Study 2 manipulated objective self-awareness with a <b>writing</b> task. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> about distinctive self-as-pects (high self-awareness) recognized self-relevant words more quickly com-pared to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> about a neutral topic (low self-awareness) and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> did no <b>writing</b> (control). The discussion considers implications for future research on self-focused attention.

60|$|By poets, as I have said, I do {{not mean}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>write</b> poetry, or indeed <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>write</b> anything. I mean such people as, having culture and imagination, use them to {{understand}} and share the feelings of their fellows; as against those who use them to rise to {{what they call a}} higher plane. Crudely, the poet differs from the mob by his sensibility; the professor differs from the mob by his insensibility. He has not sufficient finesse and sensitiveness to sympathize with the mob. His only notion is coarsely to contradict it, to cut across it, in accordance with some egotistical plan of his own; to tell himself that, whatever the ignorant say, they are probably wrong. He forgets that ignorance often has the exquisite intuitions of innocence.|$|E
