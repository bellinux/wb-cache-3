30|$|The {{inability}} of wind turbines to mitigate or ride through grid disturbances poses new challenges to operation stability in electric power systems [7]. Small signal or large signal disturbances also cause stability problems in conventional electric power systems. Based on dynamic {{characteristics of the}} load, the process to secure operation stability involves disturbance identification, dynamic control of generations, special protection schemes for system security, etc. Dynamic control of generations responds to disturbances in three ways: active <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> to mitigate phase disturbance, active <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> to mitigate frequency disturbance, and reactive <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> to mitigate voltage disturbance. With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net dynamics of generations exhibits two new features: decreasing ability to mitigate disturbances and decreasing ability to survive disturbances. The study shows that these features first impact voltage stability at the interconnection and further impact angle and frequency stability of the system when the penetration level grows. Large-scale integration of wind therefore requires a substantial increase of the ability of wind plants to mitigate and survive grid disturbances.|$|R
40|$|Perturbation of {{external}} neutron source can cause significant local power changes transformed into undesired safety-related events in an accelerator driven system. Therefore for the accurate design of MYRRHA sub-critical core {{it is important}} to evaluate the uncertainty of <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> caused by the uncertainties in nuclear reaction models describing the particle transport from primary proton energy down to the evaluated nuclear data table range. The calculations with a set of models resulted in quite low uncertainty on the local power caused by significant perturbation of primary neutron yield from proton interactions with lead and bismuth isotopes. The considered accidental event of prescribed proton beam shape loss causes drastic increase in local power but does not practically change the total core thermal power making this effect difficult to detect. In the same time the results demonstrate a correlation between perturbed local <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> in normal operation and misaligned beam conditions indicating that generation of covariance data for proton and neutron induced neutron multiplicities for lead and bismuth isotopes is needed to obtain reliable uncertainties for local <b>power</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Low {{frequency}} oscillations due to {{the lack}} of damping may occur in power systems under normal operation and will cause system instability. These oscillations are essentially nonlinear <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> which are difficult to extract the inherent characteristics by the time domain method. This paper aims to analyze nonlinear <b>power</b> <b>responses</b> by using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) which is a time-frequency signal processing method which comprises steps of the empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert transform. Dynamic <b>power</b> system <b>responses,</b> including generator output power and line power are to be processed by the HHT and a set of intrinsic mode functions and the associated Hilbert spectrum are obtained. The generator with most effects on the system will be accordingly found out through the time-frequency analysis and the power system stabilizer will be placed at the generator. Numerical results from a sample power system are demonstrated to show the validity of the time-frequency approach in the study of power system low frequency oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Work on dynamic {{topology}} optimization of engineering structures for vibration suppression has mainly addressed the maximization of eigenfrequencies and gaps between consecutive eigenfrequencies of free vibration, minimization {{of the dynamic}} compliance subject to forced vibration, and minimization of the structural frequency response. A dynamic {{topology optimization}} method of bimaterial plate structures is presented based on power flow analysis. Topology optimization problems formulated directly with the design objective of minimizing the <b>power</b> flow <b>response</b> are dealt with. In comparison to the displacement or velocity <b>response,</b> the <b>power</b> flow <b>response</b> takes not only the amplitude of force and velocity into account, but also the phase relationship of the two vector quantities. The complex expression of <b>power</b> flow <b>response</b> is derived based on time-harmonic external mechanical loading and Rayleigh damping. The mathematical formulation of topology optimization is established based on <b>power</b> flow <b>response</b> and bimaterial solid isotropic material with penalization(SIMP) model. Computational optimization procedure is developed by using adjoint design sensitivity analysis and the method of moving asymptotes(MMA). Several numerical examples are presented for bimaterial plate structures with different loading frequencies, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. Additionally, optimum results between topological design of minimum <b>power</b> flow <b>response</b> and minimum dynamic compliance are compared, showing that the present method has strong adaptability for structural dynamic topology optimization problems.

5000|$|Engines are {{commonly}} set {{to increase their}} power output when under load. This permits low speeds but very good speed stability, so the climb performance is excellent.

40|$|International audienceA {{structural}} zone partitioning {{methodology of}} complex uncertain structural-acoustic systems is presented. This methodology {{is based on}} an energy field formulation of the vibroacoustic problem. In this energy-field formulation, the vibroacoustic system is modelled using statistical averaging over independent realizations of a probabilistic vibroacoustic model. In the vibroacoustic energy model, excitations are represented in terms of input power, observations are represented in terms of <b>response</b> <b>power,</b> and the propagation between excitation and observation points is represented by a set of <b>Power</b> Frequency <b>Response</b> Functions (PFRF). When statistically averaged, these parameters are linearly related to form the equation of the vibroacoustic energy model. It is shown that above a given frequency the <b>power</b> frequency <b>response</b> functions are much less dependant, on the direction or on the precise location of the excitation or the observation, than the classical frequency response functions.
