5|$|Some {{activities}} {{that were once}} considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, {{have been removed from}} the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the <b>participants,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{resignation}} of SS commander Erhard Heiden in January 1929, Himmler assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval; he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. One of his first responsibilities was to organise SS <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg Rally that September. Over the next year, Himmler grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.|$|E

The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
5|$|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines {{debuted in}} the Olympic Games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and, as of 2008, {{has participated in}} every edition since. The Beijing Games marked the {{smallest}} Vincentian delegation in the country's history, the size having declined over the years from its largest delegation of eight <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. At {{the conclusion of the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' team has yet to medal in an event. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 28 July 2008, and stayed in the Olympic Village for the duration of their time in China. The Vincentians arrived early, three days after the Village itself opened, to make adjusting to the new environment easier. The delegation was accompanied by coach Gideon Labban; team manager Leroy Llewellyn; and chaperone Jacintha Ballantyne. Kineke Alexander was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony, leading Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the 64th nation in line.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Grand Slam Masters Final on 9–15 October, {{which he}} had {{qualified}} for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events (2009 Nanjing Pearl Spring, 2010 Corus, 2010 Bazna Kings). Along with Carlsen, the finals consisted of World Champion Anand and the highest two scorers from the preliminary stage held in Shanghai in September: Kramnik and Shirov. The average Elo of the <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in serious jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat {{in the latter part}} of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6. The tournament was won by Kramnik with 4/6. Carlsen finished this tournament with a rating of 2802, two points behind Anand at 2804 who temporarily ended Carlsen's reign at world No. 1. These setbacks called into question from some whether Carlsen's activities outside chess, such as modelling for G-Star Raw, were distracting him from performing well at the chessboard. Carlsen said he did not believe there was a direct connection.|$|E
