Its analogues contain a ketomethylene {{isostere}} replacement at the scissile bond that is believed to mimic the tetrahedron transition state of the proteolytic reaction at the active site. The focus was on a simple tripeptide Phe-Ala-Pro, which in earlier enzyme assays has shown inhibition activity. Replacement of alanine with glycin gave a tripeptide with 1/14th of the inhibition activity of Phe-Ala-Pro. The benzoylated derivative of Phe-Gly-Pro, Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro, was twice as active. To reduce the peptidic nature of ketomethylene inhibitors the P1’ and P2’ substituent may be cyclized to form a lactam, where there is a correlation between the inhibitory potency and the ring size. In 2001 it was postulated that a substitution α to nitrogen and making of 3-methyl-substituted analog of A58365A, a <b>pyridone</b> acid isolated from the fermentation broth of the bacterium Streptomyces chromofuscus with ACE inhibitory activity, might influence the level of biological activity by steric or hydrophobic effect, and/or by preventing reactions at C3.

40|$|Over 50 % of all {{colorants}} {{which are}} used nowdays are azo dyes and pigments, and among them arylazo <b>pyridone</b> dyes (and pigments) have became of interest in last several decades due to the high molar extinction coefficient, and the medium to high light and wet fastness properties. They find application generally as disperse dyes. The importance of disperse dyes increased in the 1970 s and 1980 s due {{to the use of}} polyester and nylon as the main synthetic fibers. Also, disperse dyes were used rapidly since 1970 in inks for the heat-transfer printing of polyester. The main synthetic route for the preparation of azo dyes is coupling reaction between an aromatic diazo compound and a coupling component. Of all dyes manufactured, about 60 % are produced by this reaction. Arylazo <b>pyridone</b> dyes can be prepared from <b>pyridone</b> moiety as a coupling component, where substituent can be on nitrogen, and diazonim salts which can be derived from different substituted anilines or other heterocyclic derivatives. In addition, arylazo dyes containing <b>pyridone</b> ring can be prepared from arylazo diketones or arylazo ketoesters (obtained by coupling β-diketones or β-ketoesters with diazonim salts) by condensation with cyanoacetamide.

40|$|In {{the last}} three or four decades {{disperse}} dyes derived from pyridones (in particular azo <b>pyridone</b> dyes) have gained in importance, and are widely used in various fields. These compounds have excellent coloration properties, and are suitable for the dyeing of polyester fabrics. Basic features of these dyes are simplicity of their synthesis by diazotation and azo coupling. They generally have high molar extinction coefficient with medium to high light and wet fastness. The absorption maxima of these dyes show their visible absorption wavelength ranging from yellow to orange, which can be attributed to poorly delocalized electrons in the <b>pyridone</b> ring. However, there are several dyes with deep colors such as red or violet. <b>Pyridone</b> dyes with alkyl and aryl groups in ortho position to azo group show 2 -pyridone/ 2 -hydroxypyridine tautomerism, while those containing OH and NHR groups conjugated with the azo group show azo-hydrazone tautomerism. Determining azo-hydrazone tautomerism could be therefore interesting, since the tautomers have different physico-chemical properties and most importantly different coloration. The literature on azo-hydrazone tautomerism, determination of equilibrium position, and investigation of substituent and solvent influence on tautomerism has been summarized in the presented review. The general conclusion is that the equilibrium between two tautomers is influenced by the structure of the compounds and by the solvents used.
