40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} top-down control during memory retrieval from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal cortex. In the present functional MRI study, we investigated whether the fronto-temporal functional interaction occurs even during fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> memory retrieval trials. During recency judgments, subjects judged the temporal order of two items {{in a study}} list. The task {{used in the present}} study consisted of memory trials of recency judgments and non-memory trials of counting dots, and post-trial fixation periods. By comparing the brain activity during the fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> the memory trials with that during the fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> the non-memory trials, we detected heightened brain activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, the lateral temporal cortex and the hippocampus. Functional interactions during the fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> the memory vs. non-memory trials as examined using a psychophysiological interaction revealed a decreased interaction from the lateral prefrontal cortex to the lateral temporal cortex, but not to the hippocampus. The functional interaction between the same frontal and temporal regions was also present during the memory trials. A trial-based functional connectivity analysis further revealed that the fronto-temporal interaction was positive and decreased during the fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> the memory trials, relative to the fixation <b>periods</b> <b>after</b> the non-memory trials. These results suggest that the fronto-temporal interaction existed during the post-trial fixation periods, which had been present during the memory trial...|$|R

5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted <b>period,</b> <b>after</b> which no remedy will be available.

5|$|Schneider {{made his}} NHL playoff debut in Game 4 {{of the opening}} round against the Chicago Blackhawks. With the Canucks down 6–1, Luongo was pulled in favour of Schneider in the third period. Schneider allowed one goal on seven shots, as the Blackhawks {{went on to win}} the game 7–2.

Schneider allowed three goals on 20 shots; he left the game in the third <b>period</b> <b>after</b> {{suffering}} cramps during a failed attempt to stop a penalty shot from Michael Frolik.

Schneider allowed two goals in relief for the remainder of the game as the Canucks went on to lose the contest. With Schneider on the bench, Vancouver then lost Game 7 at home.|$|E
