60|$|It {{might well}} be that this gang of ruffians,--for it was {{manifest}} {{that there had been}} such a gang,--finding the envelope addressed by the man to his wife, had fraudulently,--and as foolishly as fraudulently,-- endeavoured to bolster up their case by the postage-stamp and the postmark. Looking back at all the facts, remembering that fatal twenty thousand pounds, remembering that though the postmarks were forged on that envelope the writing was true, remembering the acknowledged promise and the combined testimony of the four persons,--he was inclined to think that something of the kind had been done in this case. If it were so, though he would fain see the perpetrators of that fraud on their trial for perjury, their fraud in no way diminished Caldigate's guilt. That a guilty man should escape {{out of the hands of}} justice by any fraud was wormwood to Judge Bramber. Caldigate was guilty. The jury had found him so. Could he take upon himself to say that the finding of the jury was wrong because the <b>prosecuting</b> <b>party</b> had concocted a fraud which had not been found out before the verdict was given? Sir John Joram, whom he had known almost as a boy, had 'demanded' the release of his client. The word stuck in Judge Bramber's throat. The word had been injudicious The more he thought of the word the more he thought that the verdict had been a true verdict, in spite of the fraud. A very honest man was Judge Bramber;--but human.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} {{the constitutionality of}} indiscriminately restraining civil immigration detainees during removal proceedings. Not only are immigration detainees routinely placed in handcuffs, leg irons, and belly chains without any individualized determination {{of the need for}} restraints, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the <b>prosecuting</b> <b>party,</b> makes the decisions about the use of restraints, rather than the judge. After examining the rationale for the well-established prohibition against the indiscriminate use of restraints during criminal and civil jury trials, and discussing how some courts have extended this rationale to bench trials, this Article contends that ICE’s practice violates substantive and procedural due process, as well as the regulations governing the authority of immigration judges and ICE’s own standards on restraints. The Article then provides empirical support for the arguments that restraints have profound cognitive and behavioral effects on both the restrained individual and the judge, drawing on studies of embodied cognition and implicit bias. These studies undermine the assumption that judges are immune to prejudice and emphasize how restraints interfere with a litigant’s right to participate fully in the proceedings, which supports more widespread application of the prohibition against indiscriminate restraints to hearings before a judge...|$|E

60|$|Your Committee, in {{a former}} Report, have stated the {{consequences}} which they apprehended from the dependency of the judges on the Governor-General and Council of Bengal; and the House has entered into their ideas upon this subject. Since that time it appears that Sir Elijah Impey has accepted of the guardianship of Mr. Barwell's children, and was the trustee for his affairs. There is no law to prevent this sort of connection, {{and it is possible}} that it might not at all affect the mind of that judge, or (upon his account) indirectly influence the conduct of his brethren; but it must forcibly affect the minds of those who have matter of complaint against government, and whose cause the Court of Directors appear to espouse, {{in a country where the}} authority of the Court of Directors has seldom been exerted but to be despised, where the operation of laws is but very imperfectly understood, but where men are acute, sagacious, and even suspicious of the effect of all personal connections. Their suspicions, though perhaps not rightly applied to every individual, will induce them to take indications from the situations and connections of the <b>prosecuting</b> <b>parties,</b> as well as of the judges. It cannot fail to be observed, that Mr. Naylor, the Company's attorney, lived in Mr. Barwell's house; the late Mr. Bogle, the Company's commissioner of lawsuits, owed his place to the patronage of Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, by whom the office was created for him; and Sir John Day, the Company's advocate, who arrived in Bengal in February, 1779, had not been four months in Calcutta, when Mr. Hastings, Mr. Barwell, and Sir Eyre Coote doubled his salary, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Francis and Mr. Wheler.|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} seeing more {{maritime}} disasters every year, {{in a variety}} of jurisdictions around the world. Many of these disasters cause a large number of deaths. As a result of those deaths, there is often pressure on the relevant authorities to <b>prosecute</b> the <b>parties</b> responsible. The master of the vessel may be the most obvious party to charge, but there may have been other parties responsible for the operation and management of the vessel whose negligent or reckless conduct contributed to the vessel’s demise. Despite the contributions of other parties, the master of a vessel may become a scapegoat, and, as a result, bear the brunt of any prosecution. There are several reasons why the master may receive the most blame in these situations. One of those may be that the law in force within the relevant jurisdiction does not provide particular criminal charges that apply to parties other than the master. This paper asks whether Australian law encourages prosecuting bodies to scapegoat the master of a vessel and whether this is demonstrative of the wider problem of seafarer criminalisation worldwide. Criminal law will be fit for its intended purpose if it provides prosecuting authorities with the means to prosecute those truly responsible for damage caused, and to <b>prosecute</b> those <b>parties</b> in an appropriate manner. In 2012, the Australian government spearheaded sweeping changes to domestic maritime law. Those changes brought several new criminal charges relevant to maritime disasters causing death, and amended previous charges. This paper looks to the law in Australia applicable to maritime disasters causing death and asks whether the laws are fit for their intended purpose. The research conducted is doctrinal, focussing particularly on the Navigation Act 2012 (Cth), the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 (Cth), and the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 (Cth) ...|$|R

Lacking the mandate to <b>prosecute</b> guilty <b>parties</b> or implement recommendations, truth commissions can still lay the foundation for a new era of civil-military relations.

40|$|When Italian law {{enforcement}} investigates illegal environmental dumping, data {{must be carefully}} compiled, analyzed, and validated in order to successfully <b>prosecute</b> the <b>parties</b> responsible.

There are a number of investigation tasks that can be carried out at both the place the waste was dumped ('on-site') and in the office/lab to catch and deal with offenders.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the traditional sociological question, how the legal system is related to the society, the aim {{of this study is to}} treat the legal system as a conflict resolver. More specifically, the following questions will be treated: 1. Which categories of people and which categories of organizations are as parties using the court for settling conflicts and in what types of conflicts do they act in this way? 2. Howdoes the legal utilization vary over time? May socio-economical, demographical, and legal conditions explain these variations?This study only deals with conflict resolution in courts of first instance, so called district courts. One aim has been to get a general view over to what extent Swedish courts are utilized as conflict resolvers, and how this utilization varies over time. The discussion is mainly based upon official statistics. To complete this discussion, an empirical study has been realized. This study is comparative. The conflict solving activities between 1940 and 1969 has been examined in the town courts of Umeå and Luleå. The data basis consists of official statistics and collected informations from cases finally dealt with in the two courts. A stratified random sample out of these cases has been made. As a result of theoretical and methodological considerations the sample consists of only certain types of disputes and crimes. As a general conclusion, one can state that disputes before the courts nowadays as earlier are concerning socially and economically strong persons. However one must notify that this study is just a case study with its limitations. Concerning criminal cases, expected results from the study are that the proportion of workers among the prosecuted is bigger than the proportion of prosecuted business leaders. Interesting however, is that the unskilled are well represented in the data material. This means a different picture compared to the distribution of plaintiffs in civil cases. The changes in character of the conflict constellations occured in the two towns at the same time as summary legal processes were introduced in criminal cases at the end of the 1940 's. A bigger proportion of workers as <b>prosecuted</b> <b>party</b> is observed after that processual simplification. Pro-cessual simplifications of that kind seem to strengthen rather than to weaken the occupational bias among the prosecuted persons, at least in crime cases with an injured person involved. Concerning criminal cases, we have finally assumpted that during phases of social and economical stagnation both the number of prosecuted workers and the number of theft and drunkeness cases increases in the type of industrialized community that Luleå belongs to. In more socially and economically differentiated communities, like Umeå, the same type of development is more linked to phases of economical expansion. While increases in the pressure of temptation are widening the economical conditions for people, this may be the reasonable explanation to the variations in the conflict resolving activities in the courts between different local communities. Explanations, close to those used to explain criminal activity caused by poverty, may refer to local communities dominated by industry. digitalisering@um...|$|R
