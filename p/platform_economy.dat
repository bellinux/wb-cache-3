It has also been argued that, as the spread of platform cooperativism “will require a different kind of ecosystem -- with appropriate forms of finance, law, policy, and culture -- to support the development of democratic online enterprises,” any person or business associated with the development of this ecosystem can be considered a proponent of platform cooperativism.|$|E

It provides strong evidence that workers in the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> are organising into new employee associations (unions) and are also being brought into existing employees associations. None of the evidence surveyed indicates that platforms are organising into employer associations or being incorporated into existing employer associations.

The authors conclude that i) no overarching framework exists for governing or facilitating social dialogue between the parties involved in the <b>platform</b> <b>economy,</b> and ii) even if the existing framework is applied to parties in the <b>platform</b> <b>economy,</b> it offers a poor fit due to differences between platform workers and employees, and platforms and employers...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} hype around platforms, {{our understanding of}} what the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> means and what drivers will define future development trajectories is limited. Companies and policy makers have a great need to investigate what potential opportunities will arise from the <b>platform</b> <b>economy.</b> A shared perception of uncertainties and a strong vision are prerequisites {{for the development of the}} <b>platform</b> <b>economy.</b> In this article, we describe a systematic way to develop a resilient vision for a new platform ecosystem, both from the viewpoint of national policy makers and corporate strategy makers in the heavy engineering industry. The process uses morphological analysis for scenario development and robust portfolio modelling for creating resilient strategies. The results include a list of key uncertainties, three general scenarios (sustainable development by Europe; polarization driven by China and the United States; US-driven fast, unreliable growth) as well as steel-industry specific scenarios based on these uncertainties, elements of a resilient vision, and strategies for coping with the uncertainties described by the scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> in Europe has sparked debate on the challenges it raises for workers, companies, social partners, governments and other stakeholders, and how these challenges can be addressed. This paper assesses government responses to the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> in seven EU countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Spain. It shows that, owing {{to the lack of}} a specific framework governing the <b>platform</b> <b>economy,</b> countries generally attempt to apply existing legislation, regulations and policies to the new challenges that the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> brings. This holds for the status of workers, working conditions, and industrial relations and social dialogue. Nevertheless, this strategy is not necessarily successful. The status of platform workers, for example, remains unclear in most member states. Some member states consider all platform workers to be self-employed, while in other member states, their status is much more dependent on the specific circumstances. There seems to be little debate on the idea of introducing a new status in the countries studied. On working conditions, the results confirm that most countries have applied the existing framework to platform work. In many of the member states, this {{has turned out to be}} problematic in several dimensions (e. g. taxation and social protection). In the area of industrial relations and social dialogue, there is much less evidence of specific actions or initiatives...|$|E

Second, the proposed economic indices could be further investigated through cross-validation with additional data sources. For example, map queries for hospitals, which can be viewed as an important indicator for disease monitoring, could be verified by using data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

40|$|This essay {{looks at}} the role of online {{platforms}} as rule-makers. The disruption of the <b>Platform</b> <b>Economy</b> has come {{hand in hand with}} a broader transformation: the emergence of a post-regulatory society, which feels more and more comfortable with transacting outside conventional legal and regulatory frameworks. This has raised the question as to how to regulate these platforms, if at all. This short piece focuses on how platform businesses are developing their own governance frameworks based on self-regulation, trust, and reputation, which create incentives for online traders to comply with the platforms' terms and conditions. Due to reputational enforcement and network effects, platforms act as powerful gatekeepers of online markets, displaying features of governance through contract. By recommending the use of contract governance as an analytical framework, this essay proposes a research agenda to examine {{the extent to which these}} emerging governance frameworks act as a competing alternative to existing forms of State-provided market regulation...|$|E

40|$|The paper explores how {{new digital}} {{business}} {{models of the}} sharing economy are challenging the nature of employment. This discussion is set {{within the context of}} the tourist accommodation sector, specifically examining the case of Airbnb. Arguably, a significant change in working practices is occurring because of the rise of the so-called sharing economy. We present the debate on whether this is representative of "sharing" in such an economy, and argue that in the case of Airbnb the term "platform economy" is a more valid description of the phenomenon. We postulate that the way in which Airbnb specifically challenges traditional employment relationships is through three processes that have existed prior to the rise of the <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> business models: free or minimally payed digital labour and related redefinitions of work; consumers' commentaries as the main elements of managerial attempts at controlling the quality of service work; and social media use and accompanying commodification having an increasing role in blurring of life and work boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The <b>platform</b> <b>economy</b> is disrupting {{innovation}} while presenting both {{opportunities and}} challenges for startups.

The study {{is based on an}} analysis of 29 cases of platform startups interviewed at a leading European startup event. The studied startups were envisioning even millions of users and hundreds or thousands of producers co-creating value on their platforms. In such platform businesses, our results highlight the importance of attracting a large user pool, providing novel services to those users, offering a new market for producers, supporting the core interaction in various ways, and utilizing elements of the platform canvas – an adaptation of the business model canvas, which we have accommodated for platform-based business models – to accomplish these goals...|$|E
