It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E

The demand for the yen is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in investing in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets).|$|E

25|$|The {{preceding}} {{months before}} the GST became active saw a spike in consumption as consumers rushed to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> that they perceived would be substantially more expensive with the GST. Once the tax came into effect, consumer consumption and economic growth declined such that by the first fiscal quarter of 2001, the Australian economy recorded negative economic growth {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Consumption soon returned to normal however. The Government was criticised by small business owners over the increased administrative responsibilities of submitting Business Activity Statements (BAS) on a quarterly basis to the Australian Taxation Office.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to credit}} cards, each {{merchant}} had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending credit. That task is now {{performed by the}} banks which assume the credit risk. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer {{does not have enough}} cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated {{by the fact that the}} customer can <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.|$|E
25|$|Collectivist anarchism advocates the {{abolition}} of {{both the state and}} private ownership of the means of production. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> in a communal market.|$|E

25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods,</b> such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E
25|$|The tenants {{would be}} free from all {{taxation}} for 10 years, but during this period {{they would not be}} allowed to change from one estate to another nor to move from the country to the town. At least one quarter of the 50 inhabitants would have to be settled within the first year of the land grant, with the rest being settled within three years following that. The patroons would have full liberty to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> in New Netherland, New England, and New France, with the exception of furs. But the trader would have to pay an export tax of five per cent in New Amsterdam before goods could be shipped to Europe. The fur trade remained a monopoly of the Company, being the most profitable investment at the time. The weaving of cloth was also prohibited in order to supply the looms in Holland with their needed raw supplies.|$|E
25|$|Retail {{sales in}} China changed {{dramatically}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s as economic reforms increased the supply of food items and consumer goods, allowed state retail stores the freedom to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> on their own, and permitted individuals and collectives greater freedom to engage in retail, service, and catering trades in rural and urban areas. Retail sales increased 300 percent from 1977 to 1985, rising at an average yearly rate of 13.9 percent — 10.5 percent when adjusted for inflation. In the 1980s retail sales to rural areas increased {{at an annual rate}} of 15.6 percent, outpacing the 9.7 percent increase in retail sales to urban areas and reflecting the more rapid rise in rural incomes. In 1977 sales to rural areas comprised 52 percent of total retail sales; in 1984 rural sales accounted for 59.2 percent of the total. Consumer goods comprised approximately 88 percent of retail sales in 1985, the remaining 12 percent consisting of farming materials and equipment.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of factions in the game, those are 'Reputation Factions' and 'Crafting Guilds'. Reputation Factions are factions that {{generally}} only inhabit a specific region of the game, such as the Men of Bree who are present in Bree-land; each have a main location where the player can <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> and services from the faction's vendors, some of which are only accessible at higher reputation levels. Some factions also possess a vendor where the player can barter faction-specific items awarded from quests or instances for unique items such as armour or weaponry. The ability to gain reputation with Reputation Factions is open to all players who have purchased the content for the region these factions are present in. Crafting Guild factions however, are available only to players who belong to a specific crafting vocation, and a player can only gain reputation with any one of the several Crafting Guild factions at any one time. Crafting Guild factions also have locations that the player can visit to barter for guild-unique goods, including valuable crafting recipes for specific professions.|$|E
25|$|At first, mints {{were set}} up in Luoyang in Henan, and also in Peking, Chengdu, Bingzhou (Taiyuan in Shanxi), and then Guilin in Guangxi. Minting rights were also granted to some princes and officials. By 660, {{deterioration}} of the coinage due to forgery had become a problem. The regulations were reaffirmed in 718, and forgeries suppressed. In 737, the first commissioner with overall responsibility for casting was appointed. In 739, ten mints were recorded, {{with a total of}} 89 furnaces casting some 327,000 strings of cash a year. 123 liang of metal were needed to produce a string of coins weighing 100 liang. In the late 740s, skilled artisans were employed for casting, rather than conscripted peasants. Despite these measures, the coinage continued to deteriorate. In 808, a ban on hoarding coins was proclaimed. This was repeated in 817. Regardless of the rank of a person, they could not hold more than 5,000 strings of cash. Cash balances exceeding this amount had to be expended within two months to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods.</b> This was an attempt to compensate for the lack of cash in circulation. By 834, mint output had fallen to 100,000 strings a year, mainly due to the shortage of copper. Forgeries using lead and tin alloys were produced.|$|E

500|$|Improvements to the {{automobile}} and highways, which {{coincided with the}} end of the gas boom, may have also contributed to the decline of the county's smaller communities. [...] The automobile changed [...] "business and shopping patterns at the expense of the small-town merchant." [...] Small town residents began to drive to larger communities to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods,</b> because of the wider selection. [...] The improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads (and interurban lines), causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails. [...] Small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic. In Blackford County, passenger service on the Lake Erie and Western Railroad line (owned by the Nickel Plate Road by that time) was discontinued in 1931, and the last interurban train ran on January18, 1941.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{developed}} in 1997, the EZpay system was born {{as a pilot}} project aimed at inductees going into basic training, to alleviate some of the stress and cost of managing money while away from home. Many U.S. military bases are structured like small towns, where goods and services are available for sale. However, transferring wages into cash, in order to purchase desired products has traditionally been a struggle. [...] The system works through soldiers receiving an advance on their wages {{in the form of}} the EZPay card, which they can then use to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> and services, such as haircuts, snacks, and recreational activities at on-base shops and stores. [...] At the end of basic training, the balance on the card would be reconverted into cash, and paid back to the soldiers. [...] The project was a great success, since it eliminated the need for bases to keep money on hand, and saved soldiers approximately $125,000 a year in banking fees.|$|E
500|$|Eagle Cash (stylized as EagleCash), {{and sister}} program EZpay, are cash {{management}} applications that use stored-value card technology to process financial transactions in [...] "closed-loop" [...] operating environments. The programs are {{sponsored by the}} United States Department of the Treasury for the U.S. Armed Forces. The programs are administered for the Treasury by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and are in use at approved U.S. military facilities {{inside and outside the}} continental United States. [...] The systems utilize a plastic payment card, similar to a credit or debit card, which has an embedded microchip which keeps track of the amount of money stored on the card and interfaces with encrypted card acceptance devices. [...] This allows soldiers with the card to <b>purchase</b> <b>goods</b> and services at U.S. military posts and canteens, without carrying cash, or manage their personal bank accounts while on deployment or in training. [...] The program reduces the amount of American currency required overseas, reduces theft, saves thousands of man-hours in labor, helps reduce the risk of transporting cash in battlefield environments, and increases security and convenience for service members. It helped reduce or eliminate the need for cash and money orders.|$|E
