5|$|A western rock lobster fishery {{developed}} {{on the island}} in the early 20th century. There are records of the island {{being used as a}} base for crayfishers as early as 1902, and for many years it was used as an anchorage by anglers. It was not until 1947, however, that a seasonally inhabited permanent camp was established there. According to former crayfisher Ron Bertelsen, the first camp was established by skippers George Barker and George Nelson and deckhand John Long, who relocated there when lobsters around Pigeon Island grew scarce. They camped {{at the southern end of}} North Island in a camp initially built from <b>packing</b> <b>case</b> timbers. A local carrier boat, the Betty Margaret, serviced the camp. From about 40 seasonal inhabitants in 1940, the population grew to about 130 by 2003. An airstrip was built in 1979.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a {{permanent}} exhibition was opened dedicated to the imperial family. Certain elements of the Reception Room, Nicholas II's New Study and Alexandra Feodorovna's Drawing Room were recreated to provide a backdrop for exhibitions of historical costumes, weapons and objects of applied art. A portrait of Alexandra Feodorovna by Friedrich von Kaulbach was returned to its original position. Clothing worn by the last imperial family and uniforms related {{to the court of}} Tsar Nicholas II was also placed on display. Much of this clothing only survived because it had been used as <b>packing</b> <b>case</b> wadding for more precious objects when the palace was evacuated in World War II.|$|E
50|$|The sawmill is {{uncommon}} {{in the region}} as an intact example of a small saw mill originally established to produce timber for fruit <b>packing</b> <b>cases.</b> Mills of this type were common in the fruit growing areas of the State until the late 1950s when the use of wooden <b>packing</b> <b>cases</b> declined.|$|R

50|$|The 28 and 32 cm rockets {{could also}} be fired from their <b>packing</b> <b>cases</b> (Packkiste) which had short hinged legs to adjust elevation. They {{could also be}} mounted in groups of four on wooden (schwere Wurfgerät 40 - heavy missile device) or tubular metal (schwere Wurfgerät 41 (sWG 41)) launch frames. The {{external}} dimensions of the <b>packing</b> <b>cases</b> were identical so no adapter was needed for the smaller rockets. The <b>packing</b> <b>cases</b> could also be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 (sWuR 40) frames attached {{to the sides of}} Sd.Kfz. 251/1 half-track armored personnel carrier or various captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the Stuka-zu-Fuß (Stuka on foot).|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} erected at {{the place}} of the old Shrine of Our Lady of Europe remained property of the British Ministry of Defence until 1961. It had been an army storehouse for oil and <b>packing</b> <b>case.</b> Since 1928 it had been used as a library for the garrison, but with the outbreak of World War II, it was returned to a storage facility. By 1959, the military authorities, which had begun to withdraw many military installations in Gibraltar, noticed that it was no longer required and decided to demolish it. However, this never happened and due to the efforts of Bishop John Healy it was ceded to the Catholic diocese on 17 October 1961, in a private ceremony. Restoration works began in 1962. For the first time in 258 years, a mass was celebrated at the Shrine on 28 September 1962. The statue was finally transferred to the Shrine in public procession from St. Joseph's Parish Church on 7 October 1967. The statue of Our Lady remains in the Shrine to this day.|$|E

50|$|As a sawmill {{originally}} {{established to}} produce timber for fruit <b>packing</b> <b>cases,</b> {{it is also}} important in demonstrating the evolution of the State's fruit growing industry. At the time, the North Coast was among the most productive fruit growing regions in the State. It is also indicative of the former use of timber as a material for <b>packing</b> <b>cases.</b> By the 1950s, timber was being superseded by corrugated fibre board as the preferred material for packaging.|$|R

60|$|It {{might have}} been the amount of the sum stated, or the tone in which it was stated--we know not--but the truth of what Sam said was borne so {{forcibly}} in upon the manager, that he went into a violent passion; sprang at Sam's throat; hustled him towards a back door, and kicked him out into a back lane, where he sat down on an empty <b>packing</b> <b>case,</b> covered his face with his hands, bowed his head on his knees, and wept.|$|E
60|$|When he had got safe {{into the}} drawing-room, {{and shut the}} door behind him, he was aware of a respite from alarms. The room was quite dismantled, uncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing cases and incongruous furniture; several great pier-glasses, in which he beheld himself at various angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures, framed and unframed, standing, with their faces to the wall; a fine Sheraton sideboard, a cabinet of marquetry, and a great old bed, with {{tapestry}} hangings. The windows opened to the floor; but by great good fortune {{the lower part of the}} shutters had been closed, and this concealed him from the neighbours. Here, then, Markheim drew in a <b>packing</b> <b>case</b> before the cabinet, and began to search among the keys. It was a long business, for there were many; and it was irksome, besides; for, after all, there might be nothing in the cabinet, and time was on the wing. But the closeness of the occupation sobered him. With the tail of his eye he saw the door--even glanced at it from time to time directly, like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate of his defences. But in truth he was at peace. The rain falling in the street sounded natural and pleasant. Presently, on the other side, the notes of a piano were wakened to the music of a hymn, and the voices of many children took up the air and words. How stately, how comfortable was the melody! How fresh the youthful voices! Markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he sorted out the keys; and his mind was thronged with answerable ideas and images; church-going children and the pealing of the high organ; children afield, bathers by the brookside, ramblers on the brambly common, kite- flyers in the windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another cadence of the hymn, back again to church, and the somnolence of summer Sundays, and the high genteel voice of the parson (which he smiled a little to recall) and the painted Jacobean tombs, and the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments in the chancel.|$|E
