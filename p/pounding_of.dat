5|$|For {{their final}} home {{game of the}} season, Michigan hosted the Wisconsin Badgers. Michigan looked to extend its two-game win streak, but faced a tough challenge, as Wisconsin was ranked 6th in the AP Poll and was fresh off of an 83–20 <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> Indiana. During the {{previous}} meeting between the two schools, Wisconsin won by a score of 45–24, with Scott Tolzien throwing 5 touchdown passes during the game.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not a war of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

25|$|The 1985 {{season was}} very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws {{struggling}} after a quick start. The team jumped out to a 4-2 start, including a 31-13 <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did not get enough help to make the playoffs, and finished 8-10.|$|E
25|$|Also on 28 November, the Pakistan Army {{had cleared}} Imam Dehri, the {{headquarters}} of Maulana Fazlullah's seminary, and police resumed their normal duty in Alpuri, the district headquarters of Shangla. Around 50 militants were killed in four days of fighting. The militants vacated Matta, Khwazakhela and Madyan police stations and fled to nearby forests. They also left the Charbagh police post in Khwazakhela, their stronghold about 27km from Mingora. Police and troops were yet to enter the areas, as <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> suspected militant positions continued and specialists were called in to sweep the area for mines and booby traps.|$|E
25|$|Appalachian State {{opened the}} 2015 {{season with a}} 49-0 <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> Howard before losing to Clemson.

The team rallied, finished the regular season 10-2 and received a bid {{to play in the}} Camellia Bowl against an 8-4 Ohio. The Mountaineers overcame their opposition 31-29 becoming the first team in Sun Belt history to win eleven games in one season. This win was also historic as it marked the first time a former FCS team won a bowl game in their first season of bowl eligibility.|$|E

25|$|Sailing from Argentia 14 January 1942, Jones joined Convoy HX 169, {{which was}} headed for Iceland. The convoy {{encountered}} a violent storm; heavy seas and winds of force 9 scattered its ships' convoy. Separated from the convoy, Jones steamed independently for Hvalfjörður, Iceland. Though hampered by a shortage of fuel, an inoperable gyro compass, an erratic magnetic compass, and the continuous <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> the storm, Jones arrived on the 19th. Five days later, she escorted three merchant ships to Argentia. Once again heavy seas and fierce winds separated the ships, and Jones continued toward Argentia with one Norwegian merchantman. She detected and attacked another submarine 2 February 1942, but her depth charges yielded no visible results.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 the {{sailing ship}} Dunbar {{carrying}} 63 passengers and 59 crew struck the rocky cliff {{at the foot}} of The Gap. The Dunbar, which was captained by James Green, had left England on 31 May 1857 arriving off Botany Bay shortly after dark on 20 August 1857. In poor visibility and stormy weather, Captain Green misjudged the entrance to the harbour. The Dunbar drove into the rocky cliff {{at the foot of}} The Gap causing the ship's topmasts to snap and the ship to turn broadside against the rocks because of the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> the waves. By light next day, crowds watched as breakers pounded victims' corpses against the rocks. Other bodies amid cargo and wreckage were washed inside Sydney harbour with the incoming tide; many of the dead were naked and had been mutilated by sharks. The funeral of the Dunbar victims was one of the longest processions ever seen in Sydney. The unidentified dead were buried in a common grave at Camperdown cemetery.|$|E
25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|E

25|$|The {{mission of}} the fast carrier forces had by this time evolved into sealing off {{designated}} enemy-held atolls and islands which the Allies intended to take and interdicting others to isolate and keep to a minimum Japanese resistance at the target. Now a third mission was to be added, the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> major enemy bases {{without the aid of}} land-based aircraft, leaving little or no need for a return visit. Thus, to ease the occupation of Eniwetok and to aid in the encirclement of Rabaul, TF 58 departed Majuro and sailed for the Carolines. On 16–17 February, they devastated Truk, the best fleet anchorage in the Mandated Territories, the base of the Japanese combined fleet and the center for air and sea communications between Japan and the Bismarck Archipelago. The force then sailed northwest to the Mariana Islands for strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, encountering heavy aerial resistance there on 21–22 February. After a brief respite for replenishment at Majuro, Mobile sailed to Espiritu Santo, where the ships of TG 58.1 were reorganized as TG 36.1 on 12 March. On 15 March, they steamed northwest to cover Marine forces as they landed on Emirau on 20 March.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the <b>pounding</b> <b>of</b> World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E

50|$|To {{exacerbate}} the situation, the region experienced a drought {{during the summer}} of 1864. Sims' efforts to purchase wheat for the army met with little success.

2500|$|Food {{often took}} the form of {{crackers}} or hardtack; Southerners sometimes chose cornmeal or pinole rather than wheat flour.
