It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|R

We emphasise the advantages of the first method. Utilising a cross-country microsimulation model for Europe, EUROMOD, we generate the distribution of replacement rates for four European countries, Denmark, France, Spain and the UK. In particular we show the important role of household composition and the presence of other household members' incomes in preserving the standard of living while out of work. We argue that, given this strong influence of <b>primary</b> <b>incomes,</b> replacement rates are not necessarily the best indicator {{of the impact of the}} taxbenefit system in this respect. To isolate the effects of the tax-benefit system on both work incentives and the degree of social protection for the out-of-work population, we therefore introduce a new measure, the “tax-benefit-to-earnings ratio”.

40|$|Inequality {{with respect}} to {{personal}} earned income has increased in recent years. This trend has gone {{hand in hand with}} changes in both the employment constellations of households and the labor market activity of individuals (e. g. through 'minijobs'). In particular, the years since 2000 have seen a rise in the share of households with no market income because their members are either registered or hidden unemployed. These findings do not necessarily indicate an increase in relative poverty, because the latter depends on net household income and not just on individual <b>primary</b> <b>incomes.</b> While the risk of poverty also increased in recent years amongst low-wage earners, the rise only applied to those 47 % of low-wage earners who live in households without another gainfully employed household member. More than half of all low-wage earners live in households that have a below-average risk of poverty. Unemployment still represents the principal risk factor for poverty. Whereas the likelihood of being poor in the event of unemployment was 29 % in 1993, this risk had increased by ten percentage points by 2003. For an unemployed person living alone or whose spouse or partner was not working, the risk of poverty in 2003 was a substantial risk of 53 %. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on distributional effects of recent fiscal consolidation policies, mainly through the channel of in-kind public transfers. We look at the distribution of income in 16 EU countries during the recent global financial and economic crisis, and the subsequent period of fiscal consolidation. Experiences in terms of the depth of the recession and the policies implemented to deal with vary greatly across EU countries. We illustrate this diversity, and show how the crisis has accentuated the differences among EU countries, both in income levels and in inequality. The effects of the public sector on household income distribution have traditionally been measured through the effects of money transfers and taxes, but in developed economies in-kind transfers are of increasing importance. In our context, the analysis of in-kind transfers –mainly education and health– from a distributional perspective is of paramount importance, since fiscal consolidation programmes have led to a reduction in public expenditure in these services in many countries. We mainly use the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which allows us to track the distributional effects of public interventions in the economy, namely money transfer and taxes. For in-kind services we impute benefits at the individual level from the EUSILC database. Starting from aggregate figures, we make a number of adjustments and arrive at an extended household income. Finally, we measure the distribution in this extended income for all countries in the analysis, before and after the crisis. Our results point to the absence of relative inequality effects of fiscal consolidations in those countries where public sector cuts have been deeper. This fact is due to the emphasis on measuring inequality in relative terms, given that <b>primary</b> <b>incomes</b> have fallen by more than the cuts in public services provided to citizens...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} defined as the {{percentage}} output increase in an economy, e. g. a nation, a region or a municipality. The economic growth is closely related to the industrial structure, health, demography and income distribution of the economy. The most used measure for national economic growth is the change in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP measures the value added of all goods and services produced in the economy. The production of goods and services generates <b>primary</b> <b>incomes</b> for households and another method of measuring GDP is therefore to add up all incomes. One part of this income consists of the sum of all wages paid to households. When regional growth studies are conducted, a common measure of economic growth is the wage sum. One reason for this may be the limited access to GDP data on regional level. However, in Sweden there exists GDP data on municipal level, which enables studies where the effects of using GDP data or wage data can be compared. The aim of the present study is to investigate the difference the use of the measures GMP (Gross Municipal Growth) and the sum of wages has on growth models. Since the two measures are similar but not identical the choice of measure of growth can influence the conclusions of an investigation. This might lead to contradictory results on for instance how the access to university research influences the economical growth (Andersson, Gr 5 sj 6 & Karlsson 2007, 2008). Preliminary results indicate high positive correlations between changes in GMP and wage sum on municipal level. However, when data on GMP per capita and wage sum per capita are used, the correlations are still positive but much smaller. References Andersson M., Gr 5 sj 6 U. & Karlsson C.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to offer {{detailed}} information of fiscal redistribution in 36 countries, employing data that have been computed from the Luxembourg Income Study’s micro-level database. LIS data are detailed enough to allow us to measure both overall redistribution, and the partial effects of redistribution by several taxes or transfers. We elaborate on the work of Jesuit and Mahler (2004) and Mahler and Jesuit (2006), and we refine, update and extent their Fiscal Redistribution approach. LIS data allow us to decompose the trajectory of the Gini coefficient from primary to disposable income inequality in several parts: we will distinguish 11 different benefits and several income taxes and social contributions in our empirical investigation across countries. First, we use LIS data to analyze income inequality and the redistributive effect of social transfers across countries in a descriptive way. Then we proceed with a simulation approach for 36 countries for which we decompose income inequality through several taxes and transfers. We analyze the redistributive effect of several social programs, like unemployment benefits or pensions and income taxes. We develop a budget incidence simulation model to investigate to what extent several social transfers contribute to the overall redistribution in modern welfare states under a strong assumption that the absence of social transfers and taxes would not change individual behavior and labor supply. Among all countries listed in this paper, Denmark and Sweden have the smallest income disparity, while Peru and Colombia have the largest. Nordic countries show the most equally distributed disposable incomes and <b>primary</b> <b>incomes,</b> comparing to the countries in other types of welfare states. On average, large primary income disparity exists in Anglo-Saxon countries. Generally speaking, European countries achieve lower levels of income inequality than other countries. With respect to the redistributive effect, our budget incidence analysis indicates that the pattern is diverse across countries. The largest redistribution is found for Belgium, while Colombia and Peru show rather limited overall redistributive effects. On average, transfers reduce income inequality by over 85 percent, while taxes account for only 15 percent of total redistribution. Among all welfare states, Continental European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, and Luxembourg) achieve the highest level of the reduction of initial income inequality. As far as social programs is concerned, in most countries two dominant income components account for above 50 percent of total reduction in income inequality: the public old age pensions and the survivors scheme, and the income taxes. For example, in Southern European Countries the public old age benefits account for over 80 percent of total redistribution, while these figures are much lower for Anglo-Saxon Countries (20 - 34 %), for Nordic Countries (31 - 48 %), for Continental European Countries (47 - 57 %), and for Central Eastern European Countries (54 - 70 %). In Anglo-Saxon Countries income taxes play a major role (above 30 %) compare to other countries (with the exception the United kingdom). Also the redistributive effect of social assistance and child and family benefits in the Anglo-Saxon Countries are relatively high in a comparative setting (9 - 28 %). In Nordic Countries also a variety of other social programs contribute to the reduction of inequality, especially the disability scheme (9 - 15 %). Remarkably, across countries all other social benefit programs seem to have rather limited redistributive effects, although the unemployment compensation benefits do have some effect too. ...|$|E
