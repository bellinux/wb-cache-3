5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} massive blowing {{rates on the}} steady laminar {{compressible}} boundary-layer flow with variable gas properties at a 3 -dim. stagnation point (which includes both nodal and saddle <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment)</b> has been studied. The equations governing the flow have been solved numerically using an implicit finite-difference scheme {{in combination with the}} quasilinearization technique for nodal <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> but employing a parametric differentiation technique instead of quasilinearization for saddle <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> It is found that the effect of massive blowing rates is to move the viscous layer away from the surface. The effect of the variation of the density- viscosity product across the boundary layer is found to be negligible for massive blowing rates but significant for moderate blowing rates. The velocity profiles in the transverse direction for saddle <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in the presence of massive blowing show both the reverse flow as well as velocity overshoot...|$|R

25|$|Near {{the middle}} of the spleen lies a long fissure, the splenic hilum. The hilum is the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> for the gastrosplenic ligament, and the point of {{insertion}} for the splenic artery and splenic vein. There are other openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves.|$|E
25|$|Gulella systemanaturae is {{characterized}} by a medium-sized shell with little prominent costulation, seven to seven and three-quarter whorls and fourfold apertural dentition consisting of angular lamella, labral process, and outer and inner columellar processes; labrum sharply angulate at its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the body whorl near the angular lamella.|$|E
25|$|The gills radiate from an {{eccentric}} or lateral <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> medium broad, {{and tend to}} swell in the middle. The gill spacing is sub-distant, with many short gills (lamellulae) that do not reach the attachment point. The gills are initially white, then later tinged a rusty-brown color. The spore print is cinnamon-brown in color.|$|E

25|$|The cotyledons, {{the seed}} leaves, {{attached}} to the embryonic axis. There may be one (Monocotyledons), or two (Dicotyledons). The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic dicotyledons, in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and leathery. In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. Dicotyledons have the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> opposite one another on the axis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often {{can be the}} crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into {{symmetrical}} halves by the median sulcus. The foramen cecum {{marks the end of}} this division (at about 2.5cm from the root of the tongue) {{and the beginning of the}} terminal sulcus. The foramen cecum is also the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> of the thyroglossal duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic development.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{conductive}} channel bridges the air {{gap between the}} negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, {{there is a large}} drop in resistance across the lightning channel. Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which expands across the entire leader network {{at a fraction of the}} speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the true}} oysters (family Ostreidae), {{scallops}} {{have a single}} central adductor muscle, thus the inside of their shells has a characteristic central scar, marking the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> for this muscle. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than those of oysters, because scallops are active swimmers; some species of scallops are known to move en masse from one area to another. In scallops, the shell shape tends to be highly regular, and is commonly used as an archetypal form of a seashell.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{particularly}} characterized by its double columellar {{processes in the}} apertural dentition, a splendid discriminating character in shell morphology in this group. In addition, the labrum is sharply angulate at its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the body whorl near the angular lamella. This may be an overlooked character as {{this has not been}} checked or noticed in other taxa with similar types of shell until the type description of Gulella systemanaturae. Also, sometimes the labrum is very slightly concave where it joins the body whorl on the columellar side.|$|E

40|$|During the 2001 college {{football}} season more than 40 million individuals attended intercollegiate football games across the four divisions {{sponsored by the}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Although {{it would be easy}} to classify all of these individuals as either being spectators or fans, that would be in accurate. Trail, Robinson, Gillentine, and Dick (2003) developed a model based on the relationship between motives and <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> that classified attendees as either spectators or fans. The purpose of this study was to use the model to determine how individuals who attend {{college football}} games should be classified at the four NCAA divisions of college football. Data were collected from spectators at games at the the four different NCAA college football divisions. A MANOVA was performed on the motive factors and on the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> factors proposed by Trail et al., using the division level as the independent variable. Results indicated that there was some support for the Trail et al. model. In general. Division I attendees have motives and <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> that are consistent with what Trail et al. (2003) classified as a fan characteristics. Division III attendees have motives and <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> that are consistent with what Trail et al. (2003) classified as spectator Matthew J.

5000|$|In 1982, Jerry Saltzer in {{his work}} “On the Naming and Binding of network destinations” [...] {{described}} the entities and the relationships that make a complete naming and addressing schema in networks. According to Saltzer four are the elements {{that need to be}} identified: applications, nodes, <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the network (PoA) and paths. An application can run in one or more nodes and should be able to move from one node to another without losing its identity in the network. A node can be connected to a pair of PoAs and should be able to move between them without losing its identity in the network. A directory maps an application name to a node address, and routes are sequences of nodes addresses and <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachments.</b>|$|R
25|$|Line arrows {{are placed}} {{to help the}} divers to {{establish}} the direction they come from, when they later need to find the way out, but should not alter the general navigation information of the system, so line arrows are added only where they cannot cause other groups to become confused about the direction to the nearest air source. An arrow would be added at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> of a reel line when tying off to explore new areas, and may be removed after return and removal of the temporary line.

25|$|The {{shell is}} medium-sized, {{cylindriform}} to subcylindriform, greatest width {{at about the}} middle of the shell, glossy and transparent when fresh, with narrowly open umbilicus to more or less rimate. Spire produced, sides straight to very slightly convex and (sub)parallel, apex obtusely conical. Whorls seven to seven and three-quarters, very slightly convex, covered with fairly close, straight, oblique and little prominent costulae, interstices wider than (at most as wide as) costulae, smooth but with clear traces of spiral sculpture, apical whorls smooth with faint traces of spiral engraving; sutures fairly shallow to somewhat incised, crenellate. Labrum incrassate and reflected, sharply angulate at its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the body whorl near the angular lamella. The aperture is fairly large, roughly triangular in shape, little obstructed by fourfold dentition: a strong, almost perpendicular, inrunning angular lamella, (almost) free from apex of labrum; a more or less horizontal, triangular mid-labral process, protruding as far as angular lamella, corresponding to noticeable outside depression; a small, but noticeable superficial tubercle above or on {{the middle of the}} columella; a deeply situated, little prominent, almost vertical, inside columellar process.|$|E
500|$|Considerable {{anatomic}} variation exists, {{in terms}} of length and <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> Despite the classical description, the muscle only solely attaches to the duodenojejunal flexure in about 8% of people; {{it is far more}} common, 40 to 60% of the time to attach additionally to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum; and 20 to 30% [...] of the time it only attaches to the third and fourth parts.

500|$|Like other insects, ants have an exoskeleton, an {{external}} covering {{that provides a}} protective casing around the body and a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> for muscles, {{in contrast to the}} internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as carbon dioxide, pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube {{along the top of the}} body (called the [...] "dorsal aorta") that functions like a heart, and pumps haemolymph toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.|$|E
500|$|Baeospora myosura {{is similar}} in size and {{appearance}} to C.tuberosa, but grows on spruce and Douglas-fir cones. The [...] "Magnolia coincap" [...] (Strobilurus conigenoides) is smaller and grows on the cones of Magnolias. The two remaining Collybia species closely resemble C.tuberosa, but can be distinguished by examining the stem bases at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> into the substrate. C.cookei has roughly spherical, light brown to yellowish sclerotia, while C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. A microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. In contrast, C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{member of}} its genus, Entoloma sinuatum has an {{imposing}} epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), bearing a cap 6–15cm (2½–6in) wide, though diameters of 25cm (10in) have been recorded. It is convex to flat, {{often with a}} blunt umbo in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in colour, and darkening with age. The distant gills are sinuate (notched at their <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to the stipe) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe).
