25|$|At the trial, some 100 {{reporters were}} {{seated at the}} press tables. Hundreds more {{gathered}} on the courthouse lawn. National Guard members in plain clothes mingled in the crowd, looking {{for any sign of}} trouble. The Sheriff's department brought the defendants to Court in a <b>patrol</b> <b>wagon</b> guarded by two carloads of deputies armed with automatic shotguns.|$|E
500|$|When {{the first}} <b>patrol</b> <b>wagon</b> arrived, Inspector Pine {{recalled}} that the crowd—most {{of whom were}} homosexual—had grown to at least ten {{times the number of}} people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, [...] "Gay power!", someone began singing [...] "We Shall Overcome", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with [...] "growing and intensive hostility". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, [...] "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing." [...] Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.|$|E
50|$|During {{the days}} of the Cold War, the village abutted East Germany, and <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> would drive through the village at night. There was no open {{crossing}} in this part of Germany, so the village was almost devoid of traffic not ending or starting there.|$|R
50|$|This {{was built}} as Patrol 8, the patrol house for Cincinnati's Police District 8, which {{was near the}} bottom of the hill. Patrol 8 was on top of the hill, at McMillan and Ravine St., so the horses didn't have to haul the <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> up the steep hill.|$|R
500|$|The {{police were}} to {{transport}} the bar's alcohol in <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons.</b> Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> had not yet arrived, so patrons were required {{to wait in line}} for about 15minutes. Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: [...] "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 23:24:00–23:25:30 (ca) – A second police patrol, a <b>patrol</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{arrives at}} the crime scene.

The car was built by city mechanical engineer Frank Loomis. The US$2,400 vehicle was equipped with electric lights, gongs, and a stretcher. [...] The car's first assignment was to pick up a drunken man at the junction of Main and Exchange streets.|$|E

60|$|As if {{the whole}} affair had been premeditated and {{prearranged}} a <b>patrol</b> <b>wagon</b> at that instant backed to the curb {{and in spite of}} Arthur Weldon's loud protests he was thrust inside with his assailant and at once driven away at a rapid gait.|$|E
60|$|A police <b>patrol</b> <b>wagon</b> {{stood at}} the side door. Three able cops were half carrying, half hustling Riley and McQuirk up its rear steps.

Repainting, body-building and reupholstering were also done by the city garage force. The municipal garage and repair shops included a complete machine-shop, blacksmith-shop, paint-shop, and two garages which provided storage for cars belonging to the following city departments: Street, Health, Park, Playground, Harbor, Engineering, Auditors, Electrical, Building, and Public affairs.

5000|$|Cincinnati in the 1880s {{was a tough}} {{industrial}} city with a rising crime rate due, in part, to general dissatisfaction with labor conditions. The Cincinnati police force had 300 men and 5 <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons.</b> In this period they arrested 50 people for murder, but only four were hanged. By January 1, 1884, there were twenty-three accused murderers in the jail. The political system was corrupt, with leaders notorious for controlling elections and manipulating judges and juries. [...] In March 1884, the city was still reeling from a devastating flood the previous month when the river crested at 71.9 ft. A full-page article published in the Cincinnati Enquirer on March 9, 1884, said: [...] "Laxity of laws gives the Queen City of the West its crimson record.

60|$|Anything {{could happen}} now. Quite without surprise, {{she saw the}} strikers leaping the fence, {{trampling}} her few little geraniums and pansies into the earth as they fled between Mercedes' house and hers. Up Pine street, from the railroad yards, was coming a rush of railroad police and Pinkertons, firing as they ran. While down Pine street, gongs clanging, horses at a gallop, came three <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> packed with police. The strikers were in a trap. The only way out was between the houses and over the back yard fences. The jam in the narrow alley prevented them all from escaping. A dozen were cornered in the angle between {{the front of her}} house and the steps. And as they had done, so were they done by. No effort was made to arrest. They were clubbed down and shot down to the last man by the guardians of the peace who were infuriated by what had been wreaked on their brethren.|$|R

A formal charge was entered against the two criminals, and they were led away to separate cells. Then came several formalities before Dick and his brothers were allowed to take possession of the japanned box with its precious contents. The bonds were gone over with care, and it was ascertained that not one was missing.|$|E
50|$|The Stonewall riots were {{a series}} of violent demonstrations {{by members of the}} gay {{community}} against a police raid {{that took place in the}} early morning hours of June 28, 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich neighborhood of New York City. Around 1:20 a.m. on June 28, 1969, Seymour Pine of the New York City Vice Squad Public Morals Division and four other officers joined forces with two male and two female undercover police officers who were already stationed inside the bar, the lights on the dance floor flashed, signaling their arrival. However, the raid did not go as planned. Because the <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> responsible for transporting the arrested patrons and the alcohol from the bar took longer than expected, a crowd of released patrons and by-standers began to grow outside of the Inn. This number would swell to much larger numbers as the night would go on. Writer David Carter notes that the police officers eventually became so afraid of the crowd that they refused to leave the bar for forty-five minutes.|$|R
500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} pieces of apparatus were constructed in the municipal shop, these including fire apparatus, oil spreaders, and trucks. The department constructed a number of oil spreaders for spreading hot oil for use in new streets and also in repair work. The shops constructed a combination hose and chemical truck which was used {{in connection with the}} high pressure fire protection system. Steam engine fire trucks were motorized by installing front drive tractors, as well as several ladder trucks. At a cost of about $800 each, a number of Fords were equipped with Ralston truck attachment and specially designed four-yard dump bodies, which were employed in picking up the contents of the street sweepers' cans and hauling them to the dump. The machine shop has built a number of trucks for the sewer repair crews, using second hand Cadillac chassis and installing a small wagon bed {{in the rear of the}} seat, capable of carrying about 1,500 lbs. of material such as sewer pipe, cement, brick, shovels and other tools. Two <b>patrol</b> <b>wagons</b> were built, using Cadillac chassis, the bodies being made at the municipal shop and all necessary changes to the chassis, the cost being approximately $1,800 each. These wagons were used for police duty and ambulance calls.|$|R
