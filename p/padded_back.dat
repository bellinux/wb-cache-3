50|$|The {{tank was}} carried via two {{transport}} belts and <b>padded</b> <b>back.</b> It {{was composed of}} two cylinders. Each was divided internally into two parts by a metal diaphragm. The two upper sections were linked together and could hold 6 litres of nitrogen at 20 atmospheres, which acted as a propellant. The lower halves were also connected and contained 12 litres of fuel, a mixture composed of 9 parts diesel oil and 1 part gasoline. Both substances were loaded from special openings on {{the upper end of}} the cylinders, where a manual valve conveyed the liquid nitrogen in the tank to pressurize them at the moment of use. The filler pipe coupling of the lance was located in the lower part of the tank, beside the right cylinder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Paramotoring is a sport clearly {{distinct}} from paragliding {{in which the}} pilot flies using a special wing and wearing a motor on his back to take off. Generally paramotoring is not considered a high risk sport but since it {{is a relatively new}} sport, there aren't any reports in literature about injuries associated with its practice. We report the case of a 48 year old healthy professional athlete which had an accident during takeoff in one of his training flights and received diffuse axonal injury, vertebral fractures and anterior shoulder sprain with associated humeral trochiter fracture. We compared injuries to those connected to the practice of other aerial sports: paragliding in particular. Probably in paramotoring, unlike in paragliding, take-off is the more critical phase of flight {{and the use of the}} motor may aggravate the dynamics of trauma in case of accident. Although the patient was wearing a helmet at the time of the incident, he suffered a diffuse axonal injury: probably the impact location and impact speed compromised the effectiveness of helmet. So more research about the biomechanics of traumatic brain injuries in paramotoring is necessary to improve protection systems, such as helmets, to reduce injury risks in this sport. Furthermore <b>padded</b> <b>back</b> protection should be made obligatory when flying with power paragliding...|$|E
40|$|Man spends {{increasing}} {{amounts of}} time in a sitting position. Concurrent with this development are increasing reports of low back dysfunction. Numerous researchers have investigated unsupported and supported sitting postures using specially designed chairs. The NADA- (Spanish for nothing) Chair ® is a simple sling consisting of two loops of webbing attached to a <b>padded</b> <b>back</b> rest. No literature has been located describing {{a study of the}} NADA-Chair®. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the NADA-Chair ® maintains a convex forward lumbar curve, and to determine people’s attitudes toward the test chair. Fifteen volunteers from the university population (mean age 21. 9 years) participated in the study. Lateral photographs were taken of the subjects sitting on a stool with and without the test chair. Body segment angles in these positions were calculated. Data were analyzed with a three factor ANOVA repeated measures test. Significant difference was shown in the lumbar angle between sitting with and without the test chair. Receptivity of the test chair was evaluated by means of a written questionnaire and relative frequencies were calculated. The test chair was better received in the unsupported sitting positions. Sixty percent of subjects would wear the chair again. These results lend support to the manufacturer’s claim that the test chair maintains a normal lumbar curve. ...|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} backpack {{design is}} a bag {{attached to a}} set of shoulder straps. Such packs are used for general transportation of goods, and have variable capacity. The simplest designs consist of one main pocket. This may be combined with webbing or cordage straps, while more sophisticated models add extra pockets, waist straps, chest straps, padded shoulder straps, <b>padded</b> <b>backs,</b> and sometimes reflective materials for added safety at night. These packs are generally produced inexpensively.|$|R

5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional <b>pad</b> <b>back</b> towards the wall.|$|R

5000|$|A talented sketch artist, she {{sketches}} {{an accurate}} likeness of {{a suspect in}} the episode [...] "Marine Down". During the same episode, it was shown that she had drawn caricatures of the team, some of which showed DiNozzo lusting after a pretty girl, and NCIS forensic scientist Abby Sciuto as a bat. She also drew one of Gibbs as well, but managed to take her drawing <b>pad</b> <b>back</b> from DiNozzo before he revealed it. In season three, when Ziva David joined the team full-time and moved into Todd's cubicle, she presented Gibbs with Todd's sketch pad. There were portraits of each cast member in it, including Gibbs.
