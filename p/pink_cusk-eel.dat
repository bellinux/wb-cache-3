50|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eel,</b> Genypterus blacodes, is {{a species}} of cusk-eel found in the oceans around {{southern}} Australia, Chile, Brazil, and around New Zealand except {{the east coast of}} Northland, in depths of 22 to 1000 m. Their length is up to 200 cm, and they live for up to 30 years.|$|E
40|$|Aporocotyle mariachristinae n. sp. and A. ymakara Villalba & Fernández, 1986 were {{collected}} from the bulbus arteriosus and ventral aorta of <b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eels,</b> Genypterus blacodes (Forster, 1801) from Patagonia, Argentina. A. mariachristinae n. sp. can be distinguished from all the species of Aporocotyle by the asymmetrical extension of posterior caeca (right posterior caecum longer, terminating at the area between mid-level of ovary and posterior body end; left posterior caecum shorter, terminating at the area between mid-level of cirrus sac and posterior to reproductive organs), the distribution of spines along the ventro-lateral body margins {{and the number of}} testes. The new species clearly differs from A. ymakara, from the same host species, in the esophagus / body length ratio, the absence of distal loops at caeca, the anterior caeca / posterior caeca length ratio, and the number of testes. Additionally, in A. ymakara the left posterior caecum may be longe...|$|R

Additionally, in A. ymakara the left posterior caecum may be longer than right posterior caecum, while in the new species left posterior caecum is always shorter. The specimen of A. ymakara collected from Argentina is also described. We also provide observations of the distribution of spines in different species of Aporocotyle, including new specimens of A. argentinensis Smith, 1969 from Merluccius hubbsi Marini, 1933. Molecular sequence data obtained from partial 18 S and 28 S rDNA regions were compared between the new species and other two species of Aporocotyle (A. argentinensis and A. spinosicanalis Williams, 1958). This is a new locality record for A. ymakara, extending the known geographical distribution for this species from Chile to Argentina, and the first report of two species of Aporocotyle in the same host species and locality...|$|R
50|$|Caldillo de congrio (Spanish for Cusk-eel stock) is a Chilean fish dish. The dish {{is made of}} congrio Dorado (<b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eel)</b> or Colorado (red cusk-eel), a cusk-eel species {{common in}} the Chilean Sea. The dish is made by boiling {{together}} fish heads, onion, garlic, coriander, carrots and pepper. Once these are boiled, only the stock is used. Onion and garlic are fried together with chopped tomatoes. The vegetables are mixed then with the stock, cream, boiled potatoes and marinated and boiled conger.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-five {{specimens}} of <b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eel,</b> Genypterus brasiliensis Regan, 1903 (Osteichthyes: Ophidiidae) {{collected from the}} coastal zone of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (approx. 21 - 23 °S, 41 - 45 °W), from September 2000 to January 2001, were necropsied to study their parasites. All fish were parasitized {{by one or more}} metazoan. Fourteen species of parasites were collected. G. brasiliensis is a new host record for nine parasite species. The larval stages of cestodes and the nematodes were the majority of the parasite specimens collected, with 38. 4 % and 36. 5 %, respectively. Cucullanus genypteri was the dominant species with highest prevalence and/or abundance. The parasites of G. brasiliensis showed the typical overdispersed pattern of distribution. Six parasite species showed correlation between the host's total body length and prevalence and abundance. Host sex did not influence prevalence and parasite abundance of any parasite species. The mean diversity in the infracommunities of G. brasiliensis was H= 0. 364 ± 0. 103, with correlation with the host's total length and without differences in relation to sex of the host. One pair of adult endoparasites (C. genypteri and A. brasiliensis) showed positive covariations between their abundances. Negative association or covariation was not found. Differences between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the parasite community of G. brasiliensis from Rio de Janeiro and Argentina suggest the existence of two population stocks of <b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> in the South America Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The {{by-catch}} {{of sharks}} in artisanal demersal <b>pink</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> (Genypterus blacodes) and yellownose skate (Dipturus chilensis) fisheries is frequent within their fishing effort. Nevertheless, {{there is no}} registry of landings, which could help to control this problem. This is particularly evident for endemic species, which includes most coastal and deep water Chilean sharks. The main systematic characteristic of these Chondrichthyan species is the external morphology of the neurocraneum. The form and arrangement of the teeth and dermal denticles allow specific differences to be identified. The objective {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the biology and systematic knowledge of demersal shark species, teeth and dermal denticle morphology and neurocraneum morphometrics of two species of Scyliorhinids, the redspotted catshark (Schroederichthys chilensis) and the dusky catshark (Halaelurus canescens), as well as three Squaliforms, the granular dogfish (Centroscyllium granulatum), the birdbeak dogfish (Deania calcea) and the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) ...|$|E
