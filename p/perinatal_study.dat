40|$|Background. Paternal {{aging is}} {{associated}} with premeiotic dam-age to spermatogonia, a mechanism by which new point mu-tations are introduced into the gene pool. We hypothesized that paternal age might contribute to preeclampsia. Methods. We studied the incidence of preeclampsia in 81, 213 deliveries surveyed in 1964 – 1976 in the Jerusalem <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Study.</b> We controlled for maternal age, parity and other risk factors using logistic regression. Results. Preeclampsia was reported in 1303 deliveries (1. 6 %). Compared with fathers age 25 – 34 years, the odds ratios (ORs) for preeclampsia were 1. 24 (95 % confidence interval 1. 05 – 1. 46) for age 35 – 44 and 1. 80 (1. 40 – 2. 31) for age 45. For fathers age 25, the OR was 1. 25 (1. 04 – 1. 51). Although weaker than maternal age effects, paternal effects were consis-tent within subgroups of other variables...|$|E

Compared with controls, mothers of cryptorchid sons (cases) had significantly greater percentages of non-protein bound (P= 0. 010) and albumin-bound (P= 0. 014) estradiol during the first trimester of the index pregnancy. On average, cases had 16 % more bioavailable oestradiol than controls. Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, testosterone, non-protein bound testosterone and sex-hormone binding globulin did not differ between the two groups. The data presented support the hypothesis that cryptorchidism results from elevated maternal oestrogen levels early in pregnancy. Cryptorchidism, a relatively common abnormality of the male genitourinary system, is the major known risk factor for testicular cancer (Henderson et al., 1979; Schottenfeld et al., 1980; Depue et al., 1983).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{low birth weight}} on the {{incidence}} of asthma by 17 years of age was investigated by studying medical draft examination records of 20, 312 male subjects born in Jerusalem between January 1967 and December 1971. Additional information on birth weight and other demographic factors was abstracted from the Jerusalem <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Study</b> computerised database. A stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for developing asthma by 17 years of age in 500 g birthweight categories from less than 2000 g to 4500 g. The odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding effects of ethnic origin, social class (determined by area of residence), paternal education, maternal age, and birth order. The group with low birth weights (less than 2500 g, n = 1004) had a significantly increased risk of developing asthma by 17 years of age, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 79 to 2. 66) for birthweight group less than 2000 g and 1. 49 (95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 12) for birthweight group 2000 - 2499 g compared with the reference group of 3000 - 3499 g.

For IVF without ovarian stimulation, a modified natural cycle protocol was used. Results: No differences were found in pregnancy duration, proportion of prematurity and proportion of low birth weight. Mean birth weight of modified natural cycle vs standard IVF singletons was 3485 (+/- 527) vs 3218 (+/- 670) g; P = 0. 003. After adjustment for prognostic factors by linear regression analysis, the difference in birth weight remaining was 134 g; P = 0. 045.

Cancer incidence through 2004 was analyzed using Cox’s proportional hazards models, controlling for age and other covariates. Women who used drugs to induce ovulation (n 567) had increased risks of cancer at any site (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 1. 36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 06, 1. 74). An increased risk of uterine cancer was found among women treated with ovulation-inducing agents (HR 3. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 28, 8. 97), specif-ically clomiphene (HR 4. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 56, 13. 34).

To assess the later health effects of prenatal and lactational dioxin exposure on liver function we measured plasma ALAT and ASAT levels amongst our longitudinal cohort, as was done perinatally and at 2 ½ years. The children underwent a caffeine loading test to determine CYP 1 A 2 activity. To assess the later effects on thyroid function we measured plasma TSH and FT 4. Study design: A longitudinal cohort of 37 healthy children (age 7 - 12, mean 8. 2 years), with documented prenatal and lactational dioxin exposure, ingested 3 mg caffeine/kg BW 6 h prior to blood withdrawal. Paraxanthine/caffeine molar ratio, ALAT, ASAT, TSH and FT 4 were determined in venous blood. Results: Linear regression of ASAT and ALAT revealed no relation with prenatal and lactational dioxin exposure. No correlation {{was found between the}} paraxanthine/caffeine molar ratio and prenatal and lactational dioxin exposure.

Nucleic acid amplification was accomplished in 123 plasma samples at enrollment or 6 - 12 weeks postpartum, and RAMs were detected in 22 (17. 9 %; 95 % CI: 11. 7 - 25. 9 %). Previous analyses had demonstrated detection of RAMs in PBMCs in 19 (16. 1 %). There was high concordance between RAMs detected in plasma and PBMC samples, with only eight discordant pairs. The prevalence of RAMs among these pregnant, HIV- 1 -infected women is high (> 15 %). Rates of detection of RAMs in plasma and PBMC samples were similar...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Early {{childhood}} physical growth {{may have}} an impact on the development of adult mental distress. The primary objectives were to (1) assess the association of early growth in weight (adjusted for height) with adult mental distress, and (2) determine if specific sub-types, or patterns, of early physical growth are associated with adult mental distress. Methods: Subjects were all Johns Hopkins Collaborative <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Study</b> cohort subjects with complete birth size information that successfully completed the Pathways to Adulthood follow-up in early adulthood. Variability in the timing of growth in weight adjusted for height from birth to age 7. 5 years was taken into account using a nonhierarchical linear model. Two critical periods of growth were considered as tertiles of change in weight adjusted for height from birth to age seven and birth to age 1 year. Mental distress in adulthood (ages 29 - 32) was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28). Results: Small for gestational age subjects were at increased risk of later mental distress, but not uniformly so. Those born with low weight and length for gestational age were a distinct subgroup of those born small for gestational age, and had unique patterns of risk for adult mental distress when early growth was considered. Conclusions: Acceleration and deceleration in weight for height change is associated with mental distress over multiple periods of early life and acts differentially between those periods. Furthermore, the association of early childhood growth with the likelihood of adult mental distress is dependent on prenatal growth...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{identification}} of fetal sheep remains in archaeological sites are scarce {{in comparison to the}} abundant literature addressing methods for postnatal age determination. However, <b>perinatal</b> <b>studies</b> can provide important information about sheep flock management in the Neolithic period. Motivated by the extensive fetal and neonatal assemblages recovered in the Neolithic and Bronze Age levels of El Mirador cave (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), we have identified and distinguished the remains using morphological criteria complemented by osteometric criteria. Skeletal development during the fetal period is less affected by the agents that can influence postnatal skeletal development (genetic, environmental, etc.). A priori, this makes age determination using actualistic data in fetal remains more reliable than in postnatal remains. Starting from these premises, the perinatal remains from El Mirador cave were analyzed using the osteological collection of fetal and neonatal individuals of the Rasa Aragonesa breed from the IPE (Instituto Pirenaico de Ecología, Jaca, Spain). Veterinary studies based on bone center ontogenesis and fetal age identification methods using metric criteria were also employed. The identification of age and the distinction of fetal and neonatal remains in the El Mirador cave assemblages based on qualitative anatomical criteria were consistent with the results obtained from osteometric data, specifically from the diaphyseal length measurement. In addition, the large number of specimen in the El Mirador assemblages made it possible to distinguish different fetal phases in accordance with skeletal developmental phenomena. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective. Survivors of perinatal stroke {{may be at risk}} for behavioral problems. Perinatal risk factors that might increase the likelihood of later behavior problems have not been identified. The goal {{of this study was to}} explore whether perinatal factors might contribute to behavior problems after perinatal stroke. Methods. 79 children with unilateral <b>perinatal</b> stroke were <b>studied.</b> <b>Perinatal</b> factors included gender, gestational age, neonatal seizures, instrumented delivery, fetal distress, acute birth problems, birth weight, and time of diagnosis. Subjects with evidence of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were excluded. Parents completed the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach 1985). The CBCL yields T-scores in several symptom scales. We focused on Social, Thought, and Attention Problems scates. Results. Gestational age and the presence of uteroplacental insufficiency were associated with significant differences on the Thought Problems scale; Attention Problems scores approached significance fo...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have {{provided}} preliminary insights into {{risk factors and}} possible prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) postpartum with no attempt to examine prenatal PTSD. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of PTSD during pregnancy and after birth, and the course of PTSD over this time. METHODS: PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using PTSD terms crossed with <b>perinatal</b> terms. <b>Studies</b> were included if they reported the prevalence of PTSD during pregnancy or after birth using a diagnostic measure. RESULTS: 59 studies (N = 24267) met inclusion criteria: 35 studies of prenatal PTSD and 28 studies of postpartum PTSD (where 4 studies provided prevalence of PTSD in pregnancy and postpartum). In community samples the mean prevalence of prenatal PTSD was 3. 3...|$|R
