In {{their analysis of}} this data published in the Textbook of Military Medicine, Ronald Bellamy and Russ Zajtchuck <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> number of cases which seem to be examples of distant injuries. Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe three mechanisms of distant wounding due to pressure transients: 1) stress waves 2) shear waves and 3) a vascular pressure impulse.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{have also}} been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be {{a different way of}} looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.|$|E
25|$|Caruso's father, Marcellino, was a {{mechanic}} and foundry worker. Initially, Marcellino thought his son should adopt the same trade, {{and at the}} age of 11, the boy was apprenticed to {{a mechanic}}al engineer who constructed public water fountains. (Whenever visiting Naples in future years, Caruso liked to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fountain that he had helped to install.) Caruso later worked alongside his father at the Meuricoffre factory in Naples. At his mother's insistence, he also attended school for a time, receiving a basic education under the tutelage of a local priest. He learned to write in a handsome script and studied technical draftsmanship. During this period he sang in his church choir, and his voice showed enough promise for him to contemplate a possible career in music.|$|E

He {{argued that the}} [...] "Plan of study" [...] which Rennie had added to the book was impractical, imagining the reader to have a shelf of books instead, probably, of just the one. Next, [...] "J. D." [...] {{attacked}} Rennie's [...] "use of system", declaring himself disappointed, especially by Rennie's [...] "abuse" [...] of zoologists who were systematic. He then asks rhetorically whether anyone can identify a bird using the second edition, answering his own question with [...] "that he can do so, no one will, I think, have the hardihood to advance" [...] and hence that [...] "The book, viewed in this light, {{appears to be a}} complete failure." ...|$|E

500|$|The first paper {{seemed to}} <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> contradiction between the {{electrodynamic}} {{theory and the}} relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c2. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper [...] "Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass" [...] in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal Physikalische Zeitschrift in 1922. That year, Fermi submitted his article [...] "On the phenomena occurring near a world line" [...] (...) to the Italian journal I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei. In this article he examined the Principle of Equivalence, and introduced the so-called [...] "Fermi coordinates". He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves {{as if it were}} a Euclidean space.|$|E
500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{investigation}} phases, players control Edgeworth directly, {{either with}} the D-pad, or by sliding the map that is {{displayed on the}} bottom screen. The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases, who they can talk to. As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene, they are saved as Edgeworth's thoughts. Using the [...] "logic" [...] function, the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information; for instance, by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once, Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must {{have been at the}} crime scene. At some points, the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene; by using the [...] "deduction" [...] function at these points, the player is able to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> contradiction between the crime scene and evidence. If the player successfully points out a contradiction, they gain access to new information. At certain points, a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene; by investigating these reproductions, the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. As more evidence is uncovered, the hologram is updated. After having examined an area sufficiently, the investigation phase ends, and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase.|$|E
