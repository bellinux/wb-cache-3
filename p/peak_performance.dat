The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E

5|$|The yearlong {{conversion}} began October 9, 2011. Between October and December, 96 of Jaguar's 200 cabinets, each containing 24 XT5 blades (two 6-core CPUs per node, four nodes per blade), were {{upgraded to}} XK7 blades (one 16-core CPU per node, four nodes per blade) while {{the remainder of}} the machine remained in use. In December, computation was moved to the 96 XK7 cabinets while the remaining 104 cabinets were upgraded to XK7 blades. ORNL's external ESnet connection was upgraded from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s and the system interconnect (the network over which CPUs communicate with each other) was updated. The Seastar design used in Jaguar was upgraded to the Gemini interconnect used in Titan which connects the nodes into a direct 3D torus interconnect network. Gemini uses wormhole flow control internally. The system memory was doubled to 584 TiB. 960 of the XK7 nodes (10 cabinets) were fitted with a Fermi based GPU as Kepler GPUs were not then available; these 960 nodes were referred to as TitanDev and used to test code. This first phase of the upgrade increased the <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> of Jaguar to 3.3 petaFLOPS. Beginning on September 13, 2012, Nvidia K20X GPUs were fitted to all of Jaguar's XK7 compute blades, including the 960 TitanDev nodes. In October, the task was completed and the computer was finally christened Titan.|$|E

30|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the age of}} <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in longer distances than the Ironman distance showed that {{the mean age of}} the winning male athletes at international level in a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon distance was ~ 36 years and {{the mean age of the}} winning male athletes at international level in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon distance was ~ 38 years (Knechtle et al. 2012 a). We postulated that the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in the Ironman distance would be in between the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> of the Half-Ironman distance and the longer distances. Consistent with our hypothesis and slightly higher than previous findings (Rüst et al. 2012 b; Stiefel et al. 2013 a), the present data showed that both female and male Ironman triathletes reached their <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> at the age of ~ 34 - 35 years. In men, this was significantly higher than the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in the Half-Ironman and the Olympic distance. In women, the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> was significantly higher than in the Olympic distance. These findings confirm the hypothesis that the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> is higher in longer race distances (i.e. Ironman distance).|$|R

These findings suggest that women would achieve <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in Half-Ironman at a higher age compared to men. Consistent with these findings, the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in the Half-Ironman distance was ~ 32 years in women and ~ 28 years in men.

30|$|For {{athletes and}} their coaches, {{the age of}} <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> is more {{important}} than the age-related decline in performance (Lepers et al. 2013 a). With the knowledge of the exact age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for the different distances, athletes would be able to determine the best time in life to race in the different distances. Due to the gap in the literature about the exact age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> over the different distances, athletes may not have been able to organize their training and plan their career as precisely as they could have with these findings. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to determine the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for world class athletes competing in the Olympic distance using race data of the top international races of the last decade. Since the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> appears to increase with increasing race distance, we expected the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for the Olympic distance to be lower than for the Half-Ironman and Ironman distances. The second aim was to determine the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for world class athletes competing in the Half-Ironman and the Ironman distances and it was assumed that the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> would be higher in the longer race distances (i.e. Half-Ironman and Ironman). We expected that the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> would be higher in the Half-Ironman distance than in the Olympic distance, and higher in the Ironman distance than in both the Olympic and the Half-Ironman distances. The third aim was to investigate a potential change in the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for the annual top athletes between 2003 and 2013 for the three different distances. It has been reported that the fastest athletes competing in ‘Ironman Hawaii’ became older and faster over the past few years (Gallmann et al. 2014). We expected that the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> for the fastest Ironman triathletes would increase over the last decade, while it would remain stable in athletes competing in the Olympic and Half-Ironman distance. The forth aim of this study was to investigate potential changes in triathlon performance over time. Since athletes competing in ‘Ironman Hawaii’ became faster over the past few years (Gallmann et al. 2014), we expected to find an improvement of performance in the Ironman distance, while performance would remain stable in the Olympic and Half-Ironman distance.|$|R

30|$|This study {{intended}} (i) {{to determine}} the age of <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> in world class athletes competing in races held in Olympic, Half-Ironman and Ironman distance triathlons and (ii) to investigate a potential change across years {{in the age of}} <b>peak</b> triathlon <b>performance</b> of the annual fastest athletes.
