40|$|Background and Aims. While several {{case reports}} on ischemic colitis (IC) suggest the {{presence}} of <b>predisposing</b> causative <b>factors,</b> {{a few studies have}} investigated the <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> in IC. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with IC, particularly focusing on the <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> Methods. We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of 159 patients with IC. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, endoscopic findings, and medical records were reviewed. Data were compared between groups of patients defined according to the <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> The <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> are defined as temporary states or episodic events occurring within a week before the development of IC such as colonoscopy, enema, use of laxatives, heavy drinking, pancreatitis, shock, and burn. Results. Compared to the group of patients without <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> of IC, the group of patients with <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> was characterized by a relatively higher prevalence of male sex (56. 9 % versus 33. 3 %, p= 0. 005), younger age (60. 9 [*]±[*] 15. 4 versus 67. 2 [*]±[*] 13. 4 years, p= 0. 010), lower incidence of hypertension (43. 1 % versus 60. 2 %, p= 0. 044), and fewer risk factors (1. 24 [*]±[*] 1. 18 versus 1. 82 [*]±[*] 1. 22, p= 0. 005). Conclusions. Among men with <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> IC may develop even at a relatively younger age {{and in the absence of}} multiple risk <b>factors,</b> suggesting that <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> may be involved in the pathogenesis of IC...|$|R
40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} in chickens develops as {{a result}} of infection with pathogenic strains of Clostridium perfringens and the presence of <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> include elements that directly change the physical properties of the gut, either damaging the epithelial surface, inducing mucus production, or changing gut transit times; factors that disrupt the gut microbiota; and factors that alter the immune status of birds. In the past research into necrotic enteritis <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> was directed by the simple hypothesis that low-level colonization of C. perfringens commonly occurred within the gut of healthy chickens and the <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> lead to a proliferation of those bacteria to produce disease. More recently, with an increasing understanding of the major virulence factors of C. perfringens and the application of molecular techniques to define different clades of C. perfringens strains, it has become clear that the C. perfringens isolates commonly found in healthy chickens are generally not strains that have the potential to cause disease. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate hypotheses regarding the development of disease, the origin of disease causing isolates of C. perfringens, and the importance of interactions with other C. perfringens strains and with <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> Many <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> that affect the physical and immunological characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract may also change the resident microbiota. Research directed towards defining the relative importance of each of these different actions of <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and may allow refinement of experiment disease models...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS) is {{an inflammatory}} condition of oral mucosa {{and is very}} common that occur in 20 % of population, in which 80 % of all cases are minor type. Etiology remains unknown but there are factors that can precipitate the attack, known as <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> which are haematinic deficiency, food hypersensitivity, bacterial or viral infection, hormonal changes, psychological stress, drugs and local trauma. Management of minor RAS are symptomatic and also discovering all <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> which may play role {{in order to give}} the appropriate treatments to all <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> The appropriate treatment for all <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> is to prevent recurrency or reduce the severity of RAS.

25|$|The genus Exserohilum {{comprises}} dematiaceous fungi {{commonly associated}} with foliar plant diseases and rarely with human and animal phaeohyphomycosis. Fungi of this genus are characterized {{by the presence of}} melanin in their cell walls, which is thought to contribute to their virulence. Many Exserohilum species are plant pathogens that affect a wide range of plant species, especially grasses Poaceae, causing distinct leaf spots and blights. However, S. rostrata has also been shown to survive in human as well as animal hosts, indicating pathogenic versatility. Though E. rostratum is a rare cause of infection in people, the species can cause a spectrum of diseases including allergic fungal sinusitis, skin and subcutaneous infections, invasive disease and occasionally keratomycosis an inflammation of the cornea. Invasive and skin infections caused by Exserohilum occur more frequently in those that are immunodeficient or have impaired immunity, these include infections in the sinuses, lungs, lining of the heart, and bone. Whereas, local trauma is a <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> for skin and corneal infections. Meningitis and peripheral arthritides have also been reported pursuant to exposure to contaminated intrathecal drugs.|$|E
25|$|A <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the landslide predisposing factors' combination using a bivariate statistical model that best predicts landslide susceptibility. The best model is one that has simultaneously good performance in terms of suitability and predictive power and has been developed using variables that are conditionally independent. The study area is the Santa Marta de Penaguião council (70 km 2) located in the Northern Portugal. In order to identify the best combination of landslide <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> all possible combinations using up to seven <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> were performed, which resulted in 120 predictions that were assessed with a landside inventory containing 767 shallow translational slides. The best landslide susceptibility model was selected according to the model degree of fitness and on the basis of a conditional independence criterion. The best model was developed with only three landslide <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> (slope angle, inverse wetness index, and land use) and was compared with a model developed using all seven landslide <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors.</b> Results showed that it is possible to produce a reliable landslide susceptibility model using fewer landslide <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> which contributes towards higher conditional independence...|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E

40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Self-care {{activity}} {{is a key}} factor in managing Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in order to reduce disability caused by the disease. <b>Predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> including knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy are introduced as determinants of self-care behaviors in the forth phase of PRECEDE model, i. e., ecological and educational assessment. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> and self-care behaviors in patients with RA in Yazd, Iran. Methods &amp; Materials: In this cross-sectional study, a convenience sampling was used to recruit 181 outpatients with RA referred to a rheumatology clinic in Yazd, Iran. Data were collected by conducting interviews with the participants using a survey questionnaire included knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy, as predisposing factors; and self-care behaviors items. Reliability and validity of the instruments were examined and approved. The statistical tests included bivariate correlations, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear regression. Results: Knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy scores were 71. 7 %, 66. 9 %, and 47. 5 %, respectively. The total <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> score was 62. 3 %. There was a significant positive correlation between the self-care behaviors with attitude and self-efficacy. However, there was no significant correlation between the patients' knowledge and self-care behaviors. Totally, the measures explained 39. 3 % of total self-care behaviors variance within which the self-efficacy was the strongest predictor (&beta;= 0. 41). Conclusion: Regarding the high power of <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> especially self-efficacy, in predicting self-care behaviors; and the low scores of self-efficacy, health promotion planners should pay more attention to <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors</b> of self-care behaviors especially the self-efficacy in designing health promotion programs. &nbsp; Key words: <b>predisposing</b> <b>factors,</b> rheumatoid arthritis, self-car...|$|R
