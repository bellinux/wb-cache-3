30|$|WSN {{is subject}} to {{a unique set of}} {{resource}} constraints, such as finite on-board battery power and limited network communication bandwidth. It is well known that communicating 1 bit over the wireless medium at short ranges consumes far more energy than processing that bit. In conventional routing protocols, sensor nodes make the routing decision via collecting routing information in delivery package and following the rule of specific routing algorithm. Additional routing data exchange between sensor nodes will obviously lead to the network inefficiency and unnecessary energy waste. Thus, we endeavour on turning routing communication procedure into calculation of local sensor node and propose beacon routing algorithm to eliminate communication consumption in routing exchanging process. Sensor nodes in local network can autonomously make routing decision in an efficient way according to the <b>polling</b> <b>signal</b> containing beacon cluster identification from mobile gateway. Therefore, additional cost of routing message exchange can be saved to increase the network lifetime.|$|E
40|$|A {{new medium}} access {{protocol}} is proposed for sharing a high speed radio channel {{among a number}} of small wireless packet access units, some of which may be stationary and some of which may be within moving vehicles. Such a system could provide fixed point, pedestrian and remote users with wireless access to CPU and database resources of an underlying ATM wireline network, essentially extending the ATM bandwidth-upon-demand interface directly to the wireless units and enabling delivery of multimedia services (albeit at the lower peak rate afforded by the radio channel). A primary goal of the proposed medium access protocol is the pre-delivery of a signal from each packet access unit as needed to rapidly compute the weights needed by a base station's adaptive array processor or a space-time processor, thereby protecting the packet flow in each direction from the effects of both multipath propagation and adjacent channel interference arising in neighboring radio cells. An impairment-robust direct sequence spread spectrum-based <b>polling</b> <b>signal</b> is invoked to stimulate a pilot tone from a given remote immediately prior to packet transfer in either direction, thereby permitting the base station to determine a good set of antenna element combining or power splitting weights to be used for that packet. Reasonable approximations are invoked to study the performance of the proposed protocol, and link utilization efficiency and average message delay are found. By proper choice of protocol parameters, a radio resource utilization efficiency of about 95 % is readily achieved. Accuracy of the approximations is confirmed by extensive computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polls</b> and {{coalition}} <b>signals</b> can help strategic voters in multiparty systems with proportional representation {{and coalition}} governments to optimise their vote decision. Using a laboratory experiment embedded in two real election campaigns, this study focuses on voters' attention to and perception of <b>polls</b> and coalition <b>signals.</b> The manipulation of <b>polls</b> and coalition <b>signals</b> allows a causal test of {{their influence on}} strategic voting in a realistic environment. The findings suggest that active information acquisition to form fairly accurate perceptions of election outcomes can compensate for the advantage of high political sophistication. The theory of strategic voting {{is supported by the}} evidence, but only for a small number of voters. Most insincere vote decisions are explained by other factors. Thus, the common practice to consider all insincere voters as strategic is misleading. " (author's abstract...|$|R

30|$|Idle module (IM): The idle module {{works in}} two modes. They are polling mode and control {{transfer}} mode. IM continuously <b>polls</b> the R/W̅ <b>signal</b> and DTM signal. Depending upon {{the status of}} these two controlling signals, CU transfers the control either to CRM or to CWM. On completion of the operation, the DONE signal is asserted to CU. On polling mode, the controller is in power saving state as the card is in the idle state. The controller sends a constant high value to the MOSI line, and the card also responds with a constant high value via MISO line of the controller.|$|R
40|$|Control {{dominated}} {{embedded systems}} {{have to be}} designed for fast reaction to asynchronous external events occurring in the environment. Such systems {{must be able to}} perform <b>signal</b> emission, <b>signal</b> <b>polling,</b> preemption and priority resolution efficiently. Current microprocessors and microcontrollers, however, have no direct support for such tasks and employ indirect mechanisms such as polling (via a port) and interrupts. In this paper, we propose a new processor core having architectural support for reactivity at the instruction level. The new processor core (called REFLIX) is an extension of an existing open source processor (FLIX) core with additional instructions to support reactivity. Initial benchmarking results (for some control dominated programs) show that REFLIX performs, on an average, 5. 92 times faster compared to FLIX and has 77 % code size reduction when compared to some conventional processors. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{strategic}} voting {{has been tested}} in experiments for elections in single member districts with three candidates or parties. It is unclear whether it can explain strategic voting behavior in a fairly common type of political system, multi-party systems with proportional representation, minimum vote thresholds, and coalition governments. In this paper, we develop a (non-formal) strategic voting game and show in a simulation that the model produces election scenarios and outcomes with desirable characteristics. We then test the decision-theoretic model in a laboratory experiment. Participants with a purely instrumental (financial) motivation voted {{in a series of}} 25 independent elections. The availability of <b>polls</b> and coalition <b>signals</b> by parties was manipulated. The results show that voters are frequently able to make optimal or strategic vote decisions, but that voters also rely on simple decision heuristics and are highly susceptible to coalition signals by parties. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper investigates how poll {{information}} and coalition signals affect strategic voting, defined as casting {{a vote for}} a party other than the most preferred party to better influence the election outcome. In particular if the outcome of an election {{is perceived to be}} close, voters in multi-party systems with proportional representation and coalition governments should have an incentive to cast a vote for the party that best influences the formation of the next government. The study focuses in particular on voters’ attention to and perception of <b>polls</b> and coalition <b>signals</b> sent by parties before elections. The study used an innovative design that embedded a laboratory experiment in two real election campaigns, allowing the manipulation of poll results and coalition signals in a realistic environment. The findings suggest that political sophistication plays a crucial role for the accurate perception of polls and strategic voting. Coalition signals are found to have a surprisingly strong effect on (apparently) strategic voting. ...|$|R
50|$|The Weilheim station {{originally}} had three mechanical signal boxes. Signal box 1 controlled movements between {{different parts of}} the station precinct and was located at the northern end of the station west of the tracks. Signal box 2 was operated by the train despatcher and was situated south of the entrance building between the local loading tracks and the station building. Both were mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1902. Signal box 3 was a mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1925, which controlled the marshalling yard and was located {{at the southern end of}} the sidings to the west of the station. In 1983, the three signal boxes were replaces by a centralised signal box with a track-plan push-button interlocking of the Lorenz L60 class, which is housed in an cubic, three-storey building with an attached observation deck. This signal box controls, in addition to the Weilheim station area, the Wilzhofen and <b>Polling</b> areas. The <b>signal</b> box is located on the main platform north of the entrance building.|$|R
50|$|The Record of the Year was {{an award}} voted by the United Kingdom public. For many {{years it was}} given in {{conjunction}} with television programmes of the same name. The first show ran {{in the early evening}} on a December Saturday just before Christmas, with the ten finalists represented as either live performances or filmed inserts or dance routines; then the phone lines were declared opened and the second show, an hour or so later, at prime time and also live, went around the TV regions revealing the votes and culminating in the announcement of the winner. It became one of the highest rated music TV ceremonies in the UK, boosting sales of CDs and then downloads in the crucial fortnight before Christmas every year. For that reason it was much respected by the industry, labels, publishers and retailers. It was the only music award in the UK to be chosen by the public. The award began in 1998 and was televised on ITV for eight years before being dropped in 2006 after disagreements over the phone voting element. Since then it had been an online poll, administered through the Record of the Year website. In 2013, the online <b>poll</b> was axed, <b>signaling</b> the end of the award.|$|R
40|$|Modern car {{alarm systems}} are {{equipped}} with smart sensors implemented using various physical principles. These sensors have to ensure high {{reliability and validity of}} monitored parameters with a lack of false operations. First of all, shock sensor, which is a part of, essentially, entire alarm systems, as well as tilt and motion sensors are referred to the smart sensors. Shock sensors with the sensitive elements (SE) of piezoelectric, microphone, and electromagnetic types possess a number of the essential shortcomings caused by the type of SE. It is, first of all, a narrow band of the sensitive elements, which does not allow true differentiation of shocks to the autobody from false actions, as well as a various sensitivity of sensors depending on the SE axis orientation. Tilt sensors of electromagnetic type implemented as separate devices were seldom used because of their high cost and imperfect characteristics. Though there is still a need for such sensors. The specified shortcomings can be hardly overcome through improvement of sensitive element hangers of considered sensors. The use of the three-axial accelerometers made by MEMS technology seems to be the most perspective here. The article presents results of pilot studies of the accelerations reached when auto-body is under shock and a car is inclined and runs. When measuring, the test board STM 32 F 3 DISCOVERY with the MEMS accelerometer LSM 303 DLHS is used. A level of noise and vibrations has been analysed when mounting a board on the plastic panel of the car and when operating the engine in the range from 700 to 4000 rpm. The article presents accelerations implemented under the following conditions: light shocks {{in different parts of the}} auto-body (wing, trunk, hood); strong shock (closing a door); slow and fast acceleration to the speed of 20 km/h with the subsequent braking and passage of obstacles such as "sleeping policemen". Research results enabled us to make justification for selecting the range of accelerometer operation, as well as the accuracy of measuring acceleration, frequency of <b>signal</b> <b>poll,</b> and algorithm of filtration. The article gives recommendations for selecting the MEMS accelerometers to be used in combined shock, tilt, and motion sensors of modern car alarm systems. </p...|$|R
