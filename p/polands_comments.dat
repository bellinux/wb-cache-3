40|$|A {{hub-and-spoke}} conspiracy {{involves an}} exchange of confidential information primarily concerning future prices. The exchange takes place generally between competing distributors via a common supplier but a reverse relationship is also possible. The essence of hub-and-spoke {{lies in the fact}} that there is no direct contact between competitors – the party guaranteeing the information flow is normally the common supplier (distributor in a reverse scenario). A hub-and-spoke conspiracy was first identified and specifically described by the British Office of Fair Trade in 2003. There are currently several pending investigations concerning hub-and-spoke practices in a number of EU Member States including Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Three cases of that type have been so far assessed in the Polish antitrust practice: Polifarb Cieszyn Wrocław (2007), Tikurilla (2010) and Akzo Nobel (2010). The main objective of this article is the reconstruction of hub-and-spoke conduct in <b>Poland.</b> <b>Commented</b> will also be issues such as: the connection between hub-and-spoke practices and ‘classic’ retail price maintenance; standard of proof, and duration of the agreements. ...|$|R

Sporadically, the controversy is caused by the lack of sensitivity toward the history of the German occupation of <b>Poland</b> with <b>comments</b> made without awareness of the controversy.|$|R

2500|$|Direct {{access to}} Himmler also made Schellenberg privy {{to some of}} the Reich's most {{sensitive}} material. For example, Schellenberg knew early on about the arrangement between Germany and Russia concerning the partition of Poland, an agreement which presaged the military invasion. Once the Nazis invaded and occupied Polish territory, Schellenberg was entrusted with securing the rear areas by Himmler and Heydrich, which meant he oversaw the deployment of special commandos from the SD and Gestapo, units which carried-out brutal measures against the Poles. Another one of his areas of responsibility was counter-espionage, both within Germany and the occupied territories—a task for which Schellenberg seemed well-suited given his penchant for intrigue.

40|$|This Comment {{provides}} {{a study of}} the 1994 Polish Copyright Law and examines whether the law will lead to increased investment in the Polish software market by U. S. software publishers. Part I discusses the U. S. and Polish computer software industries and the role of U. S. software companies in Poland. Part I also analyzes the 1952 Polish Copyright Law and the problems it precipitated, as well as the dilemma of software piracy as a function of copyright law. Finally, Part I discusses the forces of change that culminated in the enactment of the 1994 Polish Copyright Law. Part II {{provides a}}n analysis of the provisions in the 1994 Polish Copyright Law that directly concern computer programs. Part III argues that U. S. software publishers should greet the new Polish Copyright Law enthusiastically because the law conforms with international, regional, and bilateral agreements and offers a genuine remedy for the problem of software piracy in <b>Poland.</b> This <b>Comment</b> concludes that the new Polish law will promote increased investment in the Polish computer software market by U.

40|$|Faculty <b>Comments</b> <b>Poland</b> and the Czech Republic {{have been}} {{associate}} {{members of the}} European Union since late 1991. Since that time, both countries have made considerable efforts to "harmonize " their laws {{with those of the}} other EU members, so that they can join as full-fledged members. One of the toughest areas to tackle is that of environmental clean-up and future environmental standards and regulatory enforcement. This paper looks at the path that Poland and the Czech Republic are taking to improve their environmental standards and qualify for EU membership. The paper concludes that both countries are still far from complete compliance with EU environmental standards, but that, for economic and political reasons, the EU is likely to accept their application for membership and look for further environmental improvements in the next ten to fifteen years...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{no doubt}} Menzies {{supported}} British foreign policy, including appeasement, and was initially reticent {{about the prospect of}} going to war with Germany. However, by September 1939 the unfolding crisis in Europe convinced him that the diplomatic efforts by Chamberlain and other leaders to broker a peace agreement had failed and that war was now an inevitability. In his Declaration of War broadcast on 3 September 1939, Menzies explained the dramatic turn of events over the past twelve months necessitating this change of course: In those past 12 months, what has happened? in cold-blooded breach of the solemn obligations implied in both the statements I have quoted, Hitler has annexed the whole of the Czechoslovak state. Has, without flickering an eyelid, made a pact with Russia, a country the denouncing and reviling of which has been his chief stock-in-trade ever since he became chancellor. And has now, under circumstances which I will describe to you, invaded with armed force and in defiance of civilised opinion, the independent nation of <b>Poland.</b> Your own <b>comments</b> on this dreadful history will need no reinforcement by me. All I need say is, that whatever the inflamed ambitions of the German Führer may be, he will undoubtedly learn, as other great enemies of freedom have learned before, that no empire, no dominion, can be soundly established upon a basis of broken promises or dishonoured agreements. Menzies {{went on to say that}} if Hitler's expansionist [...] "policy were allowed to go unchecked there could be no security in Europe and there could be no just peace for the world".|$|R
5000|$|In 1939-40, Goerdeler {{assembled}} conservative politicians, {{diplomats and}} generals, most notably Ulrich von Hassell, General Ludwig Beck and Johannes Popitz, {{in opposition to}} Adolf Hitler. On 11 October 1939 speaking to Hassel of German war crimes in <b>Poland,</b> Goerdeler <b>commented</b> that both General Halder and Admiral Canaris were afflicted with nervous complaints {{as a result of}} [...] "our brutal conduct of the war" [...] in Poland. In October 1939, Goerdeler drafted peace terms that a post-Nazi government would seek with Great Britain and France. Under Goerdeler's terms, Germany would retain all the areas of Poland that had been part of Germany prior to 1918, Austria and the Sudetenland with independence being restored to Poland and Czechoslovakia with general disarmament, the restoration of global free trade and the ending of protectionism as the other major goals for the new regime. On 3 November 1939, Goerdeler paid another visit to Sweden, where he met with Marcus Wallenberg, Gustav Cassell, and Dr. Sven Hedin. Hedin wrote in his diary that [...] "he Goerdeler believed in Göring and thought that a speedy peace was the only thing to save Germany, but that peace was unthinkable so long as Hitler remained at the head of affairs". At the same time, Goerdeler was deeply involved in the planning of an abortive putsch intended to be launched on 5 November 1939, and as such was in very high spirits prior to that day. Hassell wrote in his diary that with worry that [...] "He Goerdeler often reminds me of Kapp." [...] (Wolfgang Kapp, the nominal leader of the Kapp Putsch was notorious for his irresponsibility) The proposed putsch became stillborn when Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch and General Franz Halder, the leaders of the planned putsch got cold feet, and dropped their support. Brauchitsch and Halder had decided to overthrow Hitler after the latter had fixed [...] "X-day" [...] for the invasion of France for 12 November 1939; an invasion that both officers believed to be doomed to fail. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November, Brauchitsch had attempted to talk Hitler into putting off [...] "X-day" [...] by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than what it was in 1918, a statement that enraged Hitler who harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. After that meeting, both Halder and Brauchitsch told Goerdeler that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do, and he should find other officers if he that was what he really wanted to do. Equally important, on 7 November 1939 following heavy snowstorms, Hitler put off [...] "X-Day" [...] until further notice, which removed the reason that had most motivated Brauchitsch and Halder to consider overthrowing Hitler. On 23 November 1939, Goerdeler met with Halder to ask him to re-consider his attitude. Halder gave Goerdeler the following reasons why he {{wanted nothing to do with}} any plot to overthrow Hitler: ...|$|R
