40|$|This master’s thesis {{project has}} been carried out at the AkzoNobel International Paint factory in Angered, Sweden. The purpose of this thesis has been to {{increase}} the capacity at the factory’s P 3 <b>pan</b> <b>charging</b> department and to improve the weekly charging schedule by calculating ideal lead times for the most frequently produced products. Due to the large product range (around 130 different products), product lead times were not measured from start to end. Instead all possible work tasks used to manufacture the different products were identified in order to set a standard time for each work task. The work tasks were then combined into a sequence using the unique work order for each product. The work tasks and their sequences were created in the software AviX, which summarized the standard times for all work tasks into complete lead times for each product. Each work task’s standard time was established either by direct time study measurements, usage of the SAM predetermined time system in AviX or a combination of the two. Most of the data collection for the work tasks was done using a video camera. In total 70 product lead times were created in AviX, which historically covers 93. 4 percent of the production in the P 3 <b>pan</b> <b>charging</b> department. Each lead time was visualized by a so-called scheduling bar divided into different colors, which represented different types of times, such as machine times and time for manual work. These scheduling bars were then used in a new load chart scheduling system created in Microsoft Visio. The result indicates that using this scheduling system could on average give an increased capacity of more than 120 percent. The capacity increase can be used to assure that the weekly volume demand is always met. It will also free up time to work with continuous improvements and 5 S as well as time for training of the charging personnel...|$|R
40|$|Nano-web {{sheets of}} {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN) reinforced by carbon nanotubes (CNT) were prepared by electrospinning process. Multi wall nanotubes (MWNT) were dispersed mechanically by high shear mixing using a homogenizer device. It {{has been found}} that the spinning solution presented an electrical percolation threshold less than 0. 5 [*]wt. % of MWNT. Electrical volume and surface conductivity of the obtained nano-webs was studied by measuring the electrical volume resistance and surface resistance thanks to home-made plate electrodes. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to characterize the nano-web sheets produced. The average filament diameters range from 320 to 750 [*]nm depending on the concentration of CNT and of PAN. From an electrical point of view, it has been observed that the electrical volume conductivity increases by about six orders of magnitude from 2 × 10 − 12 [*]S/m for pristine PAN to 4 × 10 − 6 [*]S/m for <b>PAN</b> <b>charged</b> by MWNT. Increasing the pressure on the specimen induces an exponential decrease of the volume resistivity while surface resistivity shows no significant changes, neither between pristine PAN and reinforced nano-webs, nor among reinforced nano-web in relation to MWNT concentration (in the limit of the study). This observed behavior is very interesting in the context of sensor developments...|$|R

Also, there are certain sites that have proliferated on the web that provide online PAN service at additional charge. However, {{there are only two}} authorised entities who are also authorised to host online PAN application services on behalf of ITD, i.e. NSDL e-Governance & UTIITSL.|$|R

You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows."

40|$|The thermal conductivities of nine protic ionic liquids (ILs) {{have been}} {{investigated}} between 293 and 340 K. Within this range, the thermal conductivities are between 0. 18 and 0. 30 W·m- 1 ·K- 1. These values are higher than those typically associated with oils and aprotic ILs, but {{lower than those of}} strongly hydrogen bonding solvents like water. Weak linear decreases in thermal conductivity with temperature are noted, with the exception of ethanolammonium nitrate (EtAN) where the thermal conductivity increases with temperature. The dependence of thermal conductivity on IL type is analyzed with use of the Bahe-Varela pseudolattice theory. This theory treats the bulk IL as an array of ordered domains with intervening domains of uncorrelated structure which enable and provide barriers to heat propagation (respectively) via allowed vibrational modes. For the protic ILs investigated, thermal conductivity depends strongly on the IL cation alkyl chain length. This is because the cation alkyl chain controls the dimensions of the IL bulk nanostructure, which consists of charged (ordered domains) and uncharged regions (disordered domains). As the cation alkyl chain controls the dimensions of the disordered domains, it thus limits the thermal conductivity. To test the generality of this interpretation, the thermal conductivities of propylammonium nitrate (PAN) and PAN-octanol mixtures were examined; water selectively swells the <b>PAN</b> <b>charged</b> domain, while octanol swells the uncharged regions. Up to a certain concentration, adding water increases thermal conduction and octanol decreases it, as expected. However, at high solute concentrations the IL nanostructure is broken. When additional solvent is added above this concentration the rate of change in thermal conductivity is greatly reduced. This is because, in the absence of nanostructure, the added solvent only serves to dilute the salt solution...|$|R

Pan American's wholesale customers, including R. R.

25|$|Because {{of known}} {{shrinkage}} of the graphite moderator bricks {{in the core}} due to in-service irradiation effects, some of the steel <b>charge</b> <b>pans</b> {{on top of them}} had become dislocated from their design position in the interstitial channel and were suspended from the Burst Can Detection (BCD) pipework. This was most prevalent in Reactor 1 because of the different core design to Reactors 2, 3 and 4. BNFL were unable to make an adequate safety case or effect an economic repair and therefore, Reactor 1 did not return to power from its annual outage in August 2001. The core of Reactor 4 was repaired but this reactor did not return to power after the repair.|$|R
5000|$|Because of Emperor Wen's favoritism for Consort Pan, his wife, Empress Yuan Qigui, became greatly jealous, {{and grew}} ill from the jealousy {{and died in}} 440. (Empress Yuan had first become angry at Emperor Wen when Emperor Wen {{approved}} of an expenditure for Consort Pan's relatives that was six to 10 times larger than what he had previously approved for Empress Yuan's relatives.) Because of this, Emperor Yuan's son, Liu Shao the Crown Prince became very resentful of her and her son Liu Jun, particularly because after Empress Yuan's death, Consort <b>Pan</b> became in <b>charge</b> of the imperial palace, effectively replacing Empress Yuan, even though Emperor Wen never created her empress. To ward off the resentment, Liu Jun carefully flattered and ingratiated himself with Liu Shao, and the brothers became exceedingly close. Liu Shao and Liu Jun engaged a witch, Yan Daoyu (嚴道育), to try to curse Emperor Wen to death so that Liu Shao could become emperor. In 452, the plot was discovered, and Emperor Wen, angry and disappointed, rebuked Liu Shao and Liu Jun harshly, but did not initially take any actions against them. In 453, however, when he discovered that despite the rebuke, Liu Shao and Liu Jun were still associating with Yan (and Liu Jun had hidden her in his household at one point), he considered taking punitive actions against them. When she heard of this, Consort Pan held Liu Jun and wept, rebuking him and lamenting: ...|$|R
40|$|MOST PAN {{stages in}} Australian {{factories}} use only {{five or six}} batch pans for the high grade massecuite production and operate these in a fairly rigid repeating production schedule. It is common {{that some of the}} pans are of large dropping capacity e. g. 150 to 240 t. Because of the relatively small number and large sizes of the pans, steam consumption varies widely through the schedule, often by ± 30 % about the mean value. Large fluctuations in steam consumption have implications for the steam generation/condensate management of the factory and the evaporators when bleed vapour is used. One of the objectives of a project to develop a supervisory control system for a pan stage is to (a) reduce the average steam consumption and (b) reduce the variation in the steam consumption. The operation of each of the high grade pans within the schedule at Macknade Mill was analysed to determine the idle (or buffer) time, time allocations for essential but unproductive operations (e. g. <b>pan</b> turn round, <b>charging,</b> slow ramping up of steam rates on pan start etc.), and productive time i. e. the time during boil-on of liquor and molasses feed. Empirical models were developed for each high grade pan on the stage to define the interdependence of the production rate and the evaporation rate for the different phases of each pan’s cycle. The data were analysed in a spreadsheet model to try to reduce and smooth the total steam consumption. This paper reports on the methodology developed in the model and the results of the investigations for the pan stage at Macknade Mill. It was found that the operation of the schedule severely restricted the ability to reduce the average steam consumption and smooth the steam flows. While longer cycle times provide increased flexibility the steam consumption profile was changed only slightly. The ability to cut massecuite on the run among pans, or the use of a high grade seed vessel, would assist in reducing the average steam consumption and the magnitude of the variations in steam flow...|$|R
