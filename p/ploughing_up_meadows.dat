40|$|An Experiment {{to examine}} the {{nitrogen}} fluxes after <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> and resowing grassland {{was conducted on the}} organic experimental station “Lindhof” in northern Germany. The trial was implemented on a uniform grassland site (since 1993) focussing on the factors grassland resowing, fertilisation with organic cattle slurry (0 / 230 kg ha- 1) and year of renovation (2005, 2006, 2008). The factor grassland resowing further involved the following treatments: 1. undisturbed control, 2. <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> and resowing grassland in late summer, 3. <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> of grassland in autumn followed by winter wheat and grassland resowing the year after, 4. <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> of grassland in spring followed by spring wheat and grassland resowing the year after. <b>Ploughing</b> <b>up</b> in autumn induced increased nitrate leaching. Inserted wheat cultivation led to higher leaching in the second winter. N-yields of the newly sown grassland did not exceed those of the undisturbed control due to a low content of white clover in newly established grassland...|$|R
