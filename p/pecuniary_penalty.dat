60|$|Of course such {{an article}} had {{considerable}} effect. It was apparent {{at once that}} there was ample room for an action for libel against the newspaper, {{on the part of}} Phineas Finn if not on that of the Duke. But it was equally apparent that Mr. Quintus Slide must have been very well aware of this when he wrote the article. Such an action, even if successful, may bring with it to the man punished more of good than of evil. Any <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> might be more than recouped by the largeness of the advertisement which such an action would produce. Mr. Slide no doubt calculated that he would carry with him a great body of public feeling by the mere fact that he had attacked a Prime Minister and a Duke. If he could only get all the publicans in London to take his paper because of his patriotic and bold conduct, the fortune of the paper would be made. There is no better trade than that of martyrdom, if the would-be martyr knows how far he may judiciously go, and in what direction. All this Mr. Quintus Slide was supposed to have considered very well.|$|E
60|$|The prize was {{too great}} {{not to be}} {{attempted}} by so very prudent a gentleman. He was less impulsive in his nature than his sister, and did not open his eyes and talk with watering mouth of the seven thousands of pounds a year; but in his quiet way he had weighed and calculated all the advantages to be gained, had even ascertained at what rate he could insure the lady's life, and had made himself certain that nothing in the deed of Lord Ongar's marriage-settlement entailed any <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> on his widow's second marriage. Then he had gone down, as we know, to Ongar Park, and as he had walked from the lodge {{to the house and}} back again, he had looked around him complacently, and told himself that the place would do very well. For the English character, in spite of the pigheadedness of many Englishmen, he had--as he would have said himself--much admiration, and he thought that the life of a country gentleman, with a nice place of his own--with such a very nice place of his own as was Ongar Park--and so very nice an income, would suit him well in his declining years.|$|E
6000|$|The course {{pursued by}} the Canadian {{authorities}} toward the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States {{it was agreed that}} the inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not included in the limits named in the convention (within 3 miles of parts of the British coast) it has been the custom for many years to give to intruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial Government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishing grounds to the colonial authority known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without notice or warning, in violation of the custom previously prevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up, and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within 3 marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canada into port, to search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> if true answers are not given; and if such a vessel is found [...] "preparing to fish" [...] within 3 marine miles of any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, etc., shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary {{to protect the rights of}} the citizens of the United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> {{administered}} by public administration bodies, and {{their place in}} the existing legal system. Recently, a model of liability based on administrative sanctions has become widespread. Consequently, attempts have been undertaken to modify the principles governing the bearing of responsibility in order to arrive at a simplifi ed and immediate administrative procedure and a respective penalty. It is also expected to ease the workload currently suff ered by the judicial organs of justice. An exemption from the criminal responsibility regime of a given category should be accompanied by trial guarantees similar to those applicable under criminal law. However, in reality, the procedure of sanctioning actions undertaken by administrating bodies is far from perfect and leaves much room for discretionary decisions. Unclear criteria governing decisions on penalties as well as the absence of solutions permitting prescription, combined with a lack of clear guidelines of a procedure {{in the event of a}} concurrence of an administrative as well as a criminal responsibility, may in eff ect lead to a breach of constitutional standards. In this paper the legal nature of administrative <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> is analysed and the main features diff erentiating this form of repression from punishments administered for petty crimes and crimes are discussed. The conclusions reached as a result of the performed analysis constituted the ground upon which an answer to the question whether administrative criminal law is really necessary as a separate branch of law was based. The proposed solutions are centred around the need to ensure cohesion and uniformity in the area of administering and enforcing <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> in administrative proceedings. The formulated conclusions contain de lege ferenda a postulate to tie administrative <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> to a specifi c type of responsibility, and to a model of a procedure that would protect an individual against the arbitrariness of authorities. 371151325 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{study the}} <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> for family-related {{amenities}} {{in the workplace}} (e. g., job interrup-tions, short hours, part-time work, and flexibility during the workday), how women have responded to them, and how the penalties have changed over time.

Self-employment has declined {{in many of the}} high-end professions (e. g., pharmacy, optometry, dentistry, law, medicine, and veterinary medicine) where it was costly in terms of workplace flexibility. The authors conclude that many professions have experienced an increase in workplace flexibility, driven often by exogenous factors (e. g., increased scale of operations and shifts to corporate ownership of business) but also endogenously because of an increased number of women. Workplace flexibility in some positions, notably in the business and financial sectors, has lagged...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of penalty units, fines and other charges were usually prescribed in terms of ordinary money (pounds or, later, dollars).

50|$|The earlier {{history of}} the English law of {{defamation}} is somewhat obscure; civil actions for damages {{seem to have been}} tolerably frequent {{as far back as the}} reign of Edward I (1272-1307).

50|$|The {{thresholds}} {{for access}} {{were also a}} central feature of several submissions. As discussed above, once the Attorney-General declares an agency an enforcement agency, that agency is able to access metadata retained by a service providers. The agency can do so by requesting and authorising service providers to disclose the information. Such authorisations {{can be made in}} relation to retrospective historical data where doing so is ‘reasonably necessary’ for the enforcement of the criminal law, a law imposing a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty,</b> or a law protecting the public revenue. In relation to prospective data, such authorisations could be made where ‘reasonably necessary’ for the investigation of a serious criminal offence. This differs from the process relating to stored communications (content), which can only be accessed by criminal law enforcement agencies through a warrant process.|$|E
50|$|The Act also {{introduces}} the highly contentious ‘journalist information’ warrant scheme under Division 4C. This scheme, requires ASIO and {{other law enforcement}} agencies to obtain a warrant prior to authorising the disclosure of telecommunications data, {{for the purposes of}} identifying the journalist’s confidential source. The Attorney-General or an issuing authority (including ‘eligible persons’ within ASIO and AFP) under s 180L and s 180T, respectively, must consider several factors when deciding whether to issue an information warrant. In particular, they must be satisfied that the warrant is ‘reasonably necessary’ to, enforce the criminal law, locate a person reporting missing to the AFP or State Police, enforce a law that imposes a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> or protects the public revenue and investigate series offences, including offences against the Commonwealth, State or Territory law, punishable by a 3-year imprisonment term. Additionally, the Attorney-General or the issuing authority must not issue a warrant unless they are satisfied that the public interest is issuing the warrant outweighs public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the source. Submissions by the newly created Public Interest Advocate, must also be considered when deciding to issue a warrant.|$|E
