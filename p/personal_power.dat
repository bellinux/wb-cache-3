5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the ship is visiting the planet Ligon II to retrieve a vaccine, crewman Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) is abducted by the leader of the Ligonians. The race abide by a strict code of honor, and their leader seeks to use Yar as a pawn to increase his own <b>personal</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1236, Duke Vykintas led the Samogitian {{forces to}} victory in the Battle of Saule, where the Livonian Order {{suffered}} a catastrophic defeat. It seems that Vykintas did not receive support from Mindaugas. Vykintas' <b>personal</b> <b>power</b> grew. The Livonian Order {{was on the brink}} of collapse and was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights. The combined Orders focused on the conquest of Samogitia, since only this land prevented them from consolidating their territories. The union of these aggressive powers could not have passed without notice in Lithuanian lands, and might have furthered the unification process. In about 1239 Mindaugas took over the weakened Black Ruthenia and appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern it. During the early 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic lands. In 1245, Mindaugas sent his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas, the sons of Dausprungas and Vykintas, to conquer Smolensk, but they were unsuccessful. In 1249, an internal war erupted as Mindaugas sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during {{the first six months of}} his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained <b>personal</b> <b>power</b> of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E

5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council. In August, the Vietnam War continued to escalate following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters. Khánh saw the tense situation {{as an opportunity to}} increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution, which would have augmented his <b>personal</b> <b>power</b> {{at the expense of the}} already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} noble {{democracy}} became more firmly rooted {{during the first}} interregnum, {{after the death of}} Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his <b>personal</b> <b>power,</b> rather than become an executor of szlachta's will. A lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the situation, and the conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to be the right idea to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta.|$|E

50|$|In 68 BC, Huo Guang died. Emperor Xuan and Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan {{made the}} nearly-unprecedent act of {{personally}} attending Huo's wake and built an impressive mausoleum for Huo. After Huo's death, Emperor Xuan assumed far more <b>personal</b> <b>powers</b> {{than he had}} during Huo's lifetime. Empress Huo's brother Huo Yu (霍禹), nephews Huo Yun (霍雲) and Huo Shan (霍山), and brothers-in-law Fan Mingyou (范明友) and Deng Guanghan (鄧廣漢) remained in key posts, however.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Danny Jorgensen, a {{professor}} of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida offered a spiritual explanation for the popularity of fortune-telling.

25|$|The New Thought {{movement}} {{originated in}} the early 19th century, and survives to the current day {{in the form of}} a loosely allied group of religious denominations, authors, philosophers, and individuals who share a set of beliefs concerning metaphysics, positive thinking, the law of attraction, healing, life force, creative visualization, and <b>personal</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|O'Neill {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} to the Pale Lords on 15 November 1599, {{many of whom}} were Roman Catholic, protesting that his campaign was not for <b>personal</b> <b>power</b> but only for the freedom of the Catholic religion. This was unconvincing to them, as before 1593 he had practised as an Anglican, and was not known for having any great interest in religion.|$|E
50|$|Visions {{and dreams}} could inspire designs.

Designs could {{be obtained from the}} warriors who received the visions or from medicine men. Cheyenne men who received visions were allowed to make four shields with the design. Among the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache about 50 possible shield designs existed.|$|R

25|$|Evangelicals {{agree with}} the Protestant {{orthodox}} of theology that Satan is a real, created being given entirely over to evil and that evil is whatever opposes God or is not willed by God.

25|$|Two {{groups of}} {{individuals}} were investigated, those concerned with <b>personal</b> <b>power,</b> achievement, and independence (agentic group) or those concerned with relationships, interdependence, and others (communion group). Agentic types consistently recalled emotional memories {{of events that}} involved issues of agency such as those involving mastery, dominance, and humiliation. In contrast, communal types showed a recollection bias for emotional memories featuring others, often significant others, in acts of love and friendship.|$|E
25|$|While the Five-Year Plans were forging ahead, Stalin was {{establishing}} his <b>personal</b> <b>power.</b> The NKVD {{gathered in}} {{tens of thousands}} of Soviet citizens to face arrest, deportation, or execution. Of the six original members of the 1920 Politburo who survived Lenin, all were purged by Stalin. Old Bolsheviks who had been loyal comrades of Lenin, high officers in the Red Army, and directors of industry were liquidated in the Great Purges. Purges in other Soviet republics also helped centralize control in the USSR.|$|E
50|$|As in {{many other}} {{parliamentary}} democracies, the President is not the nominal chief executive. Rather, executive authority is expressly vested in the Government (cabinet).
