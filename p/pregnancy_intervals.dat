This research analyses these effects using logistic regression in two steps. First, data from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey 2010 are used to study delivery referrals to District hospitals. Second, Kibagabaga District Hospital’s maternity records are used to study the effect of inter-pregnancy intervals on maternal morbidity. The results show that both short and long intervals lead to higher odds of being referred because of pregnancy or delivery complications. Once admitted, short intervals were not associated {{with higher levels of}} maternal morbidity. Long intervals are associated with higher risks of third trimester bleeding, premature rupture of membrane and lower limb edema, while a higher age at conception is associated with lower risks.

The maternal mortality rate is one indicator for the degree of health specially of a woman. Postpartum hemorrhage is bleeding or blood loss of 500 cc or more that occurred after the child is born. The research objective was to analyze the effect of parity, birth weight babies, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and a history of postpartum hemorrhage in the mother after giving birth to the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in Ngudi Waluyo Hospital Wlingi Blitar 2014. This study used a case-control design. The populations in this study are all mothers who gave birth in Ngudi Waluyo Hospital Wlingi Blitar 2014. The sampling technique was simple random sampling.

40|$|The {{perinatal}} mortality rate for Asian babies born in Bradford during the five years 1974 - 8 was persistently higher than for babies born to United Kingdom mothers. A comparative review of 18 924 British indigenous and 6443 Asian immigrant maternity patients delivered in Bradford from 1974 - 8 demonstrated several {{differences between the two}} ethnic groups. Factors operating in favour of Asian women were fewer teenage mothers, lower rates of illegitimacy, and fewer smokers. On the other hand, a greater number of factors presented increased risks to Asian patients-more women aged over 35, lower social class, higher parity, shorter <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals,</b> previous perinatal deaths, shorter duration of antenatal care, anaemia, shorter gestations, more babies born without professional help, and more low-birthweight babies.

40|$|In 2005, a WHO {{consultation}} meeting on <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> recommended a minimum interval of 6 {{months after a}} pregnancy disruption and an interval of two years after a live birth before attempting another pregnancy. Since then, studies have found contradictory evidence {{on the effect of}} shorter intervals after a pregnancy disruption. A binary regression analysis on 21532 last pregnancy outcomes from the 2000, 2005, and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys was done to assess the combined effects of the preceding pregnancy outcome and the interpregnancy intervals (IPIs) on fetal mortality in Rwanda. Risks of pregnancy loss are higher for primigravida and for mothers who lost the previous pregnancy and conceived again within 24 months. After a live birth, interpregnancy intervals less than two years do not increase the risk of a pregnancy loss. This study also confirms higher risks of fetal death when IPIs are beyond 5 years. An IPI of longer than 12 months after a fetal death is recommended in Rwanda. Particular attention needs to be directed to postpregnancy abortion care and family planning programs geared to spacing pregnancies should also include spacing after a fetal death...|$|E
30|$|In {{evaluating}} children’s enrollment {{opportunities and}} limited family resources, parents choose an optimal child-rearing strategy {{to ensure that}} at least one of their children will receive higher education so as to promote the socioeconomic status of the whole family and the parents’ quality of life in old age. The parents in this study were born between 1933 and 1964, their children were born between 1956 and 1984, and these younger adults received an education between 1970 and 1990. In the childbearing period of these mothers, the birth planning policies were not strictly implemented. Only part of the social upbringing fees were paid, and many rural areas still had a relatively high fertility rate. 1 Further, by the time these children reached school age, educational investment in rural areas was still determined by the family and also restricted by household income (Zeng 1998). Since China did not have an education system fully sponsored by the state, and it was not until 2001 that the elementary education received financial support from county governments (Qiao et al. 2005), education expenditures for most country governments came from “san tiwu tong. 2 ” Villages in poor areas required that families share more of the cost of education (Hannum 2003). The resources children received from their families were limited both by the family’s total resources and the number of children. Family resources directly influence children’s educational attainment because families must have sufficient income to pay children’s tuition fees. If the number of siblings is great, the time between <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> is short, and resources are diluted, then children are unlikely to receive high levels of education (Blake 1981; Downey 1995).|$|E
40|$|Background: Anemia in {{pregnancy}} {{is a serious}} condition, contributing to maternal mortality, morbidity and fetal morbidity and its prevalence varies between 35 - 100 % in developing countries. This investigation is conducted to survey the correlation of maternal factors and the changes in hemoglobin in pregnant women. Method: In this study, 108 healthy pregnant women with gestational age of 10 to 14 weeks, chosen by cluster random sampling were included. The women were followed in three visits: {{at the end of}} the first, second and third trimester. In addition, correlation of Hb concentration with maternal factors including BMI, age parity, hyperemesis, gestational age, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and weight gain was investigated. Results: There was no significant correlation between BMI, parity, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> severe nausea and vomiting and also maternal age with hemoglobin level during pregnancy. Moreover, Multiple regression models showed that adequate maternal weight gain (P< 0. 009) and high hemoglobin (p< 0. 0001) in the first trimester were positive predictors and late iron supplementation was negative predictor of hemoglobin {{in pregnancy}} (P< 0. 006).

40|$|AbstractEvidence is {{increasing}} of {{positive effects of}} feeding fats during transition on fertility and the adaptation to lactation. This study used meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of including fats in the transition diet on the risk of pregnancy to service (proportion pregnant) and calving to <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. We explored the effect of fats and diet composition on fertility using meta-regression methods. Relatively few highly controlled studies are available providing detailed descriptions of the diets used that examined interactions between fat nutrition and reproductive outcomes. Only 17 studies containing 26 comparisons were suitable for inclusion in statistical evaluations. Reproductive variables evaluated were risk of pregnancy (proportion pregnant), primarily to first service, and calving to <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> Production variables examined were milk yield, milk composition, and body weight. The sources of heterogeneity in these studies were also explored. A 27 % overall increase in pregnancy to service was observed (relative risk= 1. 27; 95 % confidence interval Knapp Hartung 1. 09 to 1. 45), and results were relatively consistent (I 2 = 19. 9 %). A strong indication of a reduction in calving to <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> was also identified, which was consistent across studies (I 2 = 0. 0 %), supporting a conclusion that, overall, the inclusion of fats does improve fertility. Further exploration of the factors contributing to proportion pregnant using bivariate meta-regression identified variables that reflected changes in diet composition or animal response resulting from inclusion of the fat interventions in the experimental diets fed. Increased fermentable neutral detergent fiber and soluble fiber intakes increased the proportion pregnant, whereas increased milk yield of the treatment group decreased this measure. Unexpectedly, the estimated energy costs of urea production also had a positive association with proportion pregnant. The limited number of suitable studies for the analysis highlights {{the need for more}} work to improve understanding of the critical nutritional factors affecting fertility. These factors include specific fatty acids in dietary interventions that contribute to increasing fertility of cows in dairy production systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{evidence}} that traumatic birth experiences are associated with psychological impairments. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms and its obstetric and perinatal risk factors among a sample of Iranian women. Methods This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Bushehr, Iran during a 3 -months period from July to September 2009. Data were collected from all women attending eleven healthcare centers for postnatal care 6 to 8 weeks after childbirth. Those who had a traumatic delivery were identified and entered into the study. In order to assess childbirth-related post-traumatic stress, the Post-traumatic Symptom Scale-Interview (PSS-I) was administered. Data on demographic, obstetric and perinatal characteristics also were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association between childbirth-related post-traumatic stress and demographic and obstetric and perinatal variables. Results In all, 400 women were initially evaluated. Of these, 218 women (54. 5 %) had a traumatic delivery and overall, 80 women (20 %) {{were found to be}} suffering from post-partum post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that post-partum PTSD was associated with educational level, gestational age at delivery, number of prenatal care visits, pregnancy complications, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals,</b> labor duration, and mode of delivery. Conclusions The findings indicated that the prevalence of traumatic birth experiences and post-partum PTSD were relatively high among Iranian women. The findings also indicated that obstetric and perinatal variables were independently the most significant contributing factors to women’s post-partum PTSD. It seems that a better perinatal care and supportive childbirth might help to reduce the burden of post-partum PTSD among this population. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: High {{fertility}} {{levels are}} of major concern to planners {{and policy makers}} in most countries in the developing world. In Saudi Arabia, the rate of population growth is the third highest of {{the countries of the}} Eastern Mediterranean Region. Objectives: This study aimed at identifying determinants of birth spacing and attitudes toward family planning among Saudi women. Methods: A cross sectional survey of all women who have been married before, aged 15 - 49 years attending Al Hada armed forces hospital (primary health care and antenatal care clinics), was conducted between 1 st February 2005 and 31 st January 2006. Data was collected on socio-demographic, biological characteristics, beliefs, attitudes, and utilization of family planning services, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> and medical history Results: For the 786 women included in the study, the mean duration of interbirth interval was 2. 38 ± 1. 24 years. The multivariate Cox regression revealed that a woman′s education, work status, husband′s work status, a woman′s history of chronic diseases, and husband′s encouragement of interbirth spacing were the only significant predictors of longer interbirth intervals. Shorter interbirth intervals were independently predicted by lower family income, and presence of female offspring only or equal number of male and female offspring as opposed to presence of more males. The great majority of participating women (98 %) had a positive opinion of the effect of birth spacing on the family. Conclusion: This study showed that certain factors were significant predictors of interbirth spacing for the Saudi women. This should lead to the encouragement of longer intervals between births. However, further studies are needed to ascertain a cause-effect association. ...|$|E
40|$|Endometrial cancer (EC) is {{a complex}} disease {{involving}} multiple gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. TGF-β signaling plays pivotal roles in EC development. This study aimed to investigate whether the genetic polymorphisms of TGF-β signaling related genes TGFB 1, TGFBR 1, SNAI 1 and TWIST 1 contribute to EC susceptibility. Using the TaqMan Genotyping Assay, 19 tagging-SNPs of these four genes were genotyped in 516 EC cases and 707 controls among Chinese Han women. Logistic regression (LR) showed that the genetic variants of TGFB 1 rs 1800469, TGFBR 1 rs 6478974 and rs 10733710, TWIST 1 rs 4721745 were associated with decreased EC risk, and these four loci showed a dose-dependent effect (Ptrend < 0. 0001). Classification and regression tree (CART) demonstrated that women carrying both the genotypes of TGFBR 1 rs 6478974 TT and rs 10512263 TC/CC had the highest risk of EC (aOR = 7. 86, 95 % CI = 3. 42 - 18. 07, P< 0. 0001). Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) revealed that TGFB 1 rs 1800469 plus TGFBR 1 rs 6478974 was the best interactional model to detect EC risk. LR, CART and MDR all revealed that TGFBR 1 rs 6478974 {{was the most important}} protective locus for EC. In haplotype association study, TGFBR 1 haplotype CACGA carrier showed the lowest EC risk among women with longer menarche-first full term <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> (˃ 11 years) and BMI˂ 24 (aOR = 0. 39, 95 % CI = 0. 17 - 0. 90, P = 0. 0275).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the fact sheet is to {{highlight}} the demographic characteristics of women with Medicaid reimbursed births by interpregnancy interval. We will also explore prenatal care initiation and infant birth outcomes by interpregnancy interval. Background Medicaid is a state/federal program that provides health insurance for certain groups of low-income people, including pregnant women. Iowa Medicaid {{is administered by the}} Iowa Department of Human Services through Iowa Medicaid Enterprise. In Iowa, pregnant women may be eligible for Medicaid if their household income is below 300 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2012, the labor and delivery costs for 40 percent of Iowa resident births were reimbursed by Medicaid (40. 3 %; n= 15, 598 of 38, 686 births). Optimal <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> The interpregnancy interval is defined as the amount of time between pregnancies. It is calculated between the date the last pregnancy ended and the date of the woman’s last menstrual period (1). Though there is no official recommendation for the optimal interpregnancy period, experts suggest 18 to 24 months as the ideal time period between pregnancies (2, 3, 4). In recent years, researchers have reported that interpregnancy intervals of less than 18 months can put mothers at risk for anemia (5). Women with short interval pregnancies also are more likely to initiate prenatal care later than women with longer intervals between their pregnancies (6). Women who become pregnant within 18 months after a previous birth are at increased risk for having a low birth weight infant or a preterm birth (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9). In later life, these children are at increased risk for exposure to maltreatment and lower cognitive functioning (10, 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postpartum family {{planning}} (PPFP) is the initiation {{and use of}} contraceptives {{during the first year}} after delivery. The first year after delivery is a complex period, during which a woman has to care for her newborn child as well as cope with a series of emotional, physical and physiological changes- which affect her fertility return. In spite of these specific needs, little attention is paid to postpartum contraception. Most of the postpartum mothers are not aware of the factors associated with fertility return which increases exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy resulting in short inter <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals.</b> Aim: To know the postpartum contraceptive use and to study their menstrual pattern and sexual behavior among the first time mothers during the postpartum period. Methods: The study population was 500 which comprised of all the first time mothers in their first year of delivery attending Maternal and Child Health (MCH) or immunization clinic. A purposive sample of 500 postpartum mothers was selected for the study, such that 125 postpartum mothers were in 0 - 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 9 and 10 - 12 months of postpartum period each. The data was collected by interview method using predesigned, pretested,semi-structured questionnaire. Results were expressed in the form of proportions.

40|$|Impact of {{reproductive}} processes upon female health has yielded conflicting results; particularly {{in relation to}} the role of reproduction-associated stress. We used the viviparous tsetse fly to determine if lactation, birth and involution lead to damage from oxidative stress (OS) that impairs subsequent reproductive cycles. Tsetse females carry an intrauterine larva to full term at each pregnancy cycle, and lactate to nourish them with milk secretions produced by the accessory gland ( = milk gland) organ. Unlike most K-strategists, tsetse females lack an apparent period {{of reproductive}} senescence allowing the production of 8 - 10 progeny over their entire life span. In a lactating female, over 47 % of the maternal transcriptome is associated with the generation of milk proteins. The resulting single larval offspring weighs as much as the mother at birth. In studying this process we noted an increase in specific antioxidant enzyme (AOE) transcripts and enzymatic activity at critical times during lactation, birth and involution in the milk gland/fat body organ and the uterus. Suppression of superoxide dismutase (sod) decreased fecundity in subsequent reproductive cycles in young mothers and nearly abolished fecundity in geriatric females. Loss of fecundity was in part due to the inability of the mother to produce adequate milk to support larval growth. Longevity was also impaired after sod knockdown. Generation of OS in virgin females through exogenous treatment with hydrogen peroxide at times corresponding to <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> reduced survival, which was exacerbated by sod knockdown. AOE expression may prevent oxidative damage associated with the generation of nutrients by the milk gland, parturition and milk gland breakdown. Our results indicate that prevention of OS is essential for females to meet the growing nutritional demands of juveniles during pregnancy and to repair the damage that occurs at birth. This process is particularly important for females to remain fecund during the latter portion of their lifetime...|$|E

In case group, there were a total of 83 women diagnosed with EP, while in the control group; there was a total of 340 women who gave birth. The basic recorded information included surgical, gynecological, obstetrics, sexual, contraceptive, and infectious histories; demographic characteristics; smoking habits; fertility markers; as well as reproductive outcome after EP. The association between EP and the factors studied was analyzed by logistic regression. Results: The findings reveal that the following factors were associated with increased risk of EP, including: Maternal age (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 11, confidence interval [CI] [1. 06 - 1. 16], P < 0. 0001), spouse′s cigarette smoking (OR = 1. 73, CI [1. 05 - 2. 85], P = 0. 02), gravidity (OR = 1. 50, CI [1. 25 - 1. 80], P < 0. 0001), prior spontaneous abortions (OR = 1. 93, CI [1. 11 - 3. 36], P = 0. 01), history of EP (OR = 17. 16, CI [1. 89 - 155. 67], P = 0. 01), tubal blockage (OR = 10. 85, CI [2. 02 - 58. 08], P = 0. 01), use of intrauterine device (IUD) (OR = 4. 39, CI [1. 78 - 10. 81], P = 0. 001), tubal damage (OR = 2. 704, CI [1. 26 - 5. 78], P = 0. 01), first <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (OR = 1. 01, CI [1. 00 - 1. 02], P < 0. 0001) and history of infertility (OR = 6. 13, CI [2. 70 - 13. 93], P < 0. 0001).

Lactating Holstein cows (n= 104, 3 - 5 years old, 450 - 500 kg BW, 27 ± 3 kg/day average milk yield) were enrolled in the study 26 - 41 days postpartum. Fifty of them were taken as the control group and 54 of them were the treated experimental group. The control group was not treated and the cows in estrus were inseminated. In the treated group the cows were injected with two PGF 2 α for presynchronization twice at every 14 days. Fourteen days after the second PGF 2 α, ovsynch protocol was initiated (GnRH, day 0; PGF 2 α, day 7; GnRH, day 9) and cows were inseminated 12 - 16 hours after second GnRH injection. Following AI, cows returning to estrus were inseminated at detected heat. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasonography at 33 - 38 days after AI. Calving to first AI (days), calving to pregnancy (day), the number of AI per <b>pregnancy,</b> calving <b>interval</b> (days) for control cows were 96. 08 ± 8. 20, 147. 58 ± 9. 95, 2. 19 ± 0. 20 and 430. 50 ± 10. 90 and for the treated group 70. 13 ± 1. 13, 101. 76 ± 5. 70, 1. 85 ± 0. 12 and 386. 80 ± 5. 70, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the mathematical development and computerization of a stochastic model of the pospartum period in human populations. Three interlocking models, based on Semi-Markov processes and covering the period from a live birth to subsequent pregnancy, provide a framework for data analysis and simulation of probability distributions of waiting times between live birth and pregnancy. ^ First, a model is developed concerning the time between a live birth and resumption of ovulation. Factors taken into account which influence resumption of ovulation include levels of infant nursing and levels of infant mortality. A second model pertains to the period between acceptance of contraception and subsequent pregnancy. Here, the possibility of multiple contraceptive methods (and switching among them) as well as contraceptive sterilization and marital dissolution are taken into account as determinants of pregnancy. A third model links the first two, namely time to resumption of ovulation and time from initiation of contraception to subsequent pregnancy. This model, termed the contraceptive strategy model, provides probability distributions of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> under various policies governing the adoption of contraception postpartum. ^ Each of the three models is developed as a discrete time Semi-Markov process. Algorithms and a listing of APL programs for implementation of the models is also provided. ^ Performance of the three models is illustrated by the use of primary and secondary data sources. Applications of the model for time to resumption for ovulation utilize Chilean and Senegalese secondary data. The postpartum strategy model is supported by secondary data from Bangladesh and Senegal. Finally, the time from initiation of contraception to subsequent pregnancy is modeled on the basis of United States data from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is a high}} unmet {{need for}} {{limiting}} and spacing child births during the postpartum period. Given the consequences of closely spaced births, {{and the benefits of}} longer <b>pregnancy</b> <b>intervals,</b> targeted activities are needed to reach this population of postpartum women. Our objective was to establish the determinants of contraceptive uptake among postpartum women in a county referral hospital in rural Kenya. Methods Sample was taken based on a mixed method approach that included both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. Postpartum women who had brought their children for the second dose of measles vaccine between 18 and 24  months were sampled Participants were interviewed using structured questionnaires, data was collected about their socio-demographic characteristics, fertility, knowledge, use, and access to contraceptives. Chi square tests were used to determine the relationship between uptake of postpartum family planning and: socio demographic characteristics, contraceptive knowledge, use access and fertility. Qualitative data collection included focus group discussions (FDGs) with mothers and in-depth interviews with service providers Information was obtained from mothers’ regarding their perceptions on family planning methods, use, availability, access and barriers to uptake and key informants’ views on family planning counseling practices and barriers to uptake of family planning Results More than three quarters (86. 3 %) of women used contraceptives within 1  year of delivery, with government facilities being the most common source. There was a significant association (p ≤  0. 05) between uptake of postpartum family planning and lower age, being married, higher education level, being employed and getting contraceptives at a health facility. One third of women expressing no intention of having additional children were not on contraceptives. In focus group discussions women perceived that the quality of services offered at the public facilities was relatively good because they felt that they were adequately counseled, as opposed to local chemist shops where they perceived the staff was not experienced. Conclusion Contraceptive uptake was high among postpartum women, who desired to procure contraceptives at health facilities. However, there was unmet need for contraceptives among women who desired no more children. Government health facility stock outs represent a missed opportunity to get family planning methods, especially long acting reversible contraceptives, to postpartum women...|$|E

In the study demographic characteristics of mothers of low birth weight babies were observed. These characteristics were residential area, education level, socio-economic status, age of mothers at the time of birth and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> These all mentioned characteristics were taken as independent variables against the dependent variable, low birth weight of infants. A sample size of 220 mothers who gave birth to a low weight baby was surveyed through purposive sampling technique in government hospitals of District Jhang and its Tehsils. Data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS. One way analysis of variance with mean plots was used to find out the mean differences between maternal demographic characteristics and low birth weight of babies. Rural women, comparatively aged women, early married women and low educated women were found to have extremely low birth weight babies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Parental {{smoking and}} prone sleep {{positioning}} are recognized causal features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies {{the relationship between}} prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping position for infants. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized the Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from 1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry. Multivariable logistic regression was {{used to analyze the}} relationship between outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as maternal marital status, ethnicity, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> age, education, and alcohol use.

40|$|Background. Risk {{factors for}} pregnancies being {{complicated}} by {{the birth of a}} small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant were analysed in a socio-economically disadvantaged area, with separate analysis for population-based and customized-based birth weight percentiles. Methods. A retrospective case-controlled study of all singleton pregnancies resulting in the birth of an infant with a birth weight 2 (95 % CI not crossing 1), including unemployment, smoking, maternal age > 34 years, not being healthy and preeclampsia, while different paternity, age 25 - 34 compared to age < 25 were also found to be significant risk factors. Higher systolic blood pressure was found to convey significant protection. Conclusion. When studying risk factors for pregnancies {{complicated by the}} birth of an SGA infant, both population-derived and customized growth centiles should be utilized. This study confirms the importance of smoking as a major risk factor, our data also show major protection being conveyed by having a regular job and being generally healthy. <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> did not have any relationship with the birth of SGA infants, while paternity change was identified as a clear risk factor.
