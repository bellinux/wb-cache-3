The effects of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> concentrations of 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg L- 1 on seedling growth parameters were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. After the greenhouse experiment, the seedlings were transplanted to the field. During the field experiment, {{the number of days}} to flowering, plant height, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight and yield were evaluated. Both experiments were carried out in a completely randomized design with four replicates. All <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> concentrations significantly reduced shoot height and internode length, when compared to the control. The concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 mg L- 1 <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> reduced shoot height by 27, 32, and 38 %, respectively. <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> treatments (except the one with 50 mg L- 1) enhanced relative chlorophyll content of leaves in comparison to the control. There were no delays in flowering and no significant differences in number of fruits per plant among treatments with <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium.</b> The concentrations of 100 and 150 mg L- 1 <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> significantly reduced yield per plant and total fruit yield, whereas the concentration of 50 mg L- 1 did not cause any change in yield compared to the control.

40|$|Managing turf {{for high}} {{aesthetic}} value is costly. Such management usually involves mowing, disease prevention, insect control, and weed control. Mowing {{is the most}} expensive practice on golf courses and annual bluegrass (Poa annua L) is the most challenging weed problem in professional turf. The plant growth regulators trinexapac-ethyl and paclobutrazol are commonly used in VA for these two costly and challenging jobs. <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> (PC) is an experimental chemical that inhibits the same enzyme (3 ß-hydroxyalase) as trinexapac-ethyl and may selectively suppress annual bluegrass. Experiments were conducted at the Virginia Tech Turfgrass Research Center and Glade Road Research Facility to determine the PC rate required to reduce clipping biomass of four turfgrass species as effectively as trinexapac-ethyl. <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> reduced clipping biomass of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratenis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) equivalent to trinexapac-ethyl at 0. 70, 0. 22, 0. 60, and 0. 27 kg a. i. ha- 1, respectively. Further experiments conducted at three locations across Virginia determined that PC was comparable to paclobutrazol for annual bluegrass suppression. Since turfgrass respons...|$|E

Neste sentido, o controle do desenvolvimento vegetativo e o aumento da frutifica????o s??o necess??rios no {{manejo de}} tais esp??cies, podendo ser obtidos pelo uso de fitorreguladores. Objetivou-se com este estudo avaliar o controle do desenvolvimento vegetativo e o aumento da frutifica????o de macieiras e de pereiras nas condi????es clim??ticas do Sul do Brasil em resposta ao uso de fitorreguladores. Para tanto, foram realizados tr??s experimentos. No primeiro experimento, foram avaliadas diferentes concentra????es de proexadione c??lcio em macieiras Imperial Gala e Fuji Suprema, enxertadas no porta-enxerto Marubakaido com interenxerto de M 9, em pomar localizado em Fraiburgo/SC. Os tratamentos (0; 165; 330; 495; 660; e 990 g ha- 1 de proexadione c??lcio) foram aplicados durante o per??odo de desenvolvimento vegetativo nos ciclos 2008 / 2009 e 2009 / 2010. As concentra????es respectivas a cada tratamento foram aplicadas parceladamente em tr??s momentos. A primeira aplica????o foi realizada quando as brota????es do tratamento testemunha apresentavam crescimento de 10 cm. A segunda e a terceira aplica????o foram realizadas aos 30 e 60 dias ap??s a primeira aplica????o, respectivamente. O proexadione c??lcio foi eficiente no controle do desenvolvimento vegetativo de macieiras Imperial Gala e Fuji Suprema, reduzindo a massa total e a massa m??dia de ramos, assim como o comprimento m??dio dos ramos, nas condi????es clim??ticas do Sul do Brasil. O uso de proexadione c??lcio em concentra????es variando de 165 a 330 g ha- 1 aumentou a produ????o de ma????s Imperial Gala, por??m altas concentra????es deste fitorregulador tendem a reduzir a produ????o de frutos por planta, sobretudo em macieiras Fuji Suprema. A redu????o do desenvolvimento vegetativo pelo uso do proexadione c??lcio contribuiu 6 para o aumento dos teores de c??lcio em ma????s Fuji Suprema. O segundo experimento foi realizado no munic??pio de Pelotas/RS, utilizando pereiras Hosui enxertadas no porta-enxerto Pyrus calleryana. Foram avaliadas diferentes concentra????es de proexadione c??lcio (0; 275; 550; e 825 g ha- 1), sendo metade da concentra????o respectiva a cada tratamento aplicada quando as brota????es apresentavam entre 5 a 10 cm de comprimento, e o restante aplicado 30 dias ap??s a primeira aplica????o. O uso de proexadione c??lcio foi efetivo no controle do desenvolvimento vegetativo de pereiras Hosui, minimizando a necessidade de poda hibernal pela redu????o da massa total e do n??mero de ramos podados. O controle do desenvolvimento vegetativo pelo uso de proexadione c??lcio determinou aumento da capacidade produtiva de pereiras Hosui, sobretudo em concentra????es de 450 a 750 g ha- 1. O objetivo do terceiro experimento foi avaliar a efetividade do thidiazuron, ??cido giber??lico, proexadione c??lcio e a combina????o destas subst??ncias no aumento da frutifica????o de pereiras asi??ticas Shinseiki. Os seguintes tratamentos foram aplicados na plena flora????o: 1. testemunha (sem aplica????o); 2. thidiazuron (TDZ) 20 mg L- 1; 3. ??cido giber??lico (AG) 20 mg L- 1; 4. proexadione c??lcio (PCa) 600 mg L- 1; 5. PCa 600 mg L- 1 + TDZ 20 mg L- 1; 6. PCa 600 mg L- 1 + AG 20 mg L- 1; e 7. AG 20 mg L- 1 + TDZ 20 mg L- 1. A aplica????o de thidiazuron 20 mg L- 1, ??cido giber??lico 20 mg L- 1 e a combina????o destas subst??ncias durante a plena flora????o aumentaram significativamente a frutifica????o e a produ????o de pereiras Shinseiki. O proexadione c??lcio, quando aplicado na flora????o isoladamente ou em combina????o ao thidiazuron e ao ??cido giber??lico, n??o se mostrou efetivo no aumento da frutifica????o e na produ????o de frutos. A utiliza????o dos fitorreguladores na flora????o diminuiu o n??mero m??dio de sementes por fruto. The proper balance between vegetative growth and frutification in pome fruit {{species such as}} apple and pear, {{it is essential to}} increase production efficiency and improving fruit quality. In this sense, control of vegetative growth and frutification increase are needed in the management of these species, which may be obtained by use of growth regulators. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the control of vegetative growth and frutification increase of apple and pear orchards in the Southern Brazil climatic conditions in response to the use of growth regulators. For this, three experiments were carried out in this research. In the first experiment, different concentrations of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> were evaluated in 'Imperial Gala' and 'Fuji Suprema' apple trees, grafted on Marubakaido rootstock with M 9 interstock, in an orchard located in Fraiburgo/SC. The treatments (0, 165, 330, 495, 660, and 990 g ha- 1 <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium)</b> were applied during the vegetative growth in 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 growing seasons. The concentrations corresponding to each treatment were applied split into three parts. The first application was done when the shoots of the control treatment showed growth of 10 cm. The second and third applications were made at 30 and 60 days after the first application, respectively. The <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> was effective in controlling vegetative growth of apple trees 'Imperial Gala' and 'Fuji Suprema', reducing the total weight and average weight of pruned shoots, as well as the average shoot length, in the Southern Brazil climatic conditions. The use of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> at concentrations ranging from 165 to 330 g ha- 1 increased the fruit production of 'Imperial Gala' apples, but high concentrations of this growth regulator tends to reduce the fruit production, especially in 'Fuji Suprema' apples. The reduction of vegetative growth by the use of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> contributed to increase calcium content in fruits of 'Fuji Suprema'. The second experiment was carried out in Pelotas/RS, using 'Hosui' pears grafted on Pyrus calleryana rootstock. Different 8 concentrations of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> were evaluated (0, 275, 550, and 825 g ha- 1), being half the concentration corresponding to each treatment applied when the shoots had between 5 to 10 cm in length, and the remainder applied 30 days after the first application. The use of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> was effective in controlling the vegetative growth of 'Hosui' pears, decreasing the need for winter pruning by reducing the total weight and the number of shoots pruned. The control of vegetative growth by use of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> determined increase the productive capacity of 'Hosui pears, especially at concentrations ranging from 450 to 750 g ha- 1. The aim of the third experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of thidiazuron, gibberellic acid, <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> and combination of these substances on frutification increase of 'Shinseiki' asian pears. The following treatments were applied at full bloom: 1. control (no application); 2. thidiazuron (TDZ) 20 mg L- 1; 3. gibberellic acid (GA) 20 mg L- 1; 4. <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> (PCa) 600 mg L- 1; 5. PCa 600 mg L- 1 + TDZ 20 mg L- 1; 6. PCa 600 mg L- 1 + AG 20 mg L- 1; e 7. AG 20 mg L- 1 + TDZ 20 mg L- 1. The application thidiazuron at 20 mg L- 1, gibberellic acid at 20 mg L- 1 and the combination of these substances during the full bloom increased significantly the frutification and the fruit production of 'Shinseiki' pears. The <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium,</b> when sprayed at flowering alone or in combination to thidiazuron and gibberellic acid, was not effective to increase the fruit set and fruit production. The use of growth regulators on flowering decreased the number of seeds per fruit...|$|E
40|$|Chickpea {{production}} in the short growing season of the Canadian Prairies is still a challenging task due to excessive and continuous vegetative growth which often results in severe yield and quality reduction. This study {{examined the effects of}} three plant growth retardants (PGR), Chlormequat Chloride (CCC), <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>Calcium</b> and Trinexapac Ethyl applied during flowering stage on vegetative growth, seed quality, yield and crop maturity of the Kabuli chickpea cultivar CDC Frontier. Field experiments were conducted at Brooks and Bow Island in southern Alberta in the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Four concentrations of each PGR were applied at 10, 20 and 30 days after flowering (DAF) stages. During the 2010 growing season the crop experienced above average moist and cooler temperature conditions. In contrast, later half of the 2011 growing season was above average dry and hot. None of the three PGR tested in this study had a significant effect on plant height at 30 days after treatments or on above ground biomass plant- 1 at harvest. Application of PGR had no significant effects on the number of seeds m- 2, except at the Brooks rain-fed site in 2011 where the PGR treatment applied at 10 and 20 DAF increased the number of seeds m- 2 at harvest. An increase of 1000 -seed weight of marketable seeds was obtained with <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>Calcium</b> and Trinexapac Ethyl applications at Bow Island, but the effects were not consistent across sites and years. Results suggested that the effect of PGR on 1000 -seed weight of marketable seeds mainly depended upon the growing environment and the type of PGR. In general, PGR applications reduced the total and marketable seed yields. Application of <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>Calcium</b> and Trinexapac Ethyl at the Bow Island site delayed crop maturity in 2011. In contrast, the application of CCC at 6000 mg L- 1 at 20 DAF accelerated crop maturity at the Brooks irrigated site in 2011. In addition to this main study, the potential effects of Pyraclostrobin and Prothioconazole fungicides on the activities of the three PGR were compared by a separate experiment conducted at the Brooks irrigated site in 2011. The results of that study revealed that {{there were no significant differences}} in the effects of PGR on chickpea vegetative growth, seed yield parameters and maturity when they were applied as a mixture with either Pyraclostrobin or Prothioconazole fungicide. In summary, results revealed that PGR applied during flowering stage were not effective on controlling vegetative growth of chickpea and did not improve seed yield and crop maturity. Their effects on yield-related traits were highly inconsistent. Thus, it can be concluded that the application of PGR is not a reliable agronomic option to handle the production issues associated with continues vegetative growth at the late reproductive stage of the chickpea cultivar CDC Frontier under the western Canadian growing conditions...|$|E

Subsequent applications during the summer of this material did not result in a quality class increase for alfalfa hay production. Treatments of growth enhancement chemistries did result in less tonnage, however, data indicate that this reduction may be due to nutritional needs of alfalfa not being supplied during periods of increased growth.

Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate vegetative growth, production, and fruit quality of ‘Smith’ pear trees in response to the use of different rates of P-Ca in the climatic conditions of southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted during the 2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015 seasons, in a 6 -year-old ‘Smith’ pear orchard, trained to a central-leader system, with spacing of 1. 5 × 4. 8 m, grafted onto Pyrus calleryana Decne. Different P-Ca rates were applied (100, 200, 300, and 400 mg∙L– 1) in different stages: first, in early spring for all treatments, and the others when shoot growth resumed (GR), but only for some treatments. Variables for vegetative growth, yield components and fruit quality at harvest and post-harvest were evaluated. The use of P-Ca was effective to control vegetative growth in both seasons, at different rates. Yield components were not affected by P-Ca applications in 2013 / 2014, except return bloom and return yield. In 2014 / 2015 season, P-Ca applications positively affected yield components, except average fruit weight and return bloom. P-Ca applications did not alter the qualitative attributes of the fruits of ‘Smith’ pear trees at harvest and after a period of cold storage. These results implicate P-Ca as a potential tool to manage vigor of ‘Smith’ pear trees in climatic conditions of southern Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The wine {{industry}} in southern Brazil {{is affected by}} late frosts that cause losses in earlier varieties such as ?Chardonnay? and ?Pinot Gris?. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a new form of application of growth regulators to delay budding of 'Chardonnay' and 'Pinot Gris'. The experiment was conducted in a commercial vineyard in Vacaria, RS, (28 ° 32 ' 11 ? S and 50 ° 50 ' 04 ? W and 972 m). The branches were pre-pruned with four buds, for the application of the products. The treatments were applied to the winter bud with concentrations (mg L- 1) : naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 (sprayed) and abscisic acid sprayed 500, in paste form Splat®: 1 g applied the paste containing NAA: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> 75, 125, 250, 500, Trinexapac-ethyl: 200, 300, 400, 600 and untreated control. The stage of budswell and green tip was evaluated at 7 and 14 days after application. 'Pinot Gris' at 7 days delayed its phenology 14 - 25 % in all doses of NAA with a decreasing linear trend. For application in paste form Splat® (Specialized Pheromone & Lure Application Technology) we observed different behavior for growth regulators applied at late phenological stages in different concentrations. NAA (500 and 1000), Prohexadione-calcium (125 and 500) and Trinexapac-ethyl (200 and 300) in doses mg L- 1 can be applied with Splat® to delay budding of ?Chardonnay? and ?Pinot Gris? and reduce the risks of damage in the budding by late frosts up to 7 and 10. 5 days, respectively compared to control.

Three trials were performed in the 2010 - 2011 season on mature ‘Lapins’ and ‘Sweetheart’ sweet cherry trees in the Angol area (37 ° 48 ’ 50 ”S, 72 ° 37 ’ 36 ”W). The effects of <b>prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> (P-Ca) on shoot growth, leaf area, yield, fruit quality and flower differentiation were assessed. Two rates were evaluated (150 mg L- 1 and 250 mg L- 1), which were sprayed when shoots were 15 cm long and 15 days later or after harvest. The P-Ca treatment reduced the elongation of terminal shoot in both cultivars, which was due to reducing both length and number of internodes, resulting in a reduction in total leaf area. This led to better light penetration and distribution in tree canopies. Applications of P-Ca to shoots 13 to 15 cm in length controlled shoot growth adequately, while the effect was excessive when the spray was repeated after 15 days. No additional effect was detected when the second application was applied after harvest. P-Ca treatments increased the number and size of reproductive buds {{and the number of}} floral primordia per bud. The development of floral structures in the buds was more advanced compared to the control. Regarding fruit quality, soluble solids concentration and fruit size there were no significant effect from P-Ca application, while the fruit firmness increased.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of manual cluster thinning (CT) and the application of the growth regulator <b>Prohexadione</b> <b>calcium</b> (ProCa) on the phenolic composition and the sensory profile of Tempranillo and Grenache wines produced from treated vines in La Rioja (Spain). ProCa was applied at preblooming and CT was carried out at veraison in two consecutive years. Different physicochemical parameters and analyses of phenolic compounds were carried out in control, CT and ProCa grapes and wines and wine sensory was performed. Thinning treatments decreased crop yield, besides ProCa application reduced berry size, and berry weight. Color and phenolic composition of Grenache and Tempranillo wines in general were affected by thinning treatments, with an increase in anthocyanin, flavanol and flavonol concentrations. In sensory analysis, wines obtained from thinned vines presented higher values for several aromatic (e. g., white and yellow fruits, fresh flowers) and taste attributes (i. e., astringency, bitternes, persistence). CT and ProCa treatments resulted in an improvement in wine quality. In general, similar results in phenolic composition, sensory properties and quality of wines were obtained by manual and chemical cluster thinning. ProCa as a growth regulator may be an option for a quality vitiviniculture. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
