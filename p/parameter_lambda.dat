50|$|The {{distribution}} of failure times is over-laid with a curve representing an exponential distribution. For this example, the exponential distribution approximates the {{distribution of}} failure times. The exponential curve is a theoretical distribution fitted to the actual failure times. This particular exponential curve is specified by the <b>parameter</b> <b>lambda,</b> λ= 1/(mean time to failure) = 1/59.6 = 0.0168. The distribution of failure times is called the probability density function (pdf), if time can take any positive value. In equations, the pdf is specified as f(t). If time can only take discrete values (such as 1 day, 2 days, and so on), {{the distribution of}} failure times is called the probability mass function (pmf). Most survival analysis methods assume that time can take any positive value, and f(t) is the pdf. If the time between observed air conditioner failures is approximated using the exponential function, then the exponential curve gives the probability density function, f(t), for air conditioner failure times.|$|E

40|$|In general {{relativity}} {{one of the}} most fundamental issues consists in defining a generally acceptable definition for the energy-momentum density. As a consequence, many coordinate-dependent definitions have been presented, whereby some of them utilize appropriate energy-momentum complexes. We investigate the energy-momentum distribution for a metric exterior to a spherically symmetric black hole in the brane world by applying the Landau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions. In both the aforesaid prescriptions, the energy thus obtained depends on the radial coordinate, the mass of the black hole and a <b>parameter</b> <b>lambda</b> (0), while all the momenta are found to be zero. It is shown that for a special value of the <b>parameter</b> <b>lambda</b> (0), the Schwarzschild space-time geometry is recovered. Some particular and limiting cases are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|We present two maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems cal H_lambda and cal H_eta {{that are}} defined, respectively, on an N-dimensional spherically {{symmetric}} generalization of the Darboux surface of type III {{and on an}} N-dimensional Taub-NUT space. Afterwards, we show that the quantization of cal H_lambda and cal H_eta leads, respectively, to exactly solvable deformations (with <b>parameters</b> <b>lambda</b> and eta) of the two basic quantum mechanical systems: the harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. In both cases the quantization is performed {{in such a way}} that the maximal superintegrability of the classical Hamiltonian is fully preserved. In particular, we prove that this strong condition is fulfilled by applying the so-called conformal Laplace-Beltrami quantization prescription, where the conformal Laplacian operator contains the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold plus a term proportional to its scalar curvature (which in both cases has non-constant value). In this way, the eigenvalue problems for the quantum counterparts of cal H_lambda and cal H_eta can be rigorously solved, and it is found that their discrete spectrum is just a smooth deformation (in terms of the <b>parameters</b> <b>lambda</b> and eta) of the oscillator and Coulomb spectrum, respectively. Moreover, it turns out that the maximal degeneracy of both systems is preserved under deformation. Finally, new further multiparametric generalizations of both systems that preserve their superintegrability are envisaged...|$|R

We extend to open gauge-algebras a recently formulated algorithm, based on redefinitions delta <b>lambda</b> of the <b>parameters</b> <b>lambda</b> of the classical Lagrangian and canonical transformations.

In addition, for clean interface the in-plane torkance of MnSi/Al is about twice as large as that of CoCo/Al.
