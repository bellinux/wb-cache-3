In this work, we prepared microgears with different heights and tooth lengths. These birefringent microgears can be induced to rotate by circularly polarized light. Here, we {{demonstrate that the}} use of phase plate for switching between left- and right-handed polarization reverses the optically induced rotation while maintaining the same rotational frequency. Due to the precise switching control, these birefringent microgears have advantages over previous microrotors that are fabricated from non-birefringent light-curing resins...|$|E

TOAD'S "DES permit required compliance with stringent water quality-based effluent limitations for the {{wastewater treatment plant}} effluent for seven heavy metals, cyanide, phenols, and chloroform {{and the performance of}} a Toxics Reduction Evaluation (TRE). The TRE study consisted of the review of current operations and wastewater management practices, verification of the sources and extent of the constituents, and the identification and screening of wastewater management and treatment practices necessary to achieve compliance. Extensive wastewater sampling was performed, sources were ranked in terms of their relative contributions, and potentially applicable control measures were identified. This structured approach for identifling contributing sources, wastewater management practices, and treatment technologies provides a fiamework for industrial dischargers to determine the priorities and costs associated with modifylng or adding those treatment processes required to comply with stringent effluent limitations...|$|E
40|$|Advance in the {{fabrication}} of nano-objects {{becomes more important}} for the development of new nanodevices with local properties leading to new functional devices. In this direction, the assembly of nanometer-scaled building objects into device configurations and functionalization is a promising investigated research field in nanotechnology. Optical recording and <b>photofabrication</b> techniques that exploit changes in material properties have gained importance, and there is a requirement for a decrease of the dimensions of the recording and processing surfaces. Photochromic materials leading to submicron structures responding to stimuli and in particular light are the best materials that exhibit multifunctional behaviors. Photomechanical properties of azopolymers show the perfect performance in photoinduced nanopatterning and reshaping by tailored light fields. Azopolymer nanostructures are then recognized as an excellent choice for a broad range of fundamental and applied research in modern nanotechnology. This chapter shows how polymer nanofilms, nanotubes, nanospheres, or nanowires containing azobenzene can be controlled by light for new photonics applications. Spatially confined excitation of unidirectional motions could make possible the local control of mechanical properties of the material and its structuration. The unprecedented flexibility of the reported photofluidization lithography with this material allows producing well-defined structures as lines, ellipsoids, rectangles, and circles at azopolymer surface with several tenth nanometers structural features. </p...|$|E
40|$|Direct Laser Writing (DLW) is an {{innovative}} tool {{that allows the}} <b>photofabrication</b> of high resolution 3 D structures, which can be successfully exploited {{for the study of}} the physical interactions between cells and substrates. In this work, we focused our attention on the topographical effects of submicrometric patterned surfaces fabricated via DLW on neuronal cell behavior. In particular, we designed, prepared, and characterized substrates based on aligned ridges for the promotion of axonal outgrowth and guidance. We demonstrated that both rat PC 12 neuron-like cells and human SH-SY 5 Y derived neurons differentiate on parallel 2. 5 μm spaced submicrometric ridges, being characterized by strongly aligned and significantly longer neurites with respect to those differentiated on flat control substrates, or on more spaced (5 and 10 μm) ridges. Furthermore, we detected an increased molecular differentiation toward neurons of the SH-SY 5 Y cells when grown on the submicrometric patterned substrates. Finally, we observed that the axons can exert forces able of bending the ridges, and we indirectly estimated the order of magnitude of these forces thanks to scanning probe techniques. Collectively, we showed as submicrometric structures fabricated by DLW can be used as a useful tool {{for the study of the}} axon mechanobiolog...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical {{machining}} (PCM), {{also known}} as photoetching, <b>photofabrication</b> or photochemical milling, is a non-traditional manufacturing method based on the combination of photoresist imaging and chemical etching. PCM uses techniques similar to those employed {{for the production of}} printed circuit boards and silicon integrated circuits. The PCM industry plays a valuable worldwide role in the production of metal precision parts and decorative items. Parts produced by PCM are typically thin, flat, and complex. These parts have applications in electronics, mechanical engineering, and the aerospace industry. The increasing popularity of industrial applications, together with greater competition, means {{that there is a need}} to understand the costs involved in PCM so that the right technology can be selected for manufacturing. The paper identifies the costs involved in Photochemical Machining and presents a cost model for PCM using a bottom-up approach. The research used IDEF 3 representation (work breakdown structure, WBS) to identify the process used in PCM. Expert interview, literature survey, and participant observation were used to identify cost drivers at each stage of the manufacturing process. The WBS and the cost drivers were used to develop the cost model, which is focused on stainless steel machining. Spreadsheets were used to implement the model, while the workbook is divided according to the main process steps and general costs. The worksheets contained in this workbook are: General Costs, Produce Drawing, Process Phototool, Select Metal, Prepare Metal, Coat the Metal, Process Photoresist, Etch Metal, Strip Photoresist, and Check & Package. Each of these sections is divided into the following types of costs: Materials, Direct Labour, Environmental and Indirect Costs. The workbook contains relevant data acquired from the PCM laboratory at Cranfield, PCM industry, and literature. The model is validated through expert judgement obtained on case study results. The model presented in this paper can be extended to include other PCM techniques to machine other materials...|$|E
40|$|The present work aims to {{demonstrate}} the potential of two photon polymerization {{for the production of}} ultraprecise microstructures. The technique benefits from the two photon absorption principle where two photons with half the energy required for excitation can result in a local polymerization reaction when absorbed simultaneously by a suitable photo-initiator (PI). In order to render the probability for simultaneous absorption sufficiently high to enable reproducible polymerization, a tightly focused femtosecond pulsed laser source is applied. As a consequence of tight focusing, a very small voxel originates where the photon density is large enough to make it statistically possible for an initiator molecule to simultaneously absorb two photons. As a result, a 3 D structure can be ‘recorded’ simply by moving the focal spot within a photo-crosslinkable solution, leaving a path of polymerized material behind. Consequently, this technique is the only rapid prototyping technique which enables ‘true’ 3 D structuring without the necessity to work in a layer by layer fashion. This unique feature results in nearly no structural limitations with respect to the design of the produced structures. [1] Furthermore, polymerization only occurs at the voxel around the focal spot inside the solution, so no typical struggles encountered during conventional stereolithography occur (e. g.; resolution abberations because of surface tension, need for support structures, oxygen inhibition). [1] In the present work, suitable materials for 2 PP have been examined for their processing parameters and compared with commercially available dedicated 2 PP resists. The applied laser source was a pulsed erbium doped femtosecond fiber laser with a center wavelenght of 780 nm. As a consequence, Irgacure 819 was selected as PI, because of its suitable absorbance spectrum. Using this photo-initiation system, several crosslinkable substances have succesfully been processed into very precise microstructures (see Figure 1). The obtained structures were examined both via optical microscopy as well as scanning electron microscopy to determine the optimal processing parameters. In a next step, the optimal processing parameters were compared to commercially available 2 PP resins, namely IP-L 780 and IP-Dip 780. The results illustrated that although the commercially available resins enabled far higher writing speeds, the investigated materials could still be processed in a sufficiently reproducible manner via 2 PP. Furthermore, the applied materials can be developed using only isopropanol, whereas the commercial resins require development using propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate (PGMEA) and isopropanol. This feature makes it possible to print the applied materials onto polymeric substrates (eg. PMMA) for ultraprecise surface modification without the risk of substrate dissolution during development.
