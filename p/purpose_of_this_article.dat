25|$|Various {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} the different (and sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, and the smaller islands which surround them. The terminology is often a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used, but also because they are often used loosely. In addition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use. However many of these classifications are contentious and have resulted in the British Isles naming dispute.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage {{is whether or not}} the children of these families will grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do. This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E

For the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> a non-singular surface X is called minimal if it cannot be obtained from another non-singular surface by blowing up a point. By Castelnuovo's contraction theorem, this is equivalent to saying that X has no (−1)-curves (smooth rational curves with self-intersection number −1). (In the more modern terminology of the minimal model program, a smooth projective surface X would be called minimal if its canonical line bundle KX is nef. A smooth projective surface has a minimal model in that stronger sense if and only if its Kodaira dimension is nonnegative.) ...|$|E

Auckland's Grammar Schools share a common line of descent from the British Grammar School system, with a strong focus on academics and traditional British sports. These schools used entry assessments and selected academic students from across the Realm of New Zealand. The schools mentioned below all share the school motto: [...] "Per Angusta Ad Augusta". They also share the same icon/logo, the [...] "Auckland Grammar Lion". Today all Grammar Schools in New Zealand are state schools, although they use school donations to supplement their government funding.|$|E
