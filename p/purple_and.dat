5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, {{with the exception of the}} keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his main work—performing with Deep <b>Purple</b> <b>and</b> other bands during the 1970s and 1980s—he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, performed in the charity supergroup Rock Aid Armenia, and engaged {{in a number of}} business investments and ventures, including a hotel, a motorcycle manufacturer, and music recording facilities at Kingsway Studios. More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep <b>Purple,</b> <b>and</b> his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> {{the indicator}} bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.|$|E

5|$|The WindSeeker at Knott's Berry Farm {{differed}} from the other five in several ways. Rather than white, blue, and green on the tower, Knott's adopted a color scheme using orange, <b>purple,</b> <b>and</b> yellow to reflect the Spanish California theme of the Fiesta Village section of the park. The tower at Knott's had no lights at the top. The ride's sign had a Mexican theme and did not light up.|$|E
5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. Because {{of the fact that}} many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and white or black and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to follow the example of Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches in <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} five pioneer battalions {{were raised by}} the AIF during the war, with one being {{assigned}} {{to each of the}} five infantry divisions that the Australians deployed to the battlefield in France and Belgium. The battalions consisted of four companies, under a headquarters company. To identify the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's personnel, they were issued with a <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> white Unit Colour Patch. The colours were in common with other Australian pioneer battalions, while the horizontal oval shape denoted that the unit was part of the 3rd Division.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha's {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by Queen Leonor, before {{municipal}} coats of arms were typically used in Portugal. The centre of the city's arms consist of the queen's personal arms, flanked on the right by a shrimping net, to commemorate the fishermen who rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso, and on the left a pelican feeding its young, a symbol of her husband, King João II. Because of its early introduction, several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards. The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> yellow gyronny.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, <b>purple,</b> <b>and</b> red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Early {{photosynthetic}} systems, such {{as those}} from green <b>and</b> <b>purple</b> sulfur <b>and</b> green <b>and</b> <b>purple</b> nonsulfur bacteria, {{are thought to have}} been anoxygenic, using various molecules as electron donors. Green <b>and</b> <b>purple</b> sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as an electron donor. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules.|$|R

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, <b>purple,</b> <b>and</b> white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are <b>purple,</b> <b>and</b> can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The programme's logo, the Big Brother Eye, {{is based}} on a black, <b>purple</b> <b>and</b> blue {{thumbprint}} and was released on 11 May. It was designed by Daniel Eatock.
