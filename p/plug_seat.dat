50|$|A typical {{representative}} of the valves to be automated is a plug-type control valve. Just like the plug in the bathtub is pressed into the drain, the plug is pressed into the <b>plug</b> <b>seat</b> by a stroke movement. The pressure of the medium acts upon the plug while the thrust unit has to provide {{the same amount of}} thrust to be able to hold and move the plug against this pressure.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{vehicles}} include reclining leather <b>seats,</b> <b>plug</b> sockets, {{air conditioning}} and a large toilet.|$|R
50|$|BestBus offers free Wi-Fi, {{electric}} <b>plugs</b> {{at every}} <b>seat,</b> free bottled water, and on-board restrooms. All bus riders are guaranteed a seat when boarding.|$|R
40|$|Glandless valve {{shuts down}} {{high-pressure}} fluid systems when severe shock from an explosion or earthquake occurs. The valve uses a pendulum {{to support the}} valve closure plug in the open position. When jarred, the valve body is moved relative to the pendulum and the plug support is displaced, allowing the <b>plug</b> to <b>seat</b> and be held by spring pressure...|$|R
50|$|The AAW team {{knew that}} the car would not last the whole race, so they fueled it for only ten laps {{in order to make}} a quick press run. This {{compensated}} the overweight of their TS16 and Kinnunen managed to overtake five cars in eight laps before a spark plug problem forced him to retire. Kinnunen later told that one spark plug thread in the cylinder head had been stripped. A Ferrari mechanic loaned them a threaded insert kit to fix it but the Finns did not master the method and the <b>plug</b> never <b>seated</b> properly.|$|R
50|$|The Airport Express used H345 Prevost Car 45' motor coaches with {{seating for}} 56. They were powered by engines that produce 55 per cent less {{nitrogen}} oxide and 90 per cent less particulate matter {{than the previous}} models. The coaches also come with improved features including such as leather seats, free WiFi internet, laptop <b>plugs</b> and retractable <b>seat</b> belts.|$|R
50|$|In 1990-91, BREL built twelve 3-car units {{based on}} the Class 158 for State Railway of Thailand. These differ from the British units in being fitted to Thailand's metre gauge, {{featuring}} differently styled outer-end gangways, manually operated inward-opening hinged doors (as opposed to the British <b>plug</b> doors), reversible <b>seating</b> and additional air-conditioning. They originally retained the original white, blue and black 'Regional Railways Express' livery. All units of Class 158 of State Railway of Thailand were refurbished in 2011. The refurbishment involved the repainting of the trains into a new livery and the lengthening of the trains to 4 coaches.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{spark plugs}} seal to the {{cylinder}} {{head with a}} single-use hollow or folded metal washer which is crushed slightly between the flat surface {{of the head and}} that of the plug, just above the threads. Some spark plugs have a tapered seat that uses no washer. The torque for installing these plugs is supposed to be lower than a washer-sealed plug. [...] Spark <b>plugs</b> with tapered <b>seats</b> should never be installed in vehicles with heads requiring washers, and vice versa. Otherwise, a poor seal or incorrect reach would result because of the threads not properly seating in the heads.|$|R
50|$|The cage {{is a part}} of {{the valve}} that {{surrounds}} the plug and is located inside the body of the valve. Typically, the cage is one of the greatest determiners of flow within the valve. As the plug is moved more of the openings in the cage are exposed and flow is increased and vice versa. The design and layout of the openings can have a large effect on flow of material (the flow characteristics of different materials at temperatures, pressures that are in a range). Cages are also used to guide the <b>plug</b> to the <b>seat</b> of the valve for a good shutoff, substituting the guiding from the bonnet.|$|R
40|$|A sensor {{provides}} a {{measurement of the}} degree of seating of an electrical connector. This sensor {{provides a}} number of discrete distances that a plug is inserted into a socket or receptacle. The number of measurements is equal to the number of pins available in the connector for sensing. On at least two occasions, the Shuttle Program has suffered serious time delays and incurred excessive costs simply because a <b>plug</b> was not <b>seated</b> well within a receptacle. Two methods were designed to address this problem: (1) the resistive pin technique and (2) the discrete length pins technique. In the resistive pin approach, a standard pin in a male connector is replaced with a pin that has a uniform resistivity along its length. This provides a variable resistance on that pin that is dependent on how far the pin is inserted into a socket. This is essentially a linear potentiometer. The discrete approach uses a pin (or a few pins) in the connector as a displacement indicator by truncating the pin length so it sits shorter in the connector than the other pins. A loss of signal on this pin would indicate a discrete amount of displacement of the connector. This approach would only give discrete values of connector displacement, and at least one pin would be needed for each displacement value that would be of interest...|$|R
40|$|Since 1997 {{numerous}} fires {{have been}} reported to the Food and Drug Administration involving cylinder valves installed on medical use oxygen cylinders sold and operated within the United States. All of the cylinder valves in question had polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) valve seats. Subsequent failure analysis showed that the main seat was the primary source of ignition. A review of the incidents involving cylinder valve fires indicated three possible ignition mechanisms: contaminant promotion, flow friction, and resonance. However, gas purity analysis showed that uncombusted, residual oxygen was within specification. Infrared and energy dispersive spectroscopy further showed that no contaminants or organic compounds were present in the remaining, uncombusted valve seat material or on <b>seat</b> <b>plug</b> surfaces. Therefore, contaminant-promoted ignition {{did not appear to be}} responsible for the failures. Observations of extruded material along the outer edge of the coined or loaded seat area produced by cylinder overuse or poppet overload led to concerns that accelerated gas flow across a deformed seat surface could generate enough localized heating to ignite the polymeric seat. Low molecular weight or highly amorphous quick-quenched PCTFE grades might be expected to be especially prone to this type of deformation. Such a failure mechanism has been described as flow friction; however, the corresponding mechanistic parameters are poorly understood. Subsequent revelation of low-temperature dimensional instability by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) in a variety of PCTFE sheet and rod stock samples led to new concerns that PCTFE valve seats could undergo excessive expansion or contraction during service. During expansion, additional extrusion and accompanying flow friction could occur. During contraction, a gap between the seal and adjacent metal surfaces could form. Gas flowing past the gap could, in turn, lead to resonance heating and subsequent ignition as described in ASTM Guide for Evaluation Nonmetallic Materials for Oxygen Service (G 63). Attempts to uncover the origins of the observed dimensional instability were hindered by uncertainties about resin grade, process history, and post-process heat history introduced by machining, annealing, and sample preparation. An approach was therefore taken to monitor property changes before and after processing and machining using a single, well-characterized lot of Neoflon CTFE. 1 M 400 H resin. A task group consisting of the current PCTFE resin supplier, two molders, and four valve seat manufacturers was formed, and phased testing on raw resin, intermediate rod stock, and finished valve seats initiated. The effect of processing and machining on the properties of PCTFE rod stock and oxygen gas cylinder valve seats was then determined. Testing focused on two types of extruded rod stock and one type of compression-molded rod stock. To accommodate valve seat manufacturer preferences for certain rod stock diameters, two representative diameters were used (4. 8 mm (0. 1875 in.) and 19. 1 mm (0. 75 in.)). To encompass a variety of possible sealing configurations, seven different valve seat types with unique geometries or machining histories were tested. The properties investigated were dimensional stability as determined by TMA, specific gravity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), compressive strength, zero strength time, and intrinsic viscosity. Findings are discussed in the context of polymer structure-process-property relationships whenever possible...|$|R
