40|$|Since {{this project}} is a {{continuation}} of a cooperative effort between UMR and General Motor Research Laboratories (GMR), it seemed fitting to provide some background information which was instrumental in the evolution of this program. A family of filled epoxies that can be cast-to-size into sheet metal stamping dies has been developed by GMR. Advantages of this material over commercial plastic tooling materials are a fast curing rate, high strength, and negligible volume shrinkage after curing. Superior Tooling And Molding <b>Plastic</b> (<b>STAMP)</b> tooling dies are considerably cheaper and faster to make than steel tooling dies; therefore, they are currently used for prototype applications throughout General Motors. With improvement of wear resistance, STAMP dies can be used for limited production applications involving 10, 000 or 20, 000 parts. GMR proposed to provide a thin (< 25 {micro}m) wear surface for the cast-to-size STAMP die to extend its wear performance. The objective of the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) research effort is to technically evaluate methodologies to coat STAMP material to appreciably improve wear resistance. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} various types of coatings will be developed and evaluated. Rather, the primary responsibility is to characterize the nature of the STAMP material and design engineered films which will lead to an optimized system. An example of this was the finding that a thin polymer layer existed on the surface of an as-cast STAMP die necessitating removal if satisfactory adherence and toughness were to be attained. The next important finding involved the influence of particle size on wear. The theme of the research approach was maintained throughout the course of the project, with improvements being made as the causes of failure were determined and appropriate corrections or improvements were made...|$|E

Gimme 5 is a partnership between Preserve and various like-minded companies such as Stonyfield Farm and Berry Plastics. Gimme 5 collection bins are set up in over 200 Whole Foods Markets, nationwide. These bins serve to collect these companies’ #5 plastic containers, as well as Brita pitcher and water bottle filters and Plum Organics caps. Consumers can drop off their clean, rigid <b>plastics</b> <b>stamped</b> with a “5” at any Gimme 5 station nationwide. Berry Plastics, Whole Foods and Preserve manage all of the collection and recycling. As {{a result of the}} program, Whole Foods recycled nearly 300,000 pounds of No. 5 plastics in 2012. Approximately 10-20% of the No. 5 materials used in Preserve products came from the Gimme 5 program.

40|$|Micro-forming {{studies have}} been more {{attractive}} in recent years because of miniaturization trend. One of the promising metal forming processes, micro-stamping, provides durability, strength, surface finish, and low cost for metal products. Hence, it is considered a prominent method for fabricating bipolar plates (BPP) with micro-channel arrays on large metallic surfaces {{to be used in}} Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC). Major concerns in micro-stamping of high volume BPPs are surface interactions between micro-stamping dies and blank metal plates, and tribological changes. These concerns {{play a critical role in}} determining the surface quality, channel formation, and dimensional precision of bipolar plates. The surface quality of BPP is highly dependent on the micro-stamping die surface, and process conditions due to large ratios of surface area to volume (size effect) that cause an increased level of friction and wear issues at the contact interface. Due to the high volume and fast production rates, BPP surface characteristics such as surface roughness, hardness, and stiffness may change because of repeated interactions between tool (micro-forming die) and workpiece (sheet blank of interest). Since the surface characteristics of BPPs have a strong effect on corrosion and contact resistance of bipolar plates, and consequently overall fuel cell performance, evolution of surface characteristics at the tool and workpiece should be monitored, controlled, and kept in acceptable ranges throughout the long production cycles to maintain the surface quality. Compared to macro-forming operations, tribological changes in micro-forming process are bigger challenges due to their dominance and criticality. Therefore, tribological size effect should be considered for better understanding of tribological changes in micro-scale. The integrity of process simulation to the experiments, on the other hand, is essential. This study describes an approach that aims to investigate the surface topography changes during long-run micro-stamping of BPPs, and establish relationships between surface roughness–corrosion resistance and surface roughness–contact resistance characteristics of BPPs. Formability levels of formed BPPs and repeatability characteristics of the process were investigated. In addition, blank thickness changes, von-Mises stress, plastic strain levels and distributions of micro-stamping process were determined via finite element analysis (FEA). Test results revealed that the surface roughness change for the stamping dies and BPPs was unsteady (no trend) due to the continuous change of surface topography (i. e. asperity deformation). Sub-micron range local <b>plastic</b> deformations on <b>stamping</b> dies led to surface topography changes on BPP in long-run manufacturing case. As surface defects trigger corrosion, the correlation between surface roughness and corrosion resistance of BPPs was found to be direct. Increasing number of surface irregularities (asperities) lowered contact surface area that resulted in increased contact resistance. ZrN coated BPPs, on the other hand, did not change surface roughness, however; it improved the protection of BPPs against corrosion significantly. In addition, ZrN coating increased the conductivity of BPPs and reduced the contact resistance between BPP and gas diffusion layer (GDL), at certain extent. As dimensional stability and repeatability was confirmed in forming of both uncoated and coated BPPs during the long run manufacturing, different formability levels were achieved for coated and uncoated samples. Lower channel height values were obtained for coated plates because of the different surface hardness of uncoated and coated plates. In tribological size effect part of study, micro stamping experiments using three different dies with distinct channel height values at different stamping force levels were performed. It was concluded that decrease in forming die dimensions led to increase in coefficient of friction as previously reported by other researchers as one of the consequences of tribological size effect. On the other hand, coefficient of friction values were not affected by the force levels used in the experiments and simulations, whereas plastic strain, equivalent stress, and formability levels were increased with increasing stamping force, as expected. 	In essence, this study proposed a methodology to investigate the long-run manufacturing effects on dimensional stability and surface characteristics of micro-stamped sheets. It also correlates these parameters to fuel cell performance measures such as interfacial contact and corrosion resistance...|$|R
