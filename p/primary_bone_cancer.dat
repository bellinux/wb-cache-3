40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{animal studies}} of the {{potential}} carcinogenicity of fluoride prompted an examination of <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence rates. METHODS: Trends {{in the incidence of}} <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancers,</b> including the incidence of osteosarcomas were examined among residents of New York State, exclusive of New York City. Average annual osteosarcoma incidence rates in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas were also compared. RESULTS: Among persons less than 30 years of age at diagnosis, <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence among males demonstrated a significant increase since 1955, while incidence among females has remained unchanged. A significant decrease in <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence rates since 1955 was observed among both males and females age 30 years and over at time of diagnosis. Osteosarcoma incidence rates have remained essentially unchanged since 1970, among both younger and older males and females. The average annual age adjusted incidence of osteosarcomas (1976 - 1987) in areas served by fluoridated water supplies was not found to differ from osteosarcoma incidence rates in non-fluoridated areas. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support an association between fluoride in drinking water and the occurrence of <b>cancer</b> of the <b>bone...</b>|$|R
50|$|Paget's {{disease of}} bone (also termed osteitis deformans or ambiguously, just Paget's disease) {{is caused by}} the {{excessive}} breakdown and formation of bone, followed by disorganised bone remodelling. This causes affected bone to weaken, resulting in pain, misshapen bones, fractures and arthritis in the joints near the affected bones. Rarely, it can develop into a <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> known as Paget's sarcoma. Often Paget's disease is localised to only a few bones in the body. The pelvis, femur, and lower lumbar vertebrae are the most commonly affected bones. Paget's disease typically is localised, affecting just one or a few bones, as opposed to osteoporosis, for example, which usually affects all the bones in the body.|$|E
40|$|Background: Individuals who {{had cancer}} in {{childhood}} are {{at higher risk}} of developing bone cancer than {{any other type of}} second primary cancer. Purpose: Using the population-based National Registry of Childhood Tumours in Britain, we in-vestigated the incidence and etiology of second <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> after childhood cancer in a cohort study and in a case-control study. Methods: A cohort study of 13 175 3 -year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in Britain be-tween 1940 and 1983 revealed 55 subsequent bone cancers. A largely nested case-control study comprised 59 case sub-jects developing second <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancer,</b> and 220 con-trol subjects were selected and matched for sex, type of first cancer, age at first cancer, and interval between diagnosis of first cancer and subsequent bone cancer.

40|$|The polyomavirus {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) is a known oncogenic DNA virus which induces <b>primary</b> brain and <b>bone</b> <b>cancers,</b> {{malignant}} mesothelioma, and lymphomas in laboratory animals. Persuasive evidence now indicates that SV 40 is causing infections in humans today and represents an emerging pathogen. A meta-analysis of molecular, pathological, and clinical data from 1, 793 cancer patients {{indicates that there}} is a significant excess risk of SV 40 associated with human <b>primary</b> brain <b>cancers,</b> <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancers,</b> malignant mesothelioma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Experimental data strongly suggest that SV 40 may be functionally important in the development of some of those human malignancies. Therefore, the major types of tumors induced by SV 40 in laboratory animals are the same as those human malignancies found to contain SV 40 markers. The Institute of Medicine recently concluded that “the biological evidence is of moderate strength that SV 40 exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions. ” This review analyzes the accumulating data that indicate that SV 40 is a pathogen which has a possible etiologic role in human malignancies.

40|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> of {{children}} and is established during stages of rapid bone growth. The disease is a consequence of immature osteoblast differentiation, which gives way to a rapidly synthesized incompletely mineralized and disorganized bone matrix. The mechanism of osteosarcoma tumorogenesis is poorly understood, and few proteomic studies have been used to interrogate the disease thus far. Accordingly, these studies have identified proteins that have been known to be associated with other malignancies, rather than being osteosarcoma specific. In this paper, we focus on the growing list of available state-of-the-art proteomic technologies and their specific application to the discovery of novel osteosarcoma diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The current signaling markers/pathways associated with primary and metastatic osteosarcoma that have been identified by early-stage proteomic technologies thus far are also described...|$|E
40|$|The CCN {{family of}} {{proteins}} {{is composed of}} six secreted proteins (CCN 1 - 6), which are grouped together based on their structural similarity.

In this review, we focus on CCN 3, a founding member of this family, and its role in regulating cells within the bone microenvironment. CCN 3 impairs normal osteoblast differentiation through multiple mechanisms, which include the neutralization of pro-osteoblastogenic stimuli such as BMP and Wnt family signals or the activation of pathways that suppress osteoblastogenesis, such as Notch. In contrast, CCN 3 is known to promote chondrocyte differentiation. Given these functions, {{it is not surprising that}} CCN 3 has been implicated in the progression of <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancers</b> such as osteosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. More recently, emerging evidence suggests that CCN 3 may also influence the ability of metastatic cancers to colonize and grow in bone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOsteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common primary bone tumour in the {{paediatric}} age group. Treatment-refractory pulmonary metastasis continues to be the major complication of OS, reducing the 5 -year survival rate for these patients to 10 – 20 %. The mechanisms underlying the metastatic process in OS are still unclear, but undoubtedly, a greater understanding of the factors and interactions involved in its regulation will open new and much needed opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Recent published data have identified a new role for bone-specific macrophages (osteoclasts) and tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), in OS metastasis. In this review we discuss the contribution of TAMs and osteoclasts in the establishment and maintenance of secondary metastatic lesions, and their novel role in the prevention of metastatic disease in a <b>primary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> such as osteosarcoma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chondrosarcoma, a <b>primary</b> {{malignant}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancer,</b> {{has potential}} for local invasion and distant metastasis, {{especially to the}} lungs. Patients diagnosed with it show poor prognosis. Paeonol (2 '-hydroxy- 4 '-methoxyacetophenone), the main active compound of traditional Chinese remedy Paeonia lactiflora Pallas, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity; whether paeonol regulates metastatic chondrosarcoma is largely unknown. Here, we find paeonol do not increase apoptosis. By contrast, at non-cytotoxic OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15 11761 concentrations, paeonol suppresses migration and invasion of chondrosarcoma cells. We also demonstrate paeonol enhancing miR- 141 expression and miR- 141 inhibitor reversing paeonol-inhibited cell motility; paeonol also reduces protein kinase C (PKC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Primary</b> and {{secondary}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancers</b> are major causes of pathological bone fractures {{which are usually}} treated through implant fixation and chemotherapy. However, both approaches face many limitations. On one hand, implants may suffer from poor osseointegration, and their rejection results in repeated surgery, patient's suffering, and extensive expenses. On the other hand, there are severe systemic adverse effects of toxic chemotherapeutics which are administrated systemically. In this paper, {{in order to address}} these two problems, we present a new type of localized drug-releasing titanium implants with enhanced implants' biointegration and drug release capabilities that could provide a high concentration of anticancer drugs locally to treat <b>bone</b> <b>cancers.</b> The implants are fabricated by 3 D printing of Ti alloy followed by an anodization process featuring unique micro- (particles) and nanosurface (tubular arrays) topography. We successfully demonstrate their enhanced bone osseointegration and drug loading capabilities using two types of anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo 2 L/TRAIL). In vitro study showed strong anticancer efficacy against cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231 -TXSA), confirming that these drug-releasing implants can be used for localized chemotherapy for treatment of <b>primary</b> {{and secondary}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancers</b> together with fracture support.

Cancer mortality usually results from the local and distant metastasis. A nutrient mixture containing ascorbic acid, lysine, proline, green tea extract, was tested on chondrosarcoma cells SW- 1353 for viability, matrix metalloproteinase expression, Matrigel invasion, morphology and apoptosis. The SW- 1353 cells were grown in appropriate media and treated with the nutrient mixture at 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 µg/ml concentrations. Cells were also treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for MMP- 9 stimulation. Cell proliferation {{was carried out by}} MTT assay, MMPs by zymography, invasion through Matrigel.
