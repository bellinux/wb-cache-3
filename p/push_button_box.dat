40|$|Visualization of {{the orbit}} motion of a {{satellite}} in space {{is an important}} step to carryout mission planning and design. In an environment of learning such visualization tools help the students to understand and appreciate the dynamical motion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to present, first, the simulation of the satellite orbit analysis based on data collected from NASA/Norad two line element files. The analysis includes orbit determination and prediction of satellite position/velocity, orbit eclipse and ground trace and so on. Second the application of this simulation to design the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite power subsystem. The intention of this simulation was to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which consists of menus, <b>push</b> <b>buttons,</b> text <b>boxes,</b> plots and other interface devices that allow the GUI user to immediately see the impact of various changes...|$|R

Additional controls can be built using SOM and distributed as [...]DLL files; anything from simple variants of existing controls (such as a tri-state check box, or a self-validating entry field) to completely custom-drawn controls (for example, a self-contained tic-tac-toe board) can be written in C, compiled, and added to a VX-REXX project.|$|R
