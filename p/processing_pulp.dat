Although several analytical techniques have been employed in the determination of H 2 O 2, such as titrimetry [8], spectrometry [9], and chemiluminescence [10], most of them exhibit shortcomings like sluggish response, complicated instrumentation, and low sensitivity and selectivity. Electroanalytical method is a preferable alternative [11 – 14] because of their relatively low cost, better efficiency, ease of operation, high sensitivity, low detection limit, and rapid response.

Six mutants of the wild-type (WT) Lipase A showing increased thermostability are chosen for this study because all the proteins have structures very similar to the WT in spite of having 2 to 12 mutations (Srivastava and Sinha, 2014; Kandhari and Sinha, 2016). The PCNs of these seven Lipase A proteins (WT and its six mutants) have been studied to uncover those small changes that do not change the structure but confer thermostability to retain functionality.|$|E

This is driving the need for environmental compliance in industries like mining, metal <b>processing,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper, sewage treatment, and chemical manufacturing. The sulfate removal from synthetic water by high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin was studied at batch experiments in this study. The effect of pH, contact time, sulfates concentration, and adsorbent dose on the sulfate sequestration was investigated. The optimum conditions were studied on Saline water as a case study. The results showed that with increasing of the absorbent amount; contact time, and pH improve the efficiency of sulfate removal. The maximum sulfates uptake was obtained in pH and contact time 3.0 and 120  min, respectively. Also, with increasing initial concentration of sulfates in water, the efficiency of sulfate removal decreased. The obtained results in this study were matched with Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) and constant rate were found 0.318 (mg/g) and 0.21 (mg/g.min), respectively. This study also showed that in the optimum conditions, the sulfate removal efficiency from Saline water by 0.1  mg/L sulfates was 65.64  %. Eventually, high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin is recommended as a suitable and low cost absorbent to sulfate removal from aqueous solutions.|$|E
40|$|The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) holds US$ 4. 1 {{billion in}} loans related to forest and estate crop activities, of which US$ 2. 7 billion are nonperforming. Ten large {{conglomerates}} account for over 70 % {{of the bad}} forest and estate crop debt. These groups are also responsible for some US$ 2. 4 billion in domestic nonperforming loans in other sectors and US$ 15 billion in offshore debt. The current high level of non-performing loans stems, in large part, from the failure by banks to exercise due diligence (i. e., seriously assess the potential for loan default) when Indonesia’s forest-linked conglomerates sought to borrow funds prior to the crisis. Direct government subsidies for forest and estate crop activities also encouraged corporate risk taking. Strong evidence suggests that debt write-offs and loan restructuring may provide Indonesia’s forest-related industries with a substantial capital subsidy. This study projects that IBRA will eventually write-off US$ 1. 3 – 1. 9 billion of debts associated with timber, wood <b>processing,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper, and oil palm investments. Debt write-off on this scale, together with IBRA’s current lack of supervision over the forest-related companies that owe it large sums of money, will serve as an impetus for debtor firms to continue to engage in practices involving an inordinate degree of financial risk...|$|E

This study evaluated physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, in three consecutive months, 17 flavors of fruit pulp of a manufacturing company in order to use the final product control as a means to identify control gaps present in the acquisition of raw materials as well as during processing steps and packaging. It was noticed that about 60 % of all pulps were unfit for human consumption, with the highest percentage in the physicochemical analysis (45 %), followed by microbiological (30 %). In the microbiological characteristics, the large amount of molds and yeasts suggest failure through cleaning and sanitizing fruits and in the processing area. For the physicochemical analysis, pH and total soluble solids content were the most alarming, verifying the possibility of water adittion (illegal) and acidulant excess, which causes the pulp loses its fruit identity.

Phenol is toxic to fish at a level of 0. 05 mg/l, therefore the removing of phenols from waste water is therefore of great importance. Produced water is the water pumped from aquifers associated with petroleum oil production, gas production or coal bed methane production. Produced water from petroleum oil reservoirs was produced in huge amounts and it contained several pollutants, such as phenol and petroleum oil droplets. New methods were required to reduce the amounts of toxic pollutants to permissible limits before rejecting this produced water to the environment. The produced water contained the following 4. 5 mg/L phenol, 300 mg/l petroleum oil, Cl- 62 mg/L and pH 6. 0. The effect of addition of petroleum oil on the activity of horseradish peroxidase was determined. It was found that petroleum oil has strong depressing effect on the activity of the horseradish peroxidase at concentrations up to 1 gm/L of petroleum oil. The effects of treating the produced water with enzyme peroxidase extracted from horseradish plant, peroxide (H 2 O 2) and polyethylene glycol have been studied.

40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{extraction}} do not provide the required amount of sucrose extraction from sugar beet pulp. To improve the process it is advisable to use additional methods of <b>processing</b> <b>pulp,</b> including the thermo-physical methods using various coolants. Thermal pre-treatment of sugar beet pulp can increase the period of active extraction, the recovery of sucrose from it and reduce the loss of sugar in the pulp, increase the productivity of diffusion unit. One {{of the most important}} criteria for evaluating the efficiency of the extraction process is the value of the molecular diffusion coefficient D, m 2 /s. The coefficient is a physical constant that characterizes the ability of a substance to penetrate by diffusion in the stationary medium. One of the most promising technological directions that increases the efficiency of the extraction process and accelerates the extraction of sugar from the pulp, is its scalding, as well as the use of different extractants for the diffusion process. The method of extraction sucrose from sugar beet with the application of preliminary scalding of sugar beet samples and the use of solutions of various salts as extractants was proposed. Positive effect of heat treatment on the molecular diffusion coefficient of sucrose from sugar beet was found experimentally. The value of the optimal duration of scalding is 30 seconds. It was found out that the heat treatment of sugar beet samples with the solutions of proposed salts leads to a gradual uniform heating of beet tissues and denaturation of proteins, which increases the diffusion coefficient of the sugar beet tissue sucrose. The maximum value of the diffusion coefficient is achieved by using as an extractant solution of ammonium sulfate (NH 4) 2 SO 4.

40|$|For a {{hardcopy}} of this report, {{printed in the}} Netherlands, an estimated 200 litres of water have been used. Water is required during different stages in the production process, from growing wood to <b>processing</b> <b>pulp</b> into the final consumer product. Most of the water is consumed in the forestry stage, where water consumption refers to the forest evapotranspiration. The water footprint during the manufacturing processes in the industrial stage consists of evaporation and contamination of ground- and surface water. In this report we assess water requirements for producing paper products using different types of wood and {{in different parts of}} the world. We quantify the combined green and blue water footprint of paper by considering the full supply chain; we do not include the grey water footprint in this study. The water footprint of printing and writing paper is estimated to be between 300 and 2600 m 3 /ton (2 - 13 litres for an A 4 sheet). These figures account for the paper recovery rates as they currently are. The exact amount depends on the sort and origin of the paper used for printing. Without recovery, the global average water footprint of paper would be much larger; by using recovered paper an estimated 40 % is saved globally. Further saving can be achieved by increasing the recovery percentages worldwide. For countries with a low recovered paper utilization rate a lot of room for reduction still remains. Some countries such as the Netherlands, Spain and Germany already use a lot of recovered paper. In addition, the global water footprint of paper can be reduced by choosing production sites and wood types that are more water-efficient. The findings presented in this report can be helpful in identifying the opportunities to reduce water footprints of paper consumption. This report also shows that the use of recovered paper may be very helpful in reducing water footprints...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} reason why the region of Northern Ostrobothnia and in {{particular}} the city of Oulu became known as the High Tech capital of the Nordic countries during the 1980 s and 1990 s. After World War II, the region’s economy was dependent upon its traditional industries of forestry, wood <b>processing,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper manufacturing and to a lesser degree on iron and steel manufacture. In common with other parts of Northern Finland, Northern Ostrobothnia suffered from high unemployment, low educational standards, outwards migration and below average standards of living and life expectancy. Aware of these problems, the national government in Helsinki embarked on a series of measures to improve this situation. First and foremost, a university was established in Oulu and its first three faculties were teacher training, medicine and engineering. The university was charged with the specific tasks of educating and conducting research to benefit the economy of Northern Finland. It was realised that economic changes were essential and attempts were made to build an electronics industry in the region to make it less dependent on natural resources. To facilitate economic developments, infrastructural improvements were made and branches of VTT and Tekes were established in Oulu. A key factor here was the government realisation that decision-making for improvements in the region should and would be devolved to the local authorities. That was the opportunity for the city of Oulu to seize initiative, and in concert with the University and a group of local entrepreneurs, to set up a Technology Park, Technopolis, in 1982 at Linnanmaa beside both the university and VTT. These small beginnings provided the foundations for sectors such as electronics, computer software, telecommunications and biotechnology sectors to emerge gradually, so that by the year 2000 there were nearly 12, 000 high tech jobs in the area. A crucial addition to this development in the long term was the arrival of Nokia to Oulu. At first Nokia concentrated on cable technology and base stations, but once it diversified into telecommunications and built up partnerships with local firms a clearly-defined high tech cluster became visible. Within the cluster, there is significant cooperation between the relevant New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs), Nokia and the local educational and research establishments. The outcome, at the time of writing, is that Oulu has gained a world reputation as an innovative centre of high technology, and it is the circumstances behind this reputation that the remainder of this thesis seeks to investigate. test...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) is {{a serious}} problem for many industries, including oil production and <b>processing,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper, and wastewater treatment. In addition, H 2 S is usually present in natural gas and biogas. It is necessary to control the generation and release of H 2 S into the environment because H 2 S is corrosive, toxic, and has an unpleasant odour. In addition, the removal of H 2 S from natural gas and biogas is essential for preventing the emission of SO 2 upon combustion of these gases. Physicochemical processes have been developed for the removal of H 2 S. These processes employ techniques such as chemical or physical absorption, thermal and catalytic conversion, and liquid phase oxidation. In comparison, biological processes for the removal of sulphide typically operate at ambient temperature and pressure, with the feasibility for the treatment of smaller streams, and the absence of expensive catalysts. The objective of the present work was to study the biooxidation of sulphide under denitrifying conditions in batch system and a continuous immobilized cell bioreactor using a mixed microbial culture enriched from the produced water of a Canadian oil reservoir. In the batch experiments conducted at various initial sulphide concentrations, an increase in the sulphide oxidation and nitrate reduction rates was observed as the initial sulphide concentration was increased in the range 1. 7 to 5. 5 mM. An extended lag phase of approximately 10 days was observed when sulphide concentrations around or higher than 14 mM were used. This, when considered {{with the fact that the}} microbial culture was not able to oxidize sulphide at an initial concentration of 20 mM, indicates the inhibitory effects of sulphide at high concentrations. The effect of the initial sulphide to nitrate concentrations ratio (ranging from 0. 3 to 4. 0) was also studied. As the initial sulphide to nitrate ratio decreased, the sulphide oxidation rates increased. The increasing trend was observed for initial nitrate concentrations in the range of 1. 3 to 7. 3 mM, corresponding to ratios of 4. 08 to 0. 83. The increase in nitrate reduction rates was more pronounced than that of the sulphide oxidation rates. However at nitrate concentrations higher than 7. 3 mM (ratios lower than 0. 83) the nitrate reduction rate remained constant. The percentage of sulphide that was oxidized to sulphate increased from 2. 4 % to 100 % as the initial sulphide to nitrate ratio decreased from 4. 08 to 0. 42. This indicated that at ratios lower than 0. 42, nitrate would be in excess and at ratios exceeding 4. 08, nitrate would be limiting. In the continuous bioreactor systems, at sulphide loading rates ranging from 0. 26 to 30. 30 mM/h, sulphide conversion remained in the range of 97. 6 % to 99. 7 %. A linear increase in the volumetric oxidation rate of sulphide was observed as the sulphide loading rate was increased with the maximum rate being 30. 30 mM/h (98. 5 % conversion). Application of immobilized cells led to a significant increase in oxidation rate of sulphide when compared with the rates obtained in a bioreactor with freely suspended cells. At nitrate loading rates ranging from 0. 19 to 24. 44 mM/h, the nitrate conversion ranged from 97. 2 % to 100 % and a linear increase in volumetric reduction rate was observed as the nitrate loading rate was increased, with the maximum rate being 24. 44 mM/h (99. 7 % conversion). A second bioreactor experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of sulphide to nitrate concentrations ratio on the performance of the system. Sulphide conversion was complete at sulphide to nitrate ratios of 1. 1 and 1. 3, but decreased to 90. 5 % at the ratio of 3. 1 and 65. 0 % at the ratio of 5. 0, indicating nitrate was limiting for sulphide to nitrate ratios of 3. 1 and 5. 0. The increase in the sulphide to nitrate ratio (and the resulting limitation of nitrate) caused a decrease in the volumetric reaction rate of sulphide. Nitrate conversion was complete at sulphide to nitrate ratios of 1. 3, 3. 1, and 5. 0; however, at a ratio of 1. 1, the conversion of nitrate dropped to 59. 6 %, indicating that nitrate was in excess, and sulphide was limiting. The volumetric reaction rate of nitrate decreased as the sulphide to nitrate ratio increased for ratios of 1. 3, 3. 1, and 5. 0; this was due to the decrease in the nitrate loading rate. For sulphide to nitrate ratios of 1. 1 and 1. 3, 7. 2 % and 19. 6 % of the sulphide was converted to sulphate, respectively. At ratios of 3. 1 and 5. 0, no sulphate was generated. For ratios between 1. 3 and 5. 0, an increase in the ratio caused a decrease in the generation of sulphate...|$|E
