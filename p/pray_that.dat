As described above, the CWA aided the plaintiff in the 1983 case Mozert v.

500|$|Although {{focused on}} healing, Antoinism does not propose any {{diagnosis}} nor prescription, {{and does not}} practice the laying on of hands; the faithful may also resort to traditional medicine. In the books of the temple, it is stated that desservants {{are not allowed to}} discourage them to consult a doctor and they should <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> they find an [...] "inspired" [...] doctor. Generally, consulting an Antoinist healer is merely a supplement to allopathic medicine. Because of its healer doctrine, the religious group is almost always compared to Christian Science; however, in spite of several similarities with this religion as well as with Friedrich Hegel's works, Belgian historian Pierre Debouxhtay rejected the idea that they could have been potential influences on Antoine's doctrines. According to him, it is possible that Antoine was influenced by Doukhobors.|$|E

It was only after Oswald's bones were the focus of an awe-inspiring miraclein which, during the night, a pillar of light appeared over the wagon in which the bones were being carried and shone up into the skythat they were accepted into the monastery: [...] "in the morning, the brethren who had refused it the day before, began themselves earnestly to <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> those holy relics, so beloved by God, might be deposited among them".|$|E

Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. [...] "We support any peaceful movement, {{at any time and}} from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands," [...] he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement, blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E
500|$|Throughout February 1554 Jane Grey {{and other}} rebels were executed. It was now {{time to deal}} with the {{religious}} leaders of the reformation and so on 8 March 1554 the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer to be transferred to Bocardo prison in Oxford to await a second trial for heresy. During this time Cranmer was able to smuggle out a letter to Martyr who had fled to Strasbourg, the last surviving document written in his own hand. He stated that the desperate situation of the church was proof that it will eventually be delivered and wrote, [...] "I <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> God may grant that we may endure to the end!" [...] Cranmer remained isolated in Bocardo prison for seventeen months before the trial started on 12 September 1555. Although it took place in England, the trial was under papal jurisdiction and the final verdict would come from Rome. Under interrogation, Cranmer admitted to every fact that was placed before him, but he denied any treachery, disobedience, or heresy. The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer's but their verdicts came almost immediately and they were burnt at the stake on 16 October. Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings. On 4 December, Rome decided Cranmer's fate by depriving him of the archbishopric and giving permission to the secular authorities to carry out their sentence.|$|E
