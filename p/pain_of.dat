5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> grief itself.|$|E

5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city {{in the days before the}} combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> death, nor call out during the fight on <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> losing a hand.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of pain depends {{mainly on the}} location of the cancer and the stage of the disease.

5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E

The mixed doubles was granted to Cochet and Colette Rosambert following {{the retirement of}} Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> Ryan.

5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> death.

5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, {{because in}} many cases the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E

Theoretical section is devoted to treatment <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> Pain influences {{the quality of life in}} a fundamental way and that is why we necessarily must pay attention to pain and we must efficiently calm pain. In the theoretical section there are mentioned definition <b>of</b> <b>pain,</b> anatomical and physiological aspects <b>of</b> <b>pain,</b> aspects <b>of</b> diagnostics and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> and epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> The literature search is mostly aimed to treatment <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> - especially to pharmacotherapy, but also other possibilities <b>of</b> interference <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> are mentioned - for example analgetic radiotherapy, invasive procedures, aplication of radioisotopes or psychotherapy. Pain is phenomenon, which has its somatic, psychologic and social component and therefore treatment <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> is multidisciplinary mission, which requires complex solution.

Patients, physicians, and physiotherapists agreed quite well regarding current pain, whereas physiotherapists overestimated the highest level <b>of</b> tolerable <b>pain</b> and physicians ignored the emotional component <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> Results indicate that differentiated pain assessment including several aspects <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> is required in order to prevent mismatches between {{patients and their}} therapists...|$|R

Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E

Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant {{he was unable to}} join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E
