40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new six-parameter <b>distribution,</b> namely <b>Beta</b> Exponentiated Weibull <b>Poisson</b> (BEWP) which is obtained by compounding between the exponentiated Weibull <b>Poisson</b> and <b>beta</b> <b>distributions.</b> We propose its basic structural properties such as density function and moments for this new distribution. We re-express the BEWP density function as a EWP linear combination, and use this to obtain its moments. In addition, it also contains several sub-models that are well known. Moreover, we apply the maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters, and applications to real data sets show the superiority of this new distribution by comparing the fitness with its sub-models...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{control over}} the {{location}} of monomers in a polymer chain {{has been described as}} the ‘Holy Grail’ of polymer synthesis. Controlled chain growth polymerization techniques have brought this goal closer, allowing the preparation of multiblock copolymers with ordered sequences of functional monomers. Such structures have promising applications ranging from medicine to materials engineering. Here we show, however, that the statistical nature of chain growth polymerization places strong limits on the control that can be obtained. We demonstrate that monomer locations are distributed according to surprisingly simple laws related to the <b>Poisson</b> or <b>beta</b> <b>distributions.</b> The degree of control is quantified in terms of the yield of the desired structure and the standard deviation of the appropriate distribution, allowing comparison between different synthetic techniques. This analysis establishes experimental requirements for the design of polymeric chains with controlled sequence of functionalities, which balance precise control of structure with simplicity of synthesis...|$|R

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well-described by the <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution.</b> Several properties of the <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution</b> make it {{a powerful tool for}} this purpose. For example, the <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution</b> can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution</b> is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well-described by a <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution</b> with parameters a = 0. 867 +/- 0. 044 and b = 3. 03 +/- 0. 17. The <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution</b> is shown to be 3. 7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution,</b> where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct <b>Beta</b> <b>distributions</b> at a confidence of 11. 6 sigma and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.
