40|$|We {{conducted}} surveys on 5 and 6 grade Elementary School {{children in}} Nagasaki Prefecture, {{and in both}} cities and remote islands in Okinawa Prefecture of Japan, in order to clarify current lifestyles, mental health (depression trends, interpersonal stress, feelings of inefficiency and tempestuousness) and the <b>psycho-social</b> school <b>environment</b> of children in remote islands. This research aims to investigate correlations between the mental health, lifestyles and <b>psycho-social</b> school <b>environment</b> of children in remote islands. T-test results for lifestyle showed boys in remote islands get up earlier and spend less time on the computer, playing with parents and exercising. Girls in remote islands sleep earlier, eat more by not leaving leftovers, exercise more outside class, spend less time studying outside school hours and have a greater awareness of their grades. Also, {{both boys and girls}} in remote island tend to have more siblings and participate more in local events. In regard to the <b>psycho-social</b> school <b>environment,</b> girls in remote islands showed a significantly higher level of satisfaction with their school, and children in remote islands were more likely to feel that their school environment was 'comfortable'. Concerning components of mental health, boys in remote islands demonstrated significantly higher interpersonal stress, and girls tended to have significantly stronger feelings of inefficiency. Also, in regard to correlations between mental health, lifestyle and the <b>psycho-social</b> school <b>environment,</b> both boys and girls produced low though significant correlations over several items. In particular, significant correlations were found between mental health and satisfaction with school in many items for boys in cities and girls in remote islands, suggesting that satisfaction with school {{is an important factor in}} children's mental health...|$|R
40|$|Processes of {{transition}} to democracy and country break up stand out as ideal experiments to estimate the impact of wide institutional reform on well-being.

There is a social gradient; mortality rises with decreasing socio-economic status. Three large sample studies, one British and two American, brought together for their complementarity in samples, measures, and design, all show similar social gradients for adult {{men and women in}} physical and mental morbidity and in psychological well-being. These gradients are observed both with educational and occupational status and are not explained by parents' social status or lack of an intact family during childhood. They are also not accounted for by intelligence measured in school. This suggests that indirect selection cannot account for inequalities in health.

40|$|Issue addressed: As {{tobacco control}} moves {{further into the}} {{legislative}} field, {{it is important to}} gauge public opinion on the acceptability of smoking policy initiatives, and identify characteristics of individuals who express high support for these initiatives. Methods: A total of 385 university students completed a questionnaire containing the Smoking Policy Inventory and items assessing the person's demographic characteristics, health beliefs about smoking, smoking-related history and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment.</b> The Smoking Policy Inventory comprises five subscales: Advertising and Promotion; Public Education; Laws and Penalties; Taxes and Fees; Restrictions on Smoking. Results: Smoking policy initiatives were strongly supported by these university students, both overall and for each of the five domains. Public Education elicited the strongest support. The overriding influence on level of support for smoking policy was the individual's experience of smoking. Characteristics associated with lower support were: being a smoker; having smoked for more than three years; having parents who smoke; having a number of friends and relatives who smoke; believing that the health impact of smoking is low; and not finding other people's smoke offensive. Conclusions: Acceptance of smoking policy initiatives is high among Australian youth. Level of acceptance is strongly influenced by the individual's experience of smoking. So what? It is recommended that raising support for smoking policy initiatives among Australian youth may be achieved by increasing acceptance of the serious health impact of smoking...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge about {{characteristics}} explaining {{low level}} of physical activity in late-life depression is needed to develop specific interventions aimed at improving physical health in depressed people above the age of 60. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO), a longitudinal multi-site naturalistic cohort study. People aged 60 and over with current depression and a non-depressed comparison group were included, and total amount of PA per week was assessed with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Depression characteristics, socio-demographics, cognitive function, somatic condition, <b>psycho-social,</b> <b>environment</b> and other lifestyle factors were added in a multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Depressed persons > 60 y were less physically active in comparison with non-depressed subjects. The difference was determined by somatic condition (especially, functional limitations) and by psychosocial characteristics (especially sense of mastery). Within the depressed subgroup only, a lower degree of physical activity was associated with more functional limitations, being an inpatient, {{and the use of}} more medication, but not with the severity of the depression. LIMITATION: This study is based on cross-sectional data, so no conclusions can be drawn regarding causality. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that depression in people over 60 is associated with lower physical activity. Patient characteristics seem more important than the depression diagnosis itself or the severity of depression.

40|$|Aim. To {{assess the}} impact of an {{intervention}} aimed to build capacity of registered nurses to enhance the clinical learning environment for undergraduate nursing students. Workplace learning is vital for the development of skills, attributes and knowledge of student nurses. Registered nurses need to be appropriately prepared to maximise student learning during clinical placement. Background. The quality of student learning during clinical practicum is largely dependent on interactions with ward staff. Design. A quasi-experimental design. Method. Measurement of students' perceptions of the psycho social learning environment during and outside of the intervention period was used to evaluate the capacity building intervention. The capacity building intervention consisted of interactive education in clinical areas over a six-week period for registered nurses in two acute surgical wards. Results. First, second and third year students (n = 62) who undertook their clinical practicum in the two surgical wards, before, during and six months after the capacity building intervention assessed the <b>psycho-social</b> learning <b>environment</b> {{at the time of their}} clinical practicum. Findings showed that students who undertook their clinical practicum during the intervention period rated the <b>psycho-social</b> clinical learning <b>environment</b> significantly higher than students who undertook their practicum at times outside of the intervention period.

Lithuanian society faces this objective as well. For this reason, this study aiming at providing the theoretical basis for and predicting the possible <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> in an integrated education system, {{as well as at}} the evaluation of the reasons for the formation of a positive approach to the disabled, is especially relevant, since it creates the prerequisites for the optimisation of the process of the integration of disabled schoolchildren into the general system of education. Method The sample of the study consisted of 2471 children from the same schools: not integrated (1958), integrated (126) and special schools (382). Empirical methods: questionnaire poll, comparative analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out using SAS. Results Our study showed that the majority of schoolchildren without disabilities and disabled schoolchildren have positive intentions for interpersonal interactions (> 82 %) and positive emotions (> 69 %) independently of the discrepant character of interpersonal contacts, different conditions of education and family life, and despite of low level of knowledge. Conclusion The results of the study confirmed positive intentions for interpersonal interaction between disabled schoolchildren and schoolchildren without disabilities, as well as a positive character of emotions, and disprove the unsound myth of the opponents of the social integration of the disabled stating that disabled children in comprehensive schools would undoubtedly experience offence from their peers without disabilities. </p...|$|E

My reason for choosing {{this issue was}} a desire to get a greater insight into cyber-bullying as a phenomenon. In addition, I found it interesting to find how the principals can work systematically for prevention and reduction of cyber-bullying incidents in schools, {{with the purpose of}} offering pupils a good <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> as enshrined in the Education Act, Section 9 a- 3. My attention was focused on understanding the concept cyber-bullying, cyber-bullying prevention measures, and challenges in cyber-bullying prevention. Before the interview, a literature review was performed. In this study, I used the qualitative semi-structured interview together with Grounded Theory approach. Specific selection criteria were used to select respondents for the survey. Four informants were interviewed. A bilingual interview guide was prepared in advance of the interviews. The questions for the interview guide were based on the following main issues and research questions: How do Norwegian principals reflect upon cyber-bullying prevention? 1. How do primary principals understand the concept cyber-bullying? 2. Which of the preventive measures that are used against cyber-bullying in primary school are considered by principals to be effective? 3. What kind of challenges do primary school principals experience as regards implementing preventive measures against cyber-bullying? The following conclusions were arrived at: Cyber-bullying prevention in the framework of the unwanted behavior prevention can be considered effective in the Norwegian context. Such prevention should be based on the principles of positive attitudes and proactive development, proactive development of responsibility for own behavior, emphasizing the positive behavior and providing predictable responses to negative behavior and proactive empathy training.

40|$|Work {{engagement}} is {{an important}} concept because it is associated with optimum worker well-being and productivity. Theoretical linkages with work burnout and consequent associations with the <b>psycho-social</b> work <b>environment</b> have been influential {{in the development of}} assumptions that its antecedents are extrinsic in nature. This qualitative analysis of ten interview responses of professional people, who reported ambivalent scores on the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and disagreement with items of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), reveals that work engagement can be diminished by intrinsic as well as psycho-social factors. The study examined individual stories within three thematic frameworks. Some respondents reported having to adjust their expectations (formed during training or early career experience) to realities encountered in their careers. The second theme focussed on local management contributing to untenable work environments whereby respondents reported that their integrity was compromised. The third theme in the current research investigated the impact of decisions made at 'arms length' by distant management or government legislation that created a heavy burden effectively changing the nature of people’s work and affecting their ability to do their job...|$|R

A mail questionnaire {{was sent to}} 8296 employees in the Social Insurance Organization (SIO) and the Individual and Family Care (IFC) in social welfare agencies. The response rate was 69. 1 % or 5730 persons. Perceived health was measured by a standard form widely used in occupational health services, FHVOMD, here split into four principal components, indic-ating psycho-vegetative, musculo-sceletal, immunological, and gastro-intestinal health. In relation to reference data on other human service personnel (nurses, teachers) and white collar workers (bank and insurance personnel), the studied groups scored much higher on psycho-vegetative symptoms (0 R:s about 3), higher on musculo-sceletal symp-toms (0 R:s about l. 7), but had equal scores on the other symptom types.

The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates for serious injury in the last 12 months. Findings The study used data of the 2007 Djibouti Global School-based Health Survey. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish associations. Of the 1, 777 respondents, 61. 1 % (63. 2 % males and 57. 8 % females) reported having sustained serious injury (SSI). Compared to participants who were not bullied, those who reported being bullied 3 - 9 days per month were more likely to have sustained serious injury in the last 12 months (AOR = 1. 27; 95 % CI [1. 06, 1. 52] for 3 - 5 days of bullying victimization per month, and AOR = 3. 19; 95 % CI [2. 28, 4. 47] for 6 - 9 days per month. Adolescents who were engaged in physical fighting were 47 % (AOR = 1. 47, 95 % CI [1. 40, 1. 55] more likely to have sustained serious injury compared to those who were not engaged in the fighting. Meanwhile, adolescents who used substances (cigarettes, other forms of tobacco or drugs) were 30 % (AOR = 1. 30, 95 % CI [1. 19, 1. 42]) more likely to have sustained serious injury compared to those who did not use substances. Conclusions Serious injury is common among adolescents in Djibouti, and we suggest that health workers attending to injured adolescents explore the patients' <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment.</b> Further, we suggest longitudinal studies where reduction of substance use and bullying may be assessed if they have an impact in reducing serious injury among adolescents. </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{there is}} a {{documented}} social gradient for osteoporosis, the underlying mechanism(s) for that gradient remain unknown. We propose a conceptual model based upon the allostatic load theory, to suggest how DNA methylation (DNAm) might underpin the social gradient in osteoporosis and fracture. We hypothesise that social disadvantage is associated with priming of inflammatory pathways mediated by epigenetic modification that leads to an enhanced state of inflammatory reactivity and oxidative stress, and thus places socially disadvantaged individuals {{at greater risk of}} osteoporotic fracture. METHODS/RESULTS: Based on a review of the literature, we present a conceptual model in which social disadvantage increases stress throughout the lifespan, and engenders a proinflammatory epigenetic signature, leading to a heightened inflammatory state that increases risk for osteoporotic fracture in disadvantaged groups that are chronically stressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our model proposes that, in addition to the direct biological effects exerted on bone by factors such as physical activity and nutrition, the recognised socially patterned risk factors for osteoporosis also act via epigenetic-mediated dysregulation of inflammation. DNAm is a dynamic modulator of gene expression with considerable relevance to the field of osteoporosis. Elucidating the extent to which this epigenetic mechanism transduces the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> to increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture may yield novel entry points for intervention {{that can be used to}} reduce individual and population-wide risks for osteoporotic fracture. Specifically, an epigenetic evidence-base may strengthen the importance of lifestyle modification and stress reduction programs, and help to reduce health inequities across social groups. MINI ABSTRACT: Our conceptual model proposes how DNA methylation might underpin the social gradient in osteoporotic fracture. We suggest that social disadvantage is associated with priming of inflammatory signalling pathways, which is mediated by epigenetic modifications, leading to a chronically heightened inflammatory state that places disadvantaged individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline a three-stage process for {{engaging}} with students to develop school level indicators of health; in sequential class groups students first generated, then categorised indicators and finally developed schematic representations of their analyses. There is a political and practical need to develop appropriate indicators for health-promoting schools. As key stakeholders in education, students have the right to be fully engaged in this process. Design/methodology/approach - The sample in this paper comprised 164 students aged 16 - 17 years in three medium-sized Dublin schools. In the first classroom, students answered the question "If you moved to a new school, what would it need to have to be a healthy place?" on individual flashcards. In the second classroom students classified the flashcards into groups using a variation of the card game "snap". In the third classroom, students discussed the relationships between the developed categories and determined how the categories should be presented. These procedures were repeated twice in three schools, resulting in six developed schemata. Findings - The paper finds that the six sets of categories showed remarkable similarity - physical aspects of the school predominated but emotional and social health issues also emerged as potential indicators. The schema demonstrated the holistic perspectives of students. They illustrate the importance of relationships and the physical and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> within schools. Originality/value - The paper illustrates that students can productively engage in the process of indicator development and have the potential to act as full stakeholders in health-promoting schools. The methods enabled student control over the data generation, analysis and presentation phases of the research, and provided a positive, fun experience for both students and researchers...|$|E
40|$|Nursing is a {{practice}} based discipline. A supportive environment {{has been identified}} as important for the transfer of learning in the clinical context. The aim of the paper was to assess undergraduate nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the psychosocial characteristics of clinical learning environments within three different clinical placement models. Three hundred and eight-nine undergraduate nursing students rated their perceptions of the <b>psycho-social</b> learning <b>environment</b> using a Clinical Learning Environment Inventory. There were 16 respondents in the Preceptor model category, 269 respondents in the Facilitation model category and 114 respondents in the clinical education unit model across 25 different clinical areas in one tertiary facility. The most positive social climate was associated with the preceptor model. On all subscales the median score was rated higher than the two other models. When clinical education units were compared with the standard facilitation model the median score was rated higher in all of the subscales in the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory. These results suggest that while preceptoring is an effective clinical placement strategy that provides psycho-social support for students, clinical education units that are more sustainable through their placement of greater numbers of students, can provide greater psycho-social support for students than traditional models...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of labor market flexibilization, nonstandard employment has expanded and standard employment has declined. In many cases, these transformations are best described as an evolution toward precarious employment, which is considered {{a major determinant of}} health and health inequalities. Using the Employment Precariousness Scale (EPRES), this study aims to determine the prevalence of precarious employment in the waged and salaried workforce in Spain, to describe its distribution across social groups defined by occupational class, gender, age, and immigrant status, and to estimate the proportion of cases of poor mental health poten-tially attributable to employment precariousness. Data are from the <b>Psycho-social</b> Work <b>Environment</b> Survey conducted in 2004 – 5 on a representa-tive sample of the Spanish workforce. Findings indicate a high prevalence of employment precariousness, affecting nearly 6. 5 million workers, with almost 900, 000 of them exposed to high precariousness. These estimates are higher than the proportion of fixed-term employment reported in regular statistical sources but may today be an underestimation, given the current economic crisis. Additionally, a significant proportion of cases of poor mental health are potentially attributable to employment precariousness. Both the proportion of cases of poor mental health attributable to and the prevalence of employment precariousness were highly unequally distributed across the study sample, indicating that this may be a significant contributor to social inequalities in mental health...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we explore the {{importance}} of 'everyday discrimination' and other psycho-social variables for psychological wellbeing, considering differences according to age, gender and socio-economic position. Using employee survey data collected within Australian organisations we explore a statistically reliable model {{of the relationship between}} aspects of the <b>psycho-social</b> work <b>environment,</b> psychological wellbeing and job satisfaction. The employee survey was carried out in two phases during mid- 2007 and mid- 2008 in a national university, two international freight terminals of a large international airline, a national manufacturing company and the roadside assistance division of a motoring organisation. Structural Equation Modelling was used to configure a model including psycho-social factors: respect, support, training, job insecurity and personally meaningful work. Everyday discrimination and consultation with supervisor were considered in terms of their direct effect on psychological wellbeing and job satisfaction and their indirect effect via the psycho-social factors enumerated above. Importantly, this generalised model attempts to describe the interrelations of these factors effectively for various age groups, gender and socio-economic position.

A further validation study with an independent sample will be required to verify the model proposed in this article.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{explanatory}} power of two theoretical frameworks in regard to the work engagement of 312 Queensland teachers from non-government schools. The first theoretical model is the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory which suggests that work engagement will be evident if people report an abundance of resources in their work environment. The second perspective is self-determination theory (SDT) which suggests that work engagement will be evident if people are able to satisfy their personal psychological needs within the work environment. Design/methodology/approach - The current research collected data from the same participants on two occasions with a six-month interval. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the research hypotheses both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Findings - It was found that the SDT provided the more compelling explanation for work engagement, in that career satisfaction (rather than job satisfaction) was a robust predictor of work engagement, although some evidence was also found for a contribution of the psycho-social work environment (supporting the JD-R model) in teachers' work engagement or burnout. It was concluded that these two theoretical perspectives are compatible. Practical implications - It is recommended that future studies of work engagement include some measurement of people's satisfaction that the career they have chosen fulfils their personal aspirations. Social implications - The theories of SDT (work engagement as a fulfilment of psychological needs) and JD-R (work engagement as a balance of job demands and resources), while coming from different directions appear to be compatible, with each perspective enriching the other and affording administrators a more complete understanding of dynamics affecting the psychological health of teaching staff. Originality/value - Previous work involving the JD-R and work engagement has focused on the immediate <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> of the workplace. The current research finds that career satisfaction predicts all dimensions of work engagement in cross-sectional analysis and over time. This supports insights from SDT and suggests that a more complete understanding of the dynamics of work engagement must include people's opportunity to redress psychological needs within the workplace.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that African Americans (AA) experience greater social stressors than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), {{the extent to which}} early life adversity and cumulative social stressors such as perceived discrimination, neighborhood violence, subjective social status, and socioeconomic status contribute to disparity in coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke between AA and NHW are not well understood. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a conceptual model based upon McEwen’s Allostatic Load Model suggesting how the relationships among social context, early life adversity, psychological stress, inflammation, adaptation, and epigenetic signature may contribute to the development of CHD and ischemic stroke. We hypothesize that social context and prior life adversity are associated with genome-wide as well as gene-specific epigenetic modifications that confer a proinflammatory epigenetic signature that mediates an enhanced proinflammatory state. Exposure to early life adversity, coupled with an increased allostatic load places individuals at greater risk for inflammatory based diseases, such as CHD and ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Based on a review of the literature, we propose a novel model in which social context and psychological stress, particularly during early life, engenders a proinflammatory epigenetic signature, which drives a heightened inflammatory state that increases risk for CHD and stroke. In the proposed model, a proinflammatory epigenetic signature and adaptation serve as mediator variables. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the extent to which epigenetic signature bridges the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment</b> with inflammation and risk for CHD may yield novel biomarkers that can be used to assess risk, development, and progression of CHD/stroke. Epigenetic biomarkers may be used to inform preventive and treatment strategies that can be targeted to those most vulnerable, or to those with early signs of CHD, such as endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, epigenetic approaches, including lifestyle modification and stress reduction programs, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, offer promise to reduce health inequity linked to social disadvantage, as emerging evidence demonstrates that adverse epigenetic marks can be reversed...|$|E
40|$|Implementing health-promoting {{programmes}} for {{the most}} excluded and at-risk social groups forms {{a key part of}} any efforts to address underserved populations and reduce health inequalities in society. However, many at-risk children, particularly children in Deaf communities, are not reached, or are poorly served, by health-promoting programmes within the school setting. This is so because schools are effective as health-promoting environments for d/Deaf children {{only to the extent that}} they properly address their unique communication needs and ensure they are both able and enabled to learn in a communication-rich and supportive <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environment.</b> This article examines how the usually separate strands of school health promotion and d/Deaf education might be woven together and illustrates research with Deaf community members that involves them and gives their perspective. The primary objective of this study was to map Deaf pilot bilingual education programmes in Spain—one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations. (2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Resolution A/RES/ 61 / 106.) —with particular attention to their compliance to the Convention’s article 24. Following pre-testing, 516 key informants were surveyed by mail (response rate: 42. 08 %) by using a snowball key-informant approach, within a Participatory Action Research framework, at a national, regional and local level. The results show that although some schools have achieved recommended standards, bilingual programmes are in various stages of formulation and implementation and are far from being equally distributed across the country, with only four regions concentrating more than 70 % of these practices. This uneven geographical distribution of programmes probably reflects more basic differences in the priority given by regions, provinces, and municipalities to the Deaf community’s needs and rights as an important policy objective and may reinforce or widen inequalities by favouring or discriminating rather than achieving access and equity for this noticeably overlooked community.

40|$|Psychosocial {{circumstances}} {{during early}} life are increasingly recognized as crucial, {{not only for}} the growing individual but also for health throughout life. A possible mechanism could be physiologic dysregulation due to stress. Cortisol in hair is a new biomarker that allows assessment of long-term activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between early stress, levels of cortisol in hair and health among children in different <b>psycho-social</b> <b>environments.</b> The ABIS-study is a prospective population-based cohort study of every child born in southeast Sweden between Oct 1 1997 and Oct 1 1999 (N= 21, 700) in which approximately 17, 000 families (79 %) participated. The studies presented in Papers I, III and IV were based on ABIS data on children aged 1, 3, 5 and 8 years concerning stress related psychosocial variables as well as hair samples and diabetes related autoantibodies. Papers I and IV compared a subsample (n= 2, 448) from two different social environments. Paper III consisted of a subsample of 100 children as well as their mothers. Paper II covered 99 university students. Paper I showed that the risk for diabetes-related autoantibodies, both against GADA and IAG 2 A (> 95 % cut off), was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) among children from the blue-collar than from the white-collar city. This difference persisted still after adjustment for other previously documented risk factors. In paper II the method of measuring cortisol concentrations in hair was developed and mean cortisol levels were significantly related to serious life events (p= 0. 045) among the students. Paper III demonstrated that, in children from one to eight years of age, cortisol levels in hair decreased over time and correlated to each succeeding age, between years 1 and 3 (r= 0. 30,p= 0. 002), 3 and 5 (r= 0. 39, p= 0. 001), and 5 and 8 (r= 0. 44, p= 0. 001). Repeated measures gave a significant linear association over time (p= 0. 001). Maternal hair cortisol levels during the second and third trimester and child hair cortisol at year 1 and 3 was also significantly associated. Paper IV showed that children with prenatal psychosocial exposures had higher infant cortisol levels in hair (B= 0. 40, p< 0. 0001, adjusted for gender and size for gestational age) in a dose-response manner and were more often (p≤ 0. 05) affected by 12 of the 14 most common childhood diagnoses with a general pattern of rising ORs. In conclusion, the findings in this thesis showed that children born into an environment fraught with adverse psychosocial exposures seem to have an increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It appears to be persistent throughout early childhood and affect health negatively, as evidenced through common childhood diseases and levels of autoantibodies. A widespread and dose response-like effect of adverse psychosocial circumstances was seen on the different outcomes studied throughout this thesis. This supports the model of physiologic dysregulation as a plausible pathway in how the duration and number of early detrimental exposures act as a trajectory to health disparities. Knowledge of these relationships could be valuable in selecting preventive measures, not least in primary care. Moreover, given the prolonged nature of exposure to a stressful social environment, the novel biomarker of cortisol in hair appears to be a useful aid in studies on how long-term stress affects health and may be particularly relevant when applied to research on children...|$|R
40|$|Background Regular {{physical}} activity {{can be effective}} not only in preventing diabetes and managing its complications but also be effective in minimizing {{the risk of developing}} other chronic diseases among diabetics. The overall aim of study was to determine probable causes of change in {{physical activity}} so as to generate evidences for future interventions and to identify psychosocial covariates of self reported physical activity in recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetes cases. Methods Participants n= 478 (239 intervention arm and 239 control arm) of an observational cohort were randomized into the ADDITION Plus trial and were recruited from 36 practices in East Anglia region. Participants were people recently diagnosed with diabetes (screen detected and clinically diagnosed within the preceding 3 years were individually randomized) and were between the age group of 40 - 69 years, (mean age 59. 2 years). The self reported data regarding physical activity was measured at baseline and one year were used. Demographic and psychosocial (treatment control, consequences, anxiety) covariates were assessed at the baseline. Linear univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis was used to quantify the associations between demographic and psychosocial correlates. Results: With regard to the psychosocial correlates(except for participants’ perceptions about the consequences of diabetes), no significant associations with physical activity were found. Treatment control and anxiety failed to predict physical activity. Conclusion The result suggests to further investigate the change in physical activity by including other variables related to demography, other <b>psycho-social</b> and <b>environment</b> influences. Based on the available literature, it is suggested that other factors were found consistently associated with physical activity such as self efficacy, attitude, sensation seeking, family-friend social support, goal orientation, motivation could be studied...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Shoulder {{disorders}} in the occupational environment {{have been widely}} studied, but the quality of research and methodology applied vary. Little {{has been done to}} ascertain whether shoulder pain in female repetitive workers is due to any verifiable pathology, or to compare findings with the general population. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the prevalence of self-reported shoulder pain in a group of female supermarket cashiers and in the general female population using a standardized questionnaire. Shoulder pain prevalence was then compared to imaging findings in order to assess specific and non-specific pain prevalence. Material and Methods: 196 cashiers and 302 controls filled in a standardized shoulder questionnaire and underwent an imaging examination of a shoulder. Results: The prevalence of shoulder pain was significantly higher in the group of cashiers (46. 4 %) than in the general population (25. 5 %) (OR = 1. 821; 95 % CI: 1. 426 – 2. 325). Specific pain prevalence was higher among the controls (19. 5 %) than among the cashiers (13. 2 %). Conclusions: The more frequent reports of shoulder pain in the supermarket cashiers are not correlated with a higher prevalence of imaging abnormalities. The causes of these more frequent complaints should be probably sought in the <b>psycho-social</b> and occupational <b>environment...</b>|$|R
