5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1982 {{tensions}} had risen again and the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov on June 3, 1982, prompted Israel to launch Operation Peace for Galilee. 69 Squadron flew 27 sorties in the <b>preparation</b> <b>phase</b> for the operation, from June 4 to the actual beginning of the invasion on June 6. The first of these were carried out {{on the afternoon of}} June 4, when a 4-ship formation struck the stadium in Beirut, used as a PLO weapons depot. Once Israeli ground forces began pushing into Lebanon, 69 Squadron provided close air support. One aircraft was damaged by enemy flak {{on the first day of}} the invasion, and two suffered landing accidents, but with poor weather and a shortage of targets, there was initially little fighting to be done. This changed on June 8 when it became apparent the Syrian forces in Lebanon would have to be engaged, and that same afternoon two squadron Phantoms bombed a Syrian electronic warfare facility on Jabel Barouk.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the <b>preparation</b> <b>phase</b> continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E

25|$|The Lithuanian men's {{national}} team automatically qualified into the 2016 Summer Olympics {{without the need}} {{to compete in the}} qualifying tournament after being finalists of EuroBasket 2015. Lithuania, China, Australia and the United States are the only countries to compete in all the Olympic Games since 1992.

2500|$|During the <b>preparation</b> <b>phase</b> {{of a plan}} {{to assist}} the CRU in {{clearing}} the compound, NZSAS trooper Corporal Douglas Grant was mortally wounded by insurgent fire. Initially it was unclear where Grant had fallen, so Smith [...] "with no concern for his personal safety", and despite receiving a significant volume of insurgent machine gun and rifle fire, moved into a position to enable him to confirm Corporal Grant’s exact location. After being ordered to wait to receive a ballistic shield, Smith leapt over a wall and moved across exposed and open ground to the position where Corporal Grant had been shot. He then commenced treating Grant using his additional advanced medical skills until he could be evacuated from the compound.|$|E

2500|$|Questioning the {{credentials}} {{of the participants}} (despite the contribution in the <b>preparation</b> <b>phase</b> of Biosphere 2 of worldwide top-level scientists and among others the Russian Academy of Sciences), Marc Cooper wrote that [...] "the group that built, conceived, and directs the Biosphere project is not a group of high-tech researchers {{on the cutting edge}} of science but a clique of recycled theater performers that evolved out of an authoritarianand decidedly non-scientificpersonality cult". He was referring to the Synergia Ranch in New Mexico, where indeed many of the Biospherians did practice theater under John Allen's leadership, and began to develop the ideas behind Biosphere 2. However, the original Biosphere 2 Science Advisory Committee, chaired by Tom Lovejoy of the Smithsonian Institution, in the report of August 1992 reported: [...] "The committee is in agreement that the conception and construction of Biosphere 2 were acts of vision and courage. The scale of Biosphere 2 is unique and Biosphere 2 is already providing unexpected scientific results not possible through other means (notably the documented, unexpected decline in atmospheric oxygen levels.) Biosphere 2 will make important scientific contributions in the fields of biogeochemical cycling, the ecology of closed ecological systems, and restoration ecology." [...] Furthermore, Columbia University assembled outside scientists to evaluate the potential of the facility, and concluded the following: [...] "A group of world-class scientists got together and decided the Biosphere 2 facility is an exceptional laboratory for addressing critical questions relative to the future of Earth and its environment." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{segmentation}} of {{digitized data}} to divide a {{free form surface}} into patches {{is one of the}} key steps required to perform a reverse engineering process of an object. To this end, discrete curvature approximations are introduced as the basis of a segmentation process that lead to a decomposition of digitized data into areas that will help the construction of parametric surface patches. The approach proposed relies on the use of a polyhedral representation of the object built from the digitized data input. Then, it is shown how noise reduction, edge swapping techniques and adapted remeshing schemes can participate to different <b>preparation</b> <b>phases</b> to provide a geometry that highlights useful characteristics for the segmentation process. The segmentation process is performed with various approximations of discrete curvatures evaluated on the polyhedron produced during the <b>preparation</b> <b>phases.</b> The segmentation process proposed involves two phases: the identification of characteristic polygonal lines and the identification of polyhedral areas useful for a patch construction process. Discrete curvature criteria are adapted to each phase and the concept of invariant evaluation of curvatures is introduced to generate criteria that are constant over equivalent meshes. A description of the segmentation procedure is provided together with examples of results for free form object surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring of {{chemical}} and physical groundwater parameters {{has been carried out}} worldwide in seismogenic areas with the aim to test possible correlations between their spatial and temporal variations and strain processes. Uranium (U) groundwater anomalies were observed during the <b>preparation</b> <b>phases</b> of the recent L'Aquila earthquake of 6 th April 2009 in the cataclastic rocks near the overthrust fault crossing the deep underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The results suggest that U may be used as a potential strain indicator of geodynamic processes occurring before the seismic swarm and the main earthquake shock. Moreover, this justifies the different radon patterns before and after the main shock: the radon releases during and after the earthquake are much than more during the preparatory period because the process does not include only the microfracturing induced by stress-strain activation, but also radon increases accompanying groundwater U anomalies.
