2500|$|To {{conduct an}} atom probe {{experiment}} {{a very sharp}} needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage {{is applied to the}} specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. [...] Typically the <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} 24 hour {{growth hormone}} secretion by intermittent 20 minute blood sampling in 34 prepubertal patients with Turner's syndrome, aged 4. 3 - 12. 4 years. Growth hormone profiles were analysed by the PULSAR programme and results expressed as {{the sum of}} growth hormone <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Six patients had abnormal growth hormone pulse frequencies. In the remaining 28, growth hormone <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes</b> declined significantly with increasing age, {{but there was no}} correlation between growth hormone <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and growth rates. Concentrations of insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) rose with age but did not correlate with either growth rates or growth hormone secretion. Fifteen patients were given oxandrolone and 11 low dose ethinyl oestradiol. Both agents increased height velocity without increasing growth hormone secretion. We conclude that the relation between growth hormone secretion and growth in Turner's syndrome is less certain than in normal children. End organ resistance is probably due to a skeletal dysplasia. Both oxandrolone and low dose ethinyl oestradiol improve the growth of girls with Turner's syndrome, but their mechanism of action remains uncertain...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of brief duration current pulses on the spontaneous electrical activity of embryonic chick atrial heart cell aggregates was investigated experimentally and theoretically. A pulse could either delay or advance {{the time of}} the action potential subsequent to the pulse depending upon the time in the control cycle at which it was applied. The perturbed cycle length throughout the transition from delay to advance was a continuous function of {{the time of the}} pulse for small <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> but was discontinuous for larger <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Similar results were obtained using a model of the ionic currents which underlie spontaneous activity in these preparations. The primary ion current components which contribute to phase resetting are the fast inward sodium ion current, INa, and the primary, potassium ion repolarization current, IX 1. The origin of the discontinuity in phase resetting of the model can be elucidated by a detailed examination of the current-voltage trajectories in the region of the phase response curve where the discontinuity occurs...|$|R

Multiscale entropy (MSE) of photoplethysmographic (PPG) <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes</b> may differ by diabetes status and hand activity. Of a middle-to-old aged and right-handed cohort without clinical cardiovascular disease, we controlled age, sex, and weight {{to select the}} unaffected (no type 2 diabetes, n= 36), the well-controlled diabetes (HbA 1 c < 8 %, n= 22), and the poorly controlled diabetes (HbA 1 c ≥ 8 %, n= 22) groups. MSEs were calculated from consecutive 1, 500 [*]PPG <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of bilateral index fingertips. The small-,[*][*]medium-, and large-scale MSEs were defined as the average of scale 1 (MSE 1), scales 2 – 4 (MSE 2 – 4), and scales 5 – 10 (MSE 5 – 10), respectively. Intra- and intergroups were compared by one- and two-sample t-tests, respectively. The dominant hand MSE 5 – 10 was lower in the poorly controlled diabetes group than the well-controlled diabetes and the unaffected (1. 28 versus 1. 52 and 1. 56, p= 0. 019 and 0. 001, resp.) groups, whereas the nondominant hand MSE 5 – 10 was lower in the well- and poorly controlled diabetes groups than the unaffected group (1. 35 and 1. 29 versus 1. 58, p= 0. 008 and 0. 005, resp.).
