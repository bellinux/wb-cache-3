There, he became the first pilot to launch a plane off a U.S. battleship, and the first pilot to launch a military aircraft off any ship, motivating the United States to begin developing the first military aircraft carriers. The idea was inspired by experiments in 1910 when stunt aviator Eugene Ely launched a Curtiss Model D (non-military) biplane off of a custom platform built onto the United States Cruiser USS Birmingham. Haviland's idea, which he had proposed to Captain Nathan C. Twining on the USS Texas (BB-35), was to build a 40 ft, 12 ft runway of timbers lashed together on the Number 2 guns of the Battleship's forward deck. His Sopwith Camel biplane would then be winched down on the runway and its wheels held by a bridle to be released at Haviland's command, after the plane's propeller had sufficient speed for takeoff. [...] "Haviland climbed into the cockpit and revved and raced the plane's motor until it seemed to the nearby sailors that the <b>prop</b> <b>blast</b> and vibration would tear the fuselage apart.

50|$|To {{people who}} are close to a <b>blast</b> <b>incident,</b> such as bomb {{disposal}} technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: overpressure (shock), fragmentation, impact and heat. Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation includes the shrapnel described above but can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source. This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts. The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being {{set in motion by}} the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as incendiary agents projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a bomb suit or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and foot protection, can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.|$|R

40|$|Purpose The role of {{ear canal}} in {{transmitting}} blast waves {{to the brain}} is not clear. The goal of this work is to characterize the influence of ear canal on blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury through a computational approach. Methods A three-dimensional human head model with single-side ear canal details was reconstructed from computed tomography images. The ear canal was positioned either facing the <b>incident</b> <b>blast</b> wave or facing away from the blast wave. Results The blast wave-head interaction has demonstrated that the overpressure within the ear canal was substantially amplified when the ear directly faced the blast wave. When it faced away from the blast wave, the overpressure within the ear canal was less than the actual <b>incident</b> <b>blast</b> pressure. Regardless of the substantial pressure differences within the ear canal induced by the blast wave, the resulting intracranial pressures were almost the same for both cases.

Blasting operations produce both toxic and nontoxic gaseous products; the toxic products are mainly carbon monoxide (CO) and the oxides of nitrogen (NOx).

40|$|A blast event {{lies within}} the social system and {{involves}} people. Hence vulnerability to blast loading {{can be considered a}} socio-technical or "soft" system, where our ability to model and hence predict bounds on behaviour is poor. Even where the "hard" part of the system is concerned (i. e. structural response), blast loading is difficult to idealize and its effects cannot be fully predicted. For all the above reasons, the analysis of vulnerability to blast loading must be grounded in past experience. Grounded Theory is a way in which theory is built from phenomena. Theory is considered as being grounded in phenomena; the reliability of data forms the basis for claiming the phenomena exist. Once the specific phenomena in the different case studies have been identified, they can be generalized into concepts. Coherence among concepts is the appropriate grounds for theory formation and acceptance. Grounded Theory is "explicity emergent" and does not test a hypothesis. For the above reasons, Grounded Theory was used to structure this ill-structured research problem that also required a reliance on experience. The main objective {{of the study was to}} construct a hierarchy of concepts, which would constitute aspects that contribute to building vulnerability, using case histories. "Vulnerability" is treated as the top level concept, itself consisting of other concepts. Ten case studies of blast loading. were chosen. These represented a variety of building uses, structural form and construction material, and also reflected a variety of explosive types and different locations worldwide. Data (e. g. statements) from case histories were used to identify phenomena. It was possible to extract 63 phenomena relating to building vulnerability from these case studies; some concepts were repeated in the case study phenomena. It was observed that the concepts lent themselves to hierarchical structuring. Some of the concepts could be grouped into a single concept that "emerged" from the former. The 63 original phenomena were used to generate 52 concepts, at various levels in the hierarchy. The hierarchy that was constructed consisted of seven levels. Each emergent concept can be called a "holon" - i. e. it is a whole when considering its constituent lower level concepts, and a part when considering an emergent higher level concept it contributes towards. The top levels of the hierarchy obtained differed somewhat from those that were previously constructed using "top down" approaches based largely on literature surveys; this demonstrates the value of a "bottom up" approach that seeks to "listen to the data" from case studies. Level 2 of the hierarchy shows that the vulnerability due to blast effects is a social process where context too plays a key role; hence due consideration must be given to context when seeking to assess or reduce vulnerability. Some of the concepts that were frequently repeated in the case study phenomena are "advance warning", "standoff distance", "nature of terrorism", "confinement", "building layout", "structural redundancy", "security" and "glass"; a method of weighting is required to account for the importance of such concepts (reflected in their repetition) within the hierarchy. The assessment procedure combines existing numerical models as well as ways of processing vague information and expert judgments. It is also a very flexible tool which allows the handling of various types of artifacts which are significantly different from past experience. Experts will use linguistic assessments to measure the evidence about the dependability of holons to sustain their function in a particular <b>blast</b> <b>incident.</b> Linguistic assessments are matched to interval probability numbers. An interval number is used to capture, in practical manner, features of fuzziness and incompleteness. Interval Probability Theory (IPT) is used to combine evidential support values throughout the hierarchy. A computer implementation of the model was developed to show its potential for practical use. The software developed was used to apply the methodology to a building located in the heart of Colombo. The interpretation of results shows the potential of the model to be used as a management tool for practical decision making...|$|R

40|$|Blast-induced TBI {{has gained}} {{prominence}} {{in recent years}} due to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet {{little is known about}} the mechanical effects of blasts on the human head; no injury thresholds have been established for blast effects on the head, and even direct transmission of the shock wave to the intracranial cavity is disputed. Still less is known about how personal protective equipment such as the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) affect the brain's response to blasts. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the mechanical response of the human brain to blasts and to study the effect of the ACH on the blast response of the head. To that end, a biofidelic computational model of the human head consisting of 11 distinct structures was developed from high-resolution medical imaging data. The model, known as the DVBIC/MIT Full Head Model (FHM), was subjected to <b>blasts</b> with <b>incident</b> overpressures of 6 atm and 30 atm and to a 5 m/s lateral impact. Results from the simulations demonstrate that blasts can penetrate the intracranial cavity and generate intracranial pressures that exceed the pressures produced during impact; the results suggest that blasts can plausibly directly cause traumatic brain injury. Subsequent investigation of the effect of the ACH on the blast response of the head found that the ACH provided minimal mitigation of blast effects. Results from the simulations conducted with the FHM extended to include the ACH suggest that the ACH can slightly reduce peak pressure magnitudes and delay peak pressure arrival times, but the benefits are minimal because the ACH does not protect the main pathways of load transmission from the blast to brain tissue. A more effective blast mitigation strategy might involve altering the helmet design to more completely surround the head in order to protect it from direct exposure to blast waves. by Michelle K.

2500|$|The {{final report}} of the {{commission}} was tabled in the Assembly on 18 May 2000. The report indicted the police by stating [...] "the lapse {{on the part of}} the police personnel, deputed for surveillance and checks, in discharging their duties more vigorously, vigilantly and intelligently". It also quoted that [...] "for surveillance and checks, had been more vigilant before the bomb <b>blasts,</b> the tragic <b>incidents...</b> could have been averted". The report stated that several state and central vigilance warnings were discarded by the city police. The report concluded that the Muslim fundamentalist organisation Al Ummah, based in Tamil Nadu, hatched a conspiracy to [...] "avenge" [...] the killings of 18 Muslims during earlier riots. The report quoted that three human bombs named Amanuallah, Melapalayam Amjath Ali and Rafique alias Shanmugam, were targeting L.K. Advani, but could not penetrate the security cardon. The investigations found that the group used the videotapes of the deceased during the riots to mobilise sympathy and garner financial support from Muslim countries, mainly those comprising the Gulf. The report made several recommendations like deploying checkposts in sensitive areas, proscribing organisations acting against law, setting up separate intelligence wing and methods to evaluate feedback of lower level police officers. The government accepted the commission's findings in principle and stated that specific recommendations would be examined in detail by the respective departments before passing orders.|$|R
40|$|Blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury is the most prevalent military injury in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet {{little is known about}} the mechanical effects of blasts on the human head, and still less is known about how personal protective equipment affects the brain’s response to blasts. In this study we investigated the effect of the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and a conceptual face shield on the propagation of stress waves within the brain tissue following blast events. We used a sophisticated computational framework for simulating coupled fluid–solid dynamic interactions and a three-dimensional biofidelic finite element model of the human head and intracranial contents combined with a detailed model of the ACH and a conceptual face shield. Simulations were conducted in which the unhelmeted head, head with helmet, and head with helmet and face shield were exposed to a frontal <b>blast</b> wave with <b>incident</b> overpressure of 10  atm. Direct transmission of stress waves into the intracranial cavity was observed in the unprotected head and head with helmet simulations. Compared to the unhelmeted head, the head with helmet experienced slight mitigation of intracranial stresses. This suggests that the existing ACH does not significantly contribute to mitigating blast effects, but does not worsen them either. By contrast, the helmet and face shield combination impeded direct transmission of stress waves to the face, resulting in a delay in the transmission of stresses to the intracranial cavity and lower intracranial stresses. This suggests a possible strategy for mitigating blast waves often associated with military concussion...|$|R
