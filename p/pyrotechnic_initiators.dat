50|$|A <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>{{initiator}}</b> (also initiator or igniter) is {{a device}} containing a pyrotechnic composition used primarily to ignite other, more difficult-to-ignite materials, e.g. thermites, gas generators, and solid-fuel rockets.

50|$|<b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiators</b> {{are often}} {{controlled}} electrically (called electro-pyrotechnic initiators), e.g. using a heated bridgewire or a bridge resistor.

An example of such pyrotechnic initiator is an electric match.|$|E
50|$|Ignition of a {{thermite}} reaction normally requires a sparkler or easily obtainable magnesium ribbon, but may require persistent efforts, as ignition can be unreliable and unpredictable. These temperatures cannot be reached with conventional black powder fuses, nitrocellulose rods, detonators, <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiators,</b> or other common igniting substances. Even when the thermite is {{hot enough to}} glow bright red, it will not ignite as it must be at or near white-hot to initiate the reaction. It is possible to start the reaction using a propane torch if done correctly.|$|E
40|$|NASA's Galileo {{mission to}} Jupiter {{will consist of}} a Jovian orbiter and an {{atmospheric}} entry probe. The power for the probe will be derived from two primary power sources. The main source is composed of three Li-SO 2 battery modules containing 13 D-size cell strings per module. These are required to retain capacity for 7. 5 years, support a 150 day clock, and a 7 hour mission sequence of increasing loads from 0. 15 to 9. 5 amperes for the last 30 minutes. This main power source is supplemented by two thermal batteries (CaCrO 4 -Ca) for use in firing the <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiators</b> during the atmospheric staging events.

50|$|A bridgewire, {{sometimes}} spelled as bridge wire, {{also known}} as a hot bridge wire (HBW) is a relatively thin resistance wire used to set off a pyrotechnic composition serving as <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator.</b> By passing of electric current it is heated to a high temperature that starts the exothermic chemical reaction of the attached composition. After successful firing, the bridgewire melts, resulting in an open circuit.|$|R
50|$|The {{solid rocket}} motor {{ignition}} commands were {{issued by the}} orbiter's computers through the master events controllers to the hold-down <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> controllers (PICs) on the mobile launcher platform. They provided the ignition to the hold-down NSDs. The launch processing system monitored the SRB hold-down PICs for low voltage during the last 16 seconds before launch. PIC low voltage would initiate a launch hold.|$|R
50|$|The major {{components}} of a cryogenic rocket engine are the combustion chamber (thrust chamber), <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator,</b> fuel injector, fuel cryopumps, oxidizer cryopumps, gas turbine, cryo valves, regulators, the fuel tanks, and rocket engine nozzle. In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, cryogenic rocket engines (or, generally, all liquid-propellant engines) are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methods by which NASA has designed, built, tested, and certified pyrotechnic devices for high reliability operation in extreme environments and illustrates the potential {{applications in the}} oil and gas industry. NASA's extremely successful application of pyrotechnics is built upon documented procedures and test methods that have been maintained and developed since the Apollo Program. Standards are managed and rigorously enforced for performance margins, redundancy, lot sampling, and personnel safety. The pyrotechnics utilized in spacecraft include such devices as small initiators and detonators with the power of a shotgun shell, detonating cord systems for explosive energy transfer across many feet, precision linear shaped charges for breaking structural membranes, and booster charges to actuate valves and pistons. NASA's pyrotechnics program {{is one of the more}} successful in the history of Human Spaceflight. No pyrotechnic device developed in accordance with NASA's Human Spaceflight standards has ever failed in flight use. NASA's <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiators</b> work reliably in temperatures as low as - 420 F. Each of the 135 Space Shuttle flights fired 102 of these initiators, some setting off multiple pyrotechnic devices, with never a failure. The recent landing on Mars of the Opportunity rover fired 174 of NASA's <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiators</b> to complete the famous ' 7 minutes of terror. ' Even after traveling through extreme radiation and thermal environments on the way to Mars, every one of them worked. These initiators have fired on the surface of Titan. NASA's design controls, procedures, and processes produce the most reliable pyrotechnics in the world. Application of pyrotechnics designed and procured in this manner could enable the energy industry's emergency equipment, such as shutoff valves and deep-sea blowout preventers, to be left in place for years in extreme environments and still be relied upon to function when needed, thus greatly enhancing safety and operational availability...|$|E
50|$|Electric matches {{consist of}} two parts, a bridgewire and a pyrogen. The bridgewire is a heating element, {{typically}} {{in the form}} of a loop or coil of thin wire, which is encased in the pyrogen, which is a quantity of readily ignited <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> composition. If the pyrogen is sufficiently conductive, it can act as the bridgewire as well. Electric matches also come with provisions for attaching an electric current source, and they may be provided with a protective cover and/or a means to attach them to the device to be ignited.|$|R
50|$|SRB {{ignition}} {{can occur}} {{only when a}} manual lock pin from each SRB safe and arm device has been removed. The ground crew removes the pin during prelaunch activities. At T minus five minutes, the SRB safe and arm device is rotated to the arm position. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are at or above 90-percent rated thrust, no SSME fail and/or SRB ignition <b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>Initiator</b> Controller (PIC) low voltage is indicated {{and there are no}} holds from the Launch Processing System (LPS).|$|R
5000|$|NanoFoil is {{the name}} trademarked by the Indium Corporation for a {{reactive}} multi-layer foil material, {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> of two mutually reactive metals, aluminium and nickel, sputtered to form thin layers to create a laminated foil. On initiation by a heat pulse, delivered by a bridge wire, a laser pulse, an electric spark, a flame, or by other means, the aluminium and nickel undergo self-sustaining exothermic reaction, producing an intermetallic compound nickel aluminide (NiAl). The reaction occurs in solid and liquid phase only, without releasing any gas.|$|R
50|$|Delay composition, {{also called}} delay charge or delay train, is a {{pyrotechnic}} composition, {{a sort of}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator,</b> a mixture of oxidizer and fuel that burns in a slow, constant rate {{that should not be}} significantly dependent on temperature and pressure. Delay compositions are used to introduce a delay into the firing train, e.g. to properly sequence firing of fireworks, to delay firing of ejection charges in e.g. model rockets, or to introduce a few seconds of time between triggering a hand grenade and its explosion. Typical delay times range between several milliseconds and several seconds.|$|R
50|$|For the <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator,</b> see Shock tube detonatorThe {{shock tube}} is an {{instrument}} used to replicate and direct blast waves at a sensor or {{a model in}} order to simulate actual explosions and their effects, usually on a smaller scale. Shock tubes (and related impulse facilities such as shock tunnels, expansion tubes, and expansion tunnels) {{can also be used}} to study aerodynamic flow under a wide range of temperatures and pressures that are difficult to obtain in other types of testing facilities. Shock tubes are also used to investigate compressible flow phenomena and gas phase combustion reactions. More recently, shock tubes have been used in biomedical research to study how biological specimens are affected by blast waves.|$|R

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|R
40|$|A Miniaturised <b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>Initiator</b> (MPI) is {{a device}} used to ignite a charge. It is reduced in scale {{in order to}} be {{suitable}} for application in miniaturised satellites. Miniaturising the system presents challenges requiring careful consideration of propellant selection. Thermal conductivity tests have been conducted on different mixtures of composite solid propellant materials {{in order to determine the}} thermal conductivity of the propellant in the temperature range 0 - 100 °C and to study the effect of the presence of porosity and bubbles on the thermal conductivity of the propellant. The applicability of semiempirical Ziebland Relation to predict the thermal conductivity of the composite propellant once the values of the single components are known has been assessed. Furthermore, mixtures of Al and Potassium Perchlorate powders with different compression factors have been examined in order to understand the influence of the processing conditions on thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of a pyrotechnic device consisting of donor/acceptor pair separated by a thin inert material or a gap relies on the shock sensitivity of the energetic materials and detonation shock attenuation in the gap. Despite its common use, full-scale numerical simulation of the device configured in an explosive train is seldom reported because the proper modeling of the entire process requires precise capturing of extreme pressure waves from a donor charge during its attenuation in the inert gap before triggering an acceptor charge and accurate description of high strain rate dynamics of both reactive and inert solids. We developed a hybrid particle level-set based multi-material hydrocode with reactive flow models for Donor (Pentolite) – Gap (PMMA) – Acceptor (aluminized RDX). The complex shock interaction, critical gap thickness, and Go/No-go characteristics of the explosive train were quantitatively investigated. An additional detailed simulation of a miniaturized <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> in a train of Donor (HMX) – Gap (steel) – Acceptor (aluminized RDX) revealed {{the existence of a}} critical gap thickness for successful operation of a small device...|$|R

40|$|There {{is no way}} the PIC's {{could have}} seen any current' was the gist of Mike Griffin's assessment. Griffin was the NASA Administrator at the time. The buck stopped at his desk. Holding a napkin out to Pat Lampton, Griffin showed Lampton the {{calculations}} he'd made over dinner that predicted that the <b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>Initiator</b> Controllers (PIC's) {{at the base of}} the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) were fine. A lightning strike the day before, the worst ever experienced with a Space Shuttle on the launch pad, caused a halt to the launch count down as technicians, engineers, and managers scrambled identify any damage to the launch system. SRB technicians and engineers assessed the data against their Lightning Strike Re-Test Requirements, determining that all but one of the requirements could be checked if they resumed the countdown. For the one remaining requirement, testing the integrity of the PIC's would require 96 hours to set up, test, and reassemble. The engineers were convinced that there was no way to do calculations to show the PIC's were okay. The only option was to stand down. It was SRB Deputy Project Manager (PM) Pat Lampton's responsibility to decide what the SRB project position needed to be to certify that their hardware was safe to fly. He had to communicate that decision to the Mission Management Team (MMT) as a Go or No Go position to resume the count down. If the answer was Go they could still meet a delayed, but acceptable launch schedule. If the answer was No Go, rescheduling the launch would be a grueling shuffling of hardware, personnel, and mission timelines to accommodate Russian missions to the Space Station, supplies for the launch, and personnel manning launch operations. On top of that, Hurricane Ernesto was spinning off the coast of Florida, threatening the need for the Shuttle to roll back to the hangar if they waited too long...|$|R
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{consists of}} a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>initiator</b> and piezoelectric initiation system. The device will be capable of being initiated mechanically; resisting initiation by EMF, RF, and EMI (electromagnetic field, radio frequency, and electromagnetic interference, respectively); and initiating in water environments and space environments. Current devices of this nature are initiated by the mechanical action of a firing pin against a primer. Primers historically are prone to failure. These failures {{are commonly known as}} misfires or hang-fires. In many cases, the primer shows the dent where the firing pin struck the primer, but the primer failed to fire. In devices such as "T" handles, which are commonly used to initiate the blowout of canopies, loss of function of the device may result in loss of crew. In devices such as flares or smoke generators, failure can result in failure to spot a downed pilot. The piezoelectrically initiated ignition system {{consists of a}} pyrotechnic device that plugs into a mechanical system (activator), which on activation, generates a high-voltage spark. The activator, when released, will strike a stack of electrically linked piezo crystals, generating a high-voltage, low-amperage current that is then conducted to the pyro-initiator. Within the initiator, an electrode releases a spark that passes through a pyrotechnic first-fire mixture, causing it to combust. The combustion of the first-fire initiates a primary pyrotechnic or explosive powder. If used in a "T" handle, the primary would ramp the speed of burn up to the speed of sound, generating a shock wave that would cause a high explosive to go "high order. " In a flare or smoke generator, the secondary would produce the heat necessary to ignite the pyrotechnic mixture. The piezo activator subsystem is redundant in that a second stack of crystals would be struck at the same time with the same activation force, doubling the probability of a first strike spark generation. If the first activation fails to ignite, the device is capable of multiple attempts. Another unique aspect is {{in the design of the}} pyrotechnic device. There is an electrode that aids the generation of a directed spark and the use of a conductive matrix to support the first-fire material so that the spark will penetrate to the second electrode...|$|R

Incorporated in the assembly is a single bridgewire Apollo standard initiator (SBASI) for initiation, a through-bulkhead-initiator to provide isolation of the SBASI output from the delay, the pyrotechnic delay, and an output charge. An {{attempt was made to}} control both primary and secondary variables affecting functional performance of the delay initiator. Design and functional limit exploration was performed to establish tolerance levels on manufacturing and assembling operations. The test results demonstrate a 2 % coefficient of variation at any one temperature and an overall 2. 7 % coefficient of variation throughout the temperature range of 30 to 120 F.
