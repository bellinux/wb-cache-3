Other aspects of the Libyan agreement included the construction of a truck and bus plant at Tripoli. Chairman Agnelli candidly described the deal as [...] "a classic petro-money recycling operation which will strengthen the Italian reserves, provide Fiat with fresh capital and give the group greater tranquility in which to carry out its investment programmes". Equally noteworthy was the fact that despite the dilutive effect of the Libyan investment on existing shareholders, the company's largest shareholder, the Agnelli family, retained a 30% stake in the recapitalised business.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1997), {{a common}} {{view in the}} {{literature}} has been that systematic monetary policy responses to the inflation caused by oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> are {{an important source of}} aggregate fluctuations in the U. S. economy, yet post- 1987 data reveal no evidence of systematic policy responses to oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> Even prior to 1987, the Federal Reserve was not responding to the inflation triggered by oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks,</b> but rather to the oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> directly, consistent with a preemptive move by the Federal Reserve to counteract potential inflationary pressures. There are indications that this response is poorly identified, however, and {{there is no evidence that}} this policy response in the pre- 1987 period caused substantial fluctuations in the Federal Funds rate or in real output. One explanation of the low explanatory power of systematic policy responses to oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> is that the Fed has been responding differently to different types of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> Our analysis suggests that the traditional monetary policy reaction framework explored by BGW and incorporated in subsequent DSGE models should be replaced by DSGE models that take account of the endogeneity of the real price of oil and that allow policy responses to depend on the underlying causes of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A common {{view in the}} {{literature}} is {{that the effect of}} energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on macroeconomic aggregates is asymmetric in energy price increases and decreases. We show that widely used asymmetric VAR models of the transmission of energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> are misspecified, resulting in inconsistent parameter estimates, and that the implied impulse responses have been routinely computed incorrectly. As a result, the quantitative importance of energy price increases for the U. S. economy has been exaggerated. In response to this problem, we develop alternative regression models, estimation methods and methods of computing responses to energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> that yield consistent estimates regardless of the degree of asymmetry. We also introduce improved tests of the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy price increases and decreases. An empirical study reveals little evidence against the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> Our analysis has important implications for the theoretical literature on the transmission of energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> and for the debate about policy responses to energy <b>price</b> <b>shocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the role of}} the terms of trade in the trade channel of propagation of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> both empirically and theoretically.

Theoretically, I add oil in the model by Corsetti and Pesenti (2005) and analyse under what conditions the terms of trade plays a relevant role in the international transmission of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> With nominal <b>price</b> rigidities and full exchange rate pass-through positive oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> depreciate the currency of the oil importing country. The subsequent negative wealth effect adds to the recessive effect of the supply channel and may trongly reduce the consumption in the oil importing country economy. Without exchange rate pass-through oil shocks transmit to the economy only through the supply channel. The model suggests that a change in the exchange rate pass-through might contribute to explain the evidence of a weaker impact of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on the macroeconomic activity in recent times. oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks,</b> macroeconomic interdependence, exchange rate pass-through, propagation, transmission...|$|R

40|$|Although oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> {{have long}} been viewed {{as one of the}} leading {{candidates}} for explaining U.

We provide a formal analysis of this question with special attention to the possible role of net oil price increases in amplifying the transmission of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> We quantify the conditional recessionary effect of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> in the net oil price increase model for all episodes of net oil price increases since the mid- 1970 s. Compared to the linear model, the cumulative effect of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> over course of the next two years is much larger in the net oil price increase model. For example, oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> explain a 3 % cumulative reduction in U. S. real GDP in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and a 5 % cumulative reduction during the financial crisis. An obvious concern is that some of these estimates are an artifact of net oil price increases being correlated with other variables that explain recessions. We show that the explanatory power of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> largely persists even after augmenting the nonlinear model with a measure of credit supply conditions, of the monetary policy stance and of consumer confidence.

We separated the oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> into two parts, positive and negative parts, to investigate how commodity markets react when oil prices go up and down. We further studied the extreme price movements, called jumps, existing in the oil markets and how jump behavior has affected China's commodity markets. Our results suggest that asymmetric effects of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> did exist in the four markets and the negative oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> had stronger influences on the four markets in China. The petrochemicals market suffered most from the oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks,</b> and the grains market was least sensitive to the shocks. When jumps occurred in the crude oil market, the four commodity markets would be affected differently. The oil fats market and petrochemicals market tended to "overreact" to jumps.

Initially, many empirical studies found a significant negative effect between oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> and GDP but more recently, empirical studies have reported an insignificant relationship between oil shocks and the macroeconomy.
