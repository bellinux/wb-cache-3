5|$|On 9 December 1937, Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXD Horatius of Imperial Airways {{was struck}} by {{lightning}} whilst flying across the Channel from Paris to Croydon. A <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> was made at Lympne where {{it was found that}} minor damage had been done to a wing.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1922, A Farman F.60 Goliath on {{a flight}} from Croydon Airport to Paris, {{suffered}} a severely damaged propeller after flying through torrential rain whilst crossing the English Channel. The engine was shut down and a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> was made at Saint-Inglevert where the propeller was changed in 15 minutes. The aircraft then departed for Le Bourget, where arrival was only 12 minutes later than scheduled.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} was opened into the accident by the Accidents Investigation Branch of the Air Ministry, with Major Cooper in charge. The investigation {{concluded that the}} accident was caused by pilot error. The aircraft had stalled whilst a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> was being attempted.|$|E
50|$|The Second Sydney Airport is {{an ongoing}} {{proposition}} for another airport to supplement or replace the existing Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney, Australia. With an estimated cost of between $6 and $8 billion, governments, debating the issue since the 1940s, are yet to pursue anything beyond preliminary investigations and <b>precautionary</b> <b>land</b> acquisition. The current designated site for the second Sydney airport is the Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek.|$|R
50|$|Northwest Airlines flight 335, a Boeing 757, made a <b>precautionary</b> {{emergency}} <b>landing</b> at the Waterloo Regional Airport on June 2, 2009, {{about an}} hour into its flight from Detroit to Los Angeles with 182 passengers and a flight crew of eight. No one was injured. The cause was smoke in the cabin.|$|R
50|$|Of {{particular}} interest is Wantrup's notion of three decision levels: At {{the highest level}} is basic law (e.g., the constitution), which affects the second-level decisions on how to form institutions (e.g., water organizations). These institutions—in turn—affect third-level decisions of how to allocate water (e.g., among crops or within an urban sector). Wantrup points out that economists who critique decisions at the third level are perhaps missing the importance of constraints or influence coming from the second level. His critique, which dates from the 1960s, is still relevant—economists still {{spend most of their}} time on optimal decisions without taking institutions into account. In taking his institutional approach, Wantrup discussed and integrated common property, the impacts of tenure rights on conservation, the <b>Precautionary</b> Principle, conservation <b>land</b> use planning, and the importance of endangered species and biodiversity.|$|R
25|$|April 1983 – Mallow racecourse, in Ireland, {{became an}} {{emergency}} airfield when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet made a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing.</b> A temporary tarmacadam runway of almost 3,000 {{feet in length}} was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later in May. A movie, 'The Runway', was loosely based on the incident.|$|E
25|$|December 26, 1973: The {{pilot of}} a Tricon International Airlines Beechcraft C-45H cargo transport, {{registration}} number N118X, lost control while circling Love Field for a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> after {{being unable to}} raise the landing gear during takeoff. The C-45 struck two houses southeast of the airport, killing the pilot and injuring a person on the ground. The crash was attributed to insufficient airspeed and improper loading.|$|E
25|$|In September 1995 {{in southwestern}} Washington State, a low–flying LongRanger was downed by a metal arrow {{launched}} by an irate deer hunter. The arrow pierced a rotor blade, bending the blade. The arrow shaft tore the tailfin and boom {{as it was}} being chopped up by the spinning rotor. The helicopter was still flyable, but the pilot made a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> to assess the damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was operating a scheduled international flight from Le Bourget Airport, Paris, France to Croydon Airport, Surrey, United Kingdom, via Berck, Pas-de-Calais, France. The aircraft departed from Le Bourget at about 12:30 local time (11:30 GMT) with two crew and eight passengers on board. A scheduled stop {{was made at}} Berck, where another three passengers boarded. Due to weather conditions, a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> was made at Lympne, Kent, where a leak in the port radiator was attended to by the mechanic.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
500|$|The CAB {{concluded}} that, had proper {{fuel management}} procedures been followed, all engines {{would have kept}} running normally, or even restarted once they shut down. The Constellation crew, however, mismanaged the fuel flow {{to the right side}} engines, causing them to shut down, and were unable to restart them. During the ensuing <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> which resulted in the crash, additional flight crew mistakes were highlighted by the CAB investigators, who were highly critical of Imperial Airlines management, maintenance and flying procedures. The CAB's final report stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mallow Racecourse, {{now known}} as Cork Racecourse, became an {{emergency}} airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing.</b> A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000ft) in length which was {{paid for by the}} plane's insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later, whereas in the meantime Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, the Captain said his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. [...] The runway was subsequently utilised for parking during race meets and was a popular facility for learner driving. Light aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area. The F3A World Model Aircraft Aerobatic Championship was held there in 2001. The 1983 incident formed the basis of the 2010 film The Runway.|$|E

50|$|In a multi-engine aircraft, {{failure of}} a single engine usually results in a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> being performed, for example landing at a {{diversion}} airport instead of continuing to the intended destination. Failure of a second engine (e.g. US Airways Flight 1549) or damage to other aircraft systems caused by an uncontained engine failure (e.g. United Airlines Flight 232) may, if an emergency landing is not possible, result in the aircraft crashing.|$|E

50|$|When a pilot {{makes an}} {{emergency}} landing of an aircraft that has {{some or all of}} its propulsive power still available, it is known as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>landing.</b> An example of such a landing occurred on April 29, 2007, at Manchester Airport in the United Kingdom, when a bird got sucked into the right engine of a Thomsonfly Boeing 757, flight Thomson 253H, just as it rotated off the runway. The incident was filmed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Precautionary</b> <b>landing</b> {{may result}} from a planned landing at a {{location}} about which information is limited, from unanticipated changes during the flight, or from abnormal or even emergency situations.
