50|$|A {{serpentine}} belt, {{also known}} as a multi-vee, <b>poly-v,</b> or multi-rib belt, is a single, continuous belt used to drive multiple peripheral devices in an automotive engine, such as an alternator, power steering pump, water pump, air conditioning compressor, air pump, etc. The belt may also be guided by an idler pulley and/or a belt tensioner (which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or manual).|$|E
40|$|Timing and <b>poly-v</b> belts, used on {{automotive}} engine, are flexible {{links that}} {{play an important}} role and have an accurate design. Their mechanical characteristics influence the dynamic behaviour of the transmissions driven by the belts. Therefore, the measurement of stiffness and damping characteristics of these components is necessary for a better evaluation of their behaviour. Moreover these quantities are input data for belt transmission dynamic behaviour models. Two methods for the determination of the longitudinal stiffness are presented: static/dynamic loading. Bending rigidity has been measured also. All these quantities are determined from the analyses of longitudinal and transverse vibrations of belt span...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a <b>poly-V</b> belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber ring and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the rubber rings used in such pulley. The test rig developed is temperature controlled in order to show the influence of the temperature...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Modified polyguanidines were prepared, {{and their}} liquid {{crystalline}} properties were studied using optical polarizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Parameters examined include chirality, the uniformity of the lengths of side chains, and attached side-chain mesogens. If the side chains on the repeat units are identical, then polymer {{has a more}} ordered structure in both solution and the solid state. Uniform lengths of the side chains are also important. Poly(N,N′-di-n-hexylguanidine), poly-I, exhibited a lyotropic smectic texture {{in contrast to a}} nematic texture of poly(N-(rac) - 2 -phenylethyl) -N′-methylguanidine) (poly-(rac-II)). Optically pure poly(N-((R) - 2 -phenylethyl) -N′-methylguanidine) (poly-(R-II)) formed a cholesteric texture, whereas the corresponding racemic polyguanidine, poly-(rac-II), formed a nematic texture. Additionally, poly-(R-II) displayed a mesophase at a lower critical concentration than either poly-I or poly-(rac-II), implying that poly-(R-II) is stiffer than these two other derivatives. Poly(N- 6 -((4 ′-methoxyphenylazo) phenyl- 4 -oxy) hexyl-N′-n-hexylguanidine) (poly-IV), one of combined liquid crystalline structures (liquid crystalline backbone plus liquid crystalline side chains), displayed a lyotropic nematic texture presumably due to the strong dipolar-dipolar interaction between the main chain and side chains that folds the appendages parallel to the molecular axis. Poly(N- 12 -((4 ′-methoxybiphenyl- 4 -oxy) dodecyl-N′-n-dodecylguanidine) (<b>poly-V)</b> and poly(N,N′-di-n-dodecylguanidine) (poly-VI) exhibited thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior...|$|E
40|$|Temperature and {{chemically}} induced denaturation comprise two of {{the most}} characteristic mechanisms to achieve the passage from the native state N to any of the unstructured states Dj in the denatured ensemble in proteins and peptides. In this work we present a full analytical solution for the configurational partition function qs of a homopolymer chain poly-X in the extended Zwanzig model (EZM) for a quasisigmoidal denaturation profile. This solution is built up from an EZM exact solution in the case where the fraction α of native contacts follows exact linear dependence on denaturant’s concentration ζ; thus an analytical solution for L {{in the case of an}} exact linear denaturation profile is also provided. A recently established connection between the number ν of potential nonnative conformations per residue and temperature-independent helical propensity ω complements the model in order to identify specific proteinogenic poly-X chains, where X represents any of the twenty naturally occurring aminoacid residues. From qs, equilibrium thermodynamic potentials like entropy and average internal energy 〈E〉 and thermodynamic susceptibilities like specific heat C are calculated for poly-valine (<b>poly-V)</b> and poly-alanine (poly-A) chains. The influence of the rate at which native contacts denature as function of ζ on thermodynamic stability is also discussed...|$|E
