In this work proteins were treated using the laboratory equipment for tribomechanical micronisation {{with three different}} rotor speeds. Before and after the tribomechanical treatment, the analyses of the particle size and particle distribution {{as well as the}} specific area and scanning microscopy were carried out. The influence of tribomechanical treatment as well as hydrocolloid addition on the rheological properties of model systems of whey protein concentrate (10 % of total solid) was studied. Rheological parameters, flow behavior index (n) and consistency coefficient (k) were determined by the power-law model. The results obtained showed that the tribomechanical treatment involves a significant decrease in particle size, a change in particle distribution and an increase in specific area of <b>powdered</b> <b>whey</b> proteins. Systems without hydrocolloid addition were Newtonian, but those with hydrocolloid addition exhibited pseudoplastic properties. The viscosity of model systems containingn tribomechanically treated whey {{protein concentrates}} (TWPC) was greater in comparison with the same systems prepared with untreated WPC. Systems with greater amount of proteins (WPC- 80) had higher viscosity than the same systems containing lower amount of proteins. Hydrocolloid addition affected an increase of viscosity of model systems prepared with untreated WPC. The most significant increase of consistency coefficient (k) was observed in systems with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and addition of a special type of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC E 466) known as DIKO, icecream binder 0911 -E. In systems containing tribomechanically treated TWPC hydrocolloids had various effects. In systems with guar gum, carragenan, inulin, pectin or amid pectin, viscosity increased in comparison with those prepared with untreated WPC. CMC and DIKO affected a significant viscosity decrease of TWPC model systems, which is the consequence of the interaction between proteins and (CMC) hydrocolloids.

Angle of repose is the maximum angle in which a pile of ingredient retains its slope. A large angle of repose represents a steeper slope and poorer flow ability. A 70 : 30 corn-soybean meal blend served as the base to which all specialty ingredients were added. In Experiment 1, six lactose sources were evaluated. Three sources were fine, <b>powdered</b> <b>whey</b> permeates, and the other sources were coarse-ground whey permeate, edible-grade spray-dried whey, and a crystalline lactose source. Lactose sources were added at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 % to the corn-soybean meal blend. Angle of repose was then measured on these mixtures, as well as on the individual lactose sources. There was a lactose source × level interaction (P< 0. 0001) observed. Increasing lactose source decreased angle of repose, but the coarse whey permeate had a much greater improvement in flow ability, resulting in the interaction. In Experiment 2, five specialty protein sources were evaluated: powdered or granulated spray-dried animal plasma, powdered or granulated spray-dried blood cells, and select menhaden fish meal. Specialty protein sources were added at 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, and 10 % to the 70 : 30 corn-soybean meal blend. There was a specialty protein source × level interaction (P< 0. 0001) observed. As powdered animal plasma and blood cells increased, angle of repose increased, resulting in poorer flow ability.

40|$|Protein {{structure}} {{affects the}} bioactivity and functionality of whey protein ingredients in food systems. Bioactivity of whey proteins and their derivatives are highly dependent upon primary, secondary and tertiary structure. The degree of denaturation of whey proteins {{is an important}} factor for determining how whey protein ingredients will perform in a food system. Several analytical methods have been developed to quantify protein denaturation of whey proteins. The goal of this project was to use a variety of analytical methods to quantify whey protein denaturation and to evaluate the correlation of denaturation to the functionality of whey protein powders. The objective of the first series of experiments was to compare three different analytical methods to measure denaturation of whey proteins in liquid whey obtained by various methods of separation and with varying degrees of heat treatment. A split plot experimental design was used. Raw bovine milk was skimmed and liquid whey was separated from the skim milk at natural pH. Three separation methods: 1) centrifugation, 2) membrane filtration and 3) enzyme coagulation, made up the first split plot. Each sub-plot of liquid whey was then divided into three split plots to receive heat treatment. Heat treatments were no heat, 76 °C for fifteen seconds and 85 °C for three minutes. Each of the resulting nine treatment combinations was analyzed by 1) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 2) bicinchoninic acid-soluble protein assay and 3) fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the amount of denatured protein in the liquid whey. Fluorescence spectroscopy was found to be the most sensitive and reliable method for detecting differences in structure due to denaturation, while native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was found to be the least sensitive method. The sample which received the centrifugal treatment of isolation with no heat was found to be the most undenatured in structure while the sample which received the enzyme treatment of isolation with high heat was found to be the most denatured in structure. The objective of the second series of experiments was to evaluate the effect of denaturation on whey protein solubility in dried whey protein powders. Solubility {{is one of the most}} important functional properties to consider when selecting a whey protein ingredient, especially for beverage systems. Processing parameters are often manipulated in efforts to improve solubility. The protein structures of whey are considered to have an effect on solubility. Specifically, the degree of denaturation of whey proteins is thought to play a role in solubility. In this experimental design, raw bovine milk was skimmed and pasteurized then enzyme-coagulated at natural pH to separate the whey. Liquid whey was then split into three aliquots and each received one of the following treatments: 1) mild heat/ freeze dry, 2) mild heat/spray dry and 3) high heat/spray dry. Heat treatment was applied to liquid whey prior to concentration. Heat treated whey was then concentrated and dried. Powders were reconstituted and analyzed for denaturation using 1) bicinchoninic acid assay for soluble protein and 2) fluorescence spectroscopy and for solubility using an insolubility index. pH 4. 6 solubility and fluorescence spectroscopy for quantifying denaturation correlated well to one another. Both found that the low heat treated samples were less denatured in structure than the sample which received the high heat treatment, regardless of drying method. However, the drying method of the protein powders was correlated to solubility rather than heat treatment. A correlation of denaturation measured in whey protein powders and solubility was apparent for the low heat, freeze dried sample and the high heat, spray dried sample. Several conclusions were made in this research. 1) Centrifugal force causes less denaturation than membrane filtration and enzyme coagulation, thus unheated liquid whey obtained by centrifugal force can be used as a control in research on denaturation. 1) Fluorescence spectroscopy is a better method for quantifying denaturation in liquid and <b>powdered</b> <b>whey</b> compared to native PAGE and pH 4. 6 solubility measured by BCA. 3) Functional solubility is dependent on denaturation and can be correlated to analytical methods of measuring denaturation...|$|E

Of three products considered, rate of deterioration by the Maillard reaction, one was significantly different from the other two, having lower activation energy. Accelerated shelf-life testing deterioration rates compared well with those at ambient conditions for two products, implying that ASLT can be used for shelf-life determinations only if Maillard reaction inhibitors are absent. The flavor and aroma of sweet Cheddar cheese <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> from one processor over 12 months, was consistent. However, the physicochemical, and microbiological properties were variable mainly between the fall and summer production with the fall production being higher in L* (lightness) and pH, but low in solubility index, and conversely, the summer production being high in solubility index and titratable acidity but low in L*...|$|R

40|$|Whey is an {{excellent}} food ingredient owing to its high nutritive value and its functional properties. However, composition of whey varies depending on composition of milk, processing conditions, processing method, and its whey protein content. The {{aim of this study}} was to prepare a <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> from raw <b>whey</b> and to determine the influence of different processing temperatures (160 and 180 °C) on the physicochemical, functional properties during storage of 180 days and on whey protein denaturation. Results have shown that temperature significantly (P < 0. 05) affects the pH, acidity, non-protein nitrogen (NPN), protein total soluble solids, fat and lactose contents. Significantly (p < 0. 05) higher foaming capacity (FC), foam stability (FS), whey protein nitrogen index (WPNI), and a lower turbidity and solubility index (SI) were observed in <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> processed at 160 °C compared to <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> processed at 180 °C. During storage of 180 days, slow but progressive changes were noticed on the physicochemical and functional properties of <b>whey</b> <b>powder.</b> Reverse phase-HPLC analysis revealed a significant (P < 0. 05) effect of temperature on whey protein contents. Denaturation of β-Lactoglobulin is followed by α-lacalbumin, casein glycomacropeptide (CMP/GMP), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) ...|$|R
