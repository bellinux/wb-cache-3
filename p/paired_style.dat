40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study {{the role of}} style {{investing}} in foreign exchange markets {{and its effect on}} the momentum anomaly. The heterogeneous agent model of Barberis and Shleifer (2003) offers several testable propositions about a market in which investors engage in style investing. I test three of these propositions: i) asset-level and style-level momentum strategies are profitable, ii) the existence of popular styles cause individual assets to exhibit momentum, and iii) assets that belong to the same style comove more than assets in different styles. These propositions are studied with two <b>style</b> <b>pairs.</b> The first one consists of two styles that divide currencies into high-yielding and low-yielding ones. This division resembles the two carry trade portfolios. The second <b>style</b> <b>pair</b> defines the US dollar as one style and a portfolio of the other nine studied developed currencies as the other. Conforming to the previous findings in the literature the currency-level momentum strategies are profitable over the sample period from 1985 to 2014. The momentum strategies that measure the past returns over the preceding one and nine months exhibit the highest mean excess returns of approximately 3 % p. a. The style-level momentum strategies for both <b>style</b> <b>pairs</b> exhibit also positive returns over the sample period. The best-performing style-level momentum strategy is a three-month strategy on the US dollar <b>style</b> <b>pair</b> which returns 4. 64 % p. a. with a Sharpe ratio of 0. 54. Excluding the one-month momentum strategies, style-level momentum for both <b>style</b> <b>pairs</b> appears at least as profitable as the currency-level momentum. Robustness checks however show that the profitability of momentum in the interest rate <b>style</b> <b>pair</b> stems largely from its exposure to the currency carry trade. The momentum of the dollar <b>style</b> <b>pair</b> is robust to the underlying strategy which suggests that the US dollar appreciates (or depreciates) in trends against other developed currencies. Multivariate regression models on panel data show that the future one-month excess re-turns of a currency depend more on the past returns of the style to which the currency be-longs than on the past returns of the currency itself. This relation remains significant even after controlling for the level of interest rate of the currency, and provides some evidence that investors engage in style investing in foreign exchange markets which might, at least partially, cause the reported momentum anomaly. Lastly, the examination of the correlation matrices of the excess returns of currencies and multivariate regression models provide evidence that currencies in the same style exhibit higher comovement than currencies in different styles...|$|R

50|$|Similar to many composers of {{the early}} to mid 16th century, he {{predominantly}} wrote masses, motets and chansons. His motets are particularly significant as they show the three separate stages of early sixteenth century motet development, highly unusual {{to find in the}} work of a single composer. In his earliest motets one can hear the influence of Ockeghem; in his middle period works, the <b>paired</b> imitation <b>style</b> of Josquin des Prez; and in his late works the stylistic refinement, well-crafted melodic lines and pervasive imitation recall Gombert.|$|R

Tim & Sid became known for the <b>pair's</b> freeform <b>style,</b> and proved popular among a younger audience and a loyal group of fans.

50|$|She {{reaches a}} {{decision}} far more humane than murdering Renaud, by casting a further spell {{to make him}} {{fall in love with}} her. The bass amplifies and is much more emphatic in this part, while the supporting dynamic harmony permits a more melodic style. The idea is elaborated with accompanying music that evokes love and idealism, similar to the structure of a minuet. Repetition is also prevalent with the orchestra first introducing the entire melody, and Armide echoing its sentiment. A variation begins with Armide's changing emotions, resulting in a dance-like feel that contains orchestral preludes and a <b>pair</b> of recitative <b>styles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>pair</b> have a <b>style</b> of {{questioning}} which peppers their friendly, casual conversations with intensely personal or embarrassing questions.

The home audience in Sweden is generally familiar with their incessant, boyish troublemaking which makes their antics all the more hilarious when the necessity arises for them to quickly, cleverly hide behind the guise of innocent curiosity of foreign journalists.|$|R

His most recent project was a collaboration with Stefan Jarl on the screenplay of his 2013 documentary Goodness! The film focuses on the moral decline within economics. Berggren also appeared in the film, both as himself and in character, portraying the role of a greedy miser.|$|R

According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of <b>paired</b> openings. The <b>style,</b> with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|R
50|$|The AK3 is {{the third}} two-seat, single engine, low wing design from André Kieger. It is {{produced}} by Junkers Profly France and is alternatively known as the Junkers Profly Junka UL. The wing has a single spar with a plywood leading edge and a false spar for the mounting of ailerons and flaps. Production aircraft have small winglets. Each wing is fixed to the fuselage with a <b>pair</b> of sailplane <b>style</b> pins for rapid demounting. The fuselage is built around four longerons, giving it a square lower section; the upper fuselage is rounded and merges into {{the line of the}} large perspex canopy over the side-by-side seating. The tailplane is mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin is swept; both are plywood structures. There are horn balances on elevators and rudder.|$|R
