40|$|This study {{presents}} {{new data}} about the cross-language application of the Late Closure principle (Frazier, 1978), whose universality was put in question by data from Spanish (Cuetos & Mitchell, 1988). Using sentences containing a restrictive relative clause unambiguously modifying the first or the second noun of a complex NP (os cúmplices do ladrão/o cúmplice dos ladrões que fugiram), this study compares the behavior of Brazilian and European Portuguese speakers participating in a self-paced reading task. The data confirm that, in early phases of <b>processing,</b> <b>attachment</b> preferences are driven by a locality principle such as Late Closure. Based on a review of studies on Portuguese, Spanish and other Romance languages, we argue that the high- versus low-attachment difference across languages emerges cleanly only in off-line tasks, such as questionnaire studies, thus limiting the types of explanations for the cross-linguistic differences. We also advance {{an explanation for the}} high attachment preferences found in unspeeded questionnaire studies based on the Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (Fodor, 1998 a, 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|Attachment {{theory and}} social work have {{sustained}} an ongoing relationship since the early work of John Bowlby in the 1940 s through to the current day. This longstanding relationship provided a frame for this current study which: explored social workers' described experiences of using attachment theory as a social work practice theory and identified patterns of <b>processing</b> <b>attachment</b> theory for social work practice. This qualitative study was methodologically guided by a hermeneutic phenomenological paradigm {{based on the work}} of Max van Manen (1990). Data collection involved a review of relevant literature followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews. Data construction included the development and implementation of a "Letter of Understanding Process" in conjunction with the construction of transcripts. Data-analysis processes consistent with hermeneutic phenomenological methods were utilised. Review of the literature suggested that attachment theory, originally developed by Bowlby (1958) and Ainsworth (1963), emphasised a relational perspective inclusive of the attachment-caregiving-exploratory systems. However within the translation process of this theory and its developments over the decades into a social work practice theory, the focus shifted from one of relationships at times of high need to one where the client and their external world of events and happenings was emphasised. Findings from the interviews found social workers' experiences of the use of attachment theory, reflected identified shifts of focus within the literature. Also found was a theory-practice processing pattern identified as the social worker "bringing practice into theory". In light of these findings, the social worker was foregrounded as one who brings practice into the lived experience of theory. Issues of sustaining the coherence of attachment theory in practice and issues of context were explored as impacting on the lived experience of theory and practice. In response to these findings practice implications were considered resulting in the development of attachment theory informed social work practice principles. Finally based on the conclusions of this study an attachment theory informed model of reflective practice was recommended along with considerations for future research...|$|E

40|$|Attachment is {{critical}} to each individual. It affects the cognitive-affective processing of social information. The present study examines how <b>attachment</b> affects the <b>processing</b> of social information, specifically maternal information. We assessed the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to maternal information (compared to non-specific others) in a Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT) with 22 participants. The results illustrated that attachment affected maternal information processing during three sequential stages of information <b>processing.</b> First, <b>attachment</b> affected visual perception, reflected by enhanced P 100 and N 170 elicited by maternal information as compared to others information. Second, compared to others, mother obtained more attentional resources, reflected by faster behavioral response to maternal information and larger P 200 and P 300. Finally, mother was evaluated positively, reflected by shorter P 300 latency in a mother+good condition as compared to a mother+bad condition. These findings indicated that the processing of attachment-relevant information is neurologically differentiated from other types of social information from {{an early stage of}} perceptual processing to late high-level processing...|$|R
40|$|Hoarding of {{possessions}} {{is thought}} to be influenced by deficits in information <b>processing,</b> emotional <b>attachments,</b> and erroneous beliefs about possessions. This study examined hypothesized beliefs about possessions using an instrument developed for this purpose, the Saving Cognitions Inventory (SCI). Participants were individuals with compulsive hoarding (n = 95), obsessive compulsive disorder without hoarding (n = 21), and community controls (n = 40). An exploratory factor analysis yielded 4 factors similar to those hypothesized, representing emotional attachment, concerns about memory, control over possessions, and responsibility toward possessions. Subscales created based on these factors were internally consistent, and showed known groups, convergent and discriminant validity. Regression analyses indicated that 3 of the 4 subscales (memory, control, and responsibility) significantly predicted hoarding severity after age, moodstate, OCD symptoms and other OCD-related cognitive variables were entered. Interestingly, difficulty with decision-making also proved to be an important predictor of hoarding behavior. Implications for understanding and treating hoarding are discussed and study limitations are noted...|$|R

Contrary to other mass-mailing detection techniques our approach is content independent and requires no <b>attachment</b> <b>processing,</b> network traffic correlation, statistical measures, or system behavioral analysis.

Here, we investigated recurrently depressed (DSM-IV) unmedicated outpatients (N =  16) and control participants matched for sex, age, and education (N =  17) before and after 15 months of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Participants were scanned at two time points, during which presentations of attachment-related scenes with neutral descriptions alternated with descriptions containing personal core sentences previously extracted from an attachment interview. Outcome measure was the interaction of the signal difference between personal and neutral presentations with group and time, and its association with symptom improvement during therapy. Signal associated with <b>processing</b> personalized <b>attachment</b> material varied in patients from baseline to endpoint, but not in healthy controls. Patients showed a higher activation in the left anterior hippocampus/amygdala, subgenual cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex before treatment and a reduction in these areas after 15 months.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a simple and {{reliable}} method to quantify the cell survival of low-dose irradiations. Two crucial factors were considered, the same number of cells plated in each flask and an appropriate interval between cell plating and irradiation. For the former, we optimized cell harvest with trypsin, diluted cells in one container, and directly seeded cells on the bottom of flasks in a low density before irradiation. Reproducible plating efficiency was obtained. For the latter, we plated cells on the bottom of flasks and then monitored the <b>processing</b> of <b>attachment,</b> cell cycle variations, and the plating efficiency after exposure to 20 cGy of X-rays. The results showed that a period of 4. 5 h to 7. 5 h after plating was suitable for further treatment. In order to confirm the reliability and feasibility of our method, we also measured the survival curves of these M 059 K and M 059 J glioma cell lines by following the optimized protocol and obtained consistent results reported by others with cell sorting system. In conclusion, we successfully developed a reliable and simple way to measure the survival fractions of human cells exposed to low dose irradiation, which might be helpful for the studies on low-dose radiation biology...|$|R
40|$|Research in both {{infants and}} adults {{demonstrated}} that attachment expectations {{are associated with}} the attentional processing of attachment-related information. However, this research suffered from methodological issues and has not been validated across ages. Employing a more ecologically valid paradigm to measure attentional processes by virtue of eye tracking, the current study tested the defensive exclusion hypothesis in late childhood. According to this hypothesis, insecurely attached children are assumed to defensively exclude attachment-related information. We hypothesized that securely attached children process attachment- related neutral and emotional information in a more open manner compared to insecurely attached children. Sixty-two children (59. 7 % girls, 8 – 12 years) completed two different tasks, while eye movements were recorded: task one presented an array of neutral faces including mother and unfamiliar women and task two presented the same with happy and angry faces. Results indicated that more securely attached children looked longer at mother’s face regardless of the emotional expression. Also, they tend to have more maintained attention to mother’s neutral face. Furthermore, more attachment avoidance was related to a reduced total viewing time of mother’s neutral, happy, and angry face. Attachment anxiety was not consistently related to the processing of mother’s face. Findings support the theoretical assumption that securely attached children have an open manner of <b>processing</b> all <b>attachment...</b>|$|R

Contrary to this hypothesis, this interaction between place and frontal region was not found. However, two novel findings were reported: More power was found during MIS compared to SSC.

40|$|Negatively stained {{complexes}} of Panulirus interruptus (spiny lobster) hemocyanin {{with two}} different monoclonal antibodies, named E and J, were studied by electron microscopy and image <b>processing.</b> The <b>attachment</b> {{site of the}} antibodies to the hexameric hemocyanin molecule was deduced from two perpendicular views of hemocyanin/antibody complexes, in which either the threefold axis {{or one of the}} twofold axes was oriented perpendicular to the supporting film. Images of complexes in these orientations were searched with reference images simulated from the known X-ray structure of P. interruptus hemocyanin. The two sites were further characterized by combining our results from electron microscopy with structural data obtained by X-ray diffraction and other methods. These two antibodies recognize different non-overlapping epitopes. The epitope for clone E is located on domain 3 at the surface of the p barrel and consists of certain loops, which form connections between P-strand structures. The epitope for clone J is situated on domain 1 at the surface of an a-helical region and consists mainly of certain a-helices connecting loops. The orientation of the hemocyanin hexamers in the two complexes is very different, as is demonstrated most clearly when they form chains. Clone E forms complexes with the threefold axes perpendicular to the chain direction, while for clone J the threefold axes seem to be parallel to the main direction. The angle between the Fab part of an IgG molecule and the threefold axis of the hexamer is 60 +/- 5 degrees for clone E and 35 +/- 7 degrees for clone J. This observation is clearly related to the difference in orientation of the hexamers for the two complexes...|$|R

The <b>attachment</b> characteristics of three species of bacteria (S. liquefaciens, S. cohnii and P. fragi) isolated from the same production surface were examined. Mixed culture biofilm development was also modelled using these three organisms. The species were found to have differing attachment abilities and therefore cell surface characteristics such as outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles, exopolysaccharide production, and cell surface hydrophobicity and charge were examined to explain these differences. All of these cell surface characteristics were subject to considerable variation in response to the environmental conditions. The outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles did not show any relationship to attachment levels, and similarly exopolysaccharide production did not relate to the levels of attachment observed, although exopolysaccharide production was found to be particularly associated with attached cells. The attachment of S. cohnii and P jragi correlated to cell surface hydrophobicity, whilst the attachment of S. liquefaciens was dependent upon cell surface charge...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} how activation of young adults' attachment schemas influence their social information processing, cognitive attributions, and feelings relating to stressful interpersonal situations with their mothers, fathers, best-friends, and romantic partners. Participants (N = 132, mean age = 24) completed {{a measure of}} anxious and avoidant attachment (Brennan et al., 1998), made attributions about self and others in response to stressful interpersonal vignettes, and then were given a recall task. Hypotheses were guided by two models: (1) Schema-Consistent <b>Processing</b> (i. e., <b>attachment</b> style should facilitate recall by assimilating belief-congruent information); and (2) Processing Limits (i. e., attachment-related memories should interfere with information processing resources upon activation of similar memories). Consistent with the Schema-Consistent Processing model, those who had higher attachment anxiety recalled themselves more negatively. Three other findings were not consistent with either processing model: (a) females who were lower on attachment avoidance recalled more feelings; (b) participants who were more avoidant tended to recall a greater number and more emotionally intense thoughts about self; and (c) the higher the level of attachment anxiety, the less likely one was to recall a combination {{of positive and negative}} thoughts about others.

40|$|SAFE PLACE is a {{collaborative}} treatment program among occupational therapists, psychotherapists, and parents {{for children with}} sensory processing disorder (SPD) and complex trauma-attachment concerns. It is both a theoretical model explicating the relationship between sensory <b>processing,</b> disrupted <b>attachment</b> and complex developmental trauma concerns in children and a specific collaborative interdisciplinary sensory integration-based trauma-informed intervention program for treating these concerns. Many adopted/fostered children present with trauma-attachment concerns and SPD. SAFE PLACE provides a therapeutic framework for service providers and parents which emphasizes development of body-based regulatory and adaptive functions with co-regulation and intersubjective experiences, deepening of attachment bonds and security, and processing and healing of traumatic experiences {{in the context of}} a sensory integration intervention process. Occupational therapists providing Ayres Sensory Integration® intervention (Smith Roley, Mailloux, Miller-Kuhaneck, 2 ̆ 6 Glennon, 2007) routinely address problems in self-care, sensory regulation and motor performance in children with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). Sensory Processing Disorder is a problem with processing and integrating sensory inputs which results in deficits in making appropriate responses to sensorimotor demands. These problems impact children’s ability to learn, be self-sufficient, and engage in meaningful lives. Sensory processing disorder not only impact the children’s lives but those of their families as well (Dunn, 1997). Occupational therapists with sensory integration training are increasingly asked to treat children with SPD who also have complex trauma and attachment disorders. Similarly, psychotherapists frequently treat children with trauma histories who also present with sensory sensitivities characteristic of SPD that appear secondary to the trauma. Knowledge of and some expertise in addressing the problems of the other’s discipline is needed for both occupational and psychotherapists in order to best meet the needs of these most complex children. The clear compatibility of sensory integration and trauma and attachment theories and interventions led Jane Koomar, PhD and Daniel Hughes, PhD to hypothesize that each intervention approach could support the other to work more effectively to help children with SPD and co-morbid complex trauma histories heal and develop effectively. This perspective suggested the need for {{a collaborative}} theoretical model and intervention program that acknowledged the necessity of regulation and discrimination of sensations, adaptation of motor demands, and regulation of emotions, affect, and behavior in order for these children to learn and grow. Koomar and Hughes subsequently developed the SAFE PLACE model and intervention program as a trauma-informed, integrative, collaborative mental health and occupational therapy intervention for children who experience both SPD symptomatology and complex trauma and attachment concerns...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an understanding}} of how the significant-other-attachment-history of ‘secure’, ‘preoccupied’, ‘dismissing-avoidant’ or ‘fearful-avoidant’ new teachers has an effect upon action-choices in the classroom. The motivation for the study is the daily challenge faced by new teachers, as evidenced by disturbing early-career retention statistics. The focus of the thesis is on the redefining of emotional intelligence (EQ) as a comprehensive ‘filtering’ and enabling application of <b>attachment</b> <b>processing.</b> A ‘mixed-method’ analysis of quantitative and qualitative data was conducted, using data from pre-service and early career contexts, collected over a three-year period. In phase one, using the Bar-On EQ-i, and the ‘Experiences in Close Relationships (Revised) Questionnaire’, EQ indicators and the two attachment indicators were tested. In phase two, relevant codes were applied to the qualitative data; using a custom-designed method inspired by Grounded Theory. Three fundamental aspects of the relationship between EQ and attachment were identified during the study, namely, the strength of the relationship, {{the nature of the relationship}}, and the effects of the relationship within a teacher-pupil negotiation context. The central argument of the thesis is that levels of attachment-related anxiety and/or attachment-related avoidance, in early-career teachers, inhibit specific EQ-functioning. The relationship between EQ and attachment was found to weaken significantly when the EQ-elements, ‘empathy’ and ‘social responsibility’, revealed no significant correlation when tested against each attachment indicator ‘anxiety’ and ‘avoidance’. Further weakness in the relationship was revealed when the EQ-element ‘interpersonal relationship’ was tested against the attachment indicator ‘anxiety’. Four EQ-elements that do evidence a significant correlation with attachment are ‘reality-testing’, ‘self-regard’, ‘stress-tolerance’ and ‘self-awareness’. The nature of the relationship emerged from qualitative analysis; explained by high levels of attachment-related anxiety or avoidance that inhibit the EQ-abilities of self-regard, reality-testing, stress-tolerance and self-awareness. There is a tri-partite relationship between the elements of attachment style, the above-noted elements of emotional intelligence, and a new teacher’s significant-other attachment history (the summative experiential factor). The nature of the relationship between EQ and attachment is further evidenced by an inhibited EQ-ability for some new teachers. This inhibited ability has an impact upon action-choice, as the new teacher attempts to develop and manage the teacher-pupil relationship. Finally, the nature of the relationship can be seen in significant-other attachment transference-type processes which manifest as positive or negative action-choices by some new teachers. Securely-attached new teachers, exhibiting enhanced self-awareness and self-regard, interpret the reality of the modern classroom differently to fearful, preoccupied and dismissing new teachers. New teachers with high levels of attachment-related anxiety or avoidance evidence diminished EQ-abilities and display action-choices that reflect an attempt to protect the teacher-self within challenging classroom contexts. While this thesis contributes to {{an understanding of}} the relationship between emotional intelligence and attachment, further research remains to be done in the field of ‘social and emotional intelligence’. In particular, future scientific research could focus on the brain activity of each of the four attachment styles, to better understand the notion of significant-other transference in educational settings. The finding, that not all elements of emotional intelligence are correlated to attachment processes, should be taken to other contexts. Such work would, in the fullness of time, inform best practice, as pre-service programmers continue to try to find a better way of supporting new teachers...|$|R
