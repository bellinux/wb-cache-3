25|$|In January 1985, Digital Research previewed the Concurrent DOS 286 {{operating}} system developed {{in cooperation with}} Intel. The product would function strictly as an 80286 native-mode (i.e. protected-mode) {{operating system}}, allowing users {{to take full advantage}} of the protected mode to perform multi-user, multitasking operations while running 8086 emulation. This worked on the B-1 prototype step of the chip, but Digital Research discovered problems with the emulation on the production level C-1 step in May, which would not allow Concurrent DOS 286 to run 8086 software in protected mode. The release of Concurrent DOS 286 was delayed until Intel would develop a new version of the chip. In August, after extensive testing on E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research acknowledged that Intel corrected all documented 286 errata, but said that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications. Nevertheless, in the E-2 step, they implemented minor changes in the microcode that would allow Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster. Named IBM 4680 OS, IBM originally chose DR Concurrent DOS 286 as the basis of their IBM 4680 computer for IBM <b>Plant</b> <b>System</b> products and point-of-sale terminals in 1986. Digital Research's FlexOS 286 version 1.0, a derivation of Concurrent DOS 286, was developed in 1986, introduced in January 1987, and later adopted by IBM for their IBM 4690 OS, but the same limitations affected it.|$|E

This study aimed at estimating the genetic variation and productivity, stability and adaptability of progenies of a M. urundeuva natural population, from the Ecological Station of Paulo de Faria - SP, under different <b>planting</b> <b>systems.</b> DBH (diameter at breast height) was evaluated in four progeny tests of M. urundeuva: i) planted with Anandenanthera falcata and Guazuma ulmifolia (TP-AMA); ii) single (TP-ASO); iii) planted with annual crops (TP-SAF) and iv) planted with Corymbia citriodora (TP-EUCA), installed in Selviria-MS.

The planted reactors showed significantly greater reductions in PCB parent compounds {{when compared to}} unplanted systems after 32 weeks, both in single congener exposures and when all three congeners were present in a mixture. There was evidence of reductive dechlorination in both <b>planted</b> and unplanted <b>systems,</b> but higher concentrations of transformation products were observed in the <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> than the unplanted. Although <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> resulted in greater biotransformation, this improvement in PCB-reduction was {{not the result of}} plant uptake but rather was due to transformations occurring in the root rhizosphere. Parent PCB congeners were transformed by reductive dechlorination resulting in successively less chlorinated PCB congeners. These dechlorination products accounted for approximately all of the molar mass of parent compound lost. Based on the transformation products, reductive dechlorination pathways are proposed for rhizospheric biotransformation of PCB 52, 77, and 153. Results suggest that PCB 52 transformation proceeds through PCBs 18 and 9 down to monochlorinated PCB 1. Biotransformation of PCB 77 occurs through the intermediaries PCB 35 and 37. The pathway for the rhizospheric transformation of PCB 153 is through PCB 101 and PCB 99. This study provides insight into rhizosphere biotransformation pathways for reductive dechlorination in marginally aerobic,intermittently flooded soil as evidenced by a mass balance on transformation products. Despite the marginally aerobic conditions it is likely that highly reduced microzones existed in the soil particles during flooding and provided the opportunity for reductive dechlorination. In these experiments, planted microcosms with fully developed roots and rhizospheres showed significant reductive dechlorination and greater biotransformation than unplanted reactors. In addition, <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> that were intermittently flooded had greater transformation of the parent PCB compounds than systems that were not. A poplar <b>planted</b> <b>system</b> resulted in the complete removal of 26 of the 29 PCB congeners detected in a commercial garden soil, while the unplanted soil only had 2 congeners completely removed after 96 days. In addition, the most recalcitrant congener, PCB 52, only decreased by 0. 1 % in the unplanted reactors while declining by 22. 3 % in the <b>planted</b> <b>system.</b> There was also greater removal of a PCB 77 spike in the <b>planted</b> <b>system</b> when compared to the unplanted system, 17. 2 % in the <b>planted</b> <b>system</b> versus 2. 8 % in the unplanted system.
