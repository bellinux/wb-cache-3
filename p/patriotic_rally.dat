50|$|On {{the night}} of 8 November, the Nazis used a <b>patriotic</b> <b>rally</b> in a Munich beer hall to launch an {{attempted}} putsch (coup d'état). This so-called Beer Hall Putsch attempt failed almost at once when the local Reichswehr commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich {{in an attempt to}} rally support. Troops opened fire, and 16 Nazis were killed. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested, and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle").|$|E

5000|$|By 1909 {{the upper}} balcony {{of the hall}} was {{considered}} inadequate. Edwin Morton Hockings, architect of Rockhampton prepared plans for a curved gallery to extend from the stage line {{to the back of}} the hall and return. The curved dress circle was claimed to increase seating to 1500 patrons. The hall was a centre of social and entertainment life within the community of Rockhampton. Political rallies, fancy dress balls, <b>patriotic</b> <b>rallies</b> and the anti-conscription league all made use of its facilities. In the 1920s the hall was licensed as a place of [...] "public amusement and entertainment".|$|R
2500|$|In London, over 2,000 Australian and New Zealand troops {{marched through}} the streets of the city. A London {{newspaper}} headline dubbed them [...] "The Knights of Gallipoli". Marches were held all over Australia in 1916; wounded soldiers from Gallipoli attended the Sydney march in convoys of cars, accompanied by nurses. Over 2,000 people attended the service in Rotorua. For the remaining years of the war, Anzac Day was used as an occasion for <b>patriotic</b> <b>rallies</b> and recruiting campaigns, and marches of serving members of the AIF were held in most cities. From 1916 onwards, in both Australia and New Zealand, Anzac memorials were held on or about 25 April, mainly organised by returned servicemen and school children in cooperation with local authorities.|$|R

The flag was then taken from town to town, city to city throughout the North, where it was frequently [...] "auctioned" [...] {{to raise funds for}} the war effort. Any patriotic citizen who won the flag at auction was expected to immediately donate it back to the nation, and it would promptly be taken to the next rally to repeat its fundraising magic. The flag was a widely known patriotic symbol for the North during the war.|$|E
5000|$|Lennox and Johnson {{were left}} behind, feeling betrayed and angered. They chose the names Left-Winger and Right-Winger respectively. They wore stolen Guardsmen armor and battled Walker and Hoskins. The pair upstaged the new Captain America at a <b>patriotic</b> <b>rally</b> and press conference, attacking him and {{revealing}} Walker's identity {{to the press}} out of jealousy over his new-found success. As a result, Walker's parents {{were killed by the}} militia group The Watchdogs, nearly driving Walker into a mental breakdown. Walker blamed his former partners for his parents' deaths, and he stalked them. When he caught up to Left-Winger and Right-Winger, he tied them to an oil tank which was detonated by a torch-saber and left them to die. [...] They barely survived the explosion due to their bodies' enhanced physiology, leaving them terribly burned and in critical condition.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{building}} a memorial hall was started by the Chaplain Brown Post of the Grand Army of the Republic. They held a public subscription drive to secure the funds. The county Commissioners provided a lot and additional funds. Once open in 1893, the G.A.R. held <b>patriotic</b> <b>rallies,</b> concerts, and lectures in the building, but were unable to cover the Post’s debts and operating costs. In 1901 the County assumed the debts {{and control of the}} building.In 1901, the building was leased to Albert F. Heineman. He provided brought in entertains for the city, including minstrel troupes, traveling theatrical companies, political figures, and vaudeville.

50|$|Częstochowa {{entered the}} 20th century {{as one of}} leading {{industrial}} centers of Russian Poland (together with Warsaw, Łódź, and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie). The city was conveniently located on the Warta and other smaller rivers (Kucelinka, Stradomka, Konopka). Real estate and land prices were low, compared to Łódź, {{and the existence of}} the monastery brought numerous pilgrims, who also were customers of local businesses. In 1904, Częstochowa had 678 smaller workshops, which employed 2,000 workers. In 1902, rail connection to the Prussian border crossing at Herby Stare was opened, and in 1911, the line to Kielce was completed. The Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907) began in Częstochowa as early as May 1904, when first <b>patriotic</b> <b>rallies</b> took place. On December 25, 1904, a man named Wincenty Makowski tried to blow up a monument of Tsar Alexander II, which {{stood in front of the}} monastery. In February 1905, general strike action was declared in the city, with workers demanding pay rises. In June 1905 street clashes took place in Częstochowa, in which 20 people were killed by Russian forces. Further protests took place in 1909 and 1912.|$|R
5000|$|During the Partitions of Poland, Częstochowa {{was seized}} by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1793, and {{incorporated}} into the province of South Prussia, Department of Kalisz (Kalisch). The Old Częstochowa became the seat of a county (see Districts of Prussia). During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807 Częstochowa {{became part of the}} Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815, Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War One. Old Częstochowa remained the seat of a county in 1807-1830. In 1809, the monastery was unsuccessfully besieged by Austrians (see Polish-Austrian War). On April 2, 1813, Jasna Góra {{was seized by}} the Russians (see War of the Sixth Coalition), after a two-week siege. In 1821, the government of Congress Poland carried out a census, according to which the population of New Częstochowa was 1,036, while the population of Old Częstochowa was 2,758. Furthermore, almost four hundred people lived in several settlements in the area (Zawodzie, Stradom, Kucelin). The idea of a merger of both towns was first brought up in 1815. In 1819, military architect Jan Bernhard planned and started the construction of Aleja Najświętszej Panny Marii—the Holy Virgin Mary Avenue, which is currently the main arterial road of the modern city, and which connected Old Częstochowa with New Częstochowa. Finally, both towns were officially merged on August 19, 1826. The new city quickly emerged as the fourth largest urban centers of Congress Poland; larger were only the cities of Warsaw, Lublin, and Kalisz. On September 8, 1862, a <b>patriotic</b> <b>rally</b> took place in the city, in front of St. Sigismund church. As a reprisal, Russian military authorities destroyed app. 65% of Częstochowa's Old Town, and martial law was introduced. During the January Uprising, several skirmishes took place in the area of Częstochowa, with the last one taking place on July 4, 1864 near Chorzenice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{speech was}} {{the climax of}} the {{commemoration}} of the six hundredth anniversary of the battle. It followed months of commemorative events which had been promoted by an intense media focus on the subject of Serbia's relationship with Kosovo. A variety of Serbian dramatists, painters, musicians and filmmakers had highlighted key motifs of the Kosovo legend, particularly the theme of the betrayal of Serbia. Public [...] "Rallies for Truth" [...] were organised by Kosovo Serbs between mid-1988 and early 1989, at which symbols of Kosovo were prominently displayed. The common theme was that Serbs outside Kosovo (and indeed outside Serbia itself) should know the truth about the predicament of the Kosovo Serbs, emotionally presented as an issue of the utmost national importance. Serb-inhabited towns competed with each other to stage ever-more <b>patriotic</b> <b>rallies</b> in an effort to gain favor from the new [...] "patriotic leadership", thus helping to further increase nationalist sentiments. The event was also invested with major religious significance. In the months preceding the Gazimestan rally, the remains of Prince Lazar of Serbia, who had fallen in the Battle of Kosovo, were carried in a heavily publicized procession around the Serb-inhabited territories of Yugoslavia. Throngs of mourners queued for hours to see the relics and attend commemorative public rallies, vowing in speeches never to allow Serbia to be defeated again. At the end of the tour, the relics were reinterred in the Serbian Orthodox monastery at Gračanica in Kosovo, near Gazimestan.|$|R
