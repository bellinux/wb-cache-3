50|$|Each piece can {{challenge}} an opposing <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is directly adjacent in front, behind, or {{to either side}} of it (identical in effect to the way it moves). Thus, a piece does not directly threaten an opposing <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is situated diagonally to it. However, a <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is known or thought to be stronger can restrict the movement of a weaker opposing <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is situated diagonally to it by threatening elimination.|$|R

5|$|It was Johnson's {{practice}} to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed {{the command of}} General Lloyd Tilghman, trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed. It is unclear how much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship {{with most of the}} Confederate generals.|$|E
5|$|Located {{after the}} main body of stories is a {{selection}} of art <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> represent interpretations of the Halo universe from a number of comic book artists.

5|$|The {{composer}} Sergei Rachmaninoff {{produced a}} number of solo piano <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. He composed sixteen such pieces, and all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these casual works, he draws upon the influence of other composers, including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well-thought out <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as a child or adult, these pieces cover {{a wide spectrum of}} forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style.|$|E

5|$|These Sermons are curious; {{and curious}} for such reason as would make other works despicable. They {{were written in}} a {{careless}} hurrying manner; and were the offspring of necessity, not of choice: so that one will see the original force of the Dean's genius more in these compositions, that were the legitimate sons of duty, than in other <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> were natural sons of love.|$|E
5|$|A free {{jazz and}} {{contemporary}} classical work, Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> are mostly fully developed suites. They eschew conventional themes for abstract {{expressions of the}} subject matter, which focuses on the Civil Rights Movement and other interrelated topics. Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The Masque at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, The Prodigal Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871). He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
5|$|Japanese losses {{during the}} {{campaign}} amounted to a significantly higher total {{than those of the}} Allies, although exact numbers have not been established. About 12,500Japanese soldiers participated in the campaign and about 5,500are believed to have been killed. Some sources indicate a possibly higher toll. With only 4,300 Japanese reaching Sio {{at the end of the}} campaign, it is possible that the figure is closer to 7,000 or 8,000. A significant amount of war materiel was also lost {{during the campaign}}. Of the 26 field artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese possessed in the region, 18 were captured by the Australians during the campaign, while 28 out of their 36 heavy machine-guns were also lost.|$|E

5|$|Oguchi's ensemble, Osuwa Daiko, {{incorporated}} these alterations {{and other}} drums into their performances. They also devised novel <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> were intended for non-religious performances. Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. Oedo Sukeroku Daiko {{was formed in}} Tokyo in 1959 under Seidō Kobayashi, and {{has been referred to}} as the first taiko group who toured professionally. Globally, kumi-daiko performance became more visible during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji, {{who claimed}} to be of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> reflect an enthusiasm for those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and are inspired by Busoni's Elegy No. 2, All'Italia, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Liszt. They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E
