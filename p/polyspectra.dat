Recently, constraints on these parameters have been investigated from CMB observations by using WMAP 9 data. In order to consider the halo/galaxy bispectrum with the equilateral-type primordial trispectra, we adopt the integrated Perturbation Theory (iPT) in which the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity are wholly encapsulated in the linear primordial <b>polyspectrum</b> {{for the evaluation of}} the biased <b>polyspectrum.</b> We show the shapes of the halo/galaxy bispectrum with the equilateral-type primordial trispectra, and find that the primordial trispectrum characterized by g_ NL ^σ̇^ 4 provides the same scale-dependence as the gravity-induced halo/galaxy bispectrum. Hence, {{it would be difficult to}} obtain the constraint on g_ NL ^σ̇^ 4 from the observations of the halo/galaxy bispectrum. On the other hand, the primordial trispectra characterized by g_ NL ^σ̇^ 2 (∂σ) ^ 2 and g_ NL ^(∂σ) ^ 4 provide the common scale-dependence which is different from that of the gravity-induced halo/galaxy bispectrum on large scales. Hence future observations of halo/galaxy bispectrum would give constraints on the non-linearity parameters, g_ NL ^σ̇^ 2 (∂σ) ^ 2 and g_ NL ^(∂σ) ^ 4 independently from CMB observations and it is expected that these constraints can be comparable to ones obtained by CMB.

The q-PEP methods exploit the best Two-Dimensional (2 D) slice of the data q-th order spectrum.

40|$|Fourier {{methods are}} {{fundamental}} tools to analyze random fields. Statistical structures of homogeneous Gaussian random fields are completely {{characterized by the}} power spectrum. In non-Gaussian random fields, <b>polyspectra,</b> higher-order counterparts of the power spectrum, are usually considered to characterize statistical information contained in the fields.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} system reconstruction from arbitrarily selected slices of the nth-order output spectrum. We establish that unique identification of the impulse response of a system can be performed, up to a scalar and a circular shift, based on any two one-dimensional (1 -D) slices of the discretized nth-order output spectrum, (n 3), {{as long as the}} distance between the slices and the grid size satisfy a simple condition. For the special case of real systems, one slice suffices for system reconstruction. The ability to choose the slices to be used for reconstruction enables us to avoid regions of the nth-order spectrum, where the estimation variance is high, or where the ideal <b>polyspectrum</b> is expected to be zero, as is the case for bandlimited systems. We show that the obtained system estimates are asymptotically unbiased and consistent. We propose a mechanism for selecting slices that result in improved system estimates. We also demonstrate via simulations the superiority, in terms of estimation bias and variance, of the proposed method over existing approaches in the case of bandlimited systems.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Polyspectra</b> {{are related}} to Fourier {{transforms}} of moment or cumulant functions of any order of random signals. They {{play an important role}} in many problems of signal analysis and processing. However, there are only a few statistical models giving explicitly the expression of <b>polyspectra.</b> Ordered signals are signals for which the explicit expression of the moment functions requires that the time instants appearing in these moments are put in an increasing order. There are many examples of such signals, the best known being the random telegraph signal constructed from a Poisson process. Some of these examples are presented and analyzed. The origin of the ordering structure is related with the point that real time is an oriented variable making a difference between past and future. This especially appears in Markov processes. The calculation of <b>polyspectra</b> is difficult because ordering is not adapted to Fourier analysis. By an appropriate grouping of various terms, the explicit expression of spectral moment functions is obtained. It shows in particular that many ordered signals present a normal density on the normal manifolds of the frequency domain and another contribution on the stationary manifold that is explicitly calculated. The analysis of the structure of this expression allows us to discuss some relationships with normal distribution, central limit theorem, and time reversibility.

40|$|The position-dependent power {{spectrum}} has been recently proposed as a descriptor of gravitationally induced non-Gaussianity in galaxy clustering, {{as it is}} sensitive to the "soft limit" of the bispectrum (i. e. {{when one of the}} wave number tends to zero). We generalise this concept to higher order and clarify their relationship to other known statistics such as the skew-spectrum, the kurt-spectra and their real-space counterparts the cumulants correlators. Using the Hierarchical Ansatz (HA) as a toy model for the higher order correlation hierarchy, we show how in the soft limit, <b>polyspectra</b> at a given order can be identified with lower order <b>polyspectra</b> with the same geometrical dependence but with renormalised amplitudes expressed in terms of amplitudes of the original <b>polyspectra.</b> We extend the concept of position-dependent bispectrum to bispectrum of the divergence of the velocity field Θ and mixed multispectra involving δ and Θ in the 3 D perturbative regime. To quantify the effects of transients in numerical simulations, we also present results for lowest order in Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) or the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). Finally, we discuss how to extend the position-dependent spectrum concept to encompass cross-spectra.

40|$|Abstract—Harmonizable {{processes}} {{constitute an}} important class of nonstationary stochastic processes. In this paper, {{we present a}} theory of <b>polyspectra</b> (higher order moment spectra) for the harmonizable class. We define and discuss four basic quantities: the th-order moment function, the th-order time-frequency polyspectrum, the th-order ambiguity function, and the th-order frequency-frequency polyspectrum. The latter generalizes the conventional polyspectrum to nonstationary stochastic processes. These four functions are related to one another by Fourier transforms. We show that the frequency and time marginals of the time-frequency polyspectrum are the instantaneous th-order moment and the conventional th-order stationary polyspectrum, respectively. All quantities except the th-order ambiguity function allow for insightful interpretations in terms of Hilbert space inner products. The inner product picture leads to two novel and very powerful definitions of polycoherence for a nonstationary stochastic process. The polycoherences are objective measures of stationarity to order, {{which can be used}} to construct various statistical tests. Finally, we give some specific examples and apply the theory to linear time-varying systems, which are popular models for fading multipath communication channels.
