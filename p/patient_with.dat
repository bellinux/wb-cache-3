50|$|Abnormalities on {{abdominal}} imaging, such as renal AML and enlarged lymphatic structures, {{are also}} common in LAM. Fat density within a renal mass is pathognomonic of AMLs. AMLs are more prevalent and more frequently bilateral and large in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> TSC-LAM than in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> S-LAM. AML size correlates with {{the prevalence of}} pulmonary cysts in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> TSC. One study CT imaged 256 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> S-LAM and 67 with TSC-LAM. Renal AMLs were present in 32% of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> S-LAM and 93% of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> TSC-LAM. Hepatic AMLs were present in 2% of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> S-LAM and 33% of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> TSC-LAM. Ascites was uncommon, seen in fewer than 10% of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> LAM.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric {{differences}} between <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> probable Alzheimer's disease and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease and dementia. METHODS: Thirty three <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> probable Alzheimer's disease and 33 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease and dementia were matched for age, sex, and mini mental state examination scores {{and given a}} battery of neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric tests. RESULTS: <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease with dementia had a significantly higher prevalence of major depression than <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Alzheimer's disease; <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Alzheimer's disease showed more severe anosognosia and disinhibition than <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease. Whereas no significant between group differences were found on tests of memory and language, demented <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease had a significantly greater impairment on a test of visual reasoning than <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: There were significant psychiatric {{differences between}} <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Alzheimer's disease and demented <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson's disease, but neuropsychological differences were restricted to a single cognitive domain...|$|R
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} a <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able}} to help him.

The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

40|$|Serum RNase (ribonuclease) {{of normal}} persons and of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatitis, {{carcinoma}} of pancreas, or other neoplasms was determined with poly(C) as substrate. Strikingly abnormal elevations {{occur in the}} serum RNase of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic cancer. There is no elevation in the serum RNase level of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatitis. Average serum RNase values of 52 normal persons, 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatitis, 30 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic cancer, 28 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> breast cancer, 11 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> lung cancer, 20 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> colon cancer, six <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stomach cancer, and four <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> liver cancer, respectively, were 104, 120, 383, 131, 173, 197, 194, and 152 units/ml of serum. Ninety percent of the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic cancer were above the level of 250 units of serum and 90 % of all <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> varied cancers were below this level. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, marked elevation of serum RNase was also observed.

40|$|Abstract. The aim {{of present}} work was to study {{spontaneous}} proliferative activity of B-lymphocytes (SP-ABL) in the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> rheumatoid arthritis (RA), {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and non-specific ulcerative colitis (NSUC). In total, 128 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> RA, 52 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> SLE, and 29 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> NSUC were observed. Thirty-four <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> osteoarthrosis (OA), 27 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> reactive arthritis (ReA), 28 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic hepatitis (CH), 19 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic colitis (ChC), and 30 healthy donors comprised the control group.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} extent to which psychiatric disturbances (especially mood disorders) generally considered poor prognostic factors, are present in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> striatonigral (SND) type multiple system atrophy (MSA) compared <b>with</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD).  The Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), and Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) were administered to clinically probable non-demented <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> SND-type MSA and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD matched for age and motor disability, at baseline and after receiving levodopa.  At baseline total HAM-D score was greater in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD. Overall, BPRS score did not differ between the two groups; however, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD scored higher on anxiety items of the BPRS, and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA had higher scores on the item indicating blunted affect. After levodopa, both groups improved significantly in UPDRS and HAM-D total scores (just significant for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA). <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD improved significantly in total BPRS score but <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA did not.  At baseline <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD were more depressed and anxious than <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA who, by contrast, showed blunted affect. After levodopa, depression and anxiety of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> IPD improved significantly whereas the affective detachment of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA did not change. Major neuronal loss in the caudate and ventral striatum, which are part of the lateral orbitofrontal and limbic circuits, may be responsible for the blunted affect not responsive to levodopa therapy found in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> MSA. ...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To measure {{circulating}} {{concentrations of}} nitrite in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HIV- 1 infection. METHODS: Nitrite concentrations were measured using the Griess reaction adapted to microtitre plates in the serum of 10 asymptomatic HIV- 1 positive <b>patients,</b> 33 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> AIDS with cerebral disorders, 17 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> AIDS with pulmonary involvement, and in eight <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> AIDS with other disorders. Nitrite concentrations were also measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> AIDS with pulmonary involvement and cerebral disorders, respectively. RESULTS: Increased serum concentrations of nitrite {{were observed in}} <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pulmonary involvement, and in particular in serum and in BAL samples of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> interstitial pneumonia (36. 2 (26. 2) mumol/l and 0. 3 (0. 4) mumol/l, respectively). Increased serum concentrations of nitrite were also noted in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> retinitis caused by infection with cytomegalovirus. Serum nitrite concentrations were also raised in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> cerebral toxoplasmosis, whereas normal serum concentrations were found in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HIV- 1 encephalopathy and cryptococcal meningitis. Nitrite concentrations in CSF were not raised in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> cerebral disorders.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Deficits in insight {{have been}} found in one study to be more common and severe in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> {{schizophrenia}} than in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizoaffective and major depression with and without psychosis but not more severe than they are in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> bipolar disorder. The goals of this study were to replicate this finding independently and to clarify whether <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia differ from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> bipolar disorder in a larger study group. METHOD: Using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder, the authors evaluated 29 inpatients with schizophrenia, 24 with schizoaffective disorder, and 183 with mood disorders with psychotic features (153 with bipolar disorder and 30 with unipolar depression). RESULTS: <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia had poorer insight than <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizoaffective disorder and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> psychotic unipolar depression but did not differ from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant differences between <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> bipolar disorder was not a result of low statistical power.
