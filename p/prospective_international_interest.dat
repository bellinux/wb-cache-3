40|$|This article {{examines}} national branding of UK higher education, a strategic intent and action to collectively brand UK higher education {{with the aim}} to attract <b>prospective</b> <b>international</b> students, using a Bourdieusian approach to understanding promises of capitals.

The findings reveal how a national higher education brand is construed by connecting particular representations of the nation with those of <b>prospective</b> <b>international</b> students and the higher education sector, which combine in the brand with promises of capitals to convert into positional advantage in a competitive environment. The conceptual framework proposed here seeks to connect national higher education branding to the concept of the competitive state, branded as a nation and committed to the knowledge economy...|$|R
