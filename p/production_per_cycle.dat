40|$|We {{study the}} time {{evolution}} of a periodically driven quantum-mechanical system coupled to several reserviors of free fermions at different temperatures. This is a paradigm of a cyclic thermodynamic process. We introduce {{the notion of a}} Floquet Liouvillean as the generator of the dynamics on an extended Hilbert space. We show that the time-periodic state to which the true state of the coupled system converges after very many periods corresponds to a zero-energy resonance of the Floquet Liouvillean. We then show that the entropy <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> is (strictly) positive, a property that implies Carnot's formulation of the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|In recent years, the {{ecological}} degradation, loss of technological sustenance and other multidimensional consequences caused by shrimp farming {{have made the}} experts and authorities bound to rethink {{about the development of}} the industry. The present study describes the water and sediment quality, and culture and management techniques in five selected shrimp farms at Paikgacha, Khulna throughout a production cycle from March to September 1997. The water quality parameters were found to be more or less suitable throughout the cycle. The concentration of the limiting major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and minor nutrients such as calcium and magnesium were satisfactorily high, concentrations of the organic matter content were also high. Remarkable negative correlation of shrimp production with secchi depth was observed among the farms. <b>Production</b> <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> ranged between 273 kg/ha and as low as 63 kg/ha...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Brazil {{plays an}} {{important}} role in global poultry production as it is the world's largest chicken exporter and the third largest broiler producer. Despite the development achieved by the Brazilian broiler industry as a result of the integrated production system, many obstacles still need to be overcome, in particular, housing environment. In this regard, detailed knowledge of the inputs, outputs, and primary waste generated by broiler production cycles is essential to establish a baseline for energy balance research studies and to develop environmental solutions. This article proposes a mass balance of conventional broiler houses of southern Brazil sheds in order to predict their outputs, but that may also be applicable to other regions with similar climate. Control volumes considered the heating, cooling, and rearing processes. All generated products and wastes were estimated considering litter production and the total <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>cycle.</b> Despite the variety of the microclimates, the results were very close to those reported in experiments, indicating that this model is adequate for this kind of estimation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{fluctuating}} classical systems {{in contact with}} a thermal bath, and whose configurational energetics undergoes cyclic transformations due to interaction with external perturbing agents. Under the assumptions that the configurational dynamics is a stochastic Markov process in the overdamped regime and that the nonequilibrium configurational distribution remains close to the underlying equilibrium one, we derived an analytic approximation of the average dissipated energy per cycle in the asymptotic limit (i. e., after many cycles of perturbation). The energy dissipation is then readily translated into average entropy <b>production,</b> <b>per</b> <b>cycle,</b> in the environment. The accuracy of the approximation was tested by comparing the outcomes with the exact values obtained by stochastic simulations of a model case: a “particle on a ring” that fluctuates in a bistable potential perturbed in two different ways. As pointed out in previous studies on the stochastic resonance phenomenon, the dependence of the average dissipation on the perturbation period may unveil the inner spectrum of the system’s fluctuation rates. In this respect, the analytical approximation presented here {{makes it possible to}} unveil the connection between average dissipation, intrinsic rates and modes of fluctuation of the system at the unperturbed equilibrium, and features of the perturbation itself (namely, the period of the cycle and the projections of the energy perturbation over the system’s modes). The possibilities of employing the analytical results as a guide to devising and rationalizing a sort of “spectroscopic calorimetry” experiment, and of employing them in strategies aiming to optimize the system’s features {{on the basis of a}} target average dissipation, are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIron oxide {{has been}} widely used as an oxygen carrier {{material}} (OCM) for hydrogen production by chemical looping due to its favourable thermodynamic properties. In spite of this, iron oxide loses much of its activity after redox cycling mainly due to sintering and agglomeration. Perovskites, such as La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 FeO 3 -δ (LSF 731), have been suggested as potential candidate OCMs for hydrogen production due to their excellent oxygen transport properties and stability under cycling. However, hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> for a similar carrier weight is lower than with iron oxide. This work proposes the use of composite OCMs made of iron oxide clusters embedded in an LSF 731 matrix. The perovskite matrix facilitates oxygen transport to the iron oxide clusters while preventing agglomeration. Two preparation methods, mechanical mixing and a modified Pechini method, were used to obtain composite materials with different iron oxide weight fractions, 11 and 30 wt. %. The reactivity of these OCMs was studied in a thermogravimetric analyser. Hydrogen production and carrier stability were investigated in a microreactor over 25 redox cycles while periodically feeding carbon monoxide and water {{in order to produce}} carbon dioxide and hydrogen in separate streams. Hydrogen production was stable over 25 cycles for LSF 731 and the composite OCM with 30 wt. % iron oxide produced by the modified Pechini method but iron oxide particles alone underwent a decrease in the hydrogen production with cycling. The hydrogen production during the 25 th cycle was eight times higher for the composite material than for iron oxide alone and four times higher than for LSF 731. The hydrogen production was therefore also higher than that expected from a simple combination of the iron oxide and LSF 731 alone, indicating a synergetic effect whereby the LSF 731 may have a higher effective oxygen capacity when {{in the form of the}} composite material...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the egg production potentials of four different indigenous chicken breeds in South Africa: Potchefstroom Koekoek, Venda, Ovambo and Naked Neck. The White Leghorn breed was used as the control. The egg production potentials were evaluated over two consecutive production cycles of 52 weeks (used as replicates). Data were collected at the exper-imental farm of the Agriculture Research Council at Irene. Treatment means were separated using Fisher’s protected t-test least signifi-cant difference at the 5 percent level of significance and the percentage mortality rate by means of a row by column chi-square test. No significant differences were observed between breeds on the mean age to the production of the first egg. The White Leghorn was superior (p ≤ 0. 05) to all four of the indigenous breeds for the mean number of eggs and percentage hen-housed egg <b>production</b> pro-duced <b>per</b> <b>production</b> <b>cycle.</b> The Potchefstroom Koekoek was also superior (p ≤ 0. 05) to the other three indigenous breeds for these parameters.

40|$|Wood {{charcoal}} production provides affordable {{energy in}} many developing countries and has substantially contributed to the economy through the provision of rural incomes. In several countries, charcoal production leads to overexploitation of forests due to inefficiencies in processing. This study was undertaken in central Laos to (1) examine and document traditional charcoal production systems; (2) investigate the production capacity, recovery efficiencies and economic gains of existing traditional charcoal production methods; (3) characterize the chemical properties of wood charcoal and investigate the potential for soil restoration and (4) investigate local charcoal producers' perception on forest degradation and their species preferences. Through a socio-economic survey, a cost-based method for economic valuation was undertaken on a range of charcoal production methods currently being used. Laboratory chemical analyses were performed on wood charcoal samples. Results indicated that the traditional mud charcoal mound was used by the majority (82 %) of charcoal producers. Total charcoal <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>production</b> <b>cycle</b> varied between 400 (produced from 2. 7 m 3 of wood) and 1600 kg (produced from 18 m 3 of wood), with a mean of 938 kg (� 120) for traditional mud charcoal mounds. The volume of the traditional mud charcoal mounds correlated positively and significantly with total charcoal production (R 2 = 0. 45, p?=? 0. 03), whereas correlated negatively and significantly with the recovery efficiency (R 2 = 0. 58, p?=? 0. 01). On average, the local producers receive a total net benefit of 457, 272 Lao kip (USD 57. 2) in 17 days. We also identified a rice husk mound method of charcoal production, which may not encourage further deforestation while producing rice husk biochar {{that can be used for}} soil restoration. Furthermore, we found that there are significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the sampled wood charcoals in chemical properties, indicating that the potential of using wood charcoal for the restoration of degraded soils varies from charcoal to charcoal...|$|R

The irreversibility of the adiabatic processes in turbine and compressor is taken into account through their isentropic efficiencies. The net work <b>per</b> <b>cycle,</b> the thermal efficiency and the two exergy efficiencies are expressed as functions of the four dimensionless variables: the isentropic efficiencies of turbine and compressor, the pressure ratio, and the temperature ratio. It is shown that the maximal values of the net work <b>per</b> <b>cycle,</b> the thermal and the exergy efficiency are achieved when the isentropic efficiencies and temperature ratio are as high as possible, while the different values of pressure ratio that maximize the net work <b>per</b> <b>cycle,</b> the thermal and the exergy efficiencies exist.

Finally, two goal functions are proposed for thermodynamic optimization of a Brayton cycle for given values of the temperature ratio and the compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies.
