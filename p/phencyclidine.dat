25|$|There {{have been}} false {{positive}} <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP) results caused by larger doses of venlafaxine, with certain on-site routine urine-based drug tests.|$|E
25|$|Other arylcyclohexylamines and analogues of {{ketamine}} include eticyclidine (PCE), 3-MeO-PCE, methoxetamine (MXE), tiletamine, <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP), tenocyclidine (TCP), {{and many}} others.|$|E
25|$|Recent years {{shows an}} {{increase}} in the consumption of vaporized heroin, methamphetamine and <b>Phencyclidine</b> (PCP). Along with a smaller number of psychedelic drugs such as DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, and Salvia divinorum.|$|E
25|$|Some NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, such as ketamine, dextromethorphan (DXM), <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP), methoxetamine (MXE), and {{nitrous oxide}} (N2O), are popular recreational drugs used for their dissociative, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant properties. When used recreationally, they {{are classified as}} dissociative drugs.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{well-known}} dissociatives <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP) and dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine is very short-acting. It takes effect within about 10 minutes, while its hallucinogenic effects last 60 minutes when insufflated or injected {{and up to}} two hours when ingested orally.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} psychotomimetic effects, NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, especially <b>phencyclidine,</b> ketamine, and dextromethorphan, {{are used as}} recreational drugs. At subanesthetic doses, these drugs have mild stimulant effects and, at higher doses, begin inducing dissociation and hallucinations, though these effects and the strength thereof vary from drug to drug.|$|E
25|$|DXM is {{also used}} recreationally. When {{exceeding}} approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative anesthetic. Its mechanism of action is via multiple effects, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. DXM and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, also act as an NMDA receptor antagonist at high doses, which produces effects similar to, yet distinct from, the dissociative states created by other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine and <b>phencyclidine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ketamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1962 by Calvin L. Stevens, {{a professor of}} Chemistry at Wayne State University and a Parke Davis consultant conducting research on alpha-hydroxyimine rearrangements. After promising preclinical research in animals, ketamine was introduced to testing in human prisoners in 1964. These investigations demonstrated ketamine's short duration of action and reduced behavioral toxicity made it a favorable choice over <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP) as a dissociative anesthetic. Following FDA approval in 1970, ketamine anesthesia was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Various psychoactive {{substances}} (both {{legal and}} illegal) have {{been implicated in}} causing, exacerbating, or precipitating psychotic states or disorders in users, with varying levels of evidence. This may be upon intoxication, for a more prolonged period after use, or upon withdrawal. Individuals who have a substance induced psychosis {{tend to have a}} greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness. Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), κ-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as <b>phencyclidine</b> and ketamine).|$|E
25|$|The racemic parent {{compound}} racemorphan was first {{described in a}} Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950. A resolution of the two isomers of racemorphan with tartaric acid was published in 1952, and DXM was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. DXM {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1958 as an over-the-counter antitussive. As had been initially hoped, DXM was a solution for some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} codeine phosphate as a cough suppressant, such as sedation and opiate dependence, but like the dissociative anesthetics <b>phencyclidine</b> and ketamine, DXM later became associated with nonmedical use.|$|E
25|$|Ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors {{can include}} NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. These receptors are named after agonists that facilitate glutamate activity. NMDA receptors are notable for their excitatory mechanisms to affect neuronal plasticity in learning and memory, {{as well as}} neuropathologies such as stroke and epilepsy. NDMA receptors have multiple binding sites just like ionotropic GABA receptors and can be influenced by co-agonists such the glycine neurotransmitter or <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP). The NMDA receptors carry a current by Ca2+ ions and can be blocked by extracellular Mg2+ ions depending on voltage and membrane potential. This Ca2+ influx is increased by excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produced by NMDA receptors, activating Ca2+-based signaling cascades (such as neurotransmitter release). AMPA generate shorter and larger excitatory postsynaptic currents than other ionotropic glutamate receptors.|$|E

500|$|Later observations, however, {{have caused}} the {{dopamine}} hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. [...] For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. [...] Also, other dissociative drugs, notably ketamine and <b>phencyclidine</b> that act on glutamate NMDA receptors (and not on dopamine receptors) can produce psychotic symptoms. Perhaps most importantly, those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia: [...] they only reduce a subset of symptoms, while producing severe short-term and long-term side effects. [...] Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists {{continue to believe that}} schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. [...] As the [...] "dopamine hypothesis" [...] has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.|$|E
500|$|Interest {{has also}} {{focused on the}} {{neurotransmitter}} glutamate and the reduced function of the NMDA glutamate receptor in schizophrenia, {{largely because of the}} abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in the postmortem brains of those diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the discovery that glutamate-blocking drugs such as <b>phencyclidine</b> and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition. Reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring frontal lobe and hippocampal function, and glutamate can affect dopamine function, both of which have been implicated in schizophrenia; this has suggested an important mediating (and possibly causal) role of glutamate pathways in the condition. But positive symptoms fail to respond to glutamatergic medication. [...] Closely related to evidence of glutamate dysfunction in schizophrenia is the observed changes GABAergic transmission. [...] Post-Mortem studies demonstrate decreased expression of GAD67, GAT-1 and GABAA receptor subunits in the prefrontal cortex, although this appears to be restricted to a certain subsets of parvalbumin containing GABAergic neurons. [...] While in vivo imaging of GABAergic signaling appears to be moderately reduced, this may be dependent upon treatment and disease stage.|$|E

2500|$|Dextromethorphan's hallucinogenic and dissociative {{effects can}} be {{attributed}} largely to dextrorphan (DXO), a metabolite produced when dextromethorphan is metabolized by the body. Both dextrorphan and dextromethorphan are NMDA receptor antagonists, like the dissociative hallucinogenic drugs ketamine and <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP), although dextrorphan is more potent than its [...] "parent molecule" [...] dextromethorphan.|$|E
2500|$|Over-the-counter {{preparations}} containing dextromethorphan {{have been}} used in manners inconsistent with their labeling, often as a recreational drug. At doses much higher than medically recommended, DXM and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which produces dissociative hallucinogenic states somewhat similar to ketamine and <b>phencyclidine.</b> Along with other drugs such as ketamine or <b>phencyclidine,</b> also known as PCP, there is a street name for dextromethorphan-infused substances which is also known as [...] "Angel." [...] It may produce distortions of the visual field – feelings of dissociation, distorted bodily perception, excitement, and a loss of sense of time. Some users report stimulant-like euphoria, particularly in response to music. Dextromethorphan usually provides its recreational effects in a non-linear fashion, so that they are experienced in significantly varied stages. These stages are commonly referred to as [...] "plateaus". Teens tend to have a higher likelihood to use dextromethorphan related drugs as it is easier to access, and an easier way to cope with psychiatric disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Autopsy results {{released}} by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner indicated that Terence Crutcher had [...] "acute <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP) intoxication" [...] {{at the time of}} the shooting. [...] The report stated that Crutcher had 96 nanograms per milliliter of PCP in his blood at the time of death. [...] The report also indicated that tenocyclidine (TCP), a psychostimulant and hallucinogen which is more potent than PCP, was present.|$|E
2500|$|At high doses, {{dextromethorphan}} {{is classified}} as a dissociative general anesthetic and hallucinogen, similar to the controlled substances ketamine and <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP). Also like those drugs, dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist. [...] Dextromethorphan generally does not produce withdrawal symptoms characteristic of physical dependence-inducing substances, {{but there have been}} cases of psychological dependence. Due to dextromethorphan's SSRI (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor)-like action, the sudden cessation of recreational dosing in tolerant individuals can result in mental and physical withdrawal symptoms similar to the withdrawal from SSRIs. These withdrawal effects can manifest as psychological effects, including depression, irritability, cravings, and as physical effects, including lethargy, body aches, and a sensation of unpleasant tingling, not unlike a mild [...] "electric shock." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{commonly}} held misconception is that <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP, angel dust) {{is the same}} as (or is synthesized from) embalming fluid. [...] Some people, believing this myth, have actually attempted to smoke cigarettes or cannabis dipped in real embalming fluid (i.e. formaldehyde), which is highly toxic. [...] Conversely, some users of PCP-laced cannabis believe (and are often told) that it contains embalming fluid proper and not PCP, or that the slang term [...] "dust" [...] really means embalming fluid proper. Sometimes, the two substances are even mixed together, in a further ostension of this legend. [...] Such concoctions are often called [...] "fry," [...] "wet," [...] "illy," [...] "sherm," [...] "worm," [...] "water-water," [...] "amp," [...] "dust(ed)," [...] or other names.|$|E
2500|$|Dextromethorphan has {{not been}} shown to cause vacuolization in animals, also known as Olney's lesions, despite early {{speculation}} that it might, due to similarities with <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP). In rats, oral administration of dextromethorphan did not cause vacuolization in laboratory tests. Oral administration of dextromethorphan repeatedly during adolescence, however, {{has been shown to}} impair learning in those rats during adulthood. The occurrence of Olney's lesions in humans, however, {{has not been}} proven or disproven. William E. White, author of the [...] "DXM FAQ," [...] has compiled informal research from correspondence with dextromethorphan users suggesting that heavy abuse may result in various deficits corresponding to the brain areas affected by Olney's lesions; these include loss of episodic memory, decline in ability to learn, abnormalities in some aspects of visual processing, and deficits of abstract language comprehension. In 2004, however, White retracted the article in which he made these claims.|$|E
2500|$|Glutamate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} excitatory neurotransmitter in vertebrate nervous systems. Evidence for the involvement of glutamate in schizophrenia includes analogous symptoms which are produced by glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists such as <b>phencyclidine</b> (PCP) and ketamine. PCP is a [...] non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist which produces hallucinations and delusions in normal subjects. In rat models, disturbed cognition, deficits in social interaction, locomotor anomalies, and prepulse inhibition deficits are seen on acute administration of PCP. Evidence that persistent PCP use and abuse in humans results in lasting deficits beyond the period of treatment {{has led to the}} suggestion that this regime in rodents may be a more accurate model of schizophrenia than acute administration. A number of protocols for chronic PCP animal models have been developed, with different effects. The effects of some, but not all protocols can be reversed by treatment with antipsychotics. In a primate model, PCP was found to induce cognitive impairments which were reversed with clozapine.|$|E
