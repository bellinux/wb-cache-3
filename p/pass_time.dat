25|$|Although the Chilean rodeo was {{declared}} a national sport, it {{finds itself in}} a precarious position in terms of finances, political support and promotion. Part {{of the reason for}} this is that the federation does not receive any of the revenue of Chiledeportes like the rest of sports federations in Chile. This is because only sports that represent Chile overseas receive funds. The Chilean Rodeo Federation has been critical of the government for the lack of funds towards the sport, arguing that because in many parts of the country, due to the distance from population centers, sporting events do not arrive, the local population turn to the rodeo as their primary <b>pass</b> <b>time</b> throughout the Chilean rural territory.

[...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] was the first episode that Martin received a writing credit for, and in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that he [...] "loved" [...] writing the episode.

A scene in the episode shows Homer buying new tires for his car. The scene was written by Brian Scully, who had been scammed by a Firestone Tire and Rubber Company dealer.

2500|$|Fassbinder's {{parents were}} cultured {{members of the}} bourgeoisie. His father mainly {{concentrated}} on his career, which he saw {{as a means to}} indulge his passion for writing poetry. His mother largely ignored him as well, spending the majority of her time with her husband working on his career. In 1951, Liselotte Pempeit and Helmut Fassbinder divorced. Helmut moved to Cologne while Liselotte raised her son as a single parent in Munich In order to support herself and her child, Pempeit took in boarders and found employment as a German to English translator. When she was working, she often sent her son to the cinema to <b>pass</b> <b>time.</b> Later in life, Fassbinder claimed that he saw at least a film a day, sometimes even four a day. During this period, Pempeit was often away from her son for long periods while she recuperated from tuberculosis. In his mother's absence, Fassbinder was looked after by his mother's tenants and friends. As he was often left alone, he became used to the independence and thus, became a juvenile delinquent. He clashed with his mother's younger lover Siggi, who lived with them when Fassbinder was around eight or nine years old. [...] He had a similar difficult relationship with the much older journalist Wolff Eder (c.1905–71), who became his stepfather in 1959.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{patterns}} of blogging, blogging motivations, and the roles of motivations as well as demographics as predictors for blogging behaviors. Six aspects of blogging behaviors are examined: 1) how bloggers cover topics in writing; 2) how bloggers manage feedbacks from readers; 3) how bloggers use hyperlinks; 4) how bloggers present themselves; 5) how bloggers expect readership; 6) how bloggers use design elements. Seven motivations for blogging emerge in this research: self-documentation, improving writing, self-expression, medium appeal, information, <b>passing</b> <b>time,</b> and socialization. Except for <b>passing</b> <b>time,</b> all the other six motivations were highly approved by bloggers. Most of those motivations are moderately correlated. Overall, certain motivations {{are found to be}} related with specific usage of blogs. Self-documentation is a predictor of feedback management, self-presentation, and readership expectation. Improving writing motivation works as a predictor for self-presentation and readership expectation. Self-expression predicts self-presentation, readership expectation, and design elements use. Medium appeal motivation predicts self-presentation. Information motivation predicts feedback management, use of hyperlinks, self-presentation, readership expectation, and design elements. <b>Passing</b> <b>time</b> motivation predicts self-presentation, design elements, and readership expectation. i Socialization motivation predicts use of hyperlinks, self-presentation, and readership expectation. Gender differences were located in many aspects of blogging. Men claim higher approval of information motivation while women endorse self-documentation, self-expression, and <b>passing</b> <b>time</b> more. Other than gender, age also plays a role in motivating people to blog. Motivations as self-documentation, self-expression, and <b>passing</b> <b>time</b> have a negative relationship with age.
