5|$|As {{integration}} of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, {{it follows that the}} static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described by a set of <b>piecewise</b> polynomials.|$|E
5|$|Point moments {{can thus}} be {{represented}} by the derivative of the delta function. Integration of the beam equation again results in <b>piecewise</b> polynomial deflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{finite element}} method is an {{important}} numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by <b>piecewise</b> linear functions, where the pieces are chosen {{with respect to a}} sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.|$|E
25|$|In {{geometric}} topology, PDIFF, for <b>piecewise</b> differentiable, is {{the category}} of piecewise-smooth manifolds and piecewise-smooth maps between them. It properly contains DIFF ({{the category of}} smooth manifolds and smooth functions between them) and PL (the category of <b>piecewise</b> linear manifolds and <b>piecewise</b> linear maps between them), and the reason it is defined is to allow one to relate these two categories. Further, <b>piecewise</b> functions such as splines and polygonal chains are common in mathematics, and PDIFF provides a category for discussing them.|$|E
25|$|PDIFF {{is mostly}} a {{technical}} point: smooth maps are not <b>piecewise</b> linear (unless linear), and <b>piecewise</b> linear maps are not smooth (unless globally linear) – the intersection is linear maps, or more precisely affine maps (because not based) – so they cannot directly be related: they are separate generalizations {{of the notion of}} an affine map.|$|E

25|$|For {{manifolds}} of dimension at most 6, any <b>piecewise</b> linear (PL) structure can be smoothed in {{an essentially}} unique way, so {{in particular the}} theory of 4 dimensional PL manifolds {{is much the same}} as the theory of 4 dimensional smooth manifolds.|$|E
25|$|With Dave Fortman {{producing}} The Oracle, The band took {{a different}} technical approach to recording their songs. While working on The Oracle in the studio, the band opted for laying down one track at a time, as opposed to recording composite parts and then assembling them in a <b>piecewise</b> manner.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} chaotic {{behavior}} of complex systems {{is not the}} issue. Meteorology {{has been known for}} years to involve complexeven chaoticbehavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The logistic map is only a second-degree polynomial; the horseshoe map is <b>piecewise</b> linear.|$|E
25|$|To gain C2 {{continuity}} the Bézier Curve loses local control, {{because to}} enforce C2 continuity the control points {{are dependent on}} each other. If a single control point moves, the whole spline needs to be re-evaluated. B-Splines have both C2 continuity and local control, but they lose the interpolation property of a <b>piecewise</b> Bézier.|$|E
25|$|The proof for {{functions}} that are <b>piecewise</b> linear but that allow intervals of constant height is similar, but involves {{a more complicated}} case analysis. Alternatively, one can find a path for modified functions {{in which all the}} intervals of constant height have been collapsed to points, and then extend the resulting path to the original functions.|$|E
25|$|This kind of delayed <b>piecewise</b> linear {{reconstruction}} {{is physically}} realizable by implementing a digital filter of gain H(z) = 1 − z−1, applying {{the output of}} that digital filter (which is simply x−x) to an ideal conventional digital-to-analog converter (that has an inherent zero-order hold as its model) and integrating (in continuous-time, H(s) = 1/(sT)) the DAC output.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though this}} is not what is {{physically}} done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), to a linear, time-invariant system, otherwise known as a linear filter with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the impulse response) so that each input impulse results in the correct <b>piecewise</b> linear function in the output.|$|E
25|$|An orbifold path is a {{path in the}} {{underlying}} space provided with an explicit <b>piecewise</b> lift of path segments to orbifold charts and explicit group elements identifying paths in overlapping charts; if {{the underlying}} path is a loop, it is called an orbifold loop. Two orbifold paths are identified if they are related through multiplication by group elements in orbifold charts. The orbifold fundamental group is the group formed by homotopy classes of orbifold loops.|$|E

In addition, Line 2 has a <b>piecewise</b> service pattern whereby the suburban segment between Guanglan Road Station and Pudong International Airport Station is served by a 4-car fleet separately. Passengers traveling across Guanglan Road on Line 2 must change trains across the platform at Guanglan Road.|$|E
25|$|Because hue is a {{circular}} quantity, represented numerically with a discontinuity at 360°, {{it is difficult}} to use in statistical computations or quantitative comparisons: analysis requires the use of circular statistics. Furthermore, hue is defined <b>piecewise,</b> in 60° chunks, where the relationship of lightness, value, and chroma to R, G, and B depends on the hue chunk in question. This definition introduces discontinuities, corners which can plainly be seen in horizontal slices of HSL or HSV.|$|E
25|$|The Whitehead {{group of}} a free abelian group is trivial, a 1964 result of Bass, Heller and Swan. This is quite hard to prove, but is {{important}} as it {{is used in the}} proof that an s-cobordism of dimension at least 6 whose ends are tori is a product. It is also the key algebraic result used in the surgery theory classification of <b>piecewise</b> linear manifolds of dimension at least 5 which are homotopy equivalent to a torus; this is the essential ingredient of the 1969 Kirby–Siebenmann structure theory of topological manifolds of dimension at least 5.|$|E
25|$|If a graph {{is drawn}} {{in the plane}} with {{straight}} line edges, then an equilibrium stress is defined as an assignment of nonzero real numbers (weights) to the edges, with the property that each vertex is in the position given by the weighted sum of its neighbors. According to the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, an equilibrium stress can be lifted to a <b>piecewise</b> linear continuous three-dimensional surface such that the edges forming the boundaries between the flat parts of the surface project to the given drawing. The weight and length of each edge determines the difference in slopes of the surface {{on either side of}} the edge, and the condition that each vertex is in equilibrium with its neighbors is equivalent to the condition that these slope differences cause the surface to meet up with itself correctly in the neighborhood of the vertex. Positive weights translate to convex dihedral angles between two faces of the <b>piecewise</b> linear surface, and negative weights translate to concave dihedral angles. Conversely, every continuous piecewise-linear surface comes from an equilibrium stress in this way. If a finite planar graph is drawn and given an equilibrium stress in such a way that all interior edges of the drawing have positive weights, and all exterior edges have negative weights, then by translating this stress into a three-dimensional surface in this way, and then replacing the flat surface representing the exterior of the graph by its complement in the same plane, one obtains a convex poyhedron, with the additional property that its perpendicular projection onto the plane has no crossings.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{ergodicity}} can {{be broken}} is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a <b>piecewise</b> linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that {{the behavior of the}} system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development of}} soliton mathematics.|$|E
