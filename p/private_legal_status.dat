The text which due to the topic tends to descriptiveness, points out also some vagueness and dubiousness of objektive legislation as well as it's plausible solutions offered by {{the practice of the}} courts. In my opinion this topic is very topical and established at the same time. Also the <b>private</b> <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of many subjects, especially but not exclusively the owners of the real estates, is affected by the matter of proprietary registration. The thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter one provides general view on the matter of the real estates cadastre, icluding the real estate evidence grand and short history discursion. In my humble opinion this discursion is advisable considering variety of real estate aquisition regulations during the last century. In chapter two the matter, subject and atribution of the real estates cadastre are described, the basic rules of cadastre management and administration are listed and basic as well as related laws and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Transnational Corporations (TNCs), {{especially}} those operating in developing countries, have enormous socio-economic power— sometimes more than states. Many TNCs seek poor and unregulated markets, employing cheap, underage and fragile children, {{so they can}} create an economic competitive advantage and meet increasing international marketing demands. While many of them bring business and prosperity to a region, the damages can outweigh these benefits they perpetuate when behaving irresponsibly - occasionally irreparably - detrimentally impacting on children’s enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. The problem is exacerbated when national governments are {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate TNCs’ operations. It shall be argued that despite the <b>private</b> <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of TNCs, they are subjected to human rights obligations because some forms of exploitative child labor has become universally condemned and thus possess jus cogens status. The analysis shows that there is no deficiency within international human right standards regarding child labor and these maybe interpreted as giving direct obligations to TNCs to respect, protect and fulfill children’s rights. The rising numbers of exploitative child labor, however, raises serious doubts about the effectiveness of those standards to adequately regulate powerful TNCs, which are not limited to concepts of territorial sovereignty. The results of the research depicts the desperate need for a renewed international legal framework going beyond soft law approaches, to clearly define legal obligations and methods to enforce responsibilities on: TNCs; states; other non-state actors; and the child itself, which is key to ensuring effective protection and fulfillment of children’s rights...|$|E

40|$|Privatization {{intends to}} promote {{organizations}} {{to be more}} responsive to consumer demands. Market institutions will force organizations to provide public goods in a more efficient way. However, the practice of privatization in the Netherlands shows that privatized organizations are less responsive to customers than before. Privatization of an organization implies that democratic accountability is also privatized. This development is explained from a multi-dimensional organizational perspective. In practice, privatization does not entail a shift from public monopoly to a free competitive market, but mostly the creation of powerful private enterprises operating in highly regulated and closed sectors. Privatized organizations are <b>private</b> in <b>legal</b> <b>status,</b> but continue to operate in a public environment. This duality implies a problem of control, because privatized organizations then have abundant and unconstrained discretionary powers to decide about redistributive policies. In a word, privatization is {{likely to lead to}} a public domain dominated by powerful private bureaucracies vis-à-vis a less powerful state and loyal, passive consumers...|$|R
40|$|Setting up of {{agricultural}} producers in associative forms open up {{opportunities for the}} economic development of their activities, by attracting local or regional advantages and using collective power to increase the prosperity of members, their families and communities they belong to. Associative forms are founded to function on democratic principles valid for all members. The first forms of association {{in the rural areas}} in Romania have arose while introducing the modern cooperative principles materialized by Ion Ionescu de la Brad (1818 - 1891), economist, statistician, agronomist, prominent representative of Romanian agricultural sciences and famous politician from that time. The members of associative forms, in any form of organizing they belong to (associations, cooperatives or producers groups), have established democratic rights. Agricultural cooperative is an autonomous association of individuals and / or <b>legal</b> persons, with <b>private</b> <b>legal</b> entity <b>status,</b> established on the freely expressed consent of the parties, to promote the interests of cooperative members. Producer groups can be established for marketing of vegetable, animal, or forestry products.

Using the 2001 – 2014 California Health Interview Surveys, the objectives are: (1) to demonstrate population-level changes in the <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> of parents, the <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> of children, {{and the likelihood of}} receiving dental care; (2) to reveal how the roles of <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> boundaries in dental care are changing; and (3) to determine whether the salience of these boundaries is attributable to <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> per se. The results reveal increases in the native-born share and dental care utilization for the total Mexican-origin population. Although dental care was primarily linked to parental citizenship early in this period, parental <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> are no longer a unique source of variation in utilization (despite the greater likelihood of insurance among citizens). These results imply that future gains in utilization among Mexican-origin children will mainly come from overcoming barriers to care among the native born...|$|R

30|$|While the {{literature}} is suggestive of this indirect effect of irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> on non-mobile transnational activities, few studies have simultaneously examined either the direct relationship between short returns and non-mobile transnational activities or the indirect relationship between irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> and non-mobile transnational activities transmitted via inhibited cross-border mobility. Waldinger (2008, p. 24) notes that “better settled migrants with secure <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> {{are more likely to}} engage in activities requiring physical presence in the homeland,” but he does not examine the impact that migrants’ <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> has on both physical presence in the homeland and the activities that require such presence. Carling (2008) points out that migrants who do not visit home cannot directly observe whether their families use remittances as intended. We thus hypothesize that irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> will indirectly constrain non-mobile transnational activities. Migrants who do not have the ability to circulate between destination and origin because of their irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> are effectively prevented from engaging in transnational livelihoods that depend on this circulation.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. The next section reviews {{the literature on}} transnational activities and argues that state immigration-control policies create irregular <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> that have both direct and indirect effects on both mobile and non-mobile transnational activities. We then review the data and methods, highlighting the advantages of MAFE’s longitudinal data on both transnational activities and <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> and the models we use to estimate direct and indirect effects. The results of these models show that Senegalese migrants are territorially confined by irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status,</b> limiting their ability to visit their homeland. The effects on remitting, however, are more complicated and not only depend directly and indirectly on <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> but also vary by destination. The final sections discuss these results, {{with an emphasis on}} why the effects of <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> vary by national context, and conclude with implications of the findings for policies of immigration control and co-development.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between {{crime and the}} <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of immigrants remains understudied but studies on amnesty programs in the United States and Italy suggest that <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> can largely explain the differences in crime between legal and illegal immigrants, most likely because <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> leads to greater job market opportunities for the immigrants. However, one study finds that the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 led {{to an increase in}} crime among previously undocumented immigrants.|$|R
30|$|A {{relationship}} between short {{visits to the}} origin community and other transnational activities {{opens the door to}} the possibility of an indirect effect of irregular <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> on non-mobile transnational activities. Waldinger (2008, 2015) argues that states effectively “cage” migrants with irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> by constraining their movement across borders. This caging not only limits migrants’ physical movement but also, by limiting physical co-presence with important people “back home,” constrains their social ties to the homeland. Short returns home thus act as a mediator of irregular <b>legal</b> <b>statuses.</b> If migrants with irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> experience territorial confinement that constrains their ability to circulate, and if short visits to the homeland allow migrants to maintain social ties and gather information, and if these ties and information encourage migrants to participate in other forms of cross-border action, then migrants with irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> should participate less in those forms of cross-border action that depend in some way on at least occasional physical presence in the homeland.|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} and estimated a Heckman-type two stage model with <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of farm workers using an ordered probit {{model in the}} first stage and a duration model in the second stage. Using the National Agricultural Workers Survey, self-reported <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> categories are: unauthorized, authorized, permanent resident, or citizen. The duration model is estimated conditionally upon the worker's <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> to address selectivity bias. The duration estimation has significant coefficients on the selection bias correction term for all <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> equations except for that of citizen workers. The most important finding from our estimation is that unauthorized workers do not necessarily have shorter farm job durations than legal workers. First, the average predicted farm job duration for unauthorized workers is the second longest among the four <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> categories. Second, the simulation analysis indicates that the duration of the "typical" unauthorized worker will be longer when working under an authorized or permanent resident status.

30|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>status</b> {{is clearly}} the key factor in {{allowing}} migrants to travel freely between destination and their home communities: those migrants who lack secure <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> {{are less likely to}} engage in this kind of physical circulation because they are not guaranteed re-entry and do not want to risk the cost and potential danger of an unauthorized entry (Massey, Durand, & Malone, 2002). Empirical research demonstrates the relationship between <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> and circulation. Kaag (2008) finds that Senegalese migrants in Italy without “papers” describe themselves as being “stuck” because {{they do not want to}} expose themselves to the cost and risk of an additional irregular passage. Waldinger (2008) finds that homeland visits are the most common form of cross-border activity among his sample of Colombians, Cubans, Dominicans, and Salvadorans, and he also finds that secure <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> strongly predicts the probability of travel home. Immigration policies are thus a crucial conditioning factor for this form of cross-border engagement: migrants who lack secure <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> experience a “territorial confinement” (Waldinger, 2008) that constrains their movement across national borders. We thus hypothesize a direct negative effect of irregular <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> on migrants’ propensity to return home for short visits because of the legal barrier to mobility inherent in irregular status.|$|R
