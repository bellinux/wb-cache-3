Quite contrarily, she also took on the role of a funerary deity in this period, evidenced by the commonplace practice of placing hippopotami decorated with marsh flora in tombs and temples. Some scholars believe that this practice demonstrates that hippopotamus goddesses facilitated the process of rebirth after death, just as they aided in earthly births. These statues, then, assisted the deceased's passing into the afterlife.|$|E

Guinefort the greyhound belonged to a knight who lived in a castle near Lyon. One day, the knight went hunting, leaving his infant son in the care of Guinefort. When he returned, he found the nursery in chaos - the cot was overturned, the child {{was nowhere to be seen}} and Guinefort greeted his master with bloody jaws. Believing Guinefort to have devoured his son, the knight slew the dog. He then heard a child crying; he turned over the cot and found his son lying there, safe and sound, along with the body of a viper. Guinefort had killed the snake and saved the child.

The leading argument of the contemporary trade protectionism, also in the EEC countries, is the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> income and employment. Since protectionism is costly, it should be applied on a temporary basis only. Extended trade protectionism leads to the petrification of obsolete economic structures and weakens the economic efficiency.

5000|$|The {{government}} had to react and so devised a plan in providing strong financial incentives to private companies between the 1960s and 1970s. It consisted on the government choosing select family businesses to distribute the incentives (imported raw materials, commodities, bank loans).

The <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> companies allowed them to develop because of the highly regulated market, which prevented foreign companies from entering.

The 1961 Convention emphasized {{the concept of the}} [...] "interests of the child" [...] as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. It built upon prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties and brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of [...] "nationality" [...] as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of [...] "habitual residence." [...] The convention also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the Boll case (regarding the Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors). Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as illegal.|$|E

The mother-to-child transmissionmodel of HIV- 1 provides the opportunity to examine whether the breadth of maternal NAbs is associated with <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> from infection. Samples were obtained at delivery from 57 transmitting mothers (T) matched with 57 nontransmitting mothers (NT) enrolled in the multicenter French perinatal cohort (ANRS EPF CO 1) between 1990 and 1996. Sixty-eight (59. 6 %) and 46 (40. 4 %) women were infected by B and non-B viruses, re-spectively. Neutralization assays were carried out with TZM-bl cells, using a panel of 10 primary isolates of 6 clades (A, B, C, F, CRF 01 _AE, and CRF 02 _AG), selected for their moderate or low sensitivity to neutralization. Neutralization breadths were not statistically different between T and NTmothers. However, a few statistically significant differences were observed, with higher frequencies or titers of NAbs toward several individual strains for NTmothers when the clade B-infected or non-clade B-infected mothers were analyzed separately.

Interest {{is growing in}} the possibility that vaccination at birth might provide earlier <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>infants,</b> but early vaccination also gives rise to concerns over the potential for excessive Th 2 -polarisation of pertussis-specific T-cell memory profiles. We evaluated this issue {{as part of a}} small pilot study comparing infants receiving a monovalent acellular pertussis vaccine (aP) at birth or birth and at 1 month, followed by DTaP at 2, 4 and 6 months with infants receiving DTaP only from 2 months.

In the aftermath of the Korean-War in 1950 s, the country rebuilt its economy through government-driven economic policies with a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> industries. The continued growth in GDP per capita seemed to prove the effectiveness of such top-down interventionist programs until the Asian financial crisis in 1997. With aggressive reforms, the country quickly reimbursed its IMF loans and began to show signs of growth again. Nonetheless, the source of growth this time was different as the Korean economy began a shift away from labor- or capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-based and technology-driven higher valued-added activities. The emergence of Korea’s online game cluster is the result of this transformation of Korea’s economy.
