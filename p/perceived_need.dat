5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, the United States had {{experienced}} panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions—the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during both the 1884 and the 1890 panics. A bank crisis in 1896, in which there was a <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} current <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> {{of the general}} {{population}} in a war-affected setting, and to study the influence of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> on the participants’ mental health status and functional impairment across genders. Methods A cross-sectional community survey (n= 464) was conducted in war-affected South Sudan. Three regression models were analysed. <b>Perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were assessed with the Humanitarian Emergency Settings <b>Perceived</b> <b>Needs</b> Scale. Psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire and level of functioning by the Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12). Results The most frequently expressed needs were related to drinking water, alcohol and drug use in the community and access to sanitation facilities. No gender differences were found regarding the level of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> or the number of traumatic events. Higher level of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> significantly predicted psychological distress and lower level of functioning even when numbers of experienced trauma events were taken into account. Conclusions The associations of higher level of needs and trauma experiences, on the one hand, and negative health outcomes on the other, necessitate a greater integration of interventions directed towards the population's <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> and mental health, particularly for those who have been exposed to trauma...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} a new methodology {{to assess the}} <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> of Indigenous Australians in two urban communities. This methodology, utilizing graphics, allowed for the classification of general areas of need into four domains namely, health, education and employment, housing {{as well as social}} issues and community facilities. In addition participants were able to prioritize their identified needs both within the four domains as well as across domains. Overall, a number of similarities of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were noted between the communities.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Schizophrenia is {{a chronic}} mental illness, and sufferers are usually {{dependent}} on family, primary caregivers in particular. The {{present study was}} designed to assess the <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> of caregivers so that adequate services can be provided for them in the community. Methods: A total of 177 primary caregivers were interviewed with the structured burden-and-need schedules to determine their <b>perceived</b> <b>needs,</b> and the related clinical and demographic factors. Fourteen <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were identified and classified into different need clusters using the generalized association plots. A multiple regression of logistic model was adopted to explore the relationships between the related factors and <b>perceived</b> <b>needs.</b> Results: Four clusters of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were identified, which included assistant patient care (77. 6 %), access to relevant information (66. 1 %), societal support (68. 2 %), and burden release (27. 2 %). These needs were significantly related to number of admissions, duration of illness, relationship between caregiver and patient, and education level of the caregiver. Conclusion: Four clusters of caregivers' <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were identified and found to be related to psychopathologic and demographic factors. These data are of value in designing appropriate community psychiatric programs {{to improve the quality of}} care and enhance the capacity of primary caregivers to care for patients...|$|R
5|$|The regime {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. In addition to taking control {{of tens of thousands}} of previously privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly {{demonstrated}} by the Crimean War, along with Australia-wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's defence posture. The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss {{to report on the}} defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence {{in the hands of the}} Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400-ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} Chinese cancer survivors’ <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> for survivorship care and {{to evaluate whether}} these needs could impact their willingness to use traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey {{with members of the}} Beijing Anti-Cancer Association in China. We measured <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> with the seven-item Brief Chinese Cancer Survivorship Needs Scale that assesses psychological, functional, nutritional, social, body image, pain, and symptom needs. The outcome variable was willingness to use TCM for survivorship care. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate whether <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> are associated with willingness. Results: A total of 600 patients were invited, with a response rate of 81 %. The mean (standard deviation) score of the <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> scale (0 to 10) was 4. 4 (2. 2), with the majority of participants endorsing nutritional (72 %), symptom (65 %), and psychological (54 %) needs. Among survivors, 387 (80 %; 95 % CI, 76 % to 83 %) were willing to use TCM for survivorship care. In multivariable analysis, a higher <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> score (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1. 33; 95 % CI, 1. 14 to 1. 56; P <. 001) was associated with greater willingness to use TCM. Specifically, nutritional (OR, 3. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 79 to 5. 62; P <. 001) and symptom needs (OR, 3. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 79 to 5. 55; P <. 001) had the strongest relationship. Conclusion: A higher level of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs,</b> especially in the areas of nutrition and symptoms, was associated with greater willingness to use TCM for survivorship care...|$|R

Fatigue, nausea, appetite loss and vomiting were the most commonly experienced and most debilitating physical symptoms. Approximately 25 % of participants had borderline or clinical levels of anxiety and depression. Although relatively low levels of <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> were reported, physical and psychological needs were the most common.

40|$|Background: Family {{members of}} {{critically}} ill patients are affected {{in one way}} or another when their critically ill patient is admitted at reu, taking in consideration that these family members serve as a bridge between health care providers and critically ill patients who are physiologically or psychologically compromised. However, in Tanzania no study has been documented to address the needs and level of satisfaction with care provided to themselves and their patients in reu. Objectives: This study aimed to assess <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> and level of satisfaction with care by family members of critically ill patients admitted at reu. Two specific objectives guided the study; the first was to identify the <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> of family members of critically ill patients. Second was to determine the level of family members' satisfaction with care provided to them and to their critically ill patients. Methods: A quantitative research methodology using a descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted. <b>Perceived</b> <b>needs</b> and level of satisfaction with care were assessed using structured questionnaires. Study population was one hundred and ten family members who visited their relatives who were critically ill and admitted at leu. Data was analyzed using statistical packages to interpret the findings. The duration of the study was two months and the results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Results: Results revealed that 72 % of the family members <b>perceived</b> the <b>need</b> of having a specific person to call at the hospital when a family member is not there as the very important need. Only 23 % of the respondents <b>perceived</b> the <b>need</b> of talking about the possibility of patient's death as very important. The study showed that educational background had associations with many <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> compared to other demographics. The care given to the patients by nurses more satisfied the family members compared to other care, 31 % was very satisfied with this care. Satisfaction with lCU environment scored the least among all cares itemized. Conclusion: The <b>perceived</b> <b>needs</b> showed by the family members of critically ill patients and level of satisfaction with care could have serious outcome on patients' recovery in rCu. Nurses who are always nearby and taking care of these patients have to know the needs of family members and use part of their time to care for them and hence raise their level of satisfaction and hence good outcome to the patients' recovery...|$|R

These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorised the Quran in its entirety (huffaz) were dying, especially in battle.|$|E

The lack {{of health care and}} high rates of life-threatening illness (such as HIV/AIDS) in developing countries, such as those in Africa, are supporting reasons for the inadequate supply of fertility treatment options.
