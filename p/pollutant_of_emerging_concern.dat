40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{are considered}} highly competitive water treatment technologies {{for the removal}} of organic pollutants. Among AOP techniques, photocatalysis has recently been the most widely studied. Our aims were to investigate how the dispersion of nanosized titanium dioxide (nanoTiO 2) applied in photodegradation-based procedures can be stabilized with cyclodextrins in order to obtain a new, more efficient photocatalyst for the purification of waters polluted by xenobiotics applying UV irradiation. During our work, on the one hand, we studied the behavior and stability of nanoTiO 2 in cyclodextrin solutions. On the other hand, we used various monomer and polymer cyclodextrin derivatives, and assessed the options for nanoTiO 2 stabilization in the presence of various salts and tap water on the basis of turbidity tests. The physical stability of nanoTiO 2 dispersions is diminished {{in the presence of the}} salts found in tap water (and occurring also in surface waters and ground water) and they are precipitated immediately. This colloidal instability can be improved by cyclodextrin derivatives. Based on the results of our studies we have selected carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin polymer (CMBCD-P) for stabilization of nanoTiO 2 dispersions. The photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and ibuprofen as model organic pollutants in various media (distilled water, NaCl solution and tap water) has been studied using nanoTiO 2 as catalyst stabilized by CMBCD-P. CMBCD-P itself showed a catalytic effect on the UV degradation of methylene blue. In addition to enhancing the colloid stability of nanoTiO 2 CMBCD-P showed also synergistic effects in catalyzing the photodecomposition process of the dye. On the other hand, ibuprofen as a model pharmaceutical, a <b>pollutant</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> (EP), was protected by CMBCD-P against the photocatalytic degradation showing that inclusion complex formation can result in opposite effects depending on the structure of the host–guest complex...|$|E

30|$|Chemical {{analysis}} generally {{requires a}} priori {{knowledge about the}} type of substances to be monitored as, for technical and economic reasons, {{it is not possible}} to analyse, detect and quantify all substances that are present in the aquatic environment. Even for the thousands of unique substances registered under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) it would be highly challenging to perform a chemical monitoring programme on the aquatic environment. Furthermore, to estimate the risk of effects related to the large number of substances that are present and detected in the environment (including <b>pollutants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern,</b> metabolites and transformation products), it would be necessary to develop a very large number of assessment criteria (EQS).

40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) are compounds considered <b>pollutants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern.</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) defines emerging pollutants as new chemicals without regulatory {{status and}} with {{an impact on the}} environment and human health that is poorly understood. Bisphenol A (BPA) has been considered an EDC and found to be ubiquitous in the environment because of its presence in a multitude of products including food and beverage packaging, flame retardants, adhesives, building materials, electronic components, and paper coatings Currently, BPA is not regulated by the federal government in the US and waste water treatment plants are not designed nor required to remove it. As wastewater effluent for drinking water use becomes a reality in our society, it warrants a need to develop methods to effectively remove BPA from wastewater. This project proposed a novel sorption application in which we incorporated bentonite and activated carbon with the gelling properties of alginate to develop alginate gel-based (hydrogel) and dry beads to remove BPA. This adsorbent material {{has the potential to be}} a low cost and non-toxic alternative for the real world applications. Two types of materials were made, Alginate-Bentonite (AlgB) and Alginate-Activated carbon (AlgC) in this study. The objectives were to (1) study the removal of BPA by AlgB and AlgC under different conditions: sorbent dose (1. 50 mg/mL- 5. 00 mg/mL), temperatures (18 °C- 40 °C) and pH (2. 28 - 11. 87); and (2) to test the removal ability on wastewater to analyze the matrix effect and the feasibility of real world use. Analysis of BPA was performed by Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) coupled with Thermal Desorption (TD) followed by Gas-Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). ^ The AlgB beads were not able to effectively remove BPA from aqueous solutions when compared with AlgC beads.

40|$|Many {{environmental}} <b>pollutants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> {{can escape}} from remediation in conventional wastewater treatment plants, hence {{they could be}} found in surface waters at low concentration levels. The removal of these contaminants requires new technological solutions, an application field where siliceous porous materials seem to be particularly useful thanks to their adsorption properties. In fact, zeolites have been used as adsorbent media for specific classes of chemicals, including hydrocarbons, halocarbons and pharmaceuticals [1, 2]. Moreover, due to their high chemical and thermal stabilities, these materials can be considered environmentally compatible. This study has a dual purpose: 1) to measure the sorption capacity of organophilic zeolites (BEA, Y and ZSM- 5) and a mesoporous silica material (MCM- 41) towards various organic compounds in water, in order to verify their removal efficiency for potential use in wastewater and groundwater remediation and 2) to understand the structure features for adsorption of organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. The adsorption process was very fast in all zeolites towards several classes <b>of</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Adsorption isotherms and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the amount <b>of</b> the organic <b>pollutant</b> embedded inside the framework is related both to lattice structure and to adsorbent hydrophobicity. The adsorption capacity of a given materials depends also on the pH of the solution and on the ionization constant of the target molecule. The competitive adsorption of two components (i. e. dichloroethane and methylterbutylether / ZSM- 5) was proved also by X-ray analysis: diffractometric data showed that methylterbutylether was preferentially adsorbed into the straight 10 -ring channel of the ZSM- 5 whereas dichloroethane molecules were preferably hosted in the sinusoidal channel. The process of competitive adsorption for a binary mixture of contaminants occurs with a reorientation of the adsorbed species. Another field where the study of the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by siliceous porous materials could be of great interest is the drug delivery in nanomedicine applications. These materials could be employed for hosting and in-situ delivering a variety of molecules of pharmaceutical interest, which are selectively entrapped within their pores and specifically transported in the body to an exact location...|$|R

The effects of PPCPs on human health are not yet well known; however, recent {{research has found that}} exposure to these chemicals has some adverse developmental effects on aquatic species at low concentrations in lab exposure studies. ^ Present research on PPCPs focuses on their occurrences, concentrations, fate, and transport in the environment. The major goal of this research was to analyze the presence of PPCPs in wastewater and river samples collected in the El Paso, Texas area. The objective {{of this study is to}} (1) optimize an existing analytical method to obtain higher sensitivity, (2) establish a baseline of concentrations of PPCPs in this border region, and (3) assess the impacts of PPCP in wastewater bio-solids from wastewater treatment plants in the El Paso, TX. ^ This research was modeled after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1694 : Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS. The principle target compounds for this study are acetaminophen, fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin, caffeine, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, codeine, cotinine, and erythromycin. Samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed on a Linear Ion Trap (LTQ) for the presence of the target analytes. A preliminary study on the influent, effluent and sludge wastewater samples collected from two wastewater facilities in the El Paso, TX region showed the presence of PPCPs in the ppt (ng/L) to ppq (pg/L) range. Fifty-four wastewater samples and six sludge samples have been processed for analysis and are being stored for further study once instrumentation time has been allotted. These samples will help to form a baseline and better understanding of the presence of PPCPs. The data will provide valuable information for future research addressing the concern of PPCPs on human health and water quality. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{chemical}} stressors affect primary producers in estuarine and coastal waters is largely unknown. However, given the large number <b>of</b> legacy <b>pollutants</b> and chemicals <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> present in the environment, {{this is an important}} and relevant issue that requires further study. The purpose of our study was to extract and identify compounds which are inhibitors of photosystem II activity in microalgae from estuarine and coastal waters. Field sampling was conducted in the Western Scheldt estuary (Hansweert, The Netherlands). We compared four different commonly used extraction methods: passive sampling with silicone rubber sheets, polar organic integrative samplers (POCIS) and spot water sampling using two different solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Toxic effects of extracts prepared from spot water samples and passive samplers were determined in the Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry bioassay. With target chemical analysis using LC-MS and GC-MS, a set of PAHs, PCBs and pesticides was determined in field samples. These compound classes are listed as priority substances for the marine environment by the OSPAR convention. In addition, recovery experiments with both SPE cartridges were performed to evaluate the extraction suitability of these methods. Passive sampling using silicone rubber sheets and POCIS can be applied to determine compounds with different structures and polarities for further identification and determination of toxic pressure on primary producers. The added value of SPE lies in its suitability for quantitative analysis; calibration of passive samplers still needs further investigation for quantification of field concentrations of contaminants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

In this work a chemometric approach to positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) optimization for the simultaneous determination <b>of</b> contaminants <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> in water samples by liquid chromatography-ion trap-time of flight-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-IT-TOF-HRMS) was applied. Three types of phase modifiers were used: formic acid, ammonium hydroxide and formic acid/ammonium formate. The effects of operational parameters such as mobile phase modifier concentrations, mobile phase flow rate, heating block temperature and drying gas flow rate were evaluated by the 24 − 1 fractional factorial experimental design, resolution IV, in the screening phase and byDoehlert experimental design. Initial factorial experimental design studies indicated that the phasemodifier ammonium hydroxide was more efficient {{compared to the other}} evaluated modifiers. It provided higher ion intensities to the majority of analytes. Doehlert experimental design allowed finding a region indicative of the optimum experimental conditions for most analytes.
