50|$|A Monégasque {{ordinance}} of 15 May 1911 {{acknowledged the}} child as Louis' daughter, and admitted her into the Grimaldi dynasty. However this was discovered to be in <b>procedural</b> <b>violation</b> of the statutes of 1882. The ordinance was therefore invalid, and the sovereign prince was so notified by the National Council of Monaco in 1918. As a consequence, an amendment of 30 October 1918 modified the law to allow the reigning prince or, with the monarch's consent, the Hereditary Prince of Monaco (the heir presumptive, whether {{a child of the}} reigning prince or not), to adopt a child, from within or without the princely dynasty, in the absence of legitimate issue of his own. The law stipulated that the adopted child would fully inherit all the rights, titles and prerogatives of the person who adopted him, including succession rights to the crown. The amendment also provided that, should the prince have legitimate issue after such an adoption, the adopted child would follow such issue in the order of succession. Another ordinance of 31 October 1918 stated the conditions for an adoption.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the law and practice of the ICTY, ICTR and ICC with respect to <b>procedural</b> <b>violations,</b> including how such international criminal tribunals have dealt with the unique severity of the crimes falling within their jurisdiction in this context. The picture that emerges from such law and practice may be one of an array of responses that is available in respect {{of a wide range of}} violations. Nevertheless, the law and practice of the international criminal tribunals in this regard is still very much in development. For example, while such tribunals have referred to various rationales for responding to <b>procedural</b> <b>violations,</b> they have not yet properly identified (and expanded on) the primary rationale(s) for doing so, sometimes citing numerous rationales in the same breath, citing certain rationales but not others, or otherwise failing to explain the meaning of nebulous terms such as ‘fairness’ and ‘integrity’. Nor is such law and practice clear on how to accommodate the public interest in the investigation and prosecution of very serious crime in responding to <b>procedural</b> <b>violations.</b> In particular, the international criminal tribunals’ law and practice is unclear on how such public interest relates to the (violated) rights of the suspect or accused. Since the seriousness of the crime(s) charged will inevitably enter the analysis in responding to <b>procedural</b> <b>violations</b> in international criminal proceedings, it is of paramount importance that international criminal tribunals come to terms with this issue. In addition, therefore, this chapter addresses the question of how best to accommodate the various — seemingly competing — interests in international criminal proceedings when responding to <b>procedural</b> <b>violations.</b> It will be argued that, in accommodating the public interest in the investigation and prosecution of very serious crime and the rights of the suspect or accused, it is important not to divorce either from the context in which they are being exercised: (international) criminal proceedings. By considering such interests in the context of broader objectives of (international) criminal justice, it becomes easier to reconcile seemingly competing interests and to distinguish illegitimate interests from legitimate ones...|$|R

40|$|Over recent years, {{the issue}} of {{corruption}} in the public construction sector has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers worldwide. However, limited efforts are available for investigating the underlying factors of corruption in this sector. Thus, this study attempted to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the underlying factors of corruption in the public construction sector of China. To achieve this goal, a total of 14 structured interviews were first carried out, and a questionnaire survey was then administered to 188 professionals in China. Two iterations of multivariate analysis approaches, namely, stepwise multiple regression analysis and partial least squares structural equation modeling were successively utilized to analyze the collected data. In addition, a case study was also conducted to triangulate the findings obtained from the statistical analysis. The results generated from these three research methods achieve the same conclusion: the most influential underlying factor leading to corruption was immorality, followed by opacity, unfairness, <b>procedural</b> <b>violation,</b> and contractual violation. This study {{has contributed to the}} body of knowledge by exploring the properties of corruption in the public construction sector.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BRE 2015 Shanxxi, 324 pages :illustrations (some color) The social {{image of}} the public {{construction}} sector has deteriorated because of a growing incidence of corrupt practices worldwide over the past decade, particularly in developing countries such as China. Such corrupt practices are a by-product of continual economic growth and rapid urbanization. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, total investment in public infrastructure and construction projects in the country increased by almost 15 times from USD 0. 16 trillion in 1993 to USD 2. 33 trillion in 2012. However, such huge investments have caused serious corruption in the Chinese public construction sector. The National Bureau of Corruption Prevention of China reported 15, 010 recorded cases of corruption in the public construction sector between 2009 and 2011; these incidences of corruption caused an estimated loss of USD 490 million. Given this severe situation, this study focuses on corruption issues in the Chinese public construction sector and aims to address a set of key {{issues related to the}} topic, including corruption indicators, causes of corruption, and the prevailing anti-corruption strategies. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were combined to facilitate this study. First, a comprehensive literature review and a series of structured interviews were sequentially conducted to establish and refine the frameworks of corruption indicators, causes of corruption, and prevailing anti-corruption strategies {{in the context of the}} Chinese public construction sector. Second, based on the interview results, a questionnaire survey was administered to solicit opinion-based data of corruption indicators, causes of corruption, and prevailing anti-corruption strategies from target respondents. A total of 188 valid replies were obtained. Third, based on the data collected from the questionnaire survey, factor analysis was conducted to consolidate the aforementioned frameworks. Fourth, partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to investigate the underlying corruption indicators, principal causes of corruption, and the effectiveness of the prevailing anti-corruption strategies. Lastly, an evaluation model was developed by using fuzzy set theory to assess the vulnerability of Chinese public construction projects to corruption. This study revealed five underlying corruption indicators, namely, immorality, opacity, unfairness, <b>procedural</b> <b>violation,</b> and contractual violation. Immorality was found to be the most influential underlying corruption indicator. This study consolidated two principal causes of corruption in the Chinese public construction sector, namely, flawed regulation systems and lack of a positive industrial climate. The former was found to contribute more to corruption than the latter. With respect to the four prevailing anti-corruption strategies, this study found that only leadership received a marginal acceptable evaluation on its effectiveness. The remaining three strategies, namely, rules and regulations, sanctions, and training, were found to be ineffective. The newly developed evaluation model for predicting vulnerability to corruption was also applied in two real-life public projects. Generally, the predicted results conform to reality.

Diskutuojama, ar slaptiesiems tyrimo veiksmams būdingi požymiai yra pakankami siekiant konkretizuoti kai kurių slaptųjų tyrimo veiksmų procesines formas ir išvengti pastarųjų painiavos.

The {{article focuses}} on the {{procedural}} problems of the undercover investigation actions‘ (UIA) procedural form, i. e. its harmonisation to others. The author discusses whether the features of UIA, that are making these procedural actions as one-way standing actions in the system of all over procedural actions in Lithuanian criminal procedure, could be sufficient in order to clarify distinction between UIA and other so-called public investigation actions. In other words, the author is making efforts to theoretically establish the concretized (individual) procedural forms for current undercover actions. The next {{question is whether the}} specific features, that are describing all the UIA, are clear and exact to identify the principle difference between the actions of undercover officers (Art. 158 of CPC) and secret surveillance (Art. 160 of CPC). One could say, that the judicial practice is facing the problems of law interpreting and application while those two legal provisions of the CPC must be applied. Any legal interpretation mess of the application of procedural forms is taking the law enforcement and judicial bodies to the confusion of the aim of criminal procedure – speedy and detailed detection of criminal acts and a proper application of the law {{in order to ensure that}} any person who has committed a criminal act is given a fair punishment and that no one who is innocent is convicted. The author has distinguished two criteria to differentiate the undercover actions, set in the Articles 158 and 160 of CPC. Author concludes that there are two major reasons to make a proper difference between the actions of undercover officers and secret surveillance. First, secret surveillance could only be applied strictly from distance, while actions of undercover officers could be applied directly and indirectly in the contact with a target person (for instance, suspect). There is no legal possibility and permission at all to use the intermediate persons in order to implement secret surveillance in spite of the tactics of the analysed procedural action. Any attempts to use intermediate persons according to Article 160 of CPC cause <b>procedural</b> <b>violation</b> of the Law and, definitely, negatively influence the admissibility of evidence. Second, only the actions of undercover officers could be carried out not only by the investigation body officers. There is an exception that should be mentioned: the persons, not acting as investigation officers, can also carry out a procedural action in the case of urgency. It is strictly defined in CPC that only in special cases, when there are no other possibilities to detect the persons committing criminal offences, investigation may be conducted by persons who are not officers of a pre-trial investigation...|$|E
