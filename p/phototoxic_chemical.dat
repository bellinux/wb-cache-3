30|$|In {{countries}} {{with a white}} population, the most common cancer is skin cancers. Every 10 – 20 years, incidence of melanoma has doubled in these countries. In 2007, more than 84, 500 people in UK was diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer [1]. It was reported that about two-thirds of Australian before 70  years old could have skin cancer at least once for their life [2]. Unrepaired photolesions which are formed by ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation is considered as main cause of the skin cancer. The mutated photolesions such as bipyrimidine dimers, apurine sites and strand breaks are produced by adsorption of UV light [3, 4]. Among them, bipyrimidine dimers have the highest frequency than others. However, the other UV light-induced mutants formed {{to a lesser extent}} can be more harmful than bipyrimidine dimers [5]. In addition, it is known that occurrence of these types of cellular DNA damages are increased by several drugs due to photosensitization [5 – 9]. Because of  the phototoxicity of the photosensitizers, FDA recommends to provide the photosensitizing effects of drug substances. Comet assay [10] and Ames test [11] are representative in vitro genotoxicity tests as standard testing. Beside such cell-based methods, acelluar assays using naked DNA, such as immunological assays [12], gel electrophoresis [13], chromatic assays [14], atomic force microscopy [15] and electrochemical sensor-based assays [16], have been also developed to analyze the UV light-induced DNA mutations. However, these approaches are still limited to the high-throughput screening of compounds for phototoxicity because of their dependence on expensive instruments and additional manipulations such as purification, radiolabeling, enzymatic digestion, or chemical modification of the DNA for sensitive and accurate information. In the pharmaceutical industry there have been growing demands for a simplified method to screen for <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds in a parallel way, especially a method that can be implemented in an automated system. In previous, a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) based simple colorimetric method to detect the single-stranded (ss)DNA breaks (SDBs) and to screen photosensitizing drugs were reported [17]. However, the AuNP based colorimetric methods are not applicable to a salt containing physiological condition because AuNPs are easily aggregated by salt. However, the colorimetric method may not detect the phenomena under physiological conditions. In contrast, salt-stable dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) could allow its application to detect SDBs in the physiological condition. Due to the selective affinity to ssDNA, and highly effective fluorescence quenching ability, GO has been applied to detect various targets such as heavy metals, small molecules and nucleic acids [18]. Previously, a GO based method to detect DNA photodimers and screen dimer-photosensitizing drugs was reported [19]. However, it is not yet reported if GO could be applied to detect the SDBs and screen photosensitizing drugs. Therefore, in this study, GO was first applied to detect the SDBs and evaluate the photosensitizing effect of drugs under a physiological condition.|$|E
40|$|The ecophysiological {{importance}} of phototoxins (PTs), {{a group of}} plant light-activated secondary compounds toxic {{to a wide range}} of organisms, was investigated in the context of plant-insect relationships. The efficiency of PTs in protecting plants against herbivores was investigated in the field by measuring the herbivory damage on a series of ten plant species having different levels of phototoxic activity. Regression analyses performed between the herbivory level and the phototoxic activity of plants indicated a lower number of herbivore attacks per leaf and a higher leaf area removed per attack on the most phototoxic plants. There was, however, no effect of the phototoxic activity of plant tissues on the total area per leaf removed by herbivores or the percent of leaf area consumed. Field observations also revealed that specialist insects typically occurred on highly phototoxic plants whereas generalist insects were predominantly restricted to the least phototoxic plants. Thus PTs do not reduce the total herbivory pressure experienced by plants, although they restrict the range of herbivores attacking plants to specialist herbivores, that is those that are likely to have evolved some adaptation. The purported adaptations of insects to PTs present in their host plants were investigated in a group of specialist and generalist herbivorous insects feeding on the phototoxic foliage of either Hypericum perforatum (Guttiferae) or Viguiera annua (Asteraceae). This comparative approach identified distinct behavioral and biochemical adaptations that are used by generalist and specialist phytophagous insects to circumvent phototoxicity. Generalist insects, three long-horned grasshoppers collected on H. perforatum in the southwest of France, were observed to selectively feed between the glands located on leaves of Hypericum perforatum that contain the PT hypericin. On the other hand, specialist insects, three leaf beetles and one noctuid, all relied on light-avoidance behavioral strategies to prevent photosensitization. Glands containing the PT hypericin were indeed acting as a feeding stimulant to larvae of Cloantha perspicillaris, a specialist noctuid on St John's-wort. Some differences between specialist and generalist insects were also observed in the activities of antioxidant enzymes which are a major biochemical adaptation for insects to tolerate the oxidative stress induced by PTs. Generalist insects relied on high constitutive activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) whereas insects specialized on phototoxic plants had lower, but PT-inducible activities of antioxidant enzymes. Some important ecophysiological constraints for plants relying on phototoxic defenses were also identified. It was furthermore confirmed that these environmentally-mediated variations in the production of defensive traits in plants affected the performance of herbivorous insects under both laboratory and field conditions. Inconsistencies between the results that were obtained in the present study and predictions based on the classical theory of coevolutionary interactions between host plants and their associated herbivorous insects, led me to propose a modified evolutionary scheme referred to as plant integrated chemical defenses (PICDs). It is suggested that PICDs may have evolved in phototoxic plants to specifically counter the ecophysiological drawbacks associated with <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemical</b> defenses.

40|$|Several light-absorbing {{chemicals}} {{are known to}} show phototoxic effects involving many kinds of DNA damage, and are suspected of initiating skin cancer. In this study, we clarified that phosphorylated histone H 2 AX (γ-H 2 AX) (phosphorylated histone H 2 AX), which was produced with the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, is a sensitive photogenotoxic marker. The immortal human keratinocyte line HaCaT was treated with a library of 11 chemicals (including known strong and weak <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> and nonphototoxic chemicals) and/or UVA exposure. γ-H 2 AX was generated after treatments with all <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and UVA. The limit of detection using γ-H 2 AX was 100 – 1, 000 times lower than that using cell viability and DNA gel electrophoresis. γ-H 2 AX was not generated following treatments with nonphototoxic chemicals and UVA. These results indicated that γ-H 2 AX is {{a powerful tool for}} detecting chemical photogenotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|The photosensitizing {{potential}} of chemicals known to produce photosensitivity in humans {{was compared to}} chemicals {{not considered to be}} photosensitizers in an in vitro assay. The assay involved exposure of human lymphoid cells to UVA (320 – 400 nm), and in some cases UVB (280 - 320 nm) radiation, {{in the presence of the}} chemicals and the assessment of phototoxicity as measured by the incorporation of 3 [H]-thymidine into nuclear DNA. All known photosensitizers tested were found to be phototoxic, while the nonphotosensitizing agents, with the exception of retinoic acid, were not phototoxic. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were compared to a T lymphoblastoid cell line as target cells; the latter were superior in terms of convenience, cost and reproducibility of results. This test system has potential as a predictive assay for detecting additional <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} an alternative 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast {{neutral red uptake}} assay and investigate the feasibility of utilizing an alternative in vitro method to replace the animal testing, in particular, in phototoxicity assessment of cosmetics. Method: Fifteen phototoxic and nine non-phototoxic chemicals were tested and 20 functional cosmetic products were assessed. The mean photo effect (MPE) and the photo-irritation factor (PIF) of Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were analyzed after exposure to specific chemicals and ultraviolet radiation, and then compared {{with the results of}} whole-animal phototoxicity testing. Result: A negative result was obtained with all the non-phototoxic chemicals in the in vitro test, while fourteen out of the fifteen <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> gave a positive result. The Pearson's chi-square test indicated no statistically significant difference from the historic phototoxicity data. For the assessed 20 cosmetic products, a high correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo data. Conclusion: The alternative 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity assay was established successfully as a substitute for the guinea pig-based photoxicity test in assessing the phototoxic effects of cosmetics...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum IU 594 and cyanophage LPP- 1 {{were used}} as {{indicator}} organisms in a bioassay of 16 pesticides. Experiments such as spot tests, disk assays, growth curves, and one-step growth experiments were {{used to examine the}} effects of pesticides on the host and virus. Also, experiments were done in which host or virus was incubated in pesticide solutions and then assayed for PFU. P. boryanum was inhibited by four herbicides: 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU), 1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(alpha, alpha,alpha-trifluoro-m-tolyl) urea (Fluometeron), 2 -chloro- 4 -(ethylamino) - 6 -(isopropylamino) -s-triazine (Atrazine), 2 -(ethylamino) - 4 -(isopropylamino) - 6 -(methylthio) -s-triazine (Ametryn). One insecticide, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) -propionaldehyde O-(methylcarbamoyl) oxime (Aldicarb), also inhibited the cyanobacterium. Two insecticides inactivated LPP- 1, O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate of diethyl mercaptosuccinate (malathion) and Isotox. Isotox is a mixture of three pesticides: S-[2 -(ethylsulfinyl) ethyl]O,O-dimethyl phosphorothioate (Metasystox -R), 1 -naphthyl methylcarbamate (Sevin) and 4, 4 '-dichloro-alpha- (trichloromethyl) benzhydrom (Kelthane). Two pesticide-resistant strains of P. boryanum were isolated against DCMU and Atrazine. These mutants showed resistance to all four herbicides, which indicates a relationship between these <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The results indicate that P. boryanum may be a useful indicator species for phototoxic agents in bioassay procedures...|$|R

40|$|Differentiation between photoallergenic and phototoxic {{reactions}} {{induced by}} {{low molecular weight}} compounds represents a current problem. The use of eratinocytes as a potential tool {{for the detection of}} photoallergens as opposed to photoirritants is considered an interesting strategy for developing in vitro methods. We have previously demonstrated the possibility to use the human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2455 and the production of interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) to screen low molecular weight sensitizers. The purpose of this work was to explore the possibility to use the NCTC 2544 assay to identify photoallergens and discriminate from <b>phototoxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> First, we identified suitable condition of UV-irradiation (3. 5 J/cm 2) by investigating the effect of UVAirradiation on intracellular IL- 18 on untreated or chloropromazine (a representative phototoxic compound) - treated NCTC 2544 cells. Then, the effect of UVA-irradiation over NCTC 2544 cells treated with increasing concentrations of 15 compounds including photoallergens (benzophenone, 4 -ter-butyl- 4 -methoxydibenzoylmethane, 2 -ethylexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, ketoprofen, 6 -methylcumarin); photoirritant and photoallergen (4 -aminobenzoic acid, chlorpromazine, promethazine); photoirritants (acridine, ibuprofen, 8 -methoxypsoralen, retinoic acid); and negative compounds (lactic acid, SDS and p-phenilendiamine) was investigated. Twenty-four hours after exposure, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay or LDH leakage, while ELISA was used to measure the production of IL- 18. At the maximal concentration assayed with non-cytotoxic effects (CV 80 under irradiated condition), all tested photoallergens induced a significant and a dose-dependent increase of intracellular IL- 18 following UVA irratiation, whereas photoirritants failed. We suggest that this system may be useful for the in vitro evaluation of the photoallergic potential of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Until very {{recently}} time, we carried out some studies for {{the determination of}} the <b>phototoxic</b> potential of <b>chemicals,</b> using to the animals, but there was no a guide for these purposes. With the development of the Alternative Toxicology there were established several procedures among which we can mention 3 T 3 Neutral Red (3 T 3 NRU). However other methods exist, very useful for the procedures of screening of the phototoxic potential of the chemists or finished products by the skill of these to interact with the red blood cells and / or to oxidize to the hemoglobin under the effects of the Ultraviolet and visibly light. In studies realized with erythrocytes of other species one found the feasibility of the utilization of the blood of rate, for what we use the protocol 81 of the In Vitro Toxicity (INVITTOX), with this one modification. The Chlorpromazine and the Sodium Duodecyl Sulphate took like controls positively and negatively respectively. The obtained results indicated that neither none of the used perfumes was showing effects photohemolityc. These results allow us to raise that 10 perfumes of National are not potentially phototoxic for the human beings, as well as the utility of the mentioned protocol for these purposes...|$|R
