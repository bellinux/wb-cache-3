50|$|The busway shared {{portions}} of its {{right of way}} with the city's light rail line. A section from the Glenbury to the South <b>Bank</b> <b>stops</b> was shared with the Overbrook line, and another section just after the Pioneer Avenue stop continues to share right of way from that point to South Hills Junction with the Beechview line. In 1993, the Overbrook line was suspended, {{and the right of}} way was exclusively busway. When the Overbrook line was rebuilt, it did not resume sharing the busway, rather, a new grade-separated private right of way was built parallel to the busway, and only the South <b>Bank</b> <b>stop</b> serving as the connection point between the rail line and busway.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bank</b> <b>stopped</b> {{payments}} on October 14, 1966. The {{collapse of the}} bank brought the Lebanese economy {{to a halt and}} sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East. Intra Bank accounted for 15% of total bank deposits and 38% of deposits with Lebanese-owned banks.|$|R

All Nordic countries have used an interconnected international giro system since the 1950s, and in Sweden, cheques are now almost totally abandoned; in Denmark, all <b>banks</b> will <b>stop</b> accepting cheques by 1 January 2017. Credit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash. For large shop payments, such as car purchases, a type of cheque, a money order (Swedish:postväxel) is still used.|$|R

50|$|In 1975, the 5-dollar {{notes were}} {{replaced}} by a coin, whilst 1,000-dollar notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by the HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, 20-dollar notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, a 10-dollar coin was introduced and the <b>banks</b> <b>stopped</b> issuing 10 dollar notes. In 1994 the HKMA gave authority to the Bank of China to issue notes.|$|R
50|$|Notes were {{initially}} issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pounds.

2500|$|This {{exposure}} to potential financial or political risk should foreign <b>banks</b> <b>stop</b> buying Treasury securities or start selling them heavily was {{addressed in a}} June 2008 report issued by the Bank of International Settlements, which stated, [...] "Foreign investors in U.S. dollar assets have seen big losses measured in dollars, and still bigger ones measured in their own currency. While unlikely, indeed highly improbable for public sector investors, a sudden rush for the exits cannot be ruled out completely." ...|$|R
50|$|The tide {{of fortune}} then turned; Fordyce lost heavily at the {{beginning}} of 1771 in the fluctuations of the market caused by the dispute with Spain about the Falkland Islands. His partners became alarmed, but it is said he succeeded in quieting their fears by showing them a pile of bank notes which he had borrowed for the purpose for a few hours. His losses continuing, he absconded, and the <b>bank</b> <b>stopped</b> payment on 10 June 1772.|$|R

50|$|In 1837, {{there was}} {{widespread}} panic due to credit tightening from England. On May 29, 1837, as depositors began to withdraw money en masse, Illinois banks suspended payments. As these banks fell into bankruptcy, Illinois’ internal improvements, like the canals {{that were supposed}} to be financed by the <b>banks,</b> <b>stopped.</b> This led to considerable uncertainty as to Chicago's future, and combined with a general lack of credit, caused Chicago real estate prices to fall approximately 88% from their peak by 1841.|$|R
50|$|Banco Mercantil {{was founded}} in 1917 as Banco Mercantil Americano, but on 23 March 1925 was renamed as Banco Neerlando Venezolano.

5000|$|Thomas Friedman {{summarized}} how {{the crisis}} has moved through stages: [...] When these reckless mortgages eventually blew up, it led to a credit crisis. <b>Banks</b> <b>stopped</b> lending. That soon morphed into an equity crisis, as worried investors liquidated stock portfolios. The equity crisis made people feel poor and metastasized into a consumption crisis, which is why purchases of cars, appliances, electronics, homes and clothing have just fallen off a cliff. This, in turn, has sparked more company defaults, exacerbated the credit crisis and metastasized into an unemployment crisis, as companies rush to shed workers.|$|R

25|$|Peru was {{not ready}} to fight any war. Since 1873 Peru was bankrupt, European and American <b>banks</b> <b>stopped</b> lending money to the Peruvian government, thus by 1878 Peru entered into a default. Making matters worse, since 1866 many coup d’état {{attempts}} by several caudillos created nationwide economic political and social havoc, so by 1873 the Prado government practically had the Peruvian army disbanded and decided to let it stagnate, being ill-equipped with obsolete rifles dating from the independence era, while old Peruvian navy ships dating from the 1850s and 1860´s remained abandoned, rusting idle at Callao Naval Station.|$|R
2500|$|In India, as of January 2010, PayPal has no {{cross-border}} money transfer authorization.

Thus, the foreign <b>banks</b> <b>stopped</b> the loans and requested for debts. The loans suddenly decreased from 10 millions Tael to 0.6 millions in December.

50|$|A debtor {{may also}} {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the debt in a claim against the <b>bank</b> to <b>stop</b> the foreclosure and sue for damages. In a foreclosure proceeding, the lender also bears the burden of proving they have standing to foreclose.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} simple {{model of the}} interbank market where banks trade a long term, safe asset. We show that {{when there is a}} lack of {{opportunities}} for banks to hedge aggregate and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks, the interbank market is characterized by excessive price volatility. In such a situation, a central bank can implement the constrained efficient allocation by using open market operations to fix the short term interest rate. The model shows also that market freezes, where <b>banks</b> <b>stop</b> trading with each other, can be a feature of the constrained efficient allocation if there is sufficient uncertainty about aggregate liquidity demand compared to idiosyncratic liquidity demand. interbank market, liquidity, central bank intervention, open market operations...|$|R
5000|$|On May 10, 1837 in New York, every {{chartered}} <b>bank</b> <b>stopped</b> {{payment in}} specie (gold and silver coinage), leaving banks and local {{institutions like the}} KSS holding notes without adequate liquid assets. Within two months the failures in New York alone aggregated nearly $100,000,000 in value. [...] "Out of eight hundred and fifty banks in the United States, three hundred and forty-three closed entirely, sixty-two failed partially, and the system of State banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered." [...] Smaller, privately held financial institutions, like the KSS, also failed in droves. The Panic {{was followed by a}} five-year depression, characterized by ongoing failures of banks and financial institutions and record unemployment levels.|$|R
