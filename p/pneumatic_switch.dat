40|$|Two {{approaches}} are described and compared {{for the analysis}} of suspected allergens (SAs) in fragrance products, which are defined by the Scientific Committee of Cosmetics and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP). The first consists of a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) experiment using both a &# 039;conventional&# 039; non-polar/polar column combination and an &# 039;inverse&# 039; polar/non-polar column set. The second approach uses a targeted multidimensional gas chromatography (MDGC) system employing a Deans type <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switch</b> and a longitudinally modulated cryogenic system (LMCS). It was found that the conventional and inverse column sets complement each other well, providing identification of SAs present. Compounds well retained on the second dimension of one column set were the first to be eluted from the other. In some instances SAs co-eluting with matrix components on the second dimension for a given column set were clearly resolved on the other, although this has the disadvantage of requiring two analytical runs. Targeted MDGC with a non-polar/polar column set, successfully separated all SAs identified within a fragrance product. The instrument is set up in a similar fashion to a GC × GC system though with longer second dimension (2 D) column, a cryogenic trap {{at the beginning of the}} second column, and a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switch</b> coupling both columns. The data are easier to process than for a GC × GC experiment. The targeted MDGC method has the capacity to deliver far greater efficiency to targeted regions of a primary separation than a GC × GC experiment, whilst still maintaining overall run times similar to those of a conventional one-dimensional (1 D) GC experiment. Cryogenic focussing at the beginning of the 2 D column delivers enhanced sensitivity, accurate 2 D retention times and narrow peak widths; these are responsible for an increased resolution obtained from the fast, relatively short (5 m) 2 D column. The two column set GC × GC analysis provided a quick and effective means to qualitatively determine the presence of six SAs in a commercially available air freshener, however all were not adequately resolved from matrix components. In contrast, quantitation was straightforward using the targeted MDGC method...|$|E

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} an electrostatically actuated microvalve {{to be used}} both as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switch</b> and as a gas flow regulator. The normally open 2 / 2 -way valve consists of two micromachined silicon chips mounted at a short distance. By applying a DC voltage between the components, the valve plate is deflected onto the orifice and interrupts the gas flow. One of the main advantages of this novel concept is a high flow rate (max. 700 ml/min) achieved with a sophisticated geometry of the orifice. Furthermore the device can be operated at a high pressure (over 10 x 10 (exp 5) Pa), which is needed for industrial applications where a high power density is required. The device itself has a very small size (6 x 6 x 1 mm 3) and a very low electrical power consumption (< 5 myJ per switching cycle). It can be driven with pulse-width modulated signals up to 1 kHz thus permitting a linear control of the gas flow, e. g. for dosing applications...|$|E

Some quantitative knowledge in the dynamic performance of these systems {{is essential for the}} prediction of response times under different operating conditions or for the calculation of a suitable response threshold setting. The paper discusses an approximative method to calculate the dynamic perfor-mance that takes into account the inherent nonlinearities of some system elements. The method is based on some simplifying assumptions and uses models for all system elements. The simplification results in an approximative over-all model for the pneumatic system which can be described by a fairly simple nonlinear differential equation. This equation can be solved by using a suit-able Runge-Kutta method and yields the pressure difference 6 p at the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switch</b> as a function of time. It is shown furthermore that this solution cannot be considered as valid in general but {{can be used as a}} calculation tool for response times and response behaviour of the system in the range of normally used response pressure thresholds with a suitable accuracy.

40|$|Metamaterials are {{composites}} {{consisting of}} sub‐wavelength resonant elements aiming {{to manipulate the}} material&# 039;s electromagnetic properties. One {{of the advantages of}} artificially created materials over natural materials is the possibility to custom design and tune their properties as one desires. Metamaterials continue to draw the attention of the research community as new and significantly enhanced phenomena associated with them are discovered. Significant effort has also been devoted to integrating them with existing structures for potential applications in sensing, defence and next generation devices. Due to the resonant nature of the metamaterial elements, the desired properties are achieved only within a narrow frequency band. For various applications, it is desirable to be able to tune their frequency response. Although the connection between the modification of geometry of the resonators and resultant variations in their response individually and as an effective media has been extensively studied, the area of dynamic tuning could benefit from further investigation. The major contribution made by this work includes investigation of real time tuning possibilities and developing new approaches for altering the shapes and orientations of metamaterial resonators, post fabrication, as means of widening flexibility in the design and improving variety of responses. A novel <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switching</b> approach is demonstrated for alteration of the shape of the resonators via addition or retraction of pneumatic elements, as well as application of this method to the realisation of a switchable graded index lens. Further, suspended resonators with mechanical degrees of freedom have been realised which allow shifts in their position and orientation leading to nonlinear effects. A new microfabricated mesh substrate with significantly reduced mass was developed. Embedding resonators into elastic substrates has also been explored for stretching and conformal adhesion purposes. Most of the work is for metamaterials operating in the microwave frequency range (GHz), except elastic metamaterial intended for far infrared (THz) frequencies. In summary, metamaterial tuning approaches have been extended to dynamic manipulation of both shape and orientation of resonators providing greater flexibility and control over effective material parameters...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{continuous}} and natural motion, fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) have shown potential {{in a range}} of robotic applications including prosthetics and orthotics. Despite their advantages and rapid developments, robots using these actuators still have several challenging issues to be addressed. First, the reliable production of low cost and complex actuators that can apply high forces is necessary, yet none of existing fabrication methods are both easy to implement and of high force output. Next, compliant or stretchable sensors that can be embedded into their bodies for sophisticated functions are required, however, many of these sensors suffer from hysteresis, fabrication complexity, chemical safety and environmental instability, and material incompatibility with soft actuators. Finally, feedback control for FEAs is necessary to achieve better performance, but most soft robots are still “open-loop”. In this dissertation, I intend to help solve the above issues and drive the applications of soft robotics towards hand orthotics and prosthetics. First, I adapt rotational casting as a new manufacturing method for soft actuators. I present a cuboid soft actuator that can generate a force of > 25 N at its tip, a near ten-fold increase over similar actuators previously reported. Next, I propose a soft orthotic finger with position control enabled via embedded optical fiber. I monitor both the static and dynamic states via the optical sensor and achieve the prescribed curvatures accurately and with stability by a gain-scheduled proportional-integral-derivative controller. Then I develop the soft orthotic fingers into a low-cost, closed-loop controlled, soft orthotic glove that can be worn by a typical human hand and helpful for grasping light objects, while also providing finger position control. I achieve motion control with inexpensive, binary <b>pneumatic</b> <b>switches</b> controlled by a simple finite-state-machine. Finally, I report the first use of stretchable optical waveguides for strain sensing in a soft prosthetic hand. These optoelectronic strain sensors are easy to fabricate, chemically inert, and demonstrate low hysteresis and high precision in their output signals. I use the optoelectronically innervated prosthetic hand to conduct various active sensation experiments inspired by the capabilities of a real hand...|$|R

In this regard, the actual problem is creation of means and methods for simultaneous measurement of pressure as discussed in the work. The first method. The holes of the selection pressure pneumatic tracks (PT) are connected to the pressure sensor (PS), which are connected to the channels of the measuring system (MS).

Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 <b>pneumatic</b> high-speed <b>switch</b> valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame.

To reach the initial position, the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging valve 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R

40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is an {{elastomeric}} silicone polymer utilized {{extensively in}} the realization of microdevices. Techniques compatible with microfabrication enable the realization of thin, flexible, conformal, and biocompatible layers ranging from 5 f!m to a few mm. The inherent silicone chemistry of PDMS makes it favorable for applications as a high-frequency dielectric. In this chapter, the dielectric properties of thin layers of PDMS are characterized at radio frequencies (RF) and terahertz frequencies. The RF properties characterization determined the average effective index of PDMS by transmission line measurements of coplanar waveguide structures. This was followed by finite element method (FEM) simulations of the coplanar waveguides, where a curve-fitting approach was used to extract the dielectric constant ofPDMS from the experimentally measured average effective index and the FEM simulated dielectric constant results. The average effective index and the dielectric constant ofPDMS were estimated to be 1. 396 and 2. 72, respectively. The suitability of PDMS as a RF substrate is demonstrated by the integration of a <b>pneumatic</b> valve, to <b>switch</b> RF transmission on or off without external electrical bias.

50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - {{lead the}} current from the catenary {{to the two}} electrical cutting knives {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. These cutting knives could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these cutting knives, the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle. If one step switch failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four <b>pneumatic</b> controlled reverse <b>switches</b> were placed on the motors.
