Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, <b>purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E

2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 <b>purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|E

40|$|The American style <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> {{developed}} in the United States was studied in comparision with the tuna long liner {{developed in}} Japan, in terms of principal particulars, speed, hull form and conditions expressed in mean value of four vessels each. In comparison with the tuna long liner of 500 GT class, the American style <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> {{of the same size}} is 20. 2 % broader in actual size and 16 % broader in L/B and has more stability. The speed which is required to be over 14 knots in cruising condition is 14. 7 knots for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> and 12. 8 knots for the tuna long liner. The <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> has the hull form of greater midship section coefficient and smaller block coefficient, i. e., the hull form of fat midship and rapidly slim bow and stern. The incident angle of water line at the bow is 9 ～ 14 degrees for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> while it is approximately 38 degrees for the tuna long liner. The trim of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> in light load condition is by the head since this vessel carries net and skiff boat in the stern area. This is a significant characteristic of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner.</b> The metacentric height (GM) in full load condition, i. e., in working condition is 0. 93 m which is about twice as much as that of ordinary fishing vessels, giving consideration to the safty against unvavorable condition in navigation and fishing operation. However, the period of rolling is 7 ～ 9 seconds which is an ordinary period for the fishing vessel of 500 GT class. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と日本で開発された 500 総トン級鮪延縄船各 4 隻の要目,速力、船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は,甲板上の搭載物重量が重いため幅を鮪延縄船より 20. 2 %広げて復原力を増している。米国式旋網船の巡航速力である 3 / 4 負荷では, 14 ノット以上要求されているが,調査した限りでは平均で 14. 7 ノットであり,鮪延縄船では, 12, 8 ノットであった。米国式旋網船は,船体中央部では鮪延縄船より肥っているが船首および船尾で急激にやせている船型である。船首の水線入射角は,米国式旋網船は極端に小さく 9 度～ 14 度であり,鮪延縄船では 38 度位である。軽荷状態の米国式旋網船のTrimはTrim by the headである。船尾に重量物(漁網約 30 トン, 9 mスキフボート約 15 トン) を積む関係であるが,このTrimは顕著な特徴である。重量物の搭載後の満載状態では 1. 14 mTrim by the sternとなり,航海に適したTrimとなる。運航者が,船の安全度と初期復原力を知る目安としているMetacentric height (GM) は,稼働状態の満載状態では 0. 93 mで一般漁船の約 2 倍となっているが,漁撈時に於ける船体の傾斜,その他の航海,操業時における悪条件の中での安全性について考慮を払ったものと思われる。GMが大きければ横揺れ周期が短くなるが,周期は 7 ～ 9 秒で 500 トン級漁船としては通常の周期である...|$|R

As to the motion characteristics of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> in longitudinal wave, the relative pitching of the bow against the wave surface shows a 20 ～ 30 % greater amplitude when synchronized with the severest head sea as compared with the conventional avarage Japanese fishing vessels. However, since consideration has been given to the height of the bow freeboard and to the increase of flaring, the splash of waves from the bow may not be particularly strong. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と英国で開発され日本で改良固定された 500 総トン級船尾トロール船各 4 隻の諸要目,速力,船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は船尾トロール船より巾が 15. 8 %広い。平均速力は,巡航速力(3 / 4 負荷) における米国式旋網船が 2. 8 ノット速い 14. 7 ノットであり,抵抗試験によれば米国式旋網船は現存の肥大船型に比べて推進馬力が半分以下でも同一速力が出せる燃料節減船型である事が推定されている。船型は,船体中央部が旋網船が肥っており船首尾でやせており,プロペラ前方の船底部分がきれいな流線型となっている。旋網船の縦波中の運動特性は,船首の波面に対する相対上下揺振を在来の平均的日本漁船と比べると最もきびしい向い波同調状態時において 20 ～ 30 %程度の振巾増加が見られるが,船首乾舷の高さとフレアーの増大が考慮されているので船首からの波浪打ち込みが特に激しくなる事は無いと考えられる...|$|R

40|$|In {{the term}} of {{promoting}} fish resources management to be sutainable and profitable as great as possible for the people welfare, the Government applies the PPP and PHP (Fishery Exploitation Levy and Fish Caught Levy) in giving a fish catching exploitation licence as for adding the state non-tax revenue. The purpose of study {{is to examine the}} fish catch compositions and kinds of fish species of the small pelagic <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat, the PPP and PHP influences on the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> fishermen incomes, and compare the amount of PHP determined by the Government and of the study result PHP. Case study method was used the study about existing of <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fishermen in Pekalongan City as the study location. The sampling technique was carried out systematically. The data analysis used the qualitative descriptive and t-test statistic analysis. The qualitative descriptive analysis was used for analyzing the fish catch compositions and kind of fish species and determining the fish prices. The t-test was used for analyzing the significant differences of the PPP and PHP influences on determind the small pelagis <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fisherman incomes, and comparing the amount of PHP by Goverment and study result PHP too. The result of study showed that the fish catch compositions of the 30 GT or more <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat {{for the last five years}}, namely in the 1997 — 2001 in Pekalongan, indicated that there were fluctuations of the production amounts. From the average production amount of each fish kind of <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fish catches for the last five years the largest fish kind composition was Layang followed by Lemuru, then Banyar, Tembang, Selar and the other fish kinds have the least compositions. Of the fish kinds the salted fish composition was larger than the fresh or iced fish composition. The highest price of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fish catches was the species of Banyar/Kembung and the lowest one was Tembang species. Based on the fish quality price of fresh or iced fish price was higher than the salted one. The PPP and PHP influenced the incomes of fishermen, especially of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat owner. Income at the first trip of the boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP has a negative value or the boat owner suffered a financial loss. Mean while the boat owner who has not paid the PPP and PHP yet has a high income per trip. For the income per trip of captain, motorist, skilled worker, and crew who both has and has not paid PPP and PHP yet was not influenced by the magnitude of fishery levies. The one-year income of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP were lower than the owners who have not yet. While the incomes among their captains, motorist, siklled worker, crews were not much different. The PHP value of the government calculation based on the old HPI (Floor Price of Fish; The Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 213 / 2001) was much higher than the one based on the study calculation. But if we compared the PHP calculation based on the new HPI (Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 548 / 2002) with the one based on the study result calculation between them was not much differrence. Therefore it need immediately to socialize and iluminate the PHP imposition based on the new HPI calculation. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{common type}} of seine is a purse seine, named such because along the bottom {{are a number of}} rings. A line (referred to as a purse-line) passes through all the rings, and when pulled, draws the rings close to one another, {{preventing}} the fish from [...] "sounding", or swimming down to escape the net. This operation is similar to a traditional style purse, which has a drawstring.The purse seine is a preferred technique for capturing fish species which school, or aggregate, close to the surface: sardines, mackerel, anchovies, herring, and certain species of tuna (schooling); and salmon soon before they swim up rivers and streams to spawn (aggregation). Boats equipped with purse seines are called <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b>|$|E
50|$|While he {{was working}} as a tuna and sardine {{fisherman}} from San Pedro, California, Puratić started thinking about the difficulty of hauling seine nets. The original power block he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped roller coated with hard rubber. It was suspended from a davit, and powered from the warp end of the winch by a looping rope. In 1954, the power block was trialled by American <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> in the Pacific. They have evolved since then, and nowadays power blocks are powered by hydraulic pumps. Their speed, torque and direction can be remotely controlled from the bridge during operations. As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlers}} {{learned the}} use of seine nets from Native Americans. By 1895 there were eighty-four seines on the Columbia, and Robert Hume started hauling them with teams of horses. The seines were operated from day break to dawn around islands and along beaches. At Puget Sound salmon were caught by fishing boats using purse seine nets. Purse seine nets are used to encircle a school of salmon and then trap them by drawing ("pursing") {{the bottom of the}} net together, as you would with a string purse. By 1905 the boats used engines for hauling the seine lines. In 1922 it was made illegal to use salmon <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> on and around the Columbia. In 1948, horse and manual seines were also outlawed.|$|E
