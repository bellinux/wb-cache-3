40|$|Engineering {{ethics is}} an {{important}} part of education since it helps students to deal with issues they can face in their profession. A project was started at Chalmers University of Technology in 2013 with the aim to improve integration of ethics in the Master’s programmes in the educational area: “electrical and computer science engineering, software engineering, and industrial engineering and management”. In this paper, experiences are shared from this project. The aim is to support and stimulate to similar activities at other universities. The objectives are to describe: •	the change process for integrating ethics into Master’s programmes at Chalmers, •	results of this work, such as amount and type of ethics integrated into the programmes, and differences in content and intended depth of learning, •	challenges to accomplish a successful integration of ethics into the programmes. There has been a successful integration of ethics in the Masters’ programmes, and all of the 13 programs now include some ethics. The most important driver has been that the project has been assigned by the dean of education who can put some pressure on the <b>programme</b> <b>directors.</b> Another important reason for a successful result is that the project has continued over several years as long as there has been a need of improvements. Support has been offered to the <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> and teachers, and there has been a regular follow up of the progress and encouragement of <b>programmes</b> <b>directors.</b> A main challenge has been that many of the <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> and teachers are unsure about what ethics is all about and how to include it in education. Thus, it has been a good idea to have short term goals that were not that demanding. It has been important that the actual changes are done by the <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> and teachers themselves, and that no one else has been telling them how to do...|$|R

40|$|Receiving {{feedback}} on daily clinical activities, in whatever form, {{is crucial for}} the development of clinical proficiency. Multisource or 360 -degree feedback procedures have been recommended to include various co-workers as sources of feedback. In 2008, a web-based multisource feedback (MSF) tool for medical residents was developed at the University Medical Center Utrecht and launched nationally in the Netherlands and has been widely used since then. In 2012, an evaluation was carried out to collect opinions on its use, {{on the quality of the}} instrument and on its experienced effectiveness.

In November 1FLTV decided against applying for EBU membership in December for financial reasons, ruling out a debut in at the 2010 contest. The broadcaster will now look at other options for funding EBU membership in the future.|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} posed by this thesis is how radio stations, {{and more specifically}} <b>programme</b> <b>directors,</b> attract and construct an audience of listeners aged between 18 and 25 years old. The thesis examines {{the political and social}} factors influencing broadcasters targeting young adults both in this country and internationally. It then analyses the broadcasts and programming strategies of three New Zealand radio stations - a student, an iwi and a commercial station. Broadcasting is examined on three levels: firstly the political and historical context of radio broadcasting is outlined including issues such as media ownership, government regulation and the structure of media institutions; secondly the daily operating practices of broadcasters are assessed, along with how programming choices are made in light of externally imposed constraints such as the desire to make a profit; and finally textual analysis is used to examine the material that is produced for broadcast. <b>Programme</b> <b>directors</b> are defined here as key gatekeepers because they determine the way a radio station sounds within the parameters of a particular format. Williams (1990) correctly maintains that broadcasting forms a continuous flow, but for ease of academic discussion each of these radio stations is analysed in terms of its music programming, advertising and promotion, news and information and DJ chat. Analysis of the verbal aspects of the broadcast draw on Goffman (1981), Brand and Scannell (1991) and Montgomery (1986). Music programming is discussed with reference to Rothenbuhler (1985) and unstructured interviews conducted by the researcher with the <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> at each of the three stations. The New Zealand case studies exemplify international trends evident in radio stations which target 18 to 25 year olds. The <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> in question presume this age group listens to the radio in the evenings, prefers music to talk and current affairs, likes newly released material rather than older songs and is likely to purchase leisure and entertainment products. The case studies provide a contemporary snap shot of how <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> construct and perceive a specific radio audience. The thesis concludes that programmers targeting young adults use music to define the station's sound, construct an audience and sell advertising...|$|R

Proudfoot’s immediate influence on programming was to drop a plan to broadcast a mixture of light music and lifestyle material in favour of a simple Top 40 format. A 30-year-old, 150 tonne fishing vessel named Oceaan 7 was acquired and fitted out with a 10kW radio transmitter for a total cost of £75,000. The radio station was named Radio 270 and it was run from Proudfoot’s business headquarters in Scalby Road, Scarborough.

25|$|Independent {{television}} {{was introduced to}} Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television {{to the rest of}} the country and advertised for bids. Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a television transmitter. Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and News Chronicle executives George and Alfred Black. This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children's programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957. Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was <b>programme</b> <b>director,</b> and both brothers were prominent board members.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an insight into}} content and language integrated learning (CLIL) practices in the Australian state of Queensland. The article comprises four main sections. The first section outlines the context of CLIL in Australia and Queensland; there follows {{a brief review of}} the literature on stakeholders in CLIL programmes, such as <b>programme</b> <b>directors,</b> teachers and parents; a third section presents the methods used in the study; and finally a summary of the findings will be presented. Based on semi-structured interviews, the research set out to uncover the views of <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> of 11 different CLIL programmes regarding their pedagogical decisions and contextual experiences in a societal climate that tolerates but does not prioritise the study of second languages. The article concludes that CLIL programmes exist as individual programmes without an umbrella organisation supporting them and that, as a consequence, there is a necessity and mentality amongst <b>programme</b> <b>directors</b> to fulfil more roles than just those of leading teachers, including advocacy, recruitment and coordination of translations for teaching units. The article makes two claims: that stakeholder agency in CLIL programmes in Queensland is characterised by a 2 ̆ 7 sole fighter mentality 2 ̆ 7; and that this mentality is fostered not only by a generally marginalised role assigned to second language learning but also by contextual factors that merge language learning with language maintenance concerns in many of the existing CLIL programmes...|$|R
