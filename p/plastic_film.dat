5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|Most {{discrete}} capacitor types {{have more}} or less capacitance changes with increasing frequencies. The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore, their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. This phenomenon for ceramic class 2 and <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> dielectrics is related to dielectric relaxation in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles {{is the reason for}} the frequency dependence of permittivity.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} was conducted to investigate the application of detecting <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> in cotton using visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging. A line-scan hyperspectral imaging system (326 – 1100  nm) was used to detect <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> mixed with cotton which was an important quality issue. Hyperspectral reflectance images were acquired and difference spectra of cotton and <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> were extracted and analyzed to determine the dominant wavelengths. Also, {{as one of the}} most commonly used methods for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA) was chosen to process the hyperspectral images. Afterwards, effective wavelengths were selected by analyzing the first three principal components (PCs) and six single-band images at 473. 24  nm, 497. 29  nm, 530. 6  nm, 670. 81  nm, 674. 71  nm, and 955. 68  nm were extracted respectively.

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> capacitors with only a single layer of <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. <b>Plastic</b> <b>film</b> capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|E

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences.
