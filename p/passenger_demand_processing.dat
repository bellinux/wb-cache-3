40|$|Purpose: The train {{dispatching}} is {{a crucial}} issue in the train operation adjustment when passenger flow outbursts. During holidays, the train dispatching is to meet <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> to the greatest extent, and ensure safety, speediness and punctuality of the train operation. In this paper, a fuzzy <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting model is put up, then a train dispatching optimization model is established based on <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> so as to evacuate stranded passengers effectively during holidays. Design/methodology/approach: First, the complex features and regularity of passenger flow during holidays are analyzed, and then a fuzzy <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting model is put forward based on the fuzzy set theory and time series theory. Next, the bi-objective of the train dispatching optimization model is to minimize the total operation cost of the train dispatching and unserved passenger volume during holidays. Finally, the validity of this model is illustrated with a case concerned with the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway in China. Findings: The case study shows that the fuzzy <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting model can predict outcomes more precisely than ARIMA model. Thus train dispatching optimization plan proves that {{a small number of}} trains are able to serve unserved passengers reasonably and effectively. Originality/value: On the basis of the <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> predictive values, the train dispatching optimization model is established, which enables train dispatching to meet <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> in condition that passenger flow outbursts, so as to maximize <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> by offering the optimal operation plan.

40|$|Although bus <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> {{prediction}} {{has attracted}} increased attention during recent years, limited {{research has been}} conducted in the context of short-term <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting. This paper proposes an interactive multiple model (IMM) filter algorithm-based model to predict short-term <b>passenger</b> <b>demand.</b> After aggregated in 15 [*]min interval, <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> data collected from a busy bus route over four months were used to generate time series. Considering that <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> exhibits various characteristics in different time scales, three time series were developed, named weekly, daily, and 15 [*]min time series. After the correlation, periodicity, and stationarity analyses, time series models were constructed. Particularly, the heteroscedasticity of time series was explored to achieve better prediction performance. Finally, IMM filter algorithm was applied to combine individual forecasting models with dynamically predicted <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> for next interval. Different error indices were adopted for the analyses of individual and hybrid models. The performance comparison indicates that hybrid model forecasts are superior to individual ones in accuracy. Findings of this study are of theoretical and practical significance in bus scheduling...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to define an {{appropriate}} approach to forecast the appearance of the air <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> between cities worldwide. For air <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> link forecasting a weighted similarity-based algorithm is used, with an analysis of nine indices. The weighted resource allocation index demonstrates the best metrics. The accuracy of this method has been determined through a comparison of modeled and known data from three separate years. The known data was used to establish boundaries when applying the similarity-based algorithm. As a result, it was found that a weighted resource allocation index, with defined boundaries, should be utilized for link prediction in the air <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> network. Furthermore, it is shown that grouping cities within the air <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> network, based on socio-economic indicators, increases the accuracy of the forecast...|$|R

More comprehensively considered passenger travel cost include bus waiting cost and accurate bus riding cost, transfer cost between buses and trains, rail riding cost.

40|$|Many {{airlines}} currently use {{a variety}} of analytic techniques for seat inventory control {{as part of a larger}} revenue or "yield" management system. However, much of the this effort has emphasized decisions based on the individual passenger, and has neglected a significant segment of total airline <b>passenger</b> <b>demand,</b> namely that of group <b>passengers.</b> Group <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> differs in several important respects from individual <b>passenger</b> <b>demand,</b> and these differences have motivated the need for separate attention in booking procedures and future demand forecasting. In this thesis we begin by discussing the issues involved with trying to characterize the stochastic nature of airline group <b>passenger</b> <b>demand,</b> and identify the primary elements of variability associated with it. Later, we use these primary elements of demand to develop a mathematical model for the distribution of group passengers on a given flight(s). Armed with a well-defined distribution for group <b>passenger</b> <b>demand,</b> we enhance current mathematical programming approaches for solving the seat inventory control problem to include the control of group seat inventories. We then present a model for determining the minimum per passenger fare an airline should charge an ad hoc group request based on the displacement of individual passengers. Finally, we discuss the issues involved with overbooking in the group demand context, and suggest areas for further research. Cover titleMay 1991 Also issued as an M.

40|$|Maritime <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> {{forecasting}} is a {{task that}} is almost always present in the development studies of passenger ports, both due to operational and investment requirements. If a port belongs to a tourist destination, {{then there is a}} reasonable intention to use the forecasting model in order to establish the dependence between the <b>passenger</b> and tourist <b>demand.</b> Since the reliability of forecasting depends to a great extent on the quality and availability of data, the forecasting model is often a compromise between the theoretical assumptions and practical possibilities. This paper presents the approach to maritime <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting using a case study of the tourist destination â PoreÄ, which has been the strongest destination in Croatia regarding tourist traffic for many years. The presented forecasting models can serve as one of the guidelines for further study of the relations between traffic and tourism.

40|$|Vehicle fleet routing and {{timetable}} setting {{are essential}} to the enhancement of an inter-city bus carrier's operating cost, profit, level of service and competitiveness in the market. In past research the average <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> has usually served as input in the production of the final fleet routes and timetables, meaning that stochastic disturbances arising from variations in daily <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> in actual operations are neglected. To incorporate the stochastic disturbances of daily <b>passenger</b> <b>demands</b> that occur in actual operations, in this research, we established a stochastic-demand scheduling model. We applied a simulation technique, coupled with link-based and path-based routing strategies, to develop two heuristic algorithms to solve the model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the two solution algorithms, we developed an evaluation method. The test results, regarding a major Taiwan inter-city bus operation, were good, showing that the model and the solution algorithms could be useful in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Short-term <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> {{forecasting}} is {{of great}} importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal dependences, and exogenous dependences {{need to be considered}} simultaneously, however, which makes short-term <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and neural network based algorithms (e. g., artificial neural network and LSTM). This paper {{is one of the first}} DL studies to forecast the short-term <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.

30|$|Flexibility is {{identified}} as the key operational advantage of DTO systems by all automated metros [3]. DTO system breaks the connection between train availability and staff availability, which means that trains can be more easily included in or removed from circulation based on the <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> [27, 28]. This real-time adaption of capacity to <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> can provide the passengers with better service and keep the operation costs as lower as possible. For sporting or other special events, in an automated line as many trains as needed can be injected into the required part of the line with short headways {{in response to the}} peaks in demand. Moreover, only a short notice, e.g., like 1 Â h before the special events, is needed rather than 3 Â months to schedule trains for automated metros as stated in [3]. The flexibility of DTO systems to increase capacity for <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> was demonstrated by the Vancouver Sky-Train during the Expoâ 86 worldâs fair in its first year operation and during the Winter Olympics in February 2010 [29].|$|R
40|$|In a {{traditional}} transit system, passenger arrival time and bus running time are typically random and uncoordinated. This randomness gives {{the appearance of}} unbalanced <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> and unreliable transit services. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time control method for bus routes. In our method, buses skip some stations and turn back at appropriate stations, in order to balance <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> along the bus route and improve the overall transit service. Our real-time control method considers the typical changes in <b>passenger</b> <b>demand</b> and the stochastic travel time of buses. In this paper, the number of controlled vehicles {{at any given time}} is determined, and the bus holding time at the turn-back station is adopted. When implemented correctly, the optimal scheme indicates which stations should be skipped, where it is suitable for buses to turn back, and how long the holding time should be at turn-back stations, which in turn will minimize the total cost of a transit system. This paper formulates such an integrated strategy, presents the solution method of the formulation, and proves the validity of the real-time control method...|$|R
