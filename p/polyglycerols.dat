50|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} biodiesel production, formation of the byproduct, crude glycerol, has also increased. While glycerol is commonly used in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other industries, increased production of crude glycerol has become very expensive to purify and utilize in these industries. Because of this, researchers are interested in finding new economical ways to utilize low-grade glycerol products. Biotechnology is one such technique: using particular enzymes to break down crude glycerol to form products such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, succinic acid, dihydroxyacetone (glycerone), hydrogen, <b>polyglycerols,</b> and polyesters. As a catalyst for the conversion of glycerol to glycerone, glycerol dehydrogenase is one such enzyme being investigated for this industrial purpose.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{solution}} {{structure of}} hyperbranched macromolecules was investigated {{by means of}} small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> of different molecular weight were investigated in D 2 O and CD 3 OD, and very similar molar masses and radii of gyration were obtained in both solvents. Kratky plots of the scattering intensity revealed a compact structure of the hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols.</b> A power law scaling relation of the radius of gyration with molar mass was observed, from which a dimension of three was obtained. These observations indicate that the hyperbranched structure prevents strong irregular association despite the high functionality of hydroxyl groups {{that could lead to}} aggregation in those solvents. Amphiphilic derivatives of the hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> have been studied in the nonpolar solvent C 6 D 6. Again, molecularly dispersed polymers were found provided the degree of esterification was sufficiently high.

We report the first novel redox-degradable hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols.</b> A glycerol monomer containing a disulfide bond, i. e., 2 -((2 -(oxiran- 2 -ylmethoxy) ethyl) disulfanyl) ethan- 1 -ol (SSG), was designed and polymerized through anionic ring-opening multibranching polymerization to yield a series of redox-degradable hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> (PSSGs) with controlled molecular weights (2000 - 11 000 g/mol) and relatively low molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn < 1. 15). In addition, copolymerization with a nondegradable glycerol (G) monomer provided P(G-co-SSG) copolymers, which contained an adjustable fraction of degradable moieties within their polyglycerol backbones. The polymerization was characterized using 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, GPC, and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The copolymerization process was also evaluated using quantitative in situ 13 C NMR kinetic measurements in bulk, which revealed that the reaction kinetics of G were faster {{than those of the}} SSG monomer, leading to a gradient during the copolymerization process. Furthermore, we explored the redox-responsive degradation of the polymers upon treatment with a reducing agent, which resulted in selective degradation of the polymers in small segments. In vitro cytotoxicity studies, such as MTT and CCK- 8 assays, revealed the superior biocompatibility of these new polymers even at high concentrations of 500 μg/mL.

The selective etherification of glycerol to higher oligomers was studied {{in the presence of}} CaO colloids and the data are compared with those obtained from NaOH and CaO. The materials were prepared by dispersing CaO, CaCO 3, or Ca(OH) 2 onto a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support.

Optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to obtain a product with Gardner color number < 2, containing no acrolein and minimal cyclic byproducts. The differences in the CaO colloids originating from CNF and bulk CaO were probed using light scattering and conductivity measurements.

40|$|Due to an {{increased}} environmental awareness and thus, concerns {{over the use of}} fossil-based monomer for polymer production, there is an ongoing effort to find alternatives to non-renewable traditional monomers. This has ushered in the rapid growth in the development of bio-based materials such as green monomers and biodegradable polymers from vegetable and animal resources. Glycerol, as a renewable bio-based monomer, is an interesting candidate for sustainable polymer production. Glycerol is a renewable material that is a by-product of the transesterification of vegetable oils to biodiesel. Utilization of the excess glycerol derived from the growing biodiesel industry is important to oleochemical industries. The main objective of this thesis was to produce high molecular weight <b>polyglycerol</b> from glycerol and synthesize stimuli-responsive <b>polyglycerol</b> hydrogels.

High molecular weight partially branched <b>polyglycerol</b> with multimodal molecular weight distributions was obtained. The polymerization of glycerol proceeded fastest with sulphuric acid as catalyst as indicated by the highest observed conversion of monomer along with the highest molecular weights. Theoretical models were used to predict the gel point and to calculate monomer functionality. High molecular weight <b>polyglycerol</b> was used to synthesize novel stimuli-responsive hydrogels.

40|$|Flowing liquids in {{pipe systems}} cause {{pressure}} drops and energy losses {{and can be}} responsible for the initiation of flow induced localized corrosion (FILC). Initiation of FILC is affected by unfavourable geometric conditions in flow systems and local flow intensities above critical values. Many technical systems are concerned, e. g. in the field of oil and gas production, pipeline transportation, chemical plants or power stations. Critical flow intensities are generally expressed in terms of wall shear stresses as a value for the friction between turbulent flowing liquids and the wall. High molecular polymers and surface active compounds can influence a turbulent flow by reducing the wall shear stress to values which are uncritical for destruction of protective surface layers and thus can reduce the likelihood of FILC. In the framework of this thesis globular structures of hyperbranched polymers (e. g. <b>polyglycerols,</b> polyethylene imines) were investigated in order to find out if hyperbranched polymers are able to reduce wall shear stresses and if they have a higher resistance to degradation in high shear fields compared to surface active compounds like surfactants. It was proved by electrochemical and rheological investigations that globular structures like <b>polyglycerols</b> and polyethylene imines as well exert flow improving properties when the molecular size is high enough. Electrochemical and rheological measurements yield different results on the flow improving properties. This is explained by the effect of local flow intensities on the near-wall concentration of additives yielding an increase of the near-wall liquid viscosity and thus influences the interaction between the flowing liquid and the wall. This may already result in a decrease of the flow induced corrosion attack in flow systems. In summary, it was found out that hyperbranched polymers are a new class of polymers with a new supramolecular structure which exhibits as well as high molecular compounds and surface active compounds flow improving properties...|$|E
