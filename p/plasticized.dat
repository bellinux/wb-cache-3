40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} <b>plasticizing</b> admixture content on the physical and mechanical properties of concrete made of 50  % coarse aggregate. The plasticizer dosage levels proposed by the manufacturer (0. 2  % – 1. 2  %) were examined and the optimum plasticizer dose (0. 8  % – 1. 0  %) was established. The use of limestone Portland cement and the optimum content (0. 8  % – 1. 0  %) of <b>plasticizing</b> admixture {{in the production of}} concrete increases the compressive strength, density, frost resistance, whereas the water absorption is reduced.

25|$|PVC is {{chemically}} resistant to acids, salts, bases, fats, and alcohols; therefore, {{it is used}} in sewerage piping. It is also resistant to some solvents, mainly uPVC. <b>Plasticized</b> PVC, also known as PVC-P, is in some cases less resistant to solvents. For example, PVC is resistant to fuel and some paint thinners. Some solvents may only swell it or deform it but not dissolve it, but some of them, like tetrahydrofuran or acetone, may damage it.|$|E
25|$|Inclusion of {{plasticizers}} {{tends to}} lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility. Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically {{similar to the}} polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain interactions. A {{good example of the}} action of plasticizers is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. An uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. <b>Plasticized</b> PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} the <b>plasticizing</b> properties of ibuprofen (IBP) on hot-melt extruded ethyl cellulose (EC). The thermal behavior of hot-melt extrudates containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 % (w/w) IBP was evaluated using modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry. By means of comparison, co-evaporates containing the same concentrations of IBP and EC, were also evaluated. Both methods yielded solid solutions having one glass transition temperature indicating compatibility between drug and polymer. A similar decrease in glass transition temperature was noticed with increasing IBP concentration in the solid solutions prepared via both methods, indicating its <b>plasticizing</b> effect. The <b>plasticizing</b> efficiency was of the same magnitude as for the traditionally used plasticizers. Infrared spectroscopy was performed for {{better understanding of the}} chemical interactions in the molecular dispersions and confirmed the existence of hydrogen bonds between IBP and EC.

40|$|Abstract: Ethylene glycol (EG) and {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) were added as plasticizers {{to improve the}} processing performance of cellulose acetate (CA). The CA with 30 % plasticizers were melted by HAAKE at 200 ℃. The effects of EG and PEG (degree of polymerization in 200 - 800) on rheological properties and mechanical properties of CA were investigated. The {{results show that the}} <b>plasticizing</b> time, equilibrium torque and melt viscosity of the <b>plasticizing</b> system increase with the increase of PEG molecular weight, while the processing performance decreased. The tensile strength of the system decrease as the PEG molecular weight increased. The <b>plasticizing</b> system which contents 30 % PEG- 200 (degree of polymerization is 200) shows the maximum elongation at break.

25|$|<b>Plasticized</b> PVC is {{a common}} {{material}} for medical gloves. Due to vinyl gloves having less flexibility and elasticity, several guidelines recommend either latex or nitrile gloves for clinical care and procedures that require manual dexterity and/or that involve patient contact {{for more than a}} brief period. Vinyl gloves show poor resistance to many chemicals, including glutaraldehyde-based products and alcohols used in formulation of disinfectants for swabbing down work surfaces or in hand rubs. The additives in PVC are also known to cause skin reactions such as allergic contact dermatitis. These are for example the antioxidant bisphenol A, the biocide benzisothiazolinone, propylene glycol/adipate polyester and ethylhexylmaleate.|$|E
25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see Closed-cell PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary cutting equipment. <b>Plasticized</b> PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a wide-format printer. These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E
25|$|T-55A (Ob'yekt 155A) - Produced 1963–1981, in Poland 1964–1979. The T-55A MBT was {{primarily}} developed to incorporate a new antiradiation lining and full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. One {{of the major}} internal additions {{was the use of}} a <b>plasticized</b> lead sheeting for antiradiation protection. This was evident externally due to use of an enlarged driver's hatch and enlarged combings over the commander's and loader's hatch to accommodate the new material. Improved POV anti-radiation protection (leading to visibly protruding turret hatches) and NBC filtration, dispensed with bow machine gun. The coaxial SGMT machine gun was replaced with a PKT machine gun. The hull machine gun was removed, which made room for six more 100mm gun rounds Since 1970, T-55A tanks began to receive a new turret fitting for the 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E

500|$|Malina recounted that Parsons was {{inspired}} to use asphalt by the ancient incendiary weapon Greek fire; in a 1982 talk for the International Association of Astronomical Artists Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group's earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons' aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter [...] "changed the future of rocket technology": the thermoplastic asphalt casting was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. <b>Plasticized</b> variants of Parsons' solid-fuel design invented by JPL's Charles Bartley were later used by NASA in Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters and by the Strategic Air Command in Polaris, Poseidon and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles.|$|E
500|$|No {{more than}} 1,800 {{copies of the}} 17-by-22-inch (559 by 432mm) [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster were printed. It was not {{initially}} seen beyond several Westinghouse factories in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the midwestern U.S., where it {{was scheduled to be}} displayed for two five-day work weeks starting Monday, February 15, 1943. The targeted factories were making <b>plasticized</b> helmet liners impregnated with Micarta, a phenolic resin invented by Westinghouse. Mostly women were employed in this enterprise, which yielded some 13million helmet liners {{over the course of the}} war. The slogan [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] was probably not interpreted by the factory workers as empowering to women alone; they had been subjected to a series of paternalistic, controlling posters promoting management authority, employee capability and company unity, and the workers would likely have understood the image to mean [...] "Westinghouse Employees Can Do It", all working together. The upbeat image served as gentle propaganda to boost employee morale and keep production from lagging. The pictured red, white and blue clothing was a subtle call to patriotism, one of the frequent tactics of corporate war production committees.|$|E

30|$|The result {{showed that}} as the lignin content in the film increased, tensile (TS) and {{bursting}} strength (BS) decreased. TS of the film ranged between 0.28 anbd 1.2  MPa, and the highest value was exhibited for LG-A, while the addition of lignin significantly decreased the TS of the film (Table  1). The highest bursting strength was observed in LG-A, whereas the lowest was observed in LG-D. Acacia lignin incorporation created an apparent <b>plasticizing</b> effect in gelatin film, as assumed from significant decrease in both tensile and bursting strength. It {{has been reported that}} lignin provides miscibility with other polymers and act as a <b>plasticizing</b> agent in blend films, but only when added in moderate concentrations (Nunez-Flores et al. 2013). The decrease in TS and BS in the lignin–gelatin blended film can be associated with high moisture content of LG-D and LG-E and deceptive <b>plasticizing</b> effect of lignin leading to a decrease in intermolecular attraction forces between polymer chains (Cuq et al. 1997).|$|R
