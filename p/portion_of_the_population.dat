5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|The wealthier <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> usually {{send their}} {{children}} to independent schools as opposed to the government-run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidized by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|The Christian {{conversion}} of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the {{conversion of}} a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and traditional religious beliefs regained preeminence; {{at least one major}} historic church in the area was burned. French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities. This was soon followed by a renewed {{effort on the part of}} Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.|$|E

5|$|Uttarakhand has a multiethnic {{population}} {{spread across}} two geocultural regions: the Garhwal, and the Kumaon. A large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> is Rajput (various clans of erstwhile landowning rulers and their descendants), {{including members of}} the native Garhwali, Kumaoni and Gujjar communities, {{as well as a}} number of immigrants. According to a 2007 study by Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of Brahmins of any state in India, with approximately 20% of the population being Brahmin. 18.76% of the population belongs to the Scheduled Castes (an official term for the lower castes in the traditional Hindu caste system). Scheduled Tribes (an official term for natives outside the Indian social system), such as the Tharu, Jaunsari, Buksa, Bhotiya and Raji constitute 2.89% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E

The two men realise that a small <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs {{to the top of}} a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E

5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> {{and most of the}} remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> from being captured.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{testing has}} shown that Kiger Mustang is a {{descendant}} of the Spanish horse. Many of today's Kiger Mustangs {{can be traced back}} to a single stallion named Mesteño, captured with the original herd in 1977 and released back to the Kiger HMA. Several organizations exist which inspect and register Kiger Mustangs; each has their own standards for entry into the stud book. In 1988, the Kiger Mustang Association (now the Kiger Mesteño Association) was formed as the original registry for the herd. By 2013, the organization had registered around 800 horses, and annually inspects between 75 and 100 new horses. Two other associations are the Steens Mountain Kiger Registry, established in 1993, and the Kiger Horse Association and Registry. The Kiger Mustangs of the Riddle Mountain and Kiger HMAs are the best known herds of mustangs in Oregon, despite making up only a small <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> As of 2013, the state had a total estimated BLM-managed feral horse population of almost 2,600, roaming over 17 HMAs and a Wild Horse Territory co-managed with the US Forest Service. A census taken in April 2010 found 60 Kiger Mustangs in the Riddle Mountain HMA and 81 in the Kiger HMA; estimates made in February 2013 list 40 horses in Riddle Mountain and 61 in Kiger.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{was elected}} {{president}} on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted {{to remain in the}} Union, while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C. vulnerable and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention, so Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney in Ex parte Merryman that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland was unconstitutional.|$|E
