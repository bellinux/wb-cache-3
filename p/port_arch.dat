There is also the Arch Linux ARM project, which aims to <b>port</b> <b>Arch</b> Linux to ARM-based devices, including the Raspberry Pi.|$|E

The idea of making a single, official <b>port</b> of <b>Arch</b> Linux for devices with ARM processors was born {{from members of the}} Arch Linux PlugApps and ArchMobile development teams, notably Mike Staszel, who went on to found the Arch Linux ARM project.|$|R

5000|$|Arch Linux ARM is a <b>port</b> of <b>Arch</b> Linux for ARM processors. Its design {{philosophy}} is [...] "simplicity and full {{control to the}} end user," [...] and like its parent operating system Arch Linux, aims to be very Unix-like. This goal of minimalism and complete user control, however, can make Arch Linux difficult for Linux beginners as it requires more knowledge of and responsibility for the operating system.|$|R
5000|$|Variants: A variant that is {{somewhat}} between the mullen {{and a low}} port, seen primarily in western riding is called a [...] "sweetwater" [...] bit and is a very wide, low <b>port</b> slightly more <b>arched</b> than a mullen that offers full tongue relief, puts pressure only on the bars, and is primarily used as a curb mouthpiece. Spade and [...] "half-breed bits also have a straight bar mouthpiece, but {{with the addition of}} a port, spoon, or other accoutrements, and thus are not truly classified as a mullen or straight bar mouthpiece." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mouthpiece}} of a horse's bit is {{the first}} factor {{most people think of}} when assessing the severity and action of the bit. Therefore, it is carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. Many mouthpieces are not allowed in certain competitions. Bit mouthpieces may be single jointed, double-jointed, [...] "mullen" [...] (a straight bar), or have an <b>arched</b> <b>port</b> in the center of varying height, with or without joints. Some have rollers, rings or small [...] "keys" [...] that the horse can move with its tongue. Mouthpieces may be smooth, wire-wrapped or otherwise roughened, or of twisted wire or metal.|$|R
5000|$|Eye of the North is set {{eight years}} after an event known as [...] "The Searing" [...] occurs in Guild Wars: Prophecies, where a {{northern}} race of cat-like beasts known as the Charr incinerate the Tyrian kingdom of Ascalon. Earthquakes begin to increase in frequency across all the three continents of the game world; Tyria, Cantha and Elona, which correspond to the three Guild Wars stand-alone campaigns; Prophecies, Factions and Nightfall, respectively. Strange creatures have begun to emerge from crevasses created by these earthquakes and the player is tasked to investigate further, starting from either Lion’s <b>Arch,</b> <b>port</b> city of Tyria; Kaineng Center, port city of Cantha; or Kamadan, Jewel of Istan, port city of Elona.|$|R
40|$|Background Foot arches are {{important}} components for body sup- <b>port.</b> Foot <b>arch</b> deformity caused by growth abnormalities cause serious limitations in daily activities. Objectives To determine {{the patterns of}} foot arch growth, factors influencing foot arch growth, and the timing for intervention in er- rant growth patterns. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluated the foot arches of chil- dren aged 0 - 18 years according to age and sex. Subjects included had no evidence of physical abnormality other than flat foot, knock- knee, or bow leg. Subjects were grouped per year of age. Data on foot arch class, age, sex, weight, height, medial intercondylar dis- tance, and medial intermalleolar distance were recorded. Chi- square test, correlation, binary and linear regressions, general lin- ear model, and contrast matrix were performed. Results In 8376 children aged 0 - 18 years, flat foot grade 3 had stable proportions in all age groups. Flat foot grade 2 and 1 had smaller proportions in older age groups than in younger ones. The proportions of normal foot was greater in older age groups. Boys {{at the age of}} 7 and girls at 9 have a small percentage of pes cavus. The mean foot arch measurements were consistent with flat foot grade 2 at age 0 - 3 years, flat foot grade 1 at 4 years, and normal foot at age 18. Median foot arch measurement of children 0 - 10 years old was consistent with flat foot grade 1, while that of chil- dren 11 years old was consistent with normal foot. Age and height gave positive influence. Based on these measurements we infer that the optimal time for intervention is 0 - 7 years for boys and 0 - 3 years for girls. Conclusion The proportion of flat foot grade 3 is stable through- out age groups, that of flat foot grade 2 and 1 are smaller in older age groups, and that of normal foot is greater in older age groups. Overgrowth happens in very small percentages after age of 7 in boys and 9 in girls. Age, sex, height, weight, and growth of the knees are influencing factor...|$|R
50|$|The Administration Building (1917) is a two-storeyed brick {{building}} with a terracotta-tiled roof, decorative fleche and brick chimneys, designed to be the centrepiece of the institution. Arts and Crafts influences {{are evident in the}} massing of the hipped roof forms and the use of unpainted brickwork contrasting with coloured roughcast plaster above sill height. The main entrance on the eastern elevation features an <b>arched</b> <b>port</b> cochere, adjacent to an oval driveway with formal landscape elements, including plantings of cycads. The entrance is given greater prominence by two tower-like wings with separate hipped roof located {{on either side of the}} port cochere. There is a verandah on the ground floor on the western elevation with brick and timber piers and stairs located both centrally and at each end. Internally the building comprises office accommodation arranged off central hallways with regular arched partitions. The rooms generally have plastered masonry partition walls with timber joinery. The building has a central timber staircase and some stained timber and glass partition walls. An Honour Board is located in the entry hall on the ground floor.The Former Hospital (1917) is located to the north of the Administration Building, across grassed terraces built by patients. It is a low-set, single-storeyed, symmetrical {{brick building}} with hipped terracotta-tiled roofs and a decorative fleche, sympathetic in design to the Administration Building. The entrance is marked by a projecting entry bay with gable roof and the wings of the building extend to either side. A slightly elevated verandah with brick and timber piers runs the length of the front elevation of the building and floor to ceiling multi-paned sash windows are located along all walls. Small windows are also located above the verandah roof and below the eaves of the main roof. The rear of the building has five small projecting wings, some no more than the size of a single room. The central projecting wing is the largest. It was the former operating room and has a five-sided projecting bay with large windows in each section. Timber sash windows with concrete sills and lintels are found throughout the building. The interior of the building contains office accommodation for clinical staff.|$|R
