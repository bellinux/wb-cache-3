In this research, chicken manure application and its combination with <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilizer</b> improved the soil nutrient condition than <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application in most cases.

The aim of this research was to determine the effect of genotype, azotobacter and the amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on the root yield of sugar beet and on the microbiological activity of the sugar beet rhizospheric soil. Three hybrids of sugar beet were used during the two years of the research. The seed of the hybrids was inoculated with three strains of azotobacter.

We collected 5570 measurements from 107 papers. FYM produced slightly lower crop yields (− 9. 5 %) when used alone and higher (+ 11. 3 %) yields when used in combination with N fertilizer (FYMm), compared to those obtained using <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilizers</b> only.

The apparent N recoveries of FYM and FYMm were 59. 3 % and 78. 7 %, respectively, of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Manured soils had significantly higher C (+ 32. 9 % on average for FYM and FYMm) and N (+ 21. 5 %) concentrations.

In this study, microbial biomass C and N contents (Cmic & Nmic). soil enzyme activities, and soil fertility with different fertilizer regimes were carried out based on a 15 -year long-term fertilizer experiment in Drab Fluvo-aquic soil in Changping County, Beijing, China. At this site, 7 different treatments were established in 1991.

In different fertilization treatments Cmic changed from 96. 49 to 500. 12 mg kg, and Nmic changed from 35. 89 to 101. 82 mg kg. Compared with CK, the other treatments increased Cmic & Nmic, Cmic/Corg (organic C) ratios, Cmic/Nmic, urease activity, soil organic matter (SOM). soil total nitrogen (STN), and soil total phosphorus (STP). All these properties in treatment with fertilizers input NPKM+ were the highest.
