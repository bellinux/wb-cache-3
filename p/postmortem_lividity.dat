It is a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body post mortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by action of gravity.|$|E
30|$|In the {{reported}} dyadic deaths, {{the pattern of}} <b>postmortem</b> <b>lividity,</b> {{as well as the}} appearance of ligature mark distinctly, varied between the deceased males and female. The post mortem lividity was distributed in ‘glove and stocking’ pattern over the extremities and was fixed in the female victim while the lividity on the male body was present {{over the back of the}} body and was not fixed. Though the ligature materials used in both the cases were cotton cloth material, the appearance of ligature mark around the neck was significantly different too. The appearance of ligature mark around the neck is influenced by many factors including the type of ligature material, weight of the body, duration of suspension, etc. Distinct grooved ligature mark in the female was suggestive of prolonged suspension while an inconspicuous and faint ligature mark in male indicated the contrary. It is highly likely that the knot of the ligature noose in the male victim loosened and opened up after some time of the suspension due to the weight of the body, as suggested by the relative position of the male victim on the floor and the cloth material freely hanging from the roof above it. The effects of body weight on ligature material and suspension can be deceptive (Kanchan et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Death by {{hemorrhage}} {{can occur}} due to sharp or blunt force, {{but also as}} part of a pathological process. If arteries, veines or organs are injured, it can also lead to a lethal loss of blood. As well as the volume of blood lost, the bleeding localisation and the rapidity of the blood loss can also be relevant for a death by hemorrhage. In pathophysiological terms, the most important factor is the irreversible hypovolemic choc and the fast draining of the heart with the consequences that the brain is insufficiently oxygenated. The diagnostic death by hemorrhage is based on a localisation of the bleeding source, the volume of blood lost and the classical signs of a hemorrhage. The lethal internal blood loss volume can be measured only approximately during the autopsy. In research papers, the figures for a lethal internal blood loss volume level lie between 1. 2 l and 3 l. The aim {{of this study is to}} show how a death by hemorrhage is represented in different trauma groups with different patterns of injury and to demonstrate which factors are important in determining the volume of blood lost. The study consisted of 120 deceased people, among them 17 gunshot, 40 sharp injuries, 35 polytraumas and 28 cases with a single bleeding source. All of these cases could be put down to death by hemorraghe and showed relevant internal blood loss volumes. The autopsy records were evaluated and analysed in retrospect with reference to the following pieces of data: general data, data of blood volumes, bleeding sources, classical hemorrhage signs, pattern of injuries, possbile indications for competing causes of death, general status of health, survival time, external blood loss and any indications of resuscitation attempts. The internal blood loss volume without any competing cause of death averaged out at 1. 8 l. This implies an average blood loss of 39 % of the assumed whole corporal blood volume. In the presence of competing causes of death, the critical volume of blood loss was reduced up to 30 %. The gunshot injuries stand out in this study as the case with the highest levels of blood loss volumes. The lowest level of blood loss volumes were observed in polytrauma cases. The main bleeding source was major vessel injuries in all groups. In the most of the cases, the blood was measured as a liquid. The classical signs of hemorrhage were observed in descending order according to frequency: pallor with a low <b>postmortem</b> <b>lividity,</b> draining of the internal organs and a low filling of the vessels and heart cavities. Subendocardial hemorrhage wasnt a specific indication for death by hemorrhage. The most important factors with reference to the blood loss volume also formed part of the results of the study and were also listed in a descending order of importance: weight, resuscitation measures, age and circumstances of competing lethal causes. All factors could be validated as highly significant by regression analysis. This study analyses the different trauma groups and tries to identify the main factors for the internal blood loss volume. In order to reach more precise conclusions with respect to the trauma groups with different pattern of injuries, the main focus should be aimed at similar pattern of injuries in other studies with more cases. Although the formula for a coarse estimation of the internal blood loss volume has only been developed with several conditions, it would be interesting to prove the validity of such a formula...|$|E
