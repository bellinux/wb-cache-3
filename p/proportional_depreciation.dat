40|$|We {{propose a}} simple axiomatic system that any {{depreciation}} method¡ªcomplying with {{the core of}} the accounting of depreciation¡ªmust obey. We show that, while none of the prevalent depreciation methods (e. g., straight-line) ex ante conforms to these principles, the accredited <b>proportional</b> <b>depreciation</b> method not only maintains the axiomatic system, but also, for a plausible family of depreciation methods, is the unique method that complies with the axiomatic system. We further propose two consistency requirements of a depreciation method¡ªpartition consistency and dynamic consistency¡ªand show that, in contrast to the commonly used methods, the <b>proportional</b> <b>depreciation</b> method is the only one to always sustain both. Our analysis may provide further resolution to the arguable evidence on the dominance of Funds From Operations over net income in measuring performance in the real estate industry. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{alternative}} representation for Fixed Capital to the commonly accepted one within the Sraffian literature (the Torrens rule). This new method for repre-senting Fixed Capital calculates the profit rate using the total capital value {{displayed in the}} firm’s balance sheet {{at the beginning of}} each time period. This contrasts with the Torrens rule, which calculates the profit rate using the lump sum of circulating capital for purchas-ing material inputs plus the book value of fixed capital stock. The core of this paper is pre-cisely to provide the rationale for the new procedure, which is grounded on an elementary knowledge of Financial Accounting. This new method gets rid of the fixed capital stock book values, so it is better adapted than the Torrens rule to show that the market prices along with the distributive variables perform the reproduction of economic system. At the same time, this new method provides us with an accounting foundation for the widespread practice within input-output analysis of combining the fixed capital stock valued as new with a <b>proportional</b> <b>depreciation.</b> J.
