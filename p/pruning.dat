5|$|Regular <b>pruning</b> is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to <b>pruning</b> or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|More recently, B.integrifolia {{has been}} used in the art of bonsai. Its rangy habit and long internodes are {{challenging}} to overcome, but the leaves do reduce with <b>pruning,</b> and unlike the gnarlier B.serrata (saw banksia) its trunk can become textured with age.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from <b>pruning</b> of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or <b>pruning</b> off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
40|$|Null {{mutations}} in the <b>prune</b> gene of Drosophila melanogaster result in <b>prune</b> eye color due to reductions in red pigment accumulation. When one {{copy of the}} awd(Killer of <b>prune)</b> mutant gene is present in a <b>prune</b> background, the animals die. The cause of prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality remains unknown. The genomic region characterized for the <b>prune</b> locus is transcriptionally active and complex, with multiple and overlapping transcripts. Despite the transcriptional complexity of the genomic region of <b>prune,</b> accumulated {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>prune</b> locus is small and consists of a single transcription unit, since every <b>prune</b> allele to date exhibits both <b>prune</b> eye color and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality. A functional <b>prune</b> product from a single, full-length cDNA was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye phenotype and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality. The DNA sequences of several mutant <b>prune</b> alleles along with Western blot analysis of mutant proteins provide convincing evidence that <b>prune</b> mutations are nulls, and that the cDNA identified in this study encodes the only product of the <b>prune</b> locus...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prunes</b> {{are used}} in {{preparing}} both sweet and savory dishes. Stewed <b>prunes,</b> a compote, are a common dessert. <b>Prunes</b> are an ingredient in North African tagines or tzimmes, a traditional Jewish dish (in which the principal ingredient is diced or sliced carrots), in the Nordic <b>prune</b> kisel, eaten with rice pudding, and in the traditional Norwegian dessert fruit soup. <b>Prunes</b> have also been included in other holiday dishes, such as stuffing and cake. Prune-filled Danish pastries, yogurt or ice cream containing <b>prunes</b> or <b>prune</b> juice are found in some countries. Chocolate-covered <b>prunes</b> are a traditional confectionery in Eastern Europe. <b>Prunes</b> are also used to make juice and kompot (uzvar), a traditional drink in Europe. In the Cotswolds, <b>prunes</b> were fermented to form a cider-like drink called jerkum which, due to the high sugar content of <b>prunes,</b> was considered particularly potent in alcohol content compared to contemporary ciders and beers.|$|R
40|$|Grading is {{important}} to ensure the production of high-quality foods, but It Is usually done with error, distorting market signals and diminishing Incentives to produce high-quality products. Size is the main quality criterion for dried <b>prunes</b> and the crucial characteristic In determining <b>prune</b> value. We studied the economic effects of errors In commodity grading, focusing In particular on the Implications of one-way (asymmetric) grading errors, namely when small, low quality product Is erroneously classified as high quality, but not vice versa. In an application to the California <b>prune</b> Industry, we estimated {{the extent to which}} large <b>prunes</b> are undervalued and small <b>prunes</b> are overvalued. We conclude that grading error means that <b>prunes</b> graded as high-quality may not really be high-quality <b>prunes.</b> The presence of these Incorrectly graded <b>prunes</b> depresses the prices that growers are paid for high-quality <b>prunes</b> and increases the net returns for small <b>prunes.</b> As a result, growers face reduced incentives to produce larger <b>prunes...</b>|$|R

His ashes, mixed with those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden.|$|E
5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. <b>Pruning</b> can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1938 <b>Prune</b> growers of Oregon {{are faced}} with the {{prospect}} of large crops and surpluses for the next few years. These surpluses will probably be felt in both fresh and dried <b>prunes.</b> This thesis presents the results of an investigation to find. new markets and new products which will be of value in utilizing these surpluses. The following products have been investigated and are included in this report. Canned prepared dried <b>prunes.</b> A. prolonged study was made of the effect of prepared Italian <b>prunes</b> on various types of cans. It was found that plain charcoal cans were entirely satisfactory over a period of 11 months' storage. Single enameled cans should not be used as they swell in less than eight months' storage. Methods of preparation of <b>prunes</b> for canning were studied. A long pre-soaking was found most satisfactory, for high quality. Short hot blanch before canning can be used if proper conditions of syrup and fill are observed. Yields and costs were given for the two methods of preparation. <b>Prune</b> beverages. Three types of <b>prune</b> beverages were discussed. Pulpy juice was most promising. A cloudy and a clear beverage were also satisfactory. Yields and costs were given and compared. Pitted <b>prune</b> pulp. Small or low-grade dried <b>prunes</b> were made into pulp by means of a suitable machine. This product was suitable for use in the bakery trade. Halved Pitted <b>prunes.</b> Fresh <b>prunes</b> were split and pitted before drying. The machine to do this was developed during this investigation. Large savings were effected in drying time, because of quicker evaporation of moisture from these halved <b>prunes.</b> Because of shorter drying time and lower temperature the quality was more nearly that of fresh <b>prunes.</b> Fresh <b>Prune</b> Juice. Small or low-grade fresh <b>prunes</b> were used to make a pulpy fresh <b>prune</b> juice. This product was excellent in flavor and color. Cloudy fresh <b>prune</b> juice was not satisfactory either in flavor, in body, or in yield. Fresh <b>Prune</b> Pulp. This was prepared from fresh <b>prunes.</b> It proved to be a very good means of fresh <b>prune</b> utilization. The combined effect of the products studied in this report, if they are developed and marketed, should prove beneficial to marketing conditions of the northwest Italian <b>prunes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Agen is the [...] "capital of the prune", a local produce {{sold as a}} sweet (stuffed with <b>prune</b> purée) or as an after-dinner delight (<b>prunes</b> {{soaked in}} Armagnac – a type of brandy). Every September, the <b>Prune</b> festival organizes rock concerts, circuses and <b>prune</b> tasting.|$|R
5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light <b>pruning</b> not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Regular <b>pruning</b> is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to <b>pruning</b> or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, {{but it has been}} grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular <b>pruning.</b> Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, and are more promising for horticulture.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy <b>pruning</b> after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light <b>pruning</b> not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by <b>pruning.</b> Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
50|$|Sunsweet {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of dried fruit and juice products, although it {{is best known for}} <b>prunes.</b> The company produces and distributes <b>prunes,</b> cranberries, apricots, nectarines, pineapples, mangoes and dates. Other recent Sunsweet products include Ones (individually wrapped <b>prunes),</b> Jumbo Red Raisins (from large red flame Chilean grapes), PlumSweets (chocolate-covered <b>prunes),</b> PlumSmart plum juice, and Specialty mangoes, blueberries, cherries, and berry blends.|$|R
50|$|Gillet’s next notable plant {{introduction}} to California (in 1883) {{was a free}} stone dessert <b>prune</b> from the Clairac region of France, which he called “Clairac Mammoth” (a.k.a. “Imperial Epineuse”). At {{a time when most}} California fruit was consumed fresh, dried and canned dessert <b>prunes</b> were a popular, expensive import from France. California <b>prune</b> growers as early as 1854 had attempted to cut into this lucrative market by importing and growing French <b>prune</b> trees, but struggled to copy French drying methods. Gillet competed with John Rock, another well-known nurseryman in Niles (Fremont), to market hardier <b>prune</b> trees that produced very large fruit. Gillet introduced his Clairac <b>prune</b> trees two years before Rock. Both men crossed or grafted the French <b>prunes</b> with wild California plums to produce a variety that was more drought-tolerant and hardier in upland orchards, than in lowlands such as the Santa Clara Valley, then the <b>prune</b> growing center of California.|$|R

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light <b>pruning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to <b>pruning.</b> Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no <b>pruning</b> and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide {{concentrations}} in <b>prune</b> products – baby strained <b>prunes</b> (range = 75 – 265 μg kg−− 1), baby apple/prune juice (33 – 61 μg kg−− 1), <b>prune</b> juice (186 – 916 μg kg−− 1) and <b>prunes</b> (58 – 332 μg kg−− 1) – on the Canadian market were determined. The formation of acrylamide in a simulated plum juice was also investigated under ‘drying conditions’ {{in an open}} vessel at temperatures < 100 °C for 24 h and under ‘wet conditions’ in a closed vessel at a temperature of 120 °C for 1 h. Acrylamide was produced in a simulated plum juice under ‘drying conditions’ in amounts comparable with those found in <b>prunes</b> and <b>prune</b> juices. Acrylamide was not produced in simulated plum juice under ‘wet conditions’ in a closed vessel at temperature of 120 °C for 1 h, but under the same condition an authentic <b>prune</b> juice doubled its acrylamide concentration. Formation of acrylamide in <b>prune</b> products was attributed {{to the presence of}} asparagine and sugars in the starting materials...|$|R
40|$|The <b>prune</b> gene of Drosophila melanogaster is {{predicted}} to encode a phosphodiesterase. Null alleles of <b>prune</b> are viable but cause an eye-color phenotype. The abnormal wing discs gene encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Killer of <b>prune</b> is a missense mutation in the abnormal wing discs gene. Although it has no phenotype by itself even when homozygous, Killer of <b>prune</b> when heterozygous causes lethality {{in the absence of}} <b>prune</b> gene function. A screen for suppressors of transgenic Killer of <b>prune</b> led to the recovery of three mutations, all of which are in the same gene. As heterozygotes these mutations are dominant suppressors of the prune-Killer of <b>prune</b> lethal interaction; as homozygotes these mutations cause early larval lethality and the absence of imaginal discs. These alleles are loss-of-function mutations in CG 10065, a gene that {{is predicted}} to encode a protein with several zinc finger domains and glutathione S-transferase activity...|$|R
40|$|In an {{experiment}} with 3 stand densities and 12 <b>prune</b> treatments there were analyzed {{the effects of}} stand density, <b>prune</b> and interaction between them on the yield of a Pinus taeda L. plantation. The stand variables analyzed were diameter at breast height (DBH), stem volume, volume per hectare, height, basal area, diameter over stubs (DMSM), Girard form coefficient (CFG), diameter of branch (DRBC) and branches angle (ARBC) at crown base. In the treatments with high density there were observed higher volume per hectare, basal area, CFG and lower DBH, stem volume, DMSM, DRBC and ARBC. In the treatments with lower <b>prune</b> height there were observed higher DBH, stem volume, volume per hectare, basal area than the treatments with larger <b>prune</b> height. Lower DMSM was observed with final <b>prune</b> height of 3, 30 m and 4, 40 m made {{at the age of}} 4 year. Higher DMSM were observed with final <b>prune</b> height of 5, 5 and 6, 6 m made at the age of 5 year. No statiscaly significant effects were found of the <b>prune</b> treatments over DRBC, ARBC and CFG or interaction between stand density and <b>prune</b> height. The density and <b>prune</b> yield effects were independent from each other...|$|R
5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand <b>pruning</b> was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale <b>pruning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard <b>pruning</b> after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
