5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, <b>Proboscidae,</b> and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000227153600015 International audienceThe {{proposed}} Mbaere-Bodingue National Park (872 km(2)) {{is located}} in the southwestern part of the Central African Republic and consists of terra firma rain forests and seasonally flooded forests. We assessed the conservation significance of this site using data on wildlife and habitat conditions collected during a comprehensive primate survey. Scores were attributed to a system of variables and sub-variables to assess the conservation value of the proposed park at the national level. We identified a total of 10 diurnal primate species (eight monkeys, two apes) and flooded forests were considered as a key habitat for primates as they hold a greater number of species than terra firma forests. We recorded the presence of 12 mammal species listed under the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including four classified as Endangered (two Primates, one <b>Proboscidae</b> and one Insectivora). We found that the conservation value of the proposed park ranked second out of the 15 existing protected areas of the country. Primate abundance was found to be generally higher than in the nearby Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (the sole other park located in the same vegetation unit), in particular for the species occurring in flooded forests. This highlights the fact that the proposed Mbaere-Bodingue National Park is an important area for the conservation of species associated with flooded forests, a habitat which is currently underrepresented in the national protected area system. Poaching pressure was identified as the main current threat to the integrity of the proposed park...|$|E
