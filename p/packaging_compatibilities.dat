40|$|Several {{fabrication}} {{techniques for}} surface micromachined 3 -D structures {{have been developed}} for RF components. The fabrication techniques all have in common the use of epoxy patterning and subsequent metallization. Techniques and structures such as embedded conductors, epoxy-core conductors, a reverse-side exposure technique, a multi-exposure scheme, and inclined patterning are presented. The epoxy-core conductor technique makes it easy to fabricate high-aspect-ratio (10 - 20 : 1), tall (~ 1 mm) RF subelements as well as potentially very complex structures by taking advantage of advanced epoxy processes. To demonstrate feasibility and usefulness of the developed fabrication techniques for RF applications, two test vehicles are employed. One is a solenoid type RF inductor, and the other is a millimeter wave radiating structure such as a W-band quarter-wavelength monopole antenna. The embedded inductor approach provides mechanical robustness and <b>package</b> <b>compatibility</b> as well as good electrical performance. An inductor with a peak Q-factor of 21 and an inductance of 2. 6 nH at 4. 5 GHz has been fabricated on a silicon substrate. In addition, successful integration with a CMOS power amplifier has been demonstrated. A high-aspect-ratio inductor fabricated using epoxy core conductors shows a maximum Q-factor of 84 and an inductance of 1. 17 nH at 2. 6 GHz on a glass substrate with a height of 900 um and a single turn. Successful W-band monopole antenna fabrication is demonstrated. A monopole with a height of 800 um shows its radiating resonance at 85 GHz with a return loss of 16 dB. In addition to the epoxy-based devices, an advanced tunable ferroelectric device architecture is introduced. This architecture enables a low-loss conductor device; a reduced intermodulation distortion (IMD) device; and a compact tunable LC module. A single-finger capacitor having a low-loss conductor with an electrode gap of 1. 2 um and an electrode thickness of 2. 2 um has been fabricated using a reverse-side exposure technique, showing a tunability of 33 % at 10 V. It shows an improved Q-factor of 21. 5. Reduced IMD capacitors consist of wide RF gaps and narrowly spaced high resistivity electrodes with a gap of 2 um and a width of 2 um within the wide gap. A 14 um gap and a 20 um gap capacitor show improved IMD performance compared to a 4 um gap capacitor by 6 dB and 15 dB, respectively, while the tunability is approximately 21 % at 30 V for all three devices due to the narrowly spaced multi-pair high resistivity DC electrodes within the gap. Finally, a compact tunable LC module is implemented by forming the narrow gap capacitor in an inductor shape. The resonance frequency of this device is variable as a function of DC bias and a frequency tunability of 1. 1 %/V is achieved. The RF components developed in this thesis illustrate the usefulness of the application of micromachining technology to this application area, especially as frequencies of operation of RF systems continue to increase (and therefore wavelengths continue to shrink).

This new packaging topology has inherently unique properties that could make it an attractive alternative in some instances to traditional metal and ceramic hermetic packages. LCP is a near-hermetic material and its lamination process is at a relatively low temperature (285 C versus 800 C for ceramics). The active device is enclosed in a package consisting of several laminated C 0 P laser machined LCP superstrate layers. Measurements demonstrate that the LCP package and the 285 C packaging process have minimal effects on the {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} radio frequency (RF) performance.

40|$|Recently the {{consumer}} electronics market has experienced a major demand for autonomous, networked devices which can collect and process information independently from the operator. These “smart” devices are the constituents of a larger computing paradigm known as {{the internet of things}} which seeks to combine environmental sensing, communication and computing technologies into an intelligent, all-in-one platform. Driven by advances in the reduction in the size and power consumption of computing technology, this expansion of the smart device market has created a need for new sensors which can be integrated onto compact and robust chip level systems. The success of these devices leverages the scaling of existing sensor technologies to improve the footprint and efficiency of the overall electronics <b>package</b> while maintaining <b>compatibility</b> with current manufacturing processes. This size reduction of current sensor technology often presents immense engineering challenges which stem from the undesirable scaling of the physical phenomena upon which the sensor operates. The scaling of electrically controllable magnetic field devices is one such category which demands an alternative approach at small length scales to achieve practical efficiencies. In this work an approach is taken to design small scale electrically controlled magnetic field sensors which sharply deviates from the traditional Oersted field devices typical of macroscale systems. Strain mediated multiferroic composites, which couple the intrinsic magnetic and electric degrees of freedom inside the material through mechanical strains, are explored in the context of antennas and static magnetic field sensors. An analysis of the radiation efficiency of a multiferroic antenna is presented and steps are taken to realize a practical experimental device. Two types of magnetometers are studied which use multiferroic composites to improve the sensitivities and measurement accessibility of such devices. The results of this work clearly demonstrate the significant advantages offered by strain mediated multiferroic materials for use in chip-scale sensor technologies which have significant potential to advance the capabilities of integrated “smart” electronic systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit (IC) <b>packaging</b> electromagnetic <b>compatibility</b> (EMC) /signal integrity (SI) /power integrity (PI) {{problems have been}} broadly attested. But IC packaging electromagnetic interference (EMI) was seldom addressed. Because the electromagnetic emission from IC packagings becomes more critical as the data rate of digital system continues increasing. Its working mechanism and modeling technology are very important. In this thesis, EM emission behaviors of IC packaging are systematically studied for the first time. It was never seen from other literatures. The fundamental principles and properties of electromagnetic radiations caused by heat sinks, vias, traces, and pin maps in IC packaging structures are carefully investigated and modeled. Both theoretical analysis based on first principles and simulated results based on numerical full wave solvers are provided to find out critical impact factors to IC packaging EMI. This work establishes basic modeling components for comprehensive radiation studies. It directly benefits fundamental understandings and guideline development for the optimization of the packaging EMI reduction. Some measurement results are also included to support concluded characterizations and analysis. A summary for IC packaging EMI design rules is discussed in details to conclude the derived design guidelines. Second, a novel data pattern based electromagnetic superposition method is developed to model the IC packaging electromagnetic emission. It employs the equivalence principle to obtain the electromagnetic field response over a broad spectrum. Then it uses the linear property of the passive parasitic system to superimpose the contribution of different signals on the packaging. As a result, with certain pre-calculations, it is convenient to compute the electromagnetic emission efficiently from different signals with various signal pattern combinations, which benefits identifying the worst case scenario. The proposed method can be implemented between different tools for specific purposes. In addition, data reconstruction can be evaluated through the phase shift, and it benefits identifying the EMI of any pulse bit pattern. This work offers great convenience for the post-processing, and allows the flexibility of real digital pulse signals. It provides a basic modeling framework for comprehensive radiation studies for IC packaging and PCB EMI reductions. Third, the performance of IC interconnects has been stretched tremendously in recently years by high speed IC systems. Their EM emission and SI modelings {{have to consider the}} existence of I/O active devices, such as buffers and drivers. The I/O model is difficult to obtain due to the IP protection and limited information. We proposed to use the X-parameter to model the IC interconnect system. Based on the PHD formalism, X-parameter models provide an accurate frequency-domain method under large-signal operating points to characterize their nonlinear behaviors. Starting from modeling the CMOS inverter, the whole link modeling primarily based on X-parameter for the pulse digital signals was presented. I/O modeling can also be investigated by the proposed new method to understand the impedance effects at high speed serial links. It is the first complete examination of the X-parameter to IC interconnect SI analysis. The nonlinear I/O property represented by IBIS models is also investigated to model its impact to IC packaging EMI. Statistical analysis is proposed to provide insightful results on random bit patterns. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
