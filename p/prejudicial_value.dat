5000|$|The {{admissibility}} of {{hearsay evidence}} in criminal proceedings has been {{governed by the}} Criminal Justice Act 2003 which effectively replaced the common law regime and abolished all common law hearsay exceptions (except those preserved by s.118) including the dying declaration exception. An original statement made by a dead person may now be admissible under the statutory [...] "unavailability" [...] exception (ss.114 & 116) subject to the courts' judicial discretion (preserved by s.126) to exclude unrealiable evidence (i.e. the <b>prejudicial</b> <b>value</b> outweighs the probative value).|$|E
5000|$|O'Connor and Friday {{had argued}} that, by denying them the {{opportunity}} to raise the sexual harassment claims as a justification for the search, Patel had improperly granted what amounted to sua sponte partial summary judgement against them. Reinhardt countered that they had had adequate time to develop their defense and so the judge was [...] "procedurally free" [...] to do that. He turned to whether such a ruling was justified and not an abuse of discretion. Even if he resolved an issue of disputed fact in their favor and assumed that O'Connor and Friday knew of the sexual harassment allegations before they went into Ortega's office, the allegations themselves were vague, {{and one of them was}} ten years old. Thus, he continued, they did not create a reasonable suspicion that he was harassing residents, and even if they did they could not have reasonably established a likelihood that evidence supporting them would be found there. [...] "The search was, at best, a general and unbounded pursuit of anything that might tend to indicate any sort of malfeasance—a search that is almost by definition, unreasonable." [...] It had also been properly excluded since its <b>prejudicial</b> <b>value</b> outweighed its probative value.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 The Supreme Court of Canada was {{concerned}} with exclusionary discretion within the judicial system. In R. v. Wray the term “probative value” is used to explain that “judges in criminal cases {{do not have a}} discretion to exclude evidence because of how it was obtained.” [...] "The trial judge's discretion to exclude admissible evidence does not extend beyond his duty to ensure that the minds of the jury will not be prejudiced by evidence of little probative value, but of great prejudicial effect. Exclusion of evidence on the ground that, although its probative value was unquestionable, it was obtained by methods which the judge considers to be unfair, {{has nothing to do with}} his duty to secure a fair trial for the accused." [...] The sole discretion to exclude evidence is based on the weighing of <b>prejudicial</b> <b>value</b> and probative value. Where the material evidence is being considered for exclusion: [...] "...a judge must determine the value of the evidence based on reliability and the strength of the inference it led to, against the cost presented by such evidence, including things as diverse as the practicalities of its presentation, the fairness to the parties and to witnesses, and the potentially distorting effect the evidence can have on the outcome of the case." [...] Judges may face the need to weigh the probative value versus the prejudicial impact in nearly any case. A part of this is symbolized by a weighing scale and represents justice.|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{automaticity}} {{of social}} cognition and cultural priming suggests {{that exposure to}} national symbols {{that are associated with}} ideological concepts or values such as a nation 2 ̆ 7 s flag, can implicitly influence people 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour and attitudes. Recent studies conducted in the United States have shown that exposure to the American flag has increased levels of nationalism, social dominance orientation, prejudice towards outgroups and the likelihood of voting for conservative political parties. Although it is thought that many effects of national flag-priming are due to the activation of cultural values that are specific to each national context, no study has tested the possibility that these effects may generalise across national groups due to the activation of a general intergroup bias. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to replicate these effects in Australia and to explore this possibility. It was predicted that exposure to the Australian flag would result in increases in Islamophobia, modern racism and opposition to multiculturalism due to the activation of <b>prejudicial</b> <b>values</b> in Australian national culture; however it was also predicted that nationalism and social dominance orientation would decrease due to the activation of egalitarianism which is a key national value in Australia. Contrary to all predictions, exposure of the Australian flag had no effect on any of the dependent measures.

40|$|Claims of {{progress}} in our ethical or moral beliefs and practices—as well as claims to ethical or moral regression—are commonplace in American social and political conversation. Often, such commentary involves a lamenting {{of the decline of}} “traditional” values in contemporary society or alternatively a rejoicing in the ways that we appear to have overcome prior <b>prejudicial</b> <b>values.</b> In this dissertation, I am concerned with the notions {{of progress}} and improvement that underlie such commonsense judgments. At a minimum, ethical progress requires the idea that some values or practices are better than others and hence that replacing some beliefs or practices with others can be a genuine improvement. Taking inspiration from the ethical works of John Dewey, I sketch an account of evaluative progress that conceives of this sort of improvement in ethical beliefs or practices in terms of problem-resolving. On my view, resolving a problem involves both offering an adequate conception of the problem and finding a problem-solution which lives up to the world and to the values we reflectively endorse. On my account, resolving problems is {{not simply a matter of}} finding the best means to a fixed end; rather, I conceive of problem-resolving as a dynamic process in which ends themselves are typically in flux. The sort of “dynamic deliberation” I have in mind, then, goes beyond mere instrumental reasoning, by not only allowing us to recognize conflicts between ends or means to ends, but in also providing a way to rationally revise or reject ends. Finally, in order for this sort of problem-resolving to make good on the idea of genuine improvement or progress, the process of solving problems must involve some sense of objectivity. I offer a procedural account of objectivity that emphasizes the role of the world in constraining our inquiry, involves a naturalization of ethical epistemology, and allows for objective inquiry to be undertaken by an individual or a community...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{of public}} apathy in today's electoral democracies are commonplace (Neumann, 1986). For many social scientists, {{low voter turnout}} and similar {{indicators}} are simply reasons for believing that liberal democracies will always be governed by elites, though these may shift over time. Recently, a number of authors have argued against this view, and indeed against the presumption that representative institutions are the only form of participation workable in modern, large-scale polities. Characterizing representation {{as a form of}} "thin democracy," for example, Barber (1984) has called for a move towards a "strong democracy" based on new or revitalized forms of popular participation. His proposals stress two dimensions of such participation: the renewal of community level institutions of self-rule and the development of more frequent national referenda [...] My argument in this paper is that the theoretical grounds on which most discussion of these issues takes place are doubly deficient. In the first place, numerical size, while a central variable, does not adequately grasp the transformation in social organization wrought during the modern era. We need to address contrasting forms of social integration as well as sizes of population. I shall adopt Habermas's (1984) distinction of system world/system integration from lifeworld/social integration for this purpose. I will argue that the current efflorescence of populist politics (of both left and right) simultaneously is a response to the split between system world and lifeworld, and is limited in an often poorly recognized way by the implications of large scale system integration. Secondly, academic discussion of representative vs. direct democracy has tended to focus on mechanisms of decision-making at the expense of attention to public discourse and the educational functions of politics. Communitarian populists (though generally not plebiscitarians) are sensitive to this, and offer proposals for improved settings for local discourse and political language less <b>prejudicial</b> to the <b>values</b> of community and tradition (Barber, 1984; Bellah, et al., 1985; Evans and Boyte, 1986). Most, however, approach this predominantly in cultural rather than social structural terms, and underestimate the limits imposed by large scale system integration. Above all, both communitarian and plebiscitarian visions tend to neglect the structural difficulties which social change has put in the way of public discourse among people significantly different from each other. Changes in cities and community patterns on the one hand, and in communications systems on the other, make it likely that no extension of community level discourse or mobilization will constitute a public discourse {{at the level of the}} state. This is a limit to communitarian politics, but not an argument against them. At the same time, the issues presented here do argue against most proposals for extensive reliance on referenda...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore how {{breakthroughs}} in neuroscience, specifically neuroimaging, {{can be used}} to validate eyewitness testimony. Though the use of direct evidence is decreasing, due to findings of numerous wrongful convictions that were based on eyewitness testimonies, it is still an element of many criminal trials today. Cross-examination is used to validate eyewitness testimony because memories are fallible. Cross-examination can successfully determine if a witness is telling the truth, but it cannot determine if a memory is true. This has resulted in juries convicting individuals based on questionable eyewitness testimony. Neuroscientists have found that neuroimaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, {{can be used to}} distinguish between true and false memories and can determine if a witness is telling the truth. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys alike stand to benefit from using neuroimaging to validate eyewitness testimony that is brought into trial. Though the jury can use neuroimaging evidence to more accurately assess eyewitness testimony, as with all scientific data, the jury should be properly instructed when neuroimages are used, {{in order to reduce the}} <b>prejudicial</b> <b>value</b> of the evidence...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Mexican Revolution and on the {{opposition}} strategies followed by the opponents of the revolutionary regime {{who lived in the}} region known as Los Altos de Jalisco. In this particular region, the Catholic population, supported by the Clergy, was in constant conflict with the revolutionary government. It shows how the new revolutionary rationale clashed with the traditional moral codes and cultural patterns of the local population who attempted to protect their way of life and traditions. The government was backed up by the classical principles of sovereignty of the modern state, that is, from design of laws and decrees that since then had all the rule of legal norms, also backed up the strength of an army accustomed to fighting. The Church, for its part, based on their right moral standards and traditions, but also the Church hierarchy and in particular the clergy in general repeatedly mentioned that the Catholic Church for being a society was founded by God not only the right but the obligation to proclaim the gospel, for which required the most absolute freedom, because only thus could fulfill the mandate of divinity. Based on the foregoing, the revolutionary government and the Church hierarchy was given the task to coordinate their organizational and operational bases according to the elements and gave them grounds to justify their institutional objectives. The three elements that made possible the construction of the Alteña identity were: the relationship that the man had with the land, the relationship he had with his family, including of course its specific form of structure and organization, and finally, the relationship was with God, while recognizing the priests in a kind of envoy to the divinity who should respect and obey, because he was an emissary of the on earth. As far as the trial of alteños who opposed the Constitution, it <b>prejudicial</b> to its <b>values</b> and beliefs, they iban to design specific strategies to counter any act of government, because they believed that such laws were preventing them eternal salvation, what for them was a central part of its very existence. The actions carried out by the Catholics who were part of the conflict are a central part of the investigation, because they were very diverse and always found elements to curb the intentions of the State. The agricultural division was opposed to the idea that they were about all that material goods come from an act of generosity of divinity, then, if the land had already spread God: Who was the government to spread? The owners of large agricultural properties, which certainly did not have the dimensions of large estates northerners were armed and carried out punitive actions against the peasants who demanded they be handed an envelope ejido; course this will not only was in the region alteña, because in other latitudes owners also acted the same way. Another of the measures taken, especially by women, is that their husbands were in the house when they knew that he was seeking land, the reasoning was simple: if the government stripped of their property to landowners to give to farmers what was equated to a robbery and as such, was considered a sinful behavior, so they did not want them and their children live with someone who was permanently living in sin.
