A pressure compensator may be employed to displace the controlling elements. It includes a housing penetrated by a drive shaft rotating internal elements. The internal components slide along the longitudinal axis established by the drive shaft to vary the fluid displacement. The axially-moving elements include the drive shaft, inner gerotor element, <b>port</b> <b>plug,</b> thrust bearing and retainer sleeve. The drive shaft includes an internal flanged forming a piston.

40|$|The generic upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> (GUPP) {{structure}} in ITER is a 6 m long metal box which deploys diagnostic components into the vacuum vessel. This structure {{is commonly used}} for all the diagnostic upper ports. The final design of the GUPP structure, which has successfully passed the final design review in 2013, is described here. The diagnostic <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> is cantilevered to the vacuum vessel with a heavy payload at the front, so called the diagnostic first wall (DFW) and the diagnostic shield module (DSM). Most of electromagnetic (EM) load (∼ 80 %) occurs in DFW/DSM. Therefore, the mounting design to transfer the EM load from DFW/DSM to the GUPP structure is challenging, which should also comply with thermal expansion and tolerance for assembly and manufacturing. Another key design parameter to be considered is {{the gap between the}} <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> and the vacuum vessel port. The gap should be large enough to accommodate the remote handling of the heavy <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> (max. 25 t), the structural deflection due to external loads and machine assembly tolerance. At the same time, the gap should be minimized to stop the neutron streaming according to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. With these design constraints, the GUPP structure should also provide space for diagnostic integration as much as possible. This requirement has led to the single wall structure having the gun-drilled water channels inside the structure. Furthermore, intensive efforts have been made on the manufacturing study including material selection, manufacturing codes and French regulation related to nuclear equipment and safety. All these main design and manufacturing aspects are discussed in this paper, including requirements, interfaces, loads and structural assessment and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The upper port of the ITER {{vacuum vessel}} {{contains}} the core charge exchange spectroscopy (cCXRS) <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> diagnostic system.

EM forces on main plug components have been calculated and main integral mechanical moments are represented. Two external contracts on independent global EM models were launched and are being successfully benchmarked against the FZJ model. In support of the cCXRS design its components are structurally analyzed under EM loading. Four different approaches to calculate EM loads for detailed structural models have been used and are described. One of them, called an "express" analysis, allows a prompt choice between different design solutions. The "air" elements, which should fill gaps between assembled conducting parts in the electromagnetic FE models, are neglected in this approach. This may save up to 90 % of time for building and calculating complex EM models. Applicability and use of this method for small critical plug components like a fast shutter are demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2010 FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH-EURATOM-FZJ.

40|$|Four of the 16 ITER upper <b>port</b> <b>plugs</b> will {{be devoted}} to {{electron}} cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) {{in order to control}} magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities [1]. In order to achieve the stabilisation of the neoclassical tearing modes (NTM) and sawtooth oscillation, a deposition of a very localized and peaked current density profile over a broad poloidal steering range is required. In the present optical configuration eight 2 MW mm-wave beams enter each of the four upper launchers (UL) through waveguides into the vacuum vessel. Each beam line comprises consecutive corrugated waveguide sections with two mitre bends, orientating the poloidal and toroidal directions and three sections of quasi-optical transmission [3]. The beam waist locations and beam shaping properties in free space propagation are defined by two additional mirrors, the first being a static focusing mirror and the second a plane poloidally steerable mirror. Each mirror reflects a group of four mm-wave beams. The three types of UL mirrors (mitre bend, focusing and steering) absorb heat generated essentially by three sources: the ohmic loss of the RF beam reflected at the mirror surfaces and the nuclear and thermal radiation coming from the plasma. While the average heat load is within reasonable engineering limits, three elements condition the actual mirror design, the peak ohmic heat load (Gaussian or Bessel type heat deposition profiles), the electromagnetic forces generated in vertical disruption events (VDE), and the ITER cooling water requirements. This paper provides an overview of the different upper port-plug mirror designs and cooling schemes and an outlook on the prototype manufacturing activities and the future test program.

40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the equatorial launcher. The front steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a shutter valve, a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the plug closure plate. These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror. The millimeter wave system is integrated into a specifically optimized upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> providing structural stability to withstand plasma disruption forces and the high heat load from the plasma side with a dedicated blanket shield module. A recent update in the ITER interface definition has resulted in the recession of the upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> first wall panels, which is now integrated into the design.

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{of developing the}} conceptual design of the ECH Upper Launcher system for MHD control in the ITER plasmas has been tackled by team of European Associations together with the European Domestic Agency ("F 4 E"). The launcher system has to meet the following requirements: (a) a mm-wave system extending from the interface to the transmission line up to the target absorption zone in the plasma and performing as an intelligent antenna; (b) a structural system integrating the mm-wave system and ensuring sufficient thermal and nuclear shielding; (C) <b>port</b> <b>Plug</b> remote handling and testing capability ensuring high <b>Port</b> <b>plug</b> system availability. The paper describes the reference launcher design. The mm-wave system is composed of waveguide and quasi-optical sections with a front steering system. An automated feedback control system is developed as a concept based on an assimilation procedure between predicted and diagnosed absorption location. The structural system consists of the blanket shield module, the <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> frame, and the internal shield for appropriate neutron shielding towards the launcher back-end. The specific advantages of a double walled structure are discussed with respect to adequate baking, to rigidity towards launcher deflection under plasma-generated loads and to removal of thermal loads, including nuclear ones. Basic Studies of remote handling (RH) to validate design development are initiated using a virtual reality simulation backed by experimental validation, for which a launcher handling test facility (LHT) is set LIP as a full scale experimental site allowing furthermore thermohydraulic studies with ITER blanket water parameters.

40|$|Transient {{electromagnetic}} (EM) {{analysis is}} presented focusing on main {{components of the}} ITER core charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (cCXRS) <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> developed by Forschungszentrum Julich (F 2 J), ITER-NL and UKAEA(CCFE) in 2009. The cCXRS primary function is to transfer {{the light in the}} visible part of spectra emitted by interaction of the plasma ions with a diagnostic neutral beam. The TYPHOON software package has been used for the EM analysis. The code is dedicated for simulation of transient electromagnetic processes using a shell approach in the integral-differential formulation to represent conducting structures with a set of multi-connected shells arbitrary located in a space. The advantage of the shell approach is a higher flexibility in modelling detailed structures as compared with widely used 3 D models. On the other hand, the shell approach requires ultimate care in modelling relatively thick structures. These issues are discussed in the paper. Two vertical displacement events (VDE) which seem to result in the largest EM loads on the main cCXRS components have been agreed with FZJ and simulated. Transient electromagnetic processes caused by different sources have been considered separately, and then superimposed to obtain the total solution. Three types of transient processes for each type of VDE have been analyzed: (1) due to variations of a toroidal plasma current, shape and position and due to variations of poloidal field coils (PFC) and central solenoid (CS) currents, (2) due to variations of the Halo current and (3) due to variations of a toroidal magnetic flux of plasma. The analysis covers two options for electrical contact between the main shell (MS) of the <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> and the blanket shield module (BSM).

40|$|Already in {{the early}} phase of a design for ITER, the {{maintenance}} aspects {{should be taken into}} account, since they might have serious implications. This paper presents the arguments in support of the case for the maintainability of the design, notably if this maintenance is to be performed by advanced remote methods. This structure is compliant to the evolving maintenance strategy of ITER. Initial results of a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and a development risk analysis for the ITER upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> # 3, housing the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic, are employed for the definition of the maintenance strategy. The CXRS upper <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> is essentially an optical system which transfers visible light from the plasma into a fiber bundle. The most critical component in this path is the first mirror (M 1) whose reflectivity degrades during operation due to deposition and/or erosion dominated effects. Amongst other measures to mitigate these effects, the strategy is to allow for a replacement of this mirror. Therefore it is mounted on a retractable central tube. The main purpose of this tube is to make frequent replacements possible without hindering operation. The maintenance method in terms of time, geometry and spare part policy has a large impact on cost of the system and time usage in the hot cell. Replacement of the tube under vacuum and magnetic field seems infeasible due to the operational risk involved. The preferred solution is to have a spare tube available which is replaced in parallel with other maintenance operations on the vessel, as to avoid any interference in the hot cell with the shutdown scheduling. This avoids having to refurbish a full <b>port</b> <b>plug</b> and also allows for a more frequent replacement of M 1, as we can replace the mirror anytime the vacuum vessel is vented, estimated to be once a year.
