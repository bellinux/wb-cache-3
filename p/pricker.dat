2500|$|Another camp {{believes}} that the witches' mark is a gendered aspect of the witch-hunts. In Anne Barstow's book, Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts, the witches' mark is viewed from a feminist perspective. Barstow sees the witch hunts of Europe {{as an attempt to}} control women, and the witches' mark as an excuse to control women's bodies through violence and sadism. The searching of women's bodies for the witches' mark gives insight into the reality of a woman's position during this time: [...] "when 'a personable and good-like woman' was defended by one of the local gentry the <b>pricker</b> argued that, having been accused, she must be tried anyway". Barstow views the violent and sexual nature of the witches' mark examinations in the witch trials to be further evidence that the witch-hunts were, in fact, [...] "women-hunts".|$|E
2500|$|The matchlock firing {{mechanism}} {{became a}} common {{term for the}} arquebus after it {{was added to the}} firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot <b>pricker</b> to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle. While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming general Qi Jiguang composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: [...] "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire." [...] Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.|$|E

60|$|Gun-pricker.--I am indebted for the {{following}} plan, both for clearing the touchhole, and also for the rather awkward operation of pricking down fresh gunpowder into it, to an old sportsman in the Orkney Island of Sanday. He takes a quill, and cuts off a broad ring from the large end of it; this is pushed over the small end of the quill, and lies securely there. Next, he cuts a wooden plug to fit the quill; into the plug, the <b>pricker</b> is fixed.|$|E

You mind {{last year when he}} came down to Malwood, with his inner marshal and his outer marshal, his justiciar, his seneschal, and his four and twenty guardsmen. One noontide I was by Franklin Swinton's gate, when up he rides with a yeoman <b>pricker</b> at his heels. 'Ouvre,' he cried, 'ouvre,' or some such word, making signs for me to open the gate; and then 'Merci,' as though he were adrad of me. And you talk of an English king?" ...|$|E

Tattoo needles can be {{referred}} to as peshnya (ice pick), pchyolka (bee), shpora (spur), or shilo (sting), while the tattoo gun {{can be referred to}} as mashinka (little machine) or bormashina (dentist's drill), and the ink is referred to as either mazut (fuel oil) or gryaz (dirt). The tattoos themselves were referred to as a reklama (advertising), regalka (regalia), kleimo (brand), or rospis (painting).|$|R
6000|$|I {{frequently}} make {{statistical records}} {{of form and}} feature, in the streets or in company, without exciting attention, {{by means of a}} fine <b>pricker</b> and a piece of paper. The <b>pricker</b> is a converted silver pencil-case, with the usual sliding piece; it is a very small one, and is attached to my watch chain. The pencil part has been taken out and replaced by a fine short needle, the open mouth of the case is covered with a hemispherical cap having a hole in the centre, and the adjustments are such that when the slide is pushed forward as far as it can go, the needle projects no more than one-tenth of an inch. If I then press it upon a piece of paper, held against the ball of my thumb, the paper is indelibly perforated with a fine hole, and the thumb is not wounded. The perforations will not be found to run into one another unless they are very numerous, and if they happen to do so now and then, it is of little consequence in a statistical inquiry. The holes are easily counted at leisure, by holding the paper against the light, and any scrap of paper will serve the purpose. It will be found that the majority of inquiries take the form of [...] "more," [...] "equal to," [...] or [...] "less," [...] so I arrange the paper in a way to present three distinct compartments to the <b>pricker,</b> and to permit of its being held in the correct position and used by the sense of touch alone. I do so by tearing the paper into the form of a cross--that is, maimed in one of its arms--and hold it by the maimed part between the thumb and finger, the head of the cross pointing upward. The head of the cross receives the pricks referring to [...] "more"; the solitary arm that is not maimed, those meaning [...] "the same"; the long foot of the cross those meaning [...] "less." [...] It is well to write the subject of the measurement on the paper before beginning to use it, then more than one set of records can be kept in the pocket at the same time, and be severally added to as occasion serves, without fear of mistaking one for the other.|$|E
6000|$|The {{whole affair}} goes safely in the pocket; the quill {{acting as a}} sheath to the sharp <b>pricker.</b> Now, when powder has to be pricked down the nipple, the [...] "broad ring" [...] is slipped off the quill {{and put on the}} nipple, which it fits; powder is poured into it, and the {{required}} operation is easily completed. This little contrivance, which is so simple and Light, lasts for months, and is perfectly effective. I have tried metal holders, but I much prefer the simple quill, on account of its elasticity and lightness. A little binding with waxed thread, may be put on, as shown in the sketch, to prevent the quill from splitting.|$|E
6000|$|Neither boy doubted a moment. Antony had the entree to the {{presence}} chamber, where on this festival night the Earl and Countess were sure {{to be with the}} Queen. He went straightway thither, and trained as he was in the usages of the place, told his business to the Earl, who was seated near the Queen. Lord Shrewsbury took the petition from him, glanced it over, and asked, [...] "Who knew the Guy Norman who sent it?" [...] Frank Talbot answered for him, that he was a yeoman <b>pricker,</b> and the Earl permitted the paper to be carried to Mary, watching her carefully as she read it, when Antony had presented it on one knee.|$|E
60|$|Just then a queer {{creature}} {{dropped from}} a tree into the ring and began moving slowly toward them. It was flat in shape, like a big turtle; only it hadn't a turtle's hard shell. Instead, its body was covered with sharp <b>prickers,</b> like rose thorns, and it had two small red eyes that looked cruel and wicked. The children could not see how many legs it had, but {{they must have been}} very short, because the creature moved so slowly over the ground.|$|R
6000|$|But the Wizard was not {{listening}} to her. He quickly removed the blankets {{from the back of}} the Sawhorse and spread one of them upon the thistles, just next the grass. The thick cloth rendered the <b>prickers</b> harmless, so the Wizard walked over this first blanket and spread the second one farther on, in the direction of the phantom city. [...] "These blankets," [...] said he, [...] "are for the Lion and the Mule to walk upon. The Sawhorse and the Woozy can walk on the thistles." ...|$|R
60|$|Oswald {{had been}} brought up to regard forays and attacks as {{ordinary}} incidents of life.

60|$|In the midst, Frank Talbot {{returned}} with the tidings that the <b>pricker</b> Guy Norman {{was nowhere to be}} found. He had last been seen by his comrades about the time that Captain Richard had returned to the Manor-house. Probably he had taken alarm on seeing him come back at that unusual hour, and had gone to carry the warning to his supposed aunt. This last intelligence made the Earl decide on going down at once to Bridgefield to examine young Babington before there was time to miss his presence at the lodge, or to hold any communication with him. Frank caused horses to be brought round, and the Earl rode down with Richard by a shaded alley in an ordinary cloak and hat.|$|E

But those in the castle fight bravely. There is a woman, two women, who stand upon the walls, and give heart to the men-at-arms. They shower down arrows, darts and great stones. Ah! they have struck down the tall leader, and the others give back. The mist thickens and I can see no more." ...|$|E
