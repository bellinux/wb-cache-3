5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had <b>plateaued.</b> Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing {{at the time of its}} death.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters, whose {{numbers were}} once {{estimated}} at 150,000–300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, {{and the world}} population fell to 1,000–2,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species now occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have <b>plateaued</b> at depressed levels. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Richard Arkwright junior was {{uninterested in}} the cotton business, and {{after the death of}} his father the Arkwright family ceased to invest in the industry. The Strutt family {{continued}} to invest, fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper. They continued building mills into the 1810s, and by 1833 their business employed 2,000people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley. As Arkwright had done at Cromford, the Strutts provided housing for their employees. Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills, so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self-sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford. The Strutts provided education, and in 1817 650 and 300children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively. Compared with Cromford, whose population had <b>plateaued</b> at around 1,200 in the early 19th century, the population of Belper rose from 4,500 in 1801 to 7,890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business. Darley Abbey also expanded as a worker's settlement although it had no market place, so providing food for the inhabitants was problematic. The settlement doubled in size between 1788 and 1801, and between 1801 and 1831 the population increased from 615 to 1,170 with the addition of much worker's housing. A Sunday School for 80children was established in one of the mills and a church and school were built in 1819 and 1826 respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Knowledge workers {{retention}} {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} source of entrepreneurial success. Thus, we argue that the sustainability of such knowledge-based success depends on the effective and efficient management of knowledge workers <b>plateauing</b> and turnover. This study therefore sought to examine why knowledge workers experience career <b>plateauing</b> and show intention to quit, and the relationship between entrepreneurial success and the type of plateauing/turnover. The data generated were analysed using Z-score and regression analysis. It was found that reduced organizational hierarchies, reduced promotion opportunities, and fewer competitive positions are the factors that influence <b>plateauing,</b> while entrepreneurial success has a negative relationship with the significant types of <b>plateauing.</b> Also, lack of recognition/competitive reward system, inadequate training/development opportunities, and managerial/leadership style are the factors that influence turnover, while a negative relationship was found to exist between entrepreneurial success and the significant types of turnover. It is therefore pertinent for managers to assess and understand the factors influencing <b>plateauing</b> and turnover, and the types of <b>plateauing</b> and turnover that are prevalent in their enterprises. This knowledge will certainly help to minimize the effects of the factors and types of <b>plateauing</b> / turnover on entrepreneurial success.

The particular case of scholars working in French universities provides an example. This study demonstrates that career <b>plateauing</b> is a real feeling experienced by French scholars, and can negatively impact their behavior. Regression analyses results (sample N = 2, 028) indicate that career <b>plateauing</b> negatively impacts job satisfaction. Indeed, the more scholars believe they have little or no opportunity for future advancement, the lower their job satisfaction. Moreover, career <b>plateauing</b> impacts commitment. The more scholars feel they have reached a plateau, the lower their commitment to their university and job. Career <b>plateauing</b> affects the affective and normative dimension of commitment more than the continuance dimension, and the results for the latter dimension are counterintuitive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to empirically {{investigate}} the relationship between career <b>plateauing</b> and mentoring. First, the relationship between career <b>plateauing</b> and work-related attitudes was investigated. Next, the relationship between mentoring experience and work-related attitudes was examined. Finally, both experience as a mentor and mentoring provided were examined as moderators between career <b>plateauing</b> and work-related attitudes. Three hundred and six government employees located in the southeastern United States completed surveys (50. 08 % response rate). Of those, 110 reported mentor experience and 196 reported no mentor experience. In general, results provided support for the relationship between job content and hierarchical <b>plateauing</b> and negative work-related attitudes. No support was found for the relationship between job tenure and work-related attitudes. Support was found for the relationship between mentoring experience and positive work-related attitudes. With the exception of contextual performance, the relationship between mentoring provided and work-related attitudes was not supported. Little support was found for the interaction between mentor experience and <b>plateauing,</b> suggesting that mentoring others may not alleviate the negative effects of career <b>plateauing.</b> Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Analysis of {{the data}} {{collected}} in sets one through four showed that the males' reproductive success, estimated {{as the number of}} sired offspring, increased at a steady rate until a total of three mates were reached. It {{is important to note that}} Bateman kept the sex ratio of males to females completely even throughout his trials. But after surpassing three mates, male reproductive success began to fall. Female reproductive success also increased with number of mates, but much more gradually than that of the males. The second series of data collected in sets five and six illustrated a dramatically different outcome. Male reproductive success increased at a steady and steep rate, never dropping. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, <b>plateaued</b> after a single mate. Bateman focused mainly on the second series of data when discussing his results. His main conclusion was that the reproductive success of females does not increase with an influx of mates, as one fit mate was enough to successfully complete fertilization.

The tour had its effect, and Sherman's hopes were high. His old friend, ex-President Hayes, thought him the best candidate. The early favorite for the nomination was again Blaine, but after Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination, his supporters divided among other candidates, including Sherman. With no clear consensus going into the 1888 convention, delegates divided their support among an unusual number of favorite sons. Daniel H. Hastings of Pennsylvania placed Sherman's name in nomination, seconded by Foraker (who was, by then, Governor of Ohio). Sherman, at last, had a unified Ohio delegation behind him and led on the first ballot with 229 votes—more than double his nearest competitor, but well short of the 416 needed for nomination. Walter Q. Gresham of Indiana was in second place with 111, followed by Russell A. Alger of Michigan with 84.

A loyal Republican, Sherman gave speeches for Harrison in Ohio and Indiana and was pleased with his victory over Cleveland that November.
