5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of COPD is tobacco smoke, with {{occupational}} exposure and pollution from indoor fires being significant causes in some countries. Typically these exposures must occur over several decades before symptoms develop. A person's genetic makeup also affects the risk.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet and {{cigarette}} smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone. A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The Kennel Club, the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; however, the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects and systems marked the official project start for a company-wide engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which was specifically established for this purpose. As Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation of Crystal Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

5|$|He {{wrote one}} of the first {{scientific}} treatises in the field of American sociology, and he published three autobiographies, each of which contains insightful essays on sociology, politics and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal The Crisis, he published many influential pieces. DuBois believed that capitalism was a <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated nuclear disarmament. The United States' Civil Rights Act, embodying many of the reforms for which DuBois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams {{had little to do}} with the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously {{delivered}} unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant {{was found on}} the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E

5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing {{billions of dollars}} of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of lead's {{toxicity}} is its {{interference with}} a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of {{vibrations}} in {{a properly}} functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to damp vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E

5|$|There {{are a few}} ocular {{conditions}} to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia. Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. In a health {{survey conducted by the}} Kennel Club (UK), the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age. The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months, which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds.|$|E
5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause {{of this is the}} chilling of the young.|$|E

5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the <b>primary</b> <b>cause</b> of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
