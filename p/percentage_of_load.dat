Typical percentage among owner-operators pulling flatbed trailers is between 85-90 percent of line haul being paid to the driver. Additionally the driver may receive 100 percent of fuel surcharges and fees for extra pickups or drops or for tarping loads. It creates strong incentives for drivers for agreeing to pull especially difficult loads; i.e. pieces that are especially heavy or large, that require tarping, pieces that are being shipped or received along treacherous routes far from the interstates.

Several legislative bills have been proposed to institute a federal standard limit on net metering. They range from H.R. 729, which sets a net metering cap at 2% of forecasted aggregate customer peak demand, to H.R. 1945 which has no aggregate cap, but does limit residential users to 10 kW, a low limit compared to many states, such as New Mexico, with an 80,000 kW limit, or states such as Arizona, Colorado, New Jersey, and Ohio which limit as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) so that the process separation (separate oil and water/sludge) becomes much easier {{and the quality of}} crude palm oil can be reliably monitored. Palm oils industry {{is one of the largest}} production; producer and exporter of palm oil and palm oil products countries in the world. Oil Palm was first introduced to Malaysia in year 1875 as an ornamental plant. Malaysia has the most ideal climate conditions for growing oil palm. The growth of the palm oil industry in Malaysia has been phenomenal over the last 4 decades. Nevertheless, palm oil industry is one of the most pollution generating agro industries in Malaysia. One of the major problems arises from the oil palm fruit processing is the large amount of wastes generated during the processes. There are two main wastes resulted from operation of a Palm Oil Mill, namely solid waste and liquid waste. The solid waste may consist of palm Kernel shells, mesocorp fibers and empty fruit bunches. The liquid waste generated from extraction of palm oil of a wet process comes mainly from oil mom after separator or decanter. There is no monitoring system that is currently available in our local palm oil mill to visualize the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> waste present inside the vessel. Therefore, the system is aimed to become an instrument to support the local and foreign palm oil mills to efficiently control in monitoring the quality of crude palm oil flow in the conveying pipeline during extraction of palm oil mill process. The monitoring system is able to visualize the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> waste present inside the vessel so that the data can be used to design better process equipment in mill process or to control certain processes in order to maximize the quality of cmde palm oil and the POME treatment process can be improved...|$|E

Experience with such sensors has shown there can be inaccuracies in how the sensor perceives applied load, depending on the material stiffnesses between which it is compressed experimentally, versus in calibration. A study was undertaken to quantify the relationship between load perception of one such sensor design (Tekscan) and the stiffness of the materials between which it is compressed. A three-dimensional finite element model of a 3 × 3 sensel portion of the sensing matrix was formulated, along {{with a layer of}} compression test material {{on each side of the}} sensor. The elastic modulus of the test material was varied across the range representative of cartilage (12 MPa) to hard plastic (10 GPa). Using the computed contact pressure results between contacting surfaces of the sensor layers, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> passing through the active conductor intersections was determined. The results revealed that with increase of the elastic modulus of the material between which the sensor was compressed, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> on the active conductor intersections increased monotonically. The highest sensitivity of perceived loading to test material modulus (0. 1 %/MPa) was seen at the low end of the modulus range.
