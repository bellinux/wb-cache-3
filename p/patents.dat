This writing had statement of problems : (1) From the Law No. 14 / 2001 about <b>patent</b> perception, should the foreign <b>patent</b> be listed according to the priority rights ? (2) Had the Law No. 14 / 2001 about <b>patent</b> given law {{protection to}} the foreign <b>patent</b> in Indonesia ? The writer used juridical-normative research method, which {{paid attention to the}} law and existing norm in law form. Data sources were primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected from <b>Patent</b> Law and several related rule to the thesis focus and secondary data from primary law, like books, magazine, paper, Internet, thesis. This final assignment aimed to find out the rights of foreign <b>patent</b> according Law which should be listed according to the priority rights, to find out the application of foreign <b>patent</b> listed in Indonesia. According to data analysis, there could be concluded that Law protection for foreign <b>patent</b> in this term is foreign <b>patent</b> which was listed by priority rights according to section 27 and 28 <b>Patent</b> Law. The <b>patent</b> listed by priority rights didn’t mean that the <b>patent</b> would be prior to be protected. Priority mean that the case which harmed the <b>patent</b> holder in material, like selling, renting or another action used <b>patent</b> without any permission or gave royalty to the legal <b>patent</b> holder, so that it caused loss to the <b>patent</b> holder. Just as happened in foreign <b>patent</b> case owed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd with <b>Patent</b> applicant No. 000483 in date 4 October 1991, titled" Micro Capsule which able to release uterus in slow way”. This priority application has been rejected by Directorate General of <b>Patent</b> since it had shortage in <b>patent,</b> so that in law, the <b>patent</b> application should be rejected since it didn’t fulfill the rule of invention in the section 1, 2, 3, and 5 <b>patent</b> Law. Foreign <b>patent</b> law was similar with Indonesia <b>Patent.</b> The differences only if the foreign <b>patent</b> in a country should use priority rights as stated in section 4 Paris Convention while in Indonesia <b>Patent</b> Law itself has been arranged in sectio 27 and 28 <b>patent</b> Law. The Law protection to foreign law in Indonesia existed when there was imitation of foreign law technology which had been listed, so there could be stated a <b>patent</b> cancellation. When there was violation which caused loss for foreign <b>patent</b> holder, there could be a civil or criminal case according to the place where the violation existed (locus delicti) Foreign <b>patent</b> solution could be done by two ways, <b>patent</b> holder could choose court (litigation) or outside court (non-litigation). Solution through court was done by accusation in Civil Law, while outside law conclusion could be done through arbitrage, mediation, and private organization. The latest conclusion of this law writing was foreign <b>patent</b> should be listed with priority rights, according to section 27 and 28 <b>patent</b> law and the protection of foreign <b>patent</b> is similar with Indonesia <b>patent</b> when there was technology plagiarism to foreign <b>patent</b> listed, there could be a <b>patent</b> cancellation.
