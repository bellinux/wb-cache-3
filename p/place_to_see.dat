5|$|The {{number of}} ducks, geese and swans is {{greatest}} in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes {{with a rare}} lesser white-fronted goose amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, {{and it is a}} good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the elusive water rail.|$|E
5|$|The only {{single use}} cinema in Street was closed down and {{converted}} into a nightclub in the 1990s. Strode Theatre, linked to the Crispin School and Strode College complex, is now the only <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> films, exhibitions and live performances. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 the theatre was expanded with a new foyer, bar and box office along with improved rehearsal space and stage access, {{at a cost of}} £750,000 by the Steel, Coleman Davis partnership who received an award for the design. The expansion was funded by the Arts Council England.|$|E

5|$|In 1719, Caroline of Ansbach and her husband, {{the future}} George II of Great Britain, bought Richmond Lodge {{as a country}} residence. This {{building}} had first been built as a hunting lodge for James I in 1619 and had also been occupied by William III. As shown in a map of 1734, Richmond Park and Richmond Gardens then formed a single unit – the latter was merged with Kew Gardens by George III in the early 1800s. In 1736 the Queen's Ride was cut through existing woodland to create a grand avenue through the park and Bog Gate or Queen's Gate was opened as a private entrance for Caroline to enter the park on her journeys between White Lodge and Richmond Lodge. The same map shows Pen Ponds, a lake divided in two by a causeway, dug in 1746 and initially {{referred to as the}} Canals, which is now a good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> water birds. Richmond Lodge fell out of use on Caroline's death in 1737 but was brought back into use by her grandson George III as his summer residence from 1764 to 1772, when he switched his summer residence to Kew Palace and had Richmond Lodge demolished.|$|E

25|$|Adjacent to the Guindy National Park, the IIT campus {{has a few}} {{patches of}} well-wooded forest which are very good for birdwatching.

Over 100 resident and migrant bird species have been recorded here. Prakriti, a wildlife club run by the students, staff and residents of IIT takes part in conservation activities and helps protect the biodiversity in campus.|$|E
25|$|Kabuki {{became a}} {{common form of}} {{entertainment}} in the ukiyo, or Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. A diverse crowd gathered under one roof, something that happened nowhere else in the city. Kabuki theaters were a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and be seen as they featured the latest fashion trends and current events. The stage provided good entertainment with exciting new music, patterns, clothing, and famous actors. Performances went from morning until sunset. The teahouses surrounding or connected to the theater provided meals, refreshments, and good company. The area around the theatres was lush with shops selling kabuki souvenirs. Kabuki, in a sense, initiated pop culture in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: Òpira dî pupi) is a {{marionette}} theatrical {{representation of}} Frankish romantic poems {{such as the}} Song of Roland or Orlando furioso {{that is one of}} the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorî (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge {{is also a}} good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> other wildlife and plant species. [...] Among the species found there are Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). [...] The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid bat, peregrine falcon, spotted bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. There are also 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.|$|E
2500|$|As the 1960s loomed the Majestic {{began to}} {{establish}} {{itself as the}} <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> art house and foreign films, with mainstream fare rounding out their bookings. After police heard complaints about a movie trailer that showed [...] "objectionable" [...] material, the Majestic previewed Ingmar Bergman's The Silence for a group headed by the Madison chief of police, but they declined to censor the film. In 1965, the Majestic finished a 14-week run of My Fair Lady, the longest run for any film in a Madison theater at that time. But as social mores and attitudes began to change during the late 1960s, RKO-Stanley-Warner began booking soft-core [...] "skin flicks" [...] that were light on art and heavy on nudity. When criticized for doing so, manager Finkler replied that the local audience for family movies had dried up.|$|E
