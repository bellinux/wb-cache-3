We develop a performance model based on Petri nets that considers the missing-read cost, write-propagation cost and the periodic maintenance cost with the objective to identify optimal periodic maintenance intervals to minimize the overall cost. The analysis results show that the overall cost is high when the user arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work against each other and is low otherwise. In all cases, there exists an optimal periodic maintenance interval that would yield the minimum cost. Further, the optimal periodic maintenance interval increases as the arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work in harmony...|$|E

40|$|User {{costs of}} {{different}} maintenance actions {{need to be}} assessed in road maintenance {{as well as the}} maintenance costs. The vehicle operating cost (VOC) and the travel delay cost are two major components of the user costs associated with road maintenance actions. This article simplifies the general calculation models of these two user cost components and develops a multiobjective Markov-based model to minimize both maintenance cost and user cost subject to a number of constraints including the average annual budget limit and the performance requirement. The road deterioration process is modeled as a discrete-time Markov process, the states of road performance are defined in terms of the road roughness, and the state transition probabilities are estimated considering the effects of deterioration and maintenance actions. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed road maintenance optimization model. The results show that the optimal road maintenance plan obtained from the model is practical to implement and is cost-effective compared with the <b>periodical</b> road <b>maintenance</b> plan. The results also indicate that the maintenance cost and the user cost are competitive. When maintenance works are carried out more frequently, the life-cycle maintenance costs will increase while the life-cycle user costs will decrease. This is because the VOC contributes the most amount of the user cost and its change has a contrary trend to the change of the maintenance cost over time...|$|R

By analyzing differences and similarities {{it will be possible to}} face some topics as: assessment of conservation/risk condition and effectiveness of previous intervention, preventive and planned conservation plan; interaction with the surrounding environment. An archaeological site demands a conservation project, designed before starting the excavation, conservation activities during the digging and a conservation plan in a long run vision, in order to manage the maintenance and also the use, which is necessary for the enhancement of the site. The case study is the hypogeum structure of the Lavello Church (Calolziocorte, Italy) : the recent restoration kept on sight the ruins under the floor by means of glass panels in the paving. The need to display the recently discovered ruins of two previous buildings led to design the paving and its supporting structure with the aim to ensure the visibility of the archaeological remains for scholars and visitors.

40|$|Abstract—Stream {{processing}} {{has become}} increasingly important as many emerging applications call for continuous real-time processing over data streams, such as voice-over-IP telephony, security surveillance, and sensor data analysis. In this paper, we propose a composable stream processing system for cooperative peer-to-peer environments. The system can dynamically select and compose stream processing elements located on different peers into user desired applications. We investigate multiple alternative approaches to composing stream applications: 1) global-state-based centralized versus local-state-based distributed algorithms for initially composing stream applications at setup phase. The centralized algorithm performs <b>periodical</b> global state <b>maintenance</b> while the distributed algorithm performs on-demand state collection. 2) Reactive versus proactive failure recovery schemes for maintaining composed stream applications during runtime. The reactive failure recovery algorithm dynamically recomposes a new stream application upon failures while the proactive approach maintains a number of backup compositions for failure recovery. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations to study the properties of different approaches. Our study illustrates the performance and overhead trade-offs among different design alternatives, which can provide important guidance for selecting proper algorithms to compose stream applications in cooperative peer-to-peer environments.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{maintenance}} activities in civil engineering considering the used case Bjørnafjorden {{as a part of}} Ferry Free E 39 project. Civil engineering {{is one of the oldest}} sectors in engineering, and its importance has been increasing in the last decades because of the advancement in modern civilization. Furthermore, maintenance activities have always been an integral part of civil industries. Especially in the large scale projects like Bjørnafjorden, the role of maintenance will be more crucial and vital due to the fact that even a slight fault in a small component can lead to a loss of millions of money. Based on this purpose, first classical and Risk-Based Maintenance (RBM) methods are presented as the maintenance strategies that are used in civil engineering. Classical maintenance strategies, which are preventive-policy based, are categorized as on-demand and <b>periodical</b> types. The <b>maintenance</b> intervals used in these strategies are claimed based on the reliability-based method considering the influencing factors on the structures. Furthermore, Risk-Based Maintenance (RBM) method, as another maintenance strategy, assesses the maintenance intervals considering the level of risks in the structures. The risk value in this method can be claimed based on the experts judgments and condition assessment data. Further, Bjørnafjorden is a part of Ferry Free E 39 project. The unique characteristics of this fjord make this project very huge. SVV (Statens Vegvesen) suggested three concepts as the possible solutions to this project: 1) Floating bridge (FB), 2) suspension bridge supported by tension leg platform (TLP), and 3) submerged floating tunnel bridge (SFTB). In order to assess the maintenance performance in these three concepts, qualitative comparison and sustainability-based methods are presented as the two maintenance strategies that can be used in the new bridge concepts. The main criteria in qualitative comparison methods are introduced as maintainability and maintenance-related risks. Further, in sustainability-based method, the maintenance performance can be analyzed by the sustainability score. The presented strategies can provide SVV with some inputs to make decision and choose an appropriate concept regarding the maintenance...|$|R

The machine can cut materials up to 300 mm thick. As a cutting tool the water jet with pressure up to 3800 bar is used. Cutting speed depends on the thickness and structure of material. Due to very high working pressure there are several machine components under stress such as the high pressure unit and high pressure lines.
