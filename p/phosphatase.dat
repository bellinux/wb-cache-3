5|$|A <b>phosphatase</b> is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid {{monoester}} into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a <b>phosphatase</b> enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. <b>Phosphatase</b> enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based on growth conditions. In most actively growing adherent cells, NEDD9 migrates as a doublet of 115 and 105 kDa. Serine/threonine hyper-phosphorylated p115 NEDD9 {{is more common in}} G2/M phase cells, suggesting these modifications are associated with increased localization to centrosome and mitotic spindle. One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 is activated by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of <b>phosphatase</b> PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.sessilis has {{compound}} cluster roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid <b>phosphatase,</b> allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Inactivation of MAPKs is {{performed}} {{by a number of}} <b>phosphatases.</b> A very conserved family of dedicated <b>phosphatases</b> is the so-called MAP kinase <b>phosphatases</b> (MKPs), a subgroup of dual-specificity <b>phosphatases</b> (DUSPs). As their name implies, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphate from both phosphotyrosine and the phosphothreonine residues. Since removal of either phosphate groups will greatly reduce MAPK activity, essentially abolishing signaling, some tyrosine <b>phosphatases</b> are also involved in inactivating MAP kinases (e.g. the <b>phosphatases</b> HePTP, STEP and PTPRR in mammals).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} of mammalian purple acid <b>phosphatases</b> and phosphoprotein <b>phosphatases</b> are shown to possess regions of significant homology. The conserved residues contain {{a high percentage}} of possible metal-binding residues. The phosphoprotein <b>phosphatases</b> 1, 2 A and 2 B are proposed to be iron-zinc metalloenzymes with active sites isostructural (or nearly so) with those of the purple <b>phosphatases...</b>|$|R
50|$|Protein <b>phosphatases</b> remove {{phosphates}} from proteins, {{usually on}} Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine residues, reversing {{the action of}} protein kinases. The PTP family of protein <b>phosphatases</b> is tyrosine-specific, and several other families (PPPL, PPM, HAD) appear to be serine/threonine specific, while other families are unknown or {{have a variety of}} substrates (DSPs dephosphorylate any amino acid, while some protein <b>phosphatases</b> also have non-protein substrates). In the human genome, 20 different folds of protein are known to be <b>phosphatases,</b> of which 10 include protein <b>phosphatases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline <b>phosphatase</b> levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline <b>phosphatase</b> and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate <b>phosphatase</b> activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that {{plays an important}} role in signal transduction pathways. 1 The phosphorylation state of a protein is a result of coordinated action of protein kinases and protein <b>phosphatases.</b> Protein <b>phosphatases</b> are known to mainly control the rate and duration of the signals, while protein kinases are known to control the amplitude of the signals. 2 Protein <b>phosphatases</b> can be divided into three groups according to their sequence, structure, and catalytic mechanism: classic Ser/Thr <b>phosphatases,</b> protein Tyr phos-phatases (PTP), and the Asp-based protein <b>phosphatases.</b> 3 Dual-specificity <b>phosphatases</b> (DUSPs) are a subfamily of PTP, which dephosphorylate phospho-Ser,-Thr, and-Tyr.

40|$|It has {{generally}} been considered that protein <b>phosphatases</b> have more diverse catalytic domain structures and mechanisms than protein kinases; however, gene annotation efforts following {{the human genome project}} appeared to have completed the whole array of protein <b>phosphatases.</b> Ser/Thr <b>phosphatases</b> are divided into three subfamilies that have different structures from each other, whereas Tyr <b>phosphatases</b> and dual-specificity <b>phosphatases</b> targeting Tyr, Ser and Thr belong to a single large family based on their common structural features. Several years of research have revealed, however, the existence of unexpected proteins, designated here as "atypical protein phosphatases", that have structural and enzymatic features {{different from those of the}} known protein <b>phosphatases</b> and are involved in important biological processes. In this review, we focus on the identification and functional characterization of atypical protein <b>phosphatases,</b> represented by eyes absent (EYA), suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling (Sts) and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM 5) and discuss their biological significance in cellular signaling...|$|R
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal <b>phosphatase</b> activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline <b>phosphatase</b> (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of {{microbiological}} techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline <b>phosphatase,</b> which is denatured by pasteurization. B. tuberculosis, the bacterium that requires the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at ranges of temperature and time similar to those that denature alkaline <b>phosphatase.</b> For this reason, presence of alkaline <b>phosphatase</b> is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.|$|E
40|$|Cell cycle {{transitions}} {{depend on}} protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The discovery of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their mode of activation by their cyclin partners explained many {{important aspects of}} cell cycle control. As the cell cycle is basically a series of recurrences of a defined set of events, protein <b>phosphatases</b> must obviously {{be as important as}} kinases. However, our knowledge about <b>phosphatases</b> lags well behind that of kinases. We still do not know exactly which <b>phosphatase(s)</b> is/are truly responsible for dephosphorylating CDK substrates, and we know very little about whether and how protein <b>phosphatases</b> are regulated.

40|$|AbstractThe new {{structural}} data obtained for PP 1 and calcineurin—A resolve {{many of the}} outstanding questions about the catalytic nature of the Ser/Thr <b>phosphatases.</b> These enzymes may now be firmly classed as two-metal ion <b>phosphatases.</b> These data also provide a model for understanding a variety of <b>phosphatases</b> that share the two-metal-ion binding signature motif found in the Ser/Thr <b>phosphatases.</b> These enzymes are clearly important in the control {{of a variety of}} cellular functions and in a number of cases are important targets for therapeutic intervention.

25|$|TFIIF and FCP1 {{cooperate}} for RNAPII recycling. FCP1, the CTD <b>phosphatase,</b> {{interacts with}} RNA polymerase II. Transcription is {{regulated by the}} state of phosphorylation of a heptapeptide repeat. The nonphosphorylated form, RNAPIIA, is recruited to the initiation complex, whereas the elongating polymerase is found with RNAPII0. RNAPII cycles during transcription. CTD <b>phosphatase</b> activity is regulated by two GTFs (TFIIF and TFIIB). The large subunit of TFIIF (RAP74) stimulates the CTD <b>phosphatase</b> activity, whereas TFIIB inhibits TFIIF-mediated stimulation. Dephosphorylation of the CTD alters the migration of the largest subunit of RNAPII (RPB1).|$|E

Protein <b>phosphatases</b> and protein kinases play a dynamic antagonistic role in protein phosphorylation. Protein <b>phosphatases</b> make up a significant fraction of eukaryotic proteome. In this article, we report the identification and analysis of protein <b>phosphatases</b> in the intracellular parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Based on an in silico analysis, we classified 250 non-redundant protein <b>phosphatases</b> in E. histolytica. The phosphotome of E. histolytica is 3. 1 % of its proteome and 1. 3 times of the human phosphotome. In this extensive study, we identified 42 new putative <b>phosphatases</b> (39 hypothetical proteins and 3 pseudophosphatases). The presence of pseudophosphatases may have an important role in virulence of E. histolytica.

40|$|The nucleus {{contains}} a large variety of protein <b>phosphatases,</b> which function in key {{processes such as}} cell-cycle progression, replication, transcription and RNA processing. Here, we review the pleiotropic action of nuclear protein <b>phosphatases</b> and focus in particular on the underlying signaling strategies. It appears that nuclear protein <b>phosphatases</b> can both mediate and antagonize signaling by protein kinases, sometimes as part of feedback loops. Some protein <b>phosphatases</b> shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which enables them to act as signal transducers between both compartments.

TRAP is synthesized as latent proenzyme and activated by proteolytic cleavage and reduction. It is differentiated from other mammalian acid phosphatases by its resistance to inhibition by tartrate and molecular weight.|$|E

40|$|While the {{importance}} of protein kinases for the spatial and temporal control of mitotic events has long been recognized, mitotic <b>phosphatases</b> have only recently come into the limelight. It is now well established that protein <b>phosphatases</b> counteract mitotic kinases, so contributing to the generation of switch-like responses at mitotic stage transitions. In addition, the timely dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins by tightly regulated <b>phosphatases</b> {{is required for the}} assembly and stability of the mitotic spindle, the initiation of anaphase, and exit from mitosis. Mitotic <b>phosphatases</b> also emerge as effectors of the DNA damage and spindle assembly checkpoints.

40|$|Two genes with {{sequence}} homology to those encoding protein tyrosine <b>phosphatases</b> were cloned from genomic DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv. The calculated molecular masses {{of these two}} putative tyrosine <b>phosphatases,</b> designated MPtpA and MPtpB, were 17. 5 and 30 kDa, respectively. MPtpA and MPtpB were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The affinity-purified proteins dephosphorylated the phosphotyrosine residue of myelin basic protein (MBP), but they failed to dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues of MBP. The activity of these <b>phosphatases</b> was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine <b>phosphatases,</b> but not by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine <b>phosphatases.</b> Mutations at the catalytic site motif, cysteine 11 of MPtpA and cysteine 160 of MPtpB, abolished enzyme activity.
