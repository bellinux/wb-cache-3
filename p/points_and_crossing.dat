50|$|Whilst flextrack is {{available}} for both EM and P4 gauges (from manufacturers such as C&L Finescale, SMP and The P4 Track Company), ready-to-run (RTR) <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> (P&C) work is not available, so this trackwork must be constructed by the modeller. Kits for doing this are also available from the aforementioned sources amongst others. Several of these kits are also available for the OO modeller who aims for more realistic track, since most RTR track is actually scaled to HO and does not represent any British prototype and the sleeper spacing is too close together for scale. EM gauge has slightly overscale flanges <b>and</b> flangeways on <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> work; P4 is closer to scale but the smaller flanges and flangeways on P&C work expose poor track construction.|$|R

50|$|In {{classical}} geometry, {{a surface}} is generally {{defined as a}} locus of a point or a line. For example, a sphere is the locus of a point which is at a given distance of a fixed point, called the center; a conical surface is the locus of a line passing through a fixed <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> a curve; a surface of revolution is the locus of a curve rotating around a line. A ruled surface is the locus of a moving line satisfying some constraints; in modern terminology, a ruled surface is a surface, which is a union of lines.|$|R

The extension would be the West Nagoyakō Line, and along its path would be constructed the Nagoya Freight Terminal Station.

5000|$|EM was {{originally}} defined to use 18mm as the track gauge (hence the name: Eighteen Millimetres). This was revised, and today EM gauge uses an [...] track gauge, which {{is closer to}} accurate but not fully to scale. It was developed as an early improvement on the standard OO system. It is still popular with FineScale modellers today because it utilises larger than scale flanges on the wheels of rolling stock, <b>and</b> because <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> (P&C) work is a little easier due to an overscale flangeway clearance. These two concessions in scaling down the prototype make for reliable running. This factor explains the continued popularity of EM as a scale for finescale modellers working today.|$|R
50|$|The {{pitch is}} a 14 &times; 20 grid (13 &times; 19 points) with goal gates on the shorter sides. Starting {{from the center}} point, the line is {{extended}} to three points per turn. The line can touch occupied <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> existing lines (there are no bounce moves) but cannot move along an existing line. If a player has no place to extend the line, the computer repositions {{the ball on the}} nearest unblocked point. This can be favourable when executed properly, as the ball is usually moved depending on the last direction of the line before it became blocked, and can be used to maneuver closer to the opponent's goal. After scoring a goal, the ball is reset to the center <b>point</b> <b>and</b> the game continues until all possible goals are scored.|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{randomized}} observational case control {{study were}} to quantify fixation behavior during standard automated perimetry (SAP) with different fixation targets and to evaluate the relationship between fixation behavior and threshold variability at each test point in healthy young participants experienced with perimetry. SAP {{was performed on the}} right eyes of 29 participants using the Octopus 900 perimeter, program 32, dynamic strategy. The fixation targets of <b>Point,</b> <b>Cross,</b> <b>and</b> Ring were used for SAP. Fixation behavior was recorded using a wearable eye-tracking glass. All participants underwent SAP twice with each fixation target in a random fashion. Fixation behavior was quantified by calculating the bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA) and the frequency of deviation from the fixation target. The BCEAs (deg 2) of <b>Point,</b> <b>Cross,</b> <b>and</b> Ring targets were 1. 11, 1. 46, and 2. 02, respectively. In all cases, BCEA increased significantly with increasing fixation target size (p < 0. 05). The logarithmic value of BCEA demonstrated the same tendency (p < 0. 05). A positive correlation was identified between fixation behavior and threshold variability for the <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cross</b> targets (ρ = 0. 413 - 0. 534, p < 0. 05). Fixation behavior increased with increasing fixation target size. Moreover, a larger fixation behavior tended to be associated with a higher threshold variability. A small fixation target is recommended during the visual field test...|$|R

50|$|In Wurzen, {{the line}} which has run {{steadily}} {{to the northeast}} from Borsdorf reaches its most northerly <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>crosses</b> the Mulde. The Mulde bridge, the first German railway bridge, was built in 1837/38 by August Königsdorfer as a simple wooden structure that was 384 m long, surpassing the 19-span bridge over the Elbe at Riesa by 39 m. The Mulde Valley Railway began in Wurzen station and ran via Großbothen for Glauchau and its northern extension ran to Eilenburg, both classified as branch lines. The Mulde Valley Railway’s connection to the waterglass factory in Dehnitz continues in use. At the next junction at Kornhain, the line to Eilenburg connected to the line from Dresden for a second time. The connecting curve, which was built mainly for military reasons, was occasionally used for diversions.|$|R

SR 111 travels generally northwest as a controlled access highway before it crosses into Sequatchie County. The controlled-access sections of SR 111 are unusual, as they contain 70 mph speed limits, which are generally reserved for Interstate highways. It then proceeds over Walden Ridge {{and into the}} Sequatchie Valley, where it comes to and interchange with US 127 and starts a concurrency with SR 8 in Dunlap, where the freeway ends.

40|$|To {{establish}} the accuracy and applicability of analytical expressions for the steady state rate of binary nucleation, we numerically solved the birth-death equations for the vapor-to-liquid transition. These calculations were performed using rate coefficients {{that are consistent}} with the principle of detailed balance and a new self-consistent form of the equilibrium distribution function for binary cluster concentrations. We found that the customary saddle <b>point</b> <b>and</b> growth path approximations are almost always valid and can fail only if the nucleating solution phase is significantly nonideal. For example, problems can arise when the vapor composition puts the system on the verge of partial liquid phase miscibility. When this occurs for comparable monomer impingement rates, nucleation still occurs through the saddle point, but the usual quadratic expansion for the cluster free energy is inadequate. When the two impingement rates differ significantly, however, the major particle flux may bypass the saddle <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> a low ridge on the free energy surface. The dependence of the saddle point location on the gas phase composition is also important in initiating or terminating ridge crossing nucleation...|$|R
