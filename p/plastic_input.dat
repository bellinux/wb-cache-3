40|$|A shift {{approach}} is presented for evaluating and interpreting {{the response of}} rigid-perfectly plastic single-degree-of-freedom systems to dynamic loading. Scaling laws for such systems are, as the term suggests, multiplicative in nature, relating peak dynamic response to products of key problem parameters such as linear spectral coordinates, force reduction coefficient and peak values of the excitation and its time derivatives. Contrary to classical laws, the proposed {{approach is}} additive, imposing {{a shift in the}} ordinates and the abscissa of the excitation function by means of a set of parameters uniquely related to the yielding resistance of the system. The dynamic response is then obtained by integrating the modified excitation function in a linear-like manner within a particular yielding branch, for the nonlinearity is incorporated into the forcing term. The mathematical validity of the approach is demonstrated analytically and its importance is highlighted for systems with symmetric yielding resistance subjected to near-fault earthquake motions. The modified excitation function may be discontinuous between different yielding branches and relates uniquely to the development of plastic deformation. It is thereby referred to as <b>Plastic</b> <b>Input</b> Motion (PIM). It is shown that the ordinates and the duration of this function may be significantly (yet not necessarily) smaller than those of the original ground motion depending on yield strength. The relationship of the proposed approach to the existing methods and parameters of earthquake engineering such as Newmark's sliding block and relative ground acceleration, is discussed.

40|$|This paper, as an {{extension}} of Maquin and Pierron (Mech Mater 41 (8) : 928 – 942, 2009), presents an experimental procedure developed to macroscopically estimate the energy balance during the very first cycles of a uniaxially loaded metallic specimen at low stress levels. This energy balance is performed by simultaneously measuring the <b>plastic</b> <b>input</b> energy using a load cell and a strain gauge, and the dissipative energy using the temperature field provided by an infrared camera. Some experimental limitations led to restrain the present procedure to positive stress ratios, and to complement this energy balance by a second measurement while the material plastic work per cycle is negligible compared to the dissipative energy. Some results obtained on a cold rolled low carbon steel specimen are presented. First, a sensitivity study is undertaken to precisely determine the detection threshold on both thermal and plastic energies. Then, after having verified the homogeneity of the dissipative source fields, energy balances have been performed at different stress levels. It was thus confirmed that the slow variations of the dissipative sources occurring during the first cycles are due to micro-plastic adaptation, and that the dissipative sources remaining after some hundreds of cycles are due to viscoelastic (internal friction) phenomena. This procedure provides a better understanding of dissipation based approaches to fatigue found in the literature and an advanced tool to study viscoelastic phenomena in uniaxial loadin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{hippocampus}} and the neocortex, the coupling between local field potential (LFP) oscillations and the spiking of single neurons {{can be highly}} precise, across neuronal populations and cell types. Spike phase (i. e., the spike time {{with respect to a}} reference oscillation) is known to carry reliable information, both with phase-locking behavior and with more complex phase relationships, such as phase precession. How this precision is achieved by neuronal populations, whose membrane properties and total input may be quite heterogeneous, is nevertheless unknown. In this note, we investigate a simple mechanism for learning precise LFP-to-spike coupling in feed-forward networks - the reliable, periodic modulation of presynaptic firing rates during oscillations, coupled with spike-timing dependent plasticity. When oscillations are within the biological range (2 - 150 [*]Hz), firing rates of the inputs change on a timescale highly relevant to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Through analytic and computational methods, we find points of stable phase-locking for a neuron with <b>plastic</b> <b>input</b> synapses. These points correspond to precise phase-locking behavior in the feed-forward network. The location of these points depends on the oscillation frequency of the inputs, the STDP time constants, and the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule. For a given input oscillation, the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule is the critical parameter that determines the phase at which an output neuron will learn to spike. These findings are robust to changes in intrinsic post-synaptic properties. Finally, we discuss implications of this mechanism for stable learning of spike-timing in {{the hippocampus}}...|$|E
40|$|Microplastic {{pollution}} {{has been}} identified as an ever increasing proportion of marine litter. Despite an increase in microplastic awareness over the last decade, it represents an as yet unquantified threat to the marine environment. The relatively few studies that monitor its distribution and impact have illustrated a range of worrying effects on marine habitats and communities. The Clyde Sea Area (CSA) is subject to many sources of terrestrial and maritime <b>plastic</b> <b>input.</b> The use of plastics in recreational and commercial vessels throughout the CSA is believed to result in large levels of microplastic fibres, which have previously been seen to be ingested by a range of marine organisms. In a study of the breakdown of commonly used polymers in benthic environments, it was found that ropes of 10 mm diameter in sub-tidal conditions release between 0. 086 and 0. 422 g of microfibers per meter per month {{in the early stages of}} degradation. This rate would be expected to increase over subsequent months, releasing substantial amounts of fibres into the CSA environment. In addition to the presence of numerous sources of microplastics, the CSA is relatively enclosed, and may accumulate high levels of debris as a result. Monthly sampling of the water and sediment in the CSA revealed contamination similar to that observed in other near-shore environments. Thus, it is expected that the potential threat to organisms in other areas will be similar to that observed in the CSA. One organism known to take up microplastics is the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, the target of the main fishery in the CSA. In this work we examined the levels of microplastic in the gut of N. norvegicus from the Scottish waters. Examination of individuals from the CSA revealed both a high occurrence and high accumulation of microplastic. This was found to be much greater than in N. norvegicus sampled from more remote Scottish waters. As a result, N. norvegicus from the CSA are most likely to suffer from the negative impacts associated with microplastic ingestion than those in offshore or in areas of low anthropogenic activity. In order to determine the potential impacts of microplastic ingestion on N. norvegicus, we first examined the mechanism by which N. norvegicus retain and egest microplastic. The position of microplastic aggregations in the foregut indicates that the gastric mill is the main obstacle to microplastic egestion. Inducing moult in microplastic-fed individuals demonstrated that expulsion of the gut lining during ecdysis enables N. norvegicus to reduce their plastic load, limiting plastic aggregation to the length of a single moult-cycle. In an 8 month controlled-feeding experiment retained plastic was seen to have a range of impacts on N. norvegicus. Feeding rate and body mass was seen to decrease in plastic loaded N. norvegicus, and a reduction was observed in a number of indicators of nutritional state. The results presented in this thesis have a number of implications to the CSA and wider marine environment. The similarity in the level of microplastic observed in the CSA to that of other studies of inshore waters indicates the potential for high microplastic uptake by crustaceans in those areas. The high variability in observed microplastic abundance suggests that small-scale monitoring is unsuitable for monitoring marine microplastic debris, and that use of an indicator species may provide a more reliable method of monitoring that is not subject to small-scale heterogeneity in distribution. The seasonal retention of microplastic by N. norvegicus indicates that crustaceans may provide a suitable indicator of local contamination. However, in the CSA, the high level of fibre aggregation and observed impacts of prolonged retention indicate that microplastic may be causing further pressure on an already exploited resource, reducing the stability of the valuable N. norvegicus population...|$|E

40|$|The {{floating}} plastic debris {{along the}} Arabian {{coast of the}} Red Sea was sampled by using surface-trawling plankton nets. A total of 120 sampling sites were spread out over the near-shore waters along 1, 500 km of coastline during seven cruises performed during 2016 and 2017. Plastic debris, dominated by millimeter-sized pieces, was constituted mostly of fragments of rigid objects (73 %) followed by pieces of films (17 %), fishing lines (6 %), and foam (4 %). These fragments were mainly made up by polyethylene (69 %) and polypropylene (21 %). Fibers, likely released from synthetic textiles, were ubiquitous and abundant, although were analyzed independently due {{to the risk of}} including non-plastic fibers and airborne contamination of samples in spite of the precautions taken. The plastic concentrations (excluding possible plastic fibers) contrasts with those found in other semi-closed seas, such as the neighboring Mediterranean. They were relatively low all over the Red Sea (< 50, 000 items km− 2; mean ± SD = 3, 546 ± 8, 154 plastic item km− 2, 1. 1 ± 3. 0 g km− 2) showing no clear spatial relationship with the distribution of coastal population. Results suggests a low <b>plastic</b> waste <b>input</b> from land as the most plausible explanation for this relative shortage of plastic in the surface waters of the Red Sea; however, the additional intervention of particular processes of surface plastic removal by fish or the filtering activity of the extensive coral reefs along the coastline cannot be discarded.

30|$|Sylvia Frey (Ocean Care, Wädenswil, Switzerland) gave an {{overview}} of the current knowledge on the occurrence and biological impacts of microplastics in freshwater and saltwater bodies. Microplastics can function as vectors of chemicals by accumulating persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs) and transferring them to living organisms. There is an urgent need to better understand such interactions and to curb <b>plastic</b> <b>inputs</b> into the aquatic environment from: (1) single-use plastics, (2) microbeads in cosmetics, and (3) plastic fibers which are not completely removed in WWTPs. A major barrier to advancing research and implementing policy action on the issue of microplastics is the lack of standard analytical methods to quantify microplastics. With currently used non-standard methods, the risk of false positives can be considerable. Florian Storck (Water Technology Center, Karlsruhe, Germany) presented his research on analytics and occurrence of microplastics in inland waterways. He recommends not to rely on visual sample inspection only, but to include chemical analysis like Raman microscopy. Nicole Bandow (Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und Prüfung, Berlin, Germany) measured chemicals released from three different types of microplastics: polystyrene, high density polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride. The plastic materials were either directly eluted, or first exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or thermic stress and then eluted. Many different peaks were detected in eluates, even more after plastics were exposed to UV or heat. Their identification is challenging, and an ecotoxicological evaluation based on analytical results is difficult {{due to the lack of}} toxicological data. She concluded that effect-based assays are needed to assess the toxicity of the eluates. Concentrations of microplastics in Swiss lakes and rivers were measured by Florian Faure (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland). All water bodies investigated contained microplastics. Concentrations increased by 5 – 150 times after stormwater overflow events. Faure and colleagues also analyzed selected additives and monomers in the plastic particles, as well as hydrophobic micropollutants. All chemicals of interest were detected, including bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and several phthalates.|$|R

An important feature of this phantom is that the phantom lungs can be interchanged so that the counting system can be challenged by different combinations of radionuclides and activity. Phantom lungs are made from lung tissue substitutes whose constituents are foaming plastics and various adjuvants selected to make the lung tissue substitute similar to normal healthy lung tissue.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a future}} fossil-free {{circular}} economy, the petroleum-based plastics industry must {{be converted to}} non-fossil feedstock. A known alternative is bio-based plastics, but a relatively unexplored option is deriving the key plastic building blocks, hydrogen and carbon, from electricity through electrolytic processes combined with carbon capture and utilization technology. In this paper the future demand for electricity and carbon dioxide is calculated {{under the assumption that}} all plastic production is electricity-based in the EU by 2050. The two most important input chemicals are ethylene and propylene and the key finding of this paper is that the electricity demand to produce these are estimated to 20  MWh/ton ethylene and 38  MWh/ton propylene, and that they both could require about 3  tons of carbon dioxide/ton product. With constant production levels, this implies an annual demand of about 800  TWh of electricity and 90  Mton of carbon dioxide by 2050 in the EU. If scaled to the total production of <b>plastics,</b> including all <b>input</b> hydrocarbons in the EU, the annual demand is estimated to 1600  TWh of electricity and 180  Mton of carbon dioxide. This suggests that a complete shift to electricity-based plastics is possible from a resource and technology point of view, but production costs may be 2 to 3 times higher than today. However, the long time frame of this paper creates uncertainties regarding the results and how technical, economic and social development may influence them. The conclusion of this paper is that electricity-based plastics, integrated with bio-based production, can be an important option in 2050 since biomass resources are scarce, but electricity from renewable sources is abundant...|$|R
40|$|Purpose High-quality wood {{production}} {{is based on}} both natural forestry populations and dedicated tree plantations, also mentioned as industrial plantations. The establishment of dedicated plantations needs high-quality seedlings, often grown in a nursery, having specific genetic and morphological features. From seed gathering to final selling, {{the growth of the}} seedlings needs human interventions and specific inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, substrates, and capital goods (e. g., pots and greenhouses). All these inputs of course can cause not negligible environmental impacts, due to their production, maintenance, and final disposal. For these reasons, the environmental impact due to seedlings production in a nursery deserves deep analysis to assess the overall impact linked to wood supply chain: it is important that wood products are able to meet high environmental standards. This study is focused on 1 - and 2 -year-old walnut tree (Juglans regia L.) seedlings, aimed to high-quality timber production. Materials and methods Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was adopted according to ISO 14040 standards. As case study, a nursery located in the South of Italy was studied. Both 1 - and 2 -year-old seedlings were analyzed from the LCA point of view and then compared, adopting 100 seedlings as functional unit. Results and discussion Three <b>inputs,</b> <b>plastic</b> production, forming, and disposal to landfill, can be identified as the greatest polluters for both 1 - and 2 -year-old seedlings; for all the impact categories taken into account, their emissions joined always exceeded the 50 % of the total amount, reaching values up to 90 % (e. g., abiotic depletion, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, and photochemical oxidation). Two-year-old production system needs more inputs than 1 -year-old; therefore, its greatest environmental impact was expected, but it is interesting to stress the increasing registered over the second year of growing, which reaches values up to 747 % (fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity), most of which is due to polypropylene (mulching cloth, trays, and first of all, the pots). Conclusions For four out of ten impact categories, polypropylene caused the greatest impact; therefore, interventions in this phase of the production system could be useful to reduce the overall environmental impact. Further investigations regarding the mortality rate for 1 - and 2 -year-old seedlings (after the plantation) are needed to better compare practical, economic, and environmental aspects...|$|R
40|$|Space flight {{produces}} {{profound changes}} of neuronal {{activity in the}} mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain, Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs) ] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS- 90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was {{compared to that of}} ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and I and 14 days after landing. An {{increase in the number of}} Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) steep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep Could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation, Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggest a major influence from proprioceptive <b>inputs.</b> and <b>plastic</b> re-weighting of <b>inputs</b> after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight, (C) 2002 IBRO.
