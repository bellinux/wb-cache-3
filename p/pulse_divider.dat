40|$|Abstract A {{programmable}} dual modulus divider was proposed. The circuit mainly {{includes three}} building blocks: prescaler, 8 -bit programmable counter and ΣΔ modulator. Two operation modes (integer/fractional-N) were achieved by switching on/off the output signal of the ΣΔ modulator. Only a programmable counter {{is needed for}} the swallow <b>pulse</b> <b>divider.</b> The prescaler was designed by using the improved dynamic TSPC triggers, and the other blocks were realized by the way of digital synthesis, placing and routing. Based on 0. 18 µm 1. 8 V CMOS technology, SpectreVerilog simulations verify that it can operate within the division ratio of 56 - 2047 with 2 GHz maximum operation frequency and < 4 mA current dissipation. The circuit is very simple {{and can be used}} in the high performance PLL frequency synthesizer. Key words divider; ΣΔ modulator; counter; 3 -wire bu...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of robust {{normalization}} and guaranteed cost control for a class of uncertain singular Markovian jump systems. The uncertainties exhibit in both system matrices and transition rate matrix of the Markovian chain. A new impulsive and proportional-derivative control strategy is presented, where the derivative gain {{is to make the}} closed-loop system of the singular plant to be a normal one, and the impulsive control part is to make the value of the Lyapunov function does not increase at each time instant of the Markovian switching. A linearization approach via congruence transformations is proposed to solve the controller design problem. The cost function is minimized via solving an optimization problem under the designed control scheme. Finally, three examples (two numerical examples and an RC <b>pulse</b> <b>divider</b> circuit example) are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the impulse electrical strength of water on conductivity was investigated in non-uniform electric field - point-plate electrode system. The voltage pulses, with the rise time t,=l ps, and time to half-decay tuz= 30 ps, were generated by a Marx bank. Conductivity was varied {{by the use of}} different CuSO 4 concentrations in distilled water. The voltage and current during the electrical breakdown were recorded by using a <b>pulse</b> voltage <b>divider</b> and current shunt. The dynamic resistance calculated from current and voltage waveforms during electrical breakdown, is also presented. On the basis of these waveforms, the dependencies of the time to breakdown and breakdown voltage on the conductivity for two polarizations of the point electrode are plotted. Investigations made by means of static photography were carried out. It was found that the electrical strength of water depends strongly on the polarity of point electrode and the conductivity of the water. The electrical strength of water decreases, and time to breakdown increases, as water conductivity is increased...|$|R
40|$|A fractional-N {{frequency}} synthesizer fabricated in a 0. 13 μm CMOS technology is presented {{for the application}} of IEEE 802. 11 b/g wireless local area network(WLAN) transceivers. A monolithic LC voltage controlled oscillator(VCO) is implemented with an on-chip symmetric inductor. The fractional-N frequency divider consists of a <b>pulse</b> swallow frequency <b>divider</b> and a 3 rd-order multistage noise shaping(MASH) ΔΣ modulator with noise-shaped dithering techniques. Measurement results show that in all channels, phase noise of the synthesizer achieves- 93 dBc/Hz and- 118 dBc/Hz in band and out of band respectively with a phase-frequency detector(PFD) frequency of 20 MHz and a loop bandwidth of 100 kHz. The integrated RMS phase error is no more than 0. 8 °. The proposed synthesizer consumes 8. 4 mW from a 1. 2 V supply and occupies an area of 0. 86 mm 2. ? 2011 Chinese Institute of Electronics...|$|R
