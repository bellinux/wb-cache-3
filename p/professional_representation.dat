This is {{in part due to}} the field's diverse <b>professional</b> <b>representation</b> including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers.

2500|$|By 2011 several councils had {{realized}} {{that they did not}} have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled <b>professional</b> <b>representation</b> of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union). This gives legal right to represent its members whether the employer or Trades Union Congress (TUC) recognizes SWU or not. [...] At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to apprehend plant disease management practices from a psyhosocial viewpoint. Is there any relationship between plant disease management practices and the <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> of the farmers? What influence does professional context have in this relationship? How does participation in SLPHT, used to spread IPM Practices, influence rice farmers in plant disease management? The relationship between <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> and pest management practices varies depending on the professional context. When institutional coercion is marked, it is the legal prescriptions which influence the relationship between <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> and practices. Inversely, when institutional coercion is less marked, <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> guides practices. Participation in SLPHT is unrelated to plant disease management by the rice farmers. This research aims to contribute to the study of adult training by showing how the professional context can influence the adoption of innovation...|$|R

40|$|This study traces {{shifts in}} health <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> {{of people with}} dementia. The {{concepts}} of subaltern, personhood and citizenship are used {{to draw attention to}} issues around visibility, voice and inclusion. Professional discourses and practices draw upon, and are shaped by historical and contemporary representations. Until recently, people with dementia were subaltern in nursing and medical discourses; marginalised and silenced. The incorporation of contemporary representations foregrounding personhood and citizenship into health professional accounts provide space for transformative styles of care. Privileging personhood centralises the person with dementia in social networks, focusing on their experiences and relationships. Respecting citizenship involves challenging discrimination and stigma: nursing from a rights-based approach necessitates listening and being responsive {{to the needs of the}} person with dementia. Incorporating contemporary <b>representations</b> in health <b>professional</b> practice requires the discarding of the historically dominant elite and authoritarian accounts of dementia still apparent in some nursing texts along with, perhaps, the historically burdened term of dementia itself...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the meanings {{of the crime scene}} in serial killings, and the tensions between the real and the imagined in the circulation of those meanings. Starting with the Whitechapel Murders of 1888 it argues that they, as well as forming an origin for the construction of the identity of 'the serial killer', initiate certain ideas about the relationship of subjects to spaces and the existence of the self in the modern urban landscape. It suggests that these ideas come to play an integral part in the contemporary discourse of serial killing, both in the popular imagination and in professional analysis. Examining the Whitechapel Murders, more recent cases and modern profiling techniques, it argues that popular and <b>professional</b> <b>representations</b> of crime scenes reveal more of social anxieties {{about the nature of the}} public and the private than they do about serial killers. It suggests that 'the serial killer' is not a coherent type, but an invention produced from the confusions of persons and places. Copyright 2006 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} concept of lawyers’ 2 ̆ 2 {{professional}} independence 2 ̆ 2 {{in the literature of}} the U. S. legal profession. It begins with some reflections on the conventional meanings of professional independence, which encompasses both the bar’s collective independence to regulate its members and individual lawyers’ independence in the context of <b>professional</b> <b>representations,</b> including independence from clients, on one hand, and independence from third parties, on the other. The article suggests that the professional conduct rules are overly preoccupied with protecting lawyers’ professional independence from the corrupting influences of other professionals. The article then turns to an aspect of professional independence that has largely dropped out of lawyers’ discourse but that deserves more attention, namely, lawyers’ independence from the courts. This includes: (1) freedom to criticize judges; (2) freedom to disobey arguably unlawful court orders; and (3) freedom to resolve certain ethical dilemmas for oneself, as a matter of professional conscience. The article maintains that as the bar has become strongly identified and allied with the judiciary, motivated by the interests in securing judicial protection from other government regulation and in securing the bar’s own institutional influence over individual lawyers, the bar has ignored this understanding and redefined professional independence consistently with a strong judicial role in regulating lawyers...|$|R
