50|$|<b>Propyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (C9H18O2), {{also known}} as propyl caproate, is an ester formed by the {{reaction}} of propanol with hexanoic acid. Although it is a completely different ester, <b>propyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> shares the same chemical formula with methyl octanoate, ethyl heptanoate, butyl pentanoate, etc. because they {{all have the same}} total carbon chain length. The scent of this ester can be described as that of blackberries, pineapple, cheese or wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{esterification}} {{process can}} also be reversed (hydrolysis) to get propanol and hexanoic acid back from <b>propyl</b> <b>hexanoate.</b> This reaction occurs between the ester and water {{in the presence of}} a dilute acid catalyst and heat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> {{being an}} ester, is {{generally}} used for replicating the scents or flavors of fruit such as blackberry and pineapple, then {{is added to}} things such as food or perfume. It also has the use as a solvent for polar organic compounds.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe odoriferous {{importance}} of volatile compounds during maturation of organic passion fruit was studied. The volatile compounds {{were analyzed using}} GC-FID-OSME and GC-MS. The volatile profile changed throughout maturation. Relative peak area improved from the 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 yellow skin color state of ripeness and was still improved from the 2 / 3 to 3 / 3, but the profile remained. Ethyl butanoate showed the highest relative peak area and importance for the aroma of the organic passion fruit in the 1 / 3 yellow skin color. Ethyl butanoate and <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>propyl</b> acetate and alpha-terpineol showed odoriferous importance from the 2 / 3 yellow skin color, and together with diethyl carbonate and cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol {{were the most important}} compounds in the 3 / 3 yellow skin color state of ripeness. PCA allowed clearly differentiate all ripening states, indicating that hexanal and caramel, earthy and synthetic aroma were most closely associated with the unripe passion fruit. 2 -methylpropyl acetate characterized the passion fruit at the 2 / 3 yellow skin color together with cis-beta-ocimene, benzaldehyde and aroma sweet and passion fruit, skin, which also were associated with the 3 / 3 yellow skin color. Esters, terpenes, alcohols, octanal, dodecanol and aroma of passion fruit, fruity, citric, candy and plastic were closely associated with the whole maturation...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the length}} of the carbon chain in this molecule, there are only minor van der Waals forces acting upon it, which is why <b>propyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> appears as a liquid and not a solid. Dipole-dipole forces are present because of the polar {{covalent}} bonds between carbon and oxygen, while hydrogen bonding only occurs with other molecules that can hydrogen bond.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> {{is formed}} by the {{condensation}} reaction (esterification) of propanol and hexanoic acid. The hydroxyl group from the propanol reacts with the hydroxyl group from the hexanoic acid to produce water and leave an oxygen that the parent acid and alcohol chains bond to, creating the ester. For this reaction to occur, it requires an acid catalyst, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, and heat.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{validated}} method using {{a thermal}} desorber {{combined with a}} gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment {{during a period of}} 6 months. 452 compounds were identified. Among them a human specific marker was sought using principle component analysis. We found a combination of 8 compounds (ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, pyridine, diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio) ethyl disulfide and 3 -methylthio- 1 -propanol) that led to the distinction of human and pig remains from other animal remains. Furthermore, it was possible to separate the pig remains from human remains based on 5 esters (3 -methylbutyl pentanoate, 3 -methylbutyl 3 -methylbutyrate, 3 -methylbutyl 2 -methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and <b>propyl</b> <b>hexanoate).</b> Further research in the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and search for one or more human specific markers. These markers would allow a more efficiently training of cadaver dogs or portable detection devices could be developed...|$|E
