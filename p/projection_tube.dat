This was achieved on Baird projection equipment using a 16-inch <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> running at 45,000 volts, producing light levels comparable to that of normal films. Each projection unit contained two projection tubes, one acting as a backup in case the first one failed.

40|$|The {{sales of}} big screen {{projection}} television (PTV) have been increasing rapidly {{and will continue}} to increase since there is no economically feasible substitute for PTV. In 2002, annual sales are forecasted to be 70 percent more than in 1997. Therefore, the demand for projection tubes (major components of PTVs) is also expected to increase as much as the sales of PTV. Matsushita Electronics Company (MEC), the second largest <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> producer, relocated their <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> plant from Japan to the U. S. (AMEC) in order to increase its sales by conforming to NAFTA regulation. This plant relocation will also enable MEC to reduce its production cost significantly. Basically, the more projection tubes produced, the lower cost will become. However, the cost does not proportionally decrease with quantity produced because the direct labor cost is a quasi-variable. In order to produce projection tubes at the lowest cost, AMEC should carefully implement its work shift schedule. There will be competition only between Hitachi and AMEC. Other <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> producers {{will not be able to}} compete with Hitachi and AMEC. For the next five years, AMEC will constantly increase sales. However, Hitachi, the largest <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> producer, will continue to dominate the market by being able to sell more projection tubes at lower production costs. Hitachi’s dominance will be a problem for AMEC in the long run. To prevent the further dominance of Hitachi, AMEC should increase their sales more than projected by implementing the following strategies; 1) supply more to minor customers, 2) have excess inventories, 3) supply flexible amounts and many types of projection tubes, 4) reduce the price of <b>projection</b> <b>tube</b> 5) improve yield rates, and 6) implement the most efficient work-shift...|$|E
40|$|The colour {{coordinate}} values {{measured with}} the colorimeters presently {{on the market}} are {{the mean of the}} readings obtained for the surface area covered by the light <b>projection</b> <b>tube.</b> When the colour of the surface measured is not uniform, such {{as in the case of}} stone, the larger the tube aperture the more representative is the colour measurement, for a larger area is involved. While this is often an advantage, when the area studied is smaller than the aperture of the colorimeter used, the values obtained include unwanted information. One possible way to deal with this drawback is by using templates to reduce the measurement area. Templates adapted to a Minolta CR- 210 colorimeter were tested in the present study. The conclusion drawn was that in addition to being convenient to use, they ensured that the readings matched the original colour of the surface, i. e., the value that would have been obtained without the templates. En los color&# 237;metros que existen en el mercado, la luz se recoge mediante un tubo de cierto di&# 225;metro y los valores de las coordenadas crom&# 225;ticas que da el medidor son una media de las obtenidas en dicha superficie. Cuando la superficie a medir no tiene un color uniforme, como ocurre en el caso de los materiales p&# 233;treos, la medida de color es m&# 225;s representativa cuanto mayor es la apertura del tubo de medida ya que la superficie medida es mayor.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the Szegö <b>projection</b> of <b>tube</b> domains over {{irreducible}} symmetric cones is unbounded in L^p for p≠ 2. Indeed, this is a consequence of the fact that the characteristic function of a disc is not a Fourier multiplier, a fundamental theorem proved by C. Fefferman in the 70 's. The same problem, related to the Bergman projection, deserves a different approach. In this survey, based on joint work of the author with D. Békollé, G. Garrigós, M. Peloso and F.

This prospective cadaver study aims at evaluating the image quality and assessing the changes that result when three different filter combinations, variation in the number of <b>projections,</b> and <b>tube</b> current are used in CBCT temporal bone imaging. The image acquisition was carried out using three filter combinations, Cu-Al, Cu-Cu and Al-Al, with varying thickness and the number of projections was changed from the standard 100 % to 150 %. Additionally, 8 mA and 12. 5 mA were used in all cases. The quality of the acquired images was then qualitatively (visually) and quantitatively (noise analysis) assessed. The visual assessment was carried out by two radiologists with over 20 years’ experience in the field of diagnostic radiology and the noise analysis (standard deviation), an algorithm-based assessment, was done in MATLAB user interface. The results showed that Copper and Aluminum (Cu-Al) filters offered the best image quality when compared with the Cu-Cu (factory-fitted) and Al-Al filter combinations in both visual and algorithm-based assessments. From the results, it was also demonstrated that increasing the number of projections from the standard 100 % number of projections to 150 % offered a better characterization of the complex temporal bone anatomy in both visual and noise analysis assessments. Finally, changes in the tube current from 8 mA to 12. 5 mA resulted in a minimal change of the image quality when visually assessed. However, the effects of the tube current variations increased when the algorithm-based noise analysis was carried out. In conclusion, variations in the material property of the filter, effective filter inter-positioning, and variations in the number of projections optimize the image quality in CBCT temporal bone imaging. /Kir 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{under review}} investigates the de Rham and {{signature}} operators on an important class of singular spaces {{equipped with a}} natural type of metric. The singular spaces are smoothly stratified pseudomanifolds. Thus every stratum is a smooth manifold and endowed with tubular control data.

These resolutions are manifolds with corners equipped with an iterated fibration structure, proposed originally by Melrose but presented carefully in the paper under review. The important topological assumption placed on the singular spaces is the Witt condition, meaning that the middle dimensional, lower middle perversity intersection homology with real coefficients of even dimensional links vanishes. One should note that the Witt spaces considered here are technically not the same as P. Siegel’s original Witt spaces, as the latter were PL spaces with a PL stratification.

The absorbed dose to radiosensitive organs and effective dose were calculated on mathematically simulated phantom corresponding to a 15 -year-old patient using PCXMC 2. 0. Radiation doses were calculated at every 15 degrees of the x-ray <b>tube</b> <b>projection</b> angle at two regions: thoracic spine and lumbar spine. Two different scan settings were investigated: 120 kV/ 128 mAs (standard) and 80 kV/ 80 mAs (low-dose). The effect on effective dose by changing the number of simulated projection angles (24, 12 and 4) was investigated. Estimated effective dose with PCXMC was compared with calculated effective dose using conversion factors between dose length product (DLP) and effective dose. The highest absorbed doses were received by the breast, lungs (thoracic spine) and stomach (lumbar spine). The effective doses using standard settings were 5 times higher than those delivered with low-dose settings (2 - 3 scans: 7. 9 - 12 mSv versus 1. 5 - 2. 4 mSv). There was no difference in estimated effective dose using 24 or 12 projection angles. Using 4 projection angles at every 90 degrees was not enough to accurate simulate the x-ray tube rotating around the patient. Conversion factors between DLP and effective dose were determined.
