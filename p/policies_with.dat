5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E

5|$|Both {{character}} and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress {{award from the}} Broadcasting Press Guild for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and {{was nominated for a}} British Comedy Award. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with Asherman's syndrome in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during the writing of the storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% {{increase in the number of}} people taking out life insurance <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> one provider, Tesco Personal Finance, which a spokesperson for the company attributed to Rachel's premature death.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> {{the intention to}} develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E

5|$|The emperor's {{political}} reforms were connected with {{his desire to}} conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> the intent to slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong (r. 1189–1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer {{to that of the}} Song and Tang dynasties. Despite cultural and demographic changes, military hostilities between the Jin and the Song persisted until the fall of the Jin.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has {{been regarded as}} being elitist by some commentators, taking 41% of its undergraduate students from non-state schools, {{according to the most}} recent 2009/2010 figures, despite the fact that such pupils make up just 7% of the population and 18% of 16+ year old pupils across the UK. The intake of state school pupils at Bristol is lower than many Oxbridge colleges. The high ratio of undergraduates from non-state school has led to some tension at the university. In late February and early March 2003, Bristol became embroiled in a row about admissions <b>policies,</b> <b>with</b> some private schools threatening a boycott based on their claims that, in an effort to improve equality of access, the university was discriminating against their students. These claims were hotly denied by the university.|$|E
5|$|School {{clubs and}} {{societies}} include singing and drama clubs, chess club, sports clubs, film club and computer games club. A student council system is in place which acts as a forum between pupils and staff; elected representatives of each year group attend fortnightly, pupil-run meetings to discuss school <b>policies</b> <b>with</b> staff. On the Ruskington site, a pupil-run Interact Club, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Sleaford and Kesteven, coordinates charitable and community work in the school. The school newspaper club produces an annual newsletter and the school takes part in the BBC School Report day. Badminton, association football, volleyball, trampolining and gymnastics clubs are run every week at the Academy. The physical education department runs Inter-House sports competitions and co-ordinates school rugby, association football, basketball, boccia and netball teams. The music department hosts a junior and senior choir, swing band, Woodwind ensemble, Samba group and Vocal groups; the music rehearsal rooms can be booked for band practice. Pupils can audition for parts in the school's annual musical production and summer cabaret. For a fee, pupils may take up music lessons taught by tutors at the school. The school has supported music students in local and regional music festivals.|$|E
