40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{focuses on}} the risks of poverty, defined as individual-level labor market and family characteristics more common among the poor than the non-poor. This article first develops a framework for analyzing the risks of poverty in terms of <b>prevalences</b> (share of the population with a risk) and penalties (increased probability of poverty associated with a risk). Comparing the four major risks (low education, single motherhood, young headship, and unemployment) across 29 rich democracies, we show there is greater variation in penalties than <b>prevalences.</b> Second, we apply this framework to the U. S. We show that <b>prevalences</b> cannot explain high U. S. poverty as the U. S. has below average <b>prevalences.</b> Rather, the U. S. has high poverty partly because it has the highest penalties. U. S. poverty would decline more with crossnational median penalties than cross-national median <b>prevalences,</b> and U. S. poverty in 2013 would actually be worse with <b>prevalences</b> from 1970 or 1980. Third, we analyze cross-national variation in <b>prevalences</b> and penalties. We find very little evidence that higher penalties discourage <b>prevalences,</b> or that lower penalties encourage <b>prevalences.</b> We also show welfare generosity significantly moderates the penalties for unemployment and low education. We conclude with three broader implications. First, a focus on risks is unlikely to provide a convincing explanation or effective strategy for poverty. Second, despite being {{the subject of the}} most research, single motherhood may be the least important of the risks. Third, for general explanations of poverty, studies based solely on the U. S. are constrained by potentially large sample selection biases...|$|R

5|$|The {{late onset}} of Huntington's disease means {{it does not}} usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} <b>prevalence</b> of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically {{as a result of}} ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. <b>Prevalence</b> is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of the}} world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the <b>prevalence</b> of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average <b>prevalence</b> for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher <b>prevalence</b> than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased <b>prevalence</b> in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of <b>prevalence.</b> Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low <b>prevalence</b> of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects the <b>prevalence</b> of chronic HBV infection {{in a given}} area. In low <b>prevalence</b> {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate <b>prevalence</b> areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa, transmission during childhood is a significant factor. The <b>prevalence</b> of chronic HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8% with 10–15% <b>prevalence</b> in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively.

40|$|The {{association}} between the contagious Staphylococcus aureus genotype B (GTB) {{and the presence of}} coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Streptococcus spp. (non-agalactiae streptococci), was investigated, and the identification of problem herds without genotyping was evaluated.

All samples were bacteriologically analysed and Staph. aureus genotyping carried out using a ribosomal spacer-PCR. Cow and quarter <b>prevalences</b> of Staph. aureus, CNS and Streptococcus spp. differed significantly between PH and CH groups. PH cases were highly associated with decreased cow <b>prevalences</b> of CNS and Streptococcus spp. These altered <b>prevalences</b> also contributed significantly to the identification of problem herds without resorting to genotyping.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{assess the}} <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, {{allergic}} rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in {{adolescents in the}} city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2012 by administering the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, as well as to compare the observed <b>prevalences</b> with those found in studies performed 10 years earlier and employing the same methodology used here. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between May and December of 2012 and involving adolescents in the 13 - to 14 -year age bracket. Participants were randomly selected from among adolescents studying at public schools in Belo Horizonte and completed the ISAAC questionnaire. Proportions were calculated in order to assess the <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the sample as a whole, and the chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used in order to compare the <b>prevalences</b> observed in 2012 with those found in 2002. Results: The <b>prevalences</b> of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in 2012 were 19. 8 %, 35. 3 %, and 16. 3 %, respectively, being significantly higher than those found in 2002 (asthma, p = 0. 006; allergic rhinitis, p < 0. 01; and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, p = 0. 002). Conclusions: The <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis among adolescents in 2012 were found to be high, having increased in comparison with those found 10 years earlier, despite efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment...|$|R

The relative <b>prevalences</b> of SCA 1 and SCA 2 were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15 % and 14 %, respectively) than in Japanese pedigrees (3 % and 5 %, respectively), corresponding to the observation that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA 1 (alleles > 30 repeats) and of SCA 2 (alleles > 22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. The relative <b>prevalences</b> of MJD/SCA 3, SCA 6, and DRPLA were significantly higher in Japanese pedigrees (43 %, 11 %, and 20 %, respectively) than in Caucasian pedigrees (30 %, 5 %, and 0 %, respectively), corresponding to the observation that the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA 3 (> 27 repeats), SCA 6 (> 13 repeats), and DRPLA (> 17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The close correlations of the relative <b>prevalences</b> of the dominant SCAs with the distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative <b>prevalences</b> of the dominant SCAs...|$|R
