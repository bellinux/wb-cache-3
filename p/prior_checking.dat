40|$|Mining the {{implicit}} {{knowledge in the}} electronic documents is a critical task in text analysis and data mining. To attain a knowledge-based view of the electronic documents, the clustering method based upon the topic cannot only be used, but also that based upon the extraction can be done. Therefore, a novel method for the clustering of the electronic documents, summarizing of the full text based on the extracted segments, and an evaluation using multi-measures for the importance to the document were presented. In the method, eighteen kinds of named entities and two kinds of syntactical phrases were extracted, and exploited for the text clustering. Then, a novel similarity equation was proposed for the calculation about the extractions. Meantime, three measures for the importance to the document were proposed, which provided a different view for the document’s content, and recommended a <b>prior</b> <b>checking</b> for the users. Therefore, the method can improve {{the efficiency of the}} knowledge discovery, and enhance the management of the document on the large scale of document collection...|$|E

30|$|There are {{practical}} advantages to using {{a range of}} entry tests at laparoscopic entry. The usefulness of the aspiration test in outruling insertion of the Veres needle into the bowel or a blood vessel cannot be disputed. Moreover, insufflation of gas through a Veres needle into a blood vessel without any <b>prior</b> <b>checks</b> would be indefensible. This study has shown that multiple non-confirmatory entry tests are {{significantly more likely to}} be associated with multiple Veres entries, not a surprising finding as a surgeon will attempt another entry if multiple tests are non-confirmatory on the first entry attempt. Multiple non-confirmatory test findings were however linked with abnormal entry findings (omental emphysema, anterior retroperitoneal gas or subcutaneous emphysema), although results did not reach significance. We suggest that surgeons using Veres entry continue to use a range of entry tests to confirm correct Veres needle placement.|$|R

30|$|Inversion of {{dynamics}} {{system has}} a history {{that goes back to}} as early as 1960 s first developed by Brocket and Mesarovic in 1965 [16]. Silverman [17] in 1969 developed an iterative inversion schemes for multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) for time invariant as well as time variant systems by successive differentiation and partitioning the output variable. Over and above its simplicity and efficiency, the algorithm could test for the existence of the inverse such that <b>prior</b> <b>check</b> was not necessary. Massey and Sain [18] in the same period discussed the existence, properties and the development scheme of inverses of linear systems. As a result, their quest yielded a different inversion method from that of Silverman. In the decade that followed, Moylan [15] refined the previous work on inversion and developed another algorithm with enhanced efficiency and an inverse model stability criterion. Hirschorn extended the procedures earlier developed for linear system inversion to nonlinear systems.|$|R
40|$|The dairy {{industry}} {{is among the}} most polluting of the food industries in volume in regard to its large water consumption. The present work was related to investigations about practices of water management of 11 dairy plants. Treatment of the process water produced in the starting, equilibrating, stopping and rinsing processing units was proposed to produce water for reuse in the plant and to lower the effluent volume. Reverse osmosis of such wastewaters, collected in dairy plants, was performed after a <b>prior</b> <b>check</b> of their stability during storage. Filtration performances were focused on permeate flux versus water recovery and on water quality (TOC, conductivity). Reverse osmosis water similar to available vapour condensates (produced in drying processes) can be achieved allowing this water to be reused for heating, cleaning and cooling purposes.

The Ministry of All-German Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior had significantly influenced the decision. During the interdepartmental voting process, the BMG managed to secure acceptance that a statement be required from public sector employees. All civil servants and other workers in the public sector were to declare that they had not been members of the KPD or any affiliated organisations after 8 May 1945. Members of the Federal Postal Ministry (Bundespostministerium) now indicated concerns with this approach. They were unwilling to dismiss anyone for political reasons without comprehensive <b>prior</b> <b>checks.</b> Anticommunist experts in the BMG immediately pounced on this cautious attitude. They appealed to the officials’ morale and to their ethical courage: as ‘superiors within the Federal government’, the reasoning went, the waverers ought to be ‘first-line combatants for democracy’.

40|$|Introduction: An {{essential}} {{quality of}} non-ionic contrast agents {{is that of}} containing in their chemical composition, elements with high atomic weight, which determine an increasing absorption of the X-ray beam and this will cause intense radiopacity. The possibilities for radiological exploration with non-ionic contrast agents are very wide. Currently the radiological examination with contrast agent no longer constitutes a risky step in medical diagnosis. Aims: To highlight the importance of using the non-ionic contrast agents Optiray 350 and Ultravist 370 in dog’s myelography and to compare the changes induced in cerebrospinal fluid and blood biochemical constituents by the administration of those non-ionic contrast substances. Materials and Methods: To {{determine the influence of}} non-ionic preparations Optiray 350 and Ultravist 370 on cerebrospinal fluid and on some haematological parameters were included in the study a total of 10 dogs. Results: Myelographies with Optiray 350 and Ultravist 370 in dogs with severe spinal condition negatively influence biochemical and haematological blood status, being necessary to take preventive measures. Optiray 350 and Ultravist 370 administration cause a slight sensitization of liver with blood biochemical parameters return to normal within 24 - 48 hours. Conclusion: Non-ionic contrast agents Optiray 350 and Ultravist 370 offer a very good opacification of the subarachnoidian space, but because it causes liver sensitization, we recommend using them with caution and only after a <b>prior</b> <b>check</b> of liver function...|$|R
