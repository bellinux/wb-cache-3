5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Deception and <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> {{are central}} themes {{in this novel}} as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E

First-year students begin the BGeX program during the BGeX Introduction Weekend {{prior to the start}} of the semester and continued taking courses designed to meet BGeX criteria throughout the four years of the undergraduate programs.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> and mathematics.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{affect the}} amount of pain experienced {{and the degree to}} which it interferes with daily life; and the American Institute of Medicine and the American Pain Society support the inclusion of expert, quality-controlled psychosocial care as part of cancer pain management. Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring). Education may be more helpful to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E

Other applications of the function are cited, but not described. The <b>problems</b> <b>solved</b> concern Wien’s displacement law and the fringing fields of a capacitor, the latter problem being representative of some <b>problems</b> <b>solved</b> using conformal transformations. The physical content of the solutions remains unchanged, but they gain a new elegance and convenience. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} aims at testing (1) {{a comparative}} advantages between the realistic mathematics education (RME) and Regular (Reg) approaches in gaining {{the ability of}} mathematics communication and problems solving; (2) a comparative advantages between the field independent (FI) and field dependent (FD) cognitive style in gaining the ability of mathematics communication and <b>problems</b> <b>solving,</b> (3) an interaction effects between instructional approach and student 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive style in gaining the mathematics communication ability and <b>problems</b> <b>solving</b> ability. To achieve those objectives, it was conducted a research by employing the factorial 2 x 2 version of quasi-experiment non equivalent control group design. Based on the data analysis, {{it has been found}} the following results: (1) the students who were facilitated by the RME approach better than the others who used Reg approach in attaining the ability of mathematics communication and word <b>problems</b> <b>solving,</b> (2) the FI students group better than the FD students group in achieving the mathematics communication and word <b>problems</b> <b>solving</b> ability, (3) there was an interaction effect between the instructional approach (RME and Reg) and cognitive style (FI and FD) in the mathematics communication and the word <b>problems</b> <b>solving</b> ability...|$|R
