25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each <b>powered</b> <b>axle.</b> In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E
500|$|Rogers {{locomotives}} were, {{from very}} early in the company's history, seen as powerful, capable engines on American railroads.
