5|$|The {{case had}} all the {{elements}} to ignite a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the <b>poor</b> <b>girl,</b> the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the detective work by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of the events), and Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement. As a consequence, the case created its own small industry.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a <b>poor</b> <b>girl,</b> and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E
40|$|I aim {{to explore}} Trajan's motive for {{providing}} grand munificence to <b>poor</b> <b>girls</b> by examining depictions of <b>poor</b> <b>girls</b> on coins and his arch in Beneventum. I also explore {{the use of}} education {{as part of this}} political agenda of emperors to create this debt. Through my examinations, I suggest that Trajan used his munificence to create an obligatory debt to reduce the possibility of <b>poor</b> <b>girls</b> gaining freedom and autonomy. Emperors depended on these <b>poor</b> <b>girls</b> because when they became older, they had the ability to populate the Empire with their children. Their children then could become laborers and soldiers, or future vessels of more children for the Roman Empire...|$|R

25|$|Before the 1950s, Hamama had leading {{roles in}} 30 films, {{in which she}} often {{played the role of}} a weak, empathetic, <b>poor</b> <b>girl.</b> After the 1950s, Hamama was in search of her real {{identity}} and was trying to establish herself as a distinct figure. During this period, her choice of material and roles was somewhat limited. However, film producers soon capitalised on her popularity with audiences in local and Middle Eastern markets. She began to play realistic, strong women, such as in Sira' Fi Al-Wadi (صراع في الوادي, Struggle in the Valley, 1954) where she portrayed a rich man's daughter who, contrary to stereotype, was a realistic woman who helped and supported the poor. In the 1952 film Miss Fatmah (الأستاذة فاطمة), Hamama starred as a law student who believed women were as important as men in society.|$|E
500|$|Devadasu was {{directed}} by Vedantham Raghaviah and produced by D. L. Narayana under the production banner of Vinodha Pictures. It was produced simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages (the latter as Devadas) [...] The film's script, which was written by Aluri Chakrapani, {{was based on the}} novel Devdas by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. The story of Devadasu revolves around a feudal lord's son Devadas falling in love with a <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> Parvati. Due to differences in their social and economic status, Devadas cannot marry his childhood love and Parvati marries an old man. Unable to forget her, he becomes alcoholic. Devadasu was the first Telugu adaptation of Chattopadhyay's novel, and Devadas was the second Tamil adaptation of the same, following the 1937 Devadas directed by and starring P. V. Rao.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{included}} two nude studies {{in this first}} exhibitiona provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910. In The Red Jacket, a young woman {{stands in front of}} a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back. She is so frail, and her downcast face looks so forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as [...] "a <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> who was cold". The other, White Azaleas, is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch. [...] Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's La maja desnuda and Édouard Manet's Olympia. Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of White Azaleas looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} {{he goes to}} the play himself and sees his lover at a play called First Love; for him this is a sign, like a four leaf clover, that she must be the one. But {{confusion}} sets in for the <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> because of mistaken identity. She is unable to make up her mind about love and says, [...] "The first love is the true love, and one loves only once." [...] But Kierkegaard says this is sophistry [...] "because the category first, {{is at the same time}} a qualitative and a numerical category." [...] Her first impression of love, when she was eight, has become decisive for her whole life. [...] Now she can love only to a certain degree because she's comparing each new experience with the past experience. Kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845.|$|E
500|$|The {{story as}} it had {{appeared}} in the London Daily Advertiser had already aroused the public's interest. [...] Fielding had left London believing that he had [...] "ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for me to give myself in this affair", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several [...] "Noble Lords" [...] had attempted to contact him. [...] On 15February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. [...] Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, [...] "either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the <b>poor</b> <b>Girl</b> as a Recompence [...] for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through". [...] A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. [...] George Squires could not be found.|$|E
500|$|Pamela {{crashed into}} an oil tanker {{at the end}} of the tenth season of Dallas. The exit storyline was the subject of notable controversy. It was left open ended after Principal left the show and the {{audience}} had no idea where the character was going. Hal Erickson of MSN.com said, [...] "Although Victoria Principal had left Dallas {{at the end of}} season ten, by the time the series' 11th season rolled around, Principal's character, Pamela Ewing, was still lingering about, swathed in bandages after being seriously injured in a car accident. As if to lead viewers to the conclusion that Pamela would suddenly make a complete recovery in the tradition of her husband Bobby Ewing's (Patrick Duffy) [...] "return from the dead" [...] at the outset of season ten, the ultimate fate of Pamela was left unresolved for several weeks—and further complicated when the <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> suddenly vanished from her hospital bed." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a leading}} role {{opposite}} Aditya Pancholi and Saif Ali Khan in Sanjay Gupta's box office flop, the reincarnation romance Hameshaa, Kajol starred as an aspiring nun in Rajiv Menon's Tamil film – the romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu – opposite Arvind Swamy and Prabhu Deva. Kajol revealed that she found dancing alongside Prabhu Deva difficult and it [...] "took me 20 retakes and 30 rehearsals" [...] to get the steps right. Her performance met with appreciation with The Indian Express reviewing, [...] "Kajol is full of beans and fits into her character with commendable ease. Hers is {{perhaps one of the}} most expressive faces of the present." [...] The film was dubbed in Hindi as Sapnay and released in Northern India. The original Tamil version was a box office success, but the dubbed version emerged as a commercial failure. Her next release was Indra Kumar's romantic comedy Ishq alongside Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Ajay Devgn, in which she played Kajal, a <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> in love with a rich boy, played by Devgn. Upon release, the film emerged as a major commercial success, with critical praise directed to the performances of the four leads.|$|E
500|$|Watts's {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} the image of Hope had near-miraculous redemptive powers. In his 1908 work Sermons in Art by the Great Masters, Stoke Newington Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of Hope in a shop window and been so inspired by the sight of it that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia. In 1918 Watts's biographer Henry William Shrewsbury wrote of [...] "a <b>poor</b> <b>girl,</b> character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" [...] seeing a photograph of Hope, using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until [...] "looking at it every day, the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour". When music hall star Marie Lloyd died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of Hope; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked [...] "like a good deed in a naughty world".|$|E

500|$|In 1993, {{she played}} a young wife in the CBS miniseries Return to Lonesome Dove, Nonnie Parker in the Disney film A Far Off Place and had a minor role in Jack the Bear, which {{garnered}} her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star. The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film S.F.W., directed by Jefery Levy. [...] In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller Fear alongside Mark Wahlberg, as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller Freeway, alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields, where she held the lead role. [...] Her character in Freeway, Vanessa Lutz, is a <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> living in Los Angeles, who encounters a serial killer {{on the way to}} her grandmother's home in Stockton. The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, [...] "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." [...] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star. The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, [...] "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie– which scared me to death– I felt like I could try anything." ...|$|E

Film critic Tadao Sato said Shindo had [...] "inherited from his mentor Mizoguchi his central theme of worship of womanhood...Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Shindo's view of women blossomed under his master's encouragement, but once in bloom revealed itself to be of a different hue...Shindo differs from Mizoguchi by idealizing the intimidating capacity of Japanese women for sustained work, and contrasting them with shamefully lazy men." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Third Reich, the Grimms' {{stories were}} used to foster nationalism, and the Nazi Party decreed that [...] was a book which each {{household}} should own; later, in Allied-occupied Germany, the book was banned for a period. In the US, the 1937 release of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs shows the triumph of good over evil, innocence over oppression, according to Zipes—a popular theme that Disney repeated in 1959 during the Cold War with the production of Sleeping Beauty. The Grimms' tales have provided much of the early foundation on which the Disney empire was built. In film, the Cinderella motif, {{the story of a}} <b>poor</b> <b>girl</b> finding love and success, continues to be repeated in movies such as Pretty Woman, The Princess Diaries, , Ever After, Maid in Manhattan, and Ella Enchanted.
