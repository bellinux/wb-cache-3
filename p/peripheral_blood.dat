40|$|Abstract Background. As arteries become stiffer with ageing, {{reflected}} waves {{move faster}} and augment late systolic pressure. We investigated the age dependency of peripheral and central systolic pressure, pressure amplification (<b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure - central systolic <b>blood</b> pressure), and <b>peripheral</b> and central systolic augmentation (maximal systolic pressure minus the first {{peak of the}} pressure wave). Methods. We randomly recruited 1420 White Europeans (mean age, 41. 7 years). <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure and central systolic blood pressure were measured {{by means of an}} oscillometric sphygmomanometer and pulse wave analysis, respectively. Results. In cross-sectional analyses (731 women, 689 men), central systolic blood pressure and central systolic augmentation increased more with age than <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>peripheral</b> systolic augmentation. These age-related increases were greater in women than men. The age-related decrease in pressure amplification was similar in both sexes. In longitudinal analyses (208 women, 190 men), the annual increases in central systolic blood pressure and central systolic augmentation were steeper (p < 0. 001) than those in <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>peripheral</b> systolic augmentation with no sex differences (p ≥ 0. 068), except for peripheral systolic augmentation, which was larger in women (p = 0. 002). Longitudinally, pressure amplification decreased more with age in women than men (p = 0. 012). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, age was the overriding determinant of <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure and central systolic blood pressure. Conclusion. With ageing, <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure approximates to central systolic blood pressure. This might explain why in older subjects <b>peripheral</b> systolic <b>blood</b> pressure becomes the main predictor of cardiovascular complications. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} c. 343 A>G and c. 2216 A>C polymorphism sites in the CDH 17 gene and colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: Ninety-three non-consanguineous colorectal carcinoma patients admitted to the Department of Oncology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were included in this study. Ninety-three <b>peripheral</b> venous <b>blood</b> samples, of approximately one milliliter from each patient, were collected between December 2009 and August 2010. The genomic DNA of these <b>peripheral</b> venous <b>blood</b> samples were extracted and purified using a Fermentas Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Fermentas, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x 2019;s protocol. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the liver-intestine cadherin (CDH 17) gene c. 343 A>G and c. 2216 A>C were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method (PCR-SSCP) in 93 <b>peripheral</b> venous <b>blood</b> samples from patients suffering with colorectal carcinoma. Typical samples that showed different migration bands in SSCP were confirmed by sequencing. Directed DNA sequencing was used to check the correctness of the genotype results from the PCR-SSCP method.

25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E
