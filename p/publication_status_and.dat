Effects of social motive (prosocial vs. egoistic) and resistance to yielding (high vs. low vs. unknown) on contenting, problem solving, and joint outcomes were examined. Consistent with Dual Concern Theory, results showed that negotiators were less contentious, engaged in more problem solving, and achieved higher joint outcomes {{when they had a}} prosocial rather than egoistic motive, but only when resistance to yielding was high (or unknown) rather than low.

Using data from a study of publication bias (39 meta-analyses, 394 published and 88 unpublished trials) and language bias (29 meta-analyses, 297 English language trials and 52 non-English language trials), we compare results from logistic regression models, with and without robust standard errors to allow for clustering on meta-analysis, with results using a 'meta-meta-analytic' approach that can allow for between- and within-meta-analysis heterogeneity. We also consider how to allow for the confounding effects of different trial characteristics.

40|$|Abstract Systematic reviews {{can provide}} timely, {{reliable}} evidence {{on which to}} make informed decisions. In order to make balanced decisions, information is not only needed {{on the benefits of}} an intervention, but also on its adverse effects. Yet few systematic reviews incorporate adverse effects data in their analysis. There is currently a lack of guidance on how to identify adverse effects data, this may impede systematic reviewers. This thesis helps address this situation by evaluating and optimising the methods for retrieval of research evidence for systematic reviews of adverse effects. The first stage of this programme of research critically reviews the methodological literature relating to the retrieval and inclusion of adverse effects data, including aspects such as the impact of study design (for example RCTs and cohort studies), database search strategies (for example in MEDLINE and EMBASE), sources of data (including database and non-database sources), <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> funding status. Second, the results of a survey of the literature searching methods used in 849 systematic reviews of adverse effects are presented. Data were collated on aspects such as sources searched, search strategy design and the standard of reporting of the methods used. The reviews are published over a 17 year time period (1994 - 2011) thus enabling time trends analysis. The methods used in these systematic reviews of adverse effects are also compared with those reported in surveys of other types of reviews. Further potentially relevant evidence is incorporated to address gaps identified in the literature. A detailed analysis is provided of the contribution of different sources of data for adverse drug reactions using 58 included studies from a case study systematic review. The same case study systematic review is then used to measure the performance of adverse effects search filters in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Finally 242 included papers from a series of 26 systematic reviews are evaluated to strengthen the evidence base regarding adverse effects search filters and to assess individual adverse effects search terms in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index (SCI). The strengths and weaknesses of the analyses are discussed and implications for practice and guidance presented along with recommendations for future research. ...|$|E
40|$|The wide-spread {{implementation}} of institutional repositories (IR), digital libraries, preprint services, and open access journals has dramatically changed the communication options {{that are available}} to scholars. At the same time, scholarship itself is becoming digital, thereby fundamentally extending the notion of a unit of scholarly communication beyond journal papers to include multimedia files, data sets, simulations, visualizations, etc. Meanwhile, the evaluation of scholarly performance remains bound to the use of citation data derived from a subset of all available communication channels (pre-selected journals), and an ever decreasing subset of all communicated units (journal papers). Clearly, {{there is a need for}} frameworks that allow measuring scholarly activity and its impact in the context of this new reality. We discuss the architecture of a system that is being developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory that aims at determining impact and prestige rankings on the basis of aggregated usage data. This system relies on two key components. First, an architecture that allows to OAI-PMH harvest, and hence aggregate, usage logs from various scholarly communication venues. For interoperability, usage logs are expressed as XML documents that are compliant with the ContextObject of the OpenURL Standard. Second, a set of social network methods to determine impact and prestige from the temporal patterns detected in the aggregated usage data. The proposed solution can be deployed on top of any type of scholarly communication channel, and can take into account the use of scholarly communication units of all types. We discuss recent results which indicate that, when applied to articles and journals, the resulting impact rankings correlate significantly with the Institute for Scientific Information's Impact Factor, but highlight different aspects of <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> can thus form the basis of a more comprehensive assessment of scholarly impact. We speculate on how an open, freely accessible system for the evaluation of science relying on widely aggregated usage data can be applied to a wider range of scholarly communication processes then is presently the case, and can ultimately liberate the scientific community from the limitations and distortions caused by the existing singular focus on proprietary, citation based science evaluation mechanisms...|$|E

Versions of some of these papers have been submitted to conferences and workshops: the website will have more information on <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> history. GRUMPS decided to begin with a first study, partly to help the team coalesce. This involved installing two pieces of software in a first year computing science lab: one (the "UAR") to record a large volume of student actions at a low level with a view to mining them later, another (the "LSS") directly designed to assist tutor-student interaction. Some of the papers derive from that, although more are planned. Results from this first study {{can be found on the}} website. The project also has a link to UWA in Perth, Western Australia, where related software has already been developed and used as described in one of the papers. Another project strand concerns using handsets in lecture theatres to support interactivity there, as two other papers describe. As yet unrepresented in this collection, GRUMPS will also be entering the bioinformatics application area. The GRUMPS project operates on several levels. It is based in the field of Distributed Information Management (DIM), expecting to cover both mobile and static nodes, synchronous and detached clients, high and low volume data sources. The specific focus of the project (see the original proposal on the web site) is to address records of computational activity (where any such pre-existing usage might have extra record collection installed) and data experimentation, where the questions to be asked of the data emerge concurrently with data collection which will therefore be dynamically modifiable: a requirement that further pushes on the space of DIM. The level above concerns building and making usable tools for asking questions of the data, or rather of the activities that generate the data. Above that again is the application domain level: what the original computational activities serve, education and bioinformatics being two identified cases. The GRUMPS team is therefore multidisciplinary, from DIM architecture researchers to educational evaluators. The mix of papers reflects this. </p...|$|E

We sought to determine the proportion of trials submitted to the FDA in support of newly approved drugs that are published in biomedical journals that a typical clinician, consumer, or policy maker living in the US would reasonably search. We conducted a cohort study of trials supporting new drugs approved between 1998 and 2000, as described in FDA medical and statistical review documents and the FDA approved drug label. We determined <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> time from approval to full publication in the medical literature at 2 and 5 y by searching PubMed and other databases through 01 August 2006. We then evaluated trial characteristics associated with publication. We identified 909 trials supporting 90 approved drugs in the FDA reviews, of which 43 % (394 / 909) were published. Among the subset of trials described in the FDA-approved drug label and classified as "pivotal trials" for our analysis, 76 % (257 / 340) were published. In multivariable logistic regression for all trials 5 y postapproval, likelihood of publication correlated with statistically significant results (odds ratio [OR] 3. 03, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 78 - 5. 17); larger sample sizes (OR 1. 33 per 2 -fold increase in sample size, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 1. 52); and pivotal status (OR 5. 31, 95 % CI 3. 30 - 8. 55). In multivariable logistic regression for only the pivotal trials 5 y postapproval, likelihood of publication correlated with statistically significant results (OR 2. 96, 95 % CI 1. 24 - 7. 06) and larger sample sizes (OR 1. 47 per 2 -fold increase in sample size, 95 % CI 1. 15 - 1. 88). Statistically significant results and larger sample sizes were also predictive of publication at 2 y postapproval and in multivariable Cox proportional models for all trials and the subset of pivotal trials. Over half of all supporting trials for FDA-approved drugs remained unpublished >/= 5 y after approval.

40|$|Editorial group: Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. <b>Publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> date: New, {{published}} in Issue 12, 2014. Review content assessed as up-to-date: 30 November 2014. Background: Creatine is an amino acid derivative and, when phosphorylated (phosphocreatine), {{is involved in}} replenishing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the creatine kinase reaction. Cells obtain creatine from a diet rich in fish, meat, or dairy and by endogenous synthesis from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine in an approximate 50 : 50 ratio. Animal {{studies have shown that}} creatine may provide fetal neuroprotection when given to the mother through her diet in pregnancy. It is important to assess whether maternally administered creatine in human pregnancy (at times of known, suspected, or potential fetal compromise) may offer neuroprotection to the fetus and may accordingly reduce the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as cerebral palsy and associated impairments and disabilities arising from fetal brain injury. Objectives: To assess the effects of creatine when used for neuroprotection of the fetus. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014). Selection criteria: We planned to include all published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials. We planned to include studies reported as abstracts only as well as full-text manuscripts. Trials using a cross-over or cluster-randomised design were not eligible for inclusion. We planned to include trials comparing creatine given to women in pregnancy for fetal neuroprotection (regardless of the route, timing, dose, or duration of administration) with placebo, no treatment, or with an alternative agent aimed at providing fetal neuroprotection. We also planned to include comparisons of different regimens for administration of creatine. Data collection and analysis: We identified no completed or ongoing randomised controlled trials. Main results: We found no randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review. Authors' conclusions: As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review, we are unable to comment on implications for practice. Although evidence from animal studies has supported a fetal neuroprotective role for creatine when administered to the mother during pregnancy, no trials assessing creatine in pregnant women for fetal neuroprotection have been published to date. If creatine is established as safe for the mother and her fetus, research efforts should first be directed towards randomised trials comparing creatine with either no intervention (ideally using a placebo), or with alternative agents aimed at providing fetal neuroprotection (including magnesium sulphate for the very preterm infant). If appropriate, these trials should then be followed by studies comparing different creatine regimens (dosage and duration of exposure). Such trials should be high quality and adequately powered to evaluate maternal and infant short and longer-term outcomes (including neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy), and should consider utilisation/costs of health care.

40|$|Editorial group: Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. <b>Publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> date: New {{search for}} studies and content updated (no change to conclusions), {{published}} in Issue 2, 2014. Review content assessed as up-to-date: 1 December 2013. Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) {{is a form}} of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mother and baby both perinatally and in the long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is little consensus on whether or not screening for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate protocol to follow. Objectives: To assess the effects of different methods of screening for GDM and maternal and infant outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 December 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different methods of screening for GDM. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and quality assessment. We resolved disagreements through discussion or through a third author. Main results: We included four trials involving 3972 women in the review. One quasi-randomised trial compared risk factor screening with universal or routine screening by 50 g oral glucose challenge testing. Women in the universal screening group {{were more likely to be}} diagnosed with GDM (one trial, 3152 women, risk ratio (RR) 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 26 to 0. 75). This trial did not report on the other primary outcomes of the review (positive screen for GDM, mode of birth, large-for-gestational age, or macrosomia). Considering secondary outcomes, infants of mothers in the risk factor screening group were born marginally earlier than infants of mothers in the routine screening group (one trial, 3152 women, mean difference (MD) - 0. 15 weeks, 95 % CI - 0. 27 to - 0. 03). The remaining three trials evaluated different methods of administering a 50 g glucose load. Two small trials compared glucose monomer with glucose polymer testing, with one of these trials including a candy bar group. One trial compared a glucose solution with food. No differences in diagnosis of GDM were found between each comparison. However, in one trial significantly more women in the glucose monomer group screened positive for GDM than women in the candy bar group (80 women, RR 3. 49, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 11. 57). The three trials did not report on the primary review outcomes of mode of birth, large-for-gestational age or macrosomia. Overall, women drinking the glucose monomer experienced fewer side effects from testing than women drinking the glucose polymer (two trials, 151 women, RR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 7. 13). However, we observed substantial heterogeneity between the trials for this result (I² = 61 %). Authors' conclusions: There was insufficient evidence to determine if screening for gestational diabetes, or what types of screening, can improve maternal and infant health outcomes.

40|$|ADVANTAGES OF META-ANALYSIS: Literature reviews have {{traditionally}} been largely narrative. Meta-analysis now offers the opportunity to critically evaluate and statistically combine results of comparable studies or trials. Its major purposes are to increase the numbers of observations and the statistical power, and to improve the estimates of the effect size of an intervention or an association. METHODS: There is, as yet, no unanimously accepted strategy for performing a meta-analysis but researchers agree that each meta-analysis should be conducted like a scientific experiment and begin with a protocol, which clearly states its aim and methodology. Meta-analysts disagree on the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of primary studies, with relation to <b>publication</b> <b>status,</b> comparability <b>and</b> required scientific quality, but sensitivity analyses {{make it possible to}} assess the impact of various selection criteria on the results. Several statistical methods have been developed to analyse data extracted from the literature; more recently, meta-analyses have also been performed on individual subject data. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis is superior to narrative reports for systematic reviews of the literature, but its quantitative results should be interpreted with caution even when the analysis is performed according to rigorous rules. status: publishe...|$|R

It introduces the ALICE experiment {{with a focus}} on the subdetectors that are to be used for first physics. The characteristic features of ALICE – the very low-momentum cut-off, the low material budget, and the excellent PID and vertexing capabilities – that make ALICE an important contributor to LHC physics in the realm of soft QCD, are described. A selection of measurements that are accessible with data taken in a few days to 1 – 2 weeks are discussed: the pseudorapidity density dNch/dη, the multiplicity distribution, and the transverse momentum dis-tribution dNch/d pT of charged particles. The analysis procedures and the associated systematic uncertainties are briefly discussed...|$|R

Review content assessed as up-to-date: 27 November 2013. Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), although rare, {{is a major}} cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and methods of prophylaxis are therefore often used for women considered to be at risk. This may include women who have given birth by caesarean section, those with a personal or family history of VTE and women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias (conditions that predispose people to thrombosis). Many methods of prophylaxis carry risks of adverse effects, and as the risk of VTE is often low, {{it is possible that the}} benefits of thromboprophylaxis may be outweighed by harms. Guidelines for clinical practice have been based on expert opinion rather than high-quality evidence from randomised trials. Objectives: To assess the effects of thromboprophylaxis in women who are pregnant or have recently given birth and are at increased risk of VTE on the incidence of VTE and adverse effects of treatment. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (27 November 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing one method of thromboprophylaxis with placebo or no treatment, and randomised trials comparing two (or more) methods of thromboprophylaxis. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted the data. Main results: Nineteen trials, at an overall moderate risk of bias, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Only 16 trials, involving 2592 women, assessing a range of methods of thromboprophylaxis, contributed data to the review. Six trials compared methods of antenatal prophylaxis: heparin versus no treatment/placebo (two trials), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) (four trials). Nine trials assessed prophylaxis after caesarean section: four compared heparin with placebo; three compared LMWH with UFH; one compared hydroxyethyl starch (HES) with UFH; and one compared five-day versus 10 -day LMWH. One study examined prophylaxis with UFH in the postnatal period (including following vaginal births). For antenatal prophylaxis, none of the included trials reported on maternal mortality, and no differences were detected for the other primary outcomes of symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo or when LMWH was compared with UFH. The risk ratios (RR) for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: antenatal LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 0. 33; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 04 to 2. 99 (two trials, 56 women); and antenatal LMWH versus UFH, RR 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 09 to 2. 49 (four trials, 404 women). No differences were shown when antenatal LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo for any secondary outcomes. Antenatal LMWH was associated with fewer adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment (RR 0. 07; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 54; two trials, 226 women), and fewer fetal losses (RR 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 95; three trials, 343 women) when compared with UFH. In two trials, antenatal LMWH compared with UFH was associated with fewer bleeding episodes (defined in one trial of 121 women as bruises > 1 inch (RR 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 36); and in one trial of 105 women as injection site haematomas of ≥ 2 cm, bleeding during delivery or other bleeding (RR 0. 28; 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 53)), however in a further trial of 117 women no difference between groups was shown for bleeding at delivery. The results for these secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution, being derived from small trials that were not of high methodological quality. For post-caesarean/postnatal prophylaxis, only one trial comparing five-day versus 10 -day LMWH after caesarean section reported on maternal mortality, observing no deaths. No differences were seen across any of the comparisons for the other primary outcomes (symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic PE and symptomatic DVT). The RRs for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: post-caesarean LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 1. 30; 95 % CI 0. 39 to 4. 27 (four trials, 840 women); post-caesarean LMWH versus UFH, RR 0. 33; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 7. 99 (three trials, 217 women); post-caesarean five-day versus 10 -day LMWH, RR 0. 36; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 8. 78 (one trial, 646 women); postnatal UFH versus no heparin, RR 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 02 to 1. 36 (one trial, 210 women). For prophylaxis after caesarean section, in one trial (of 580 women), women receiving UFH and physiotherapy were more likely to have bleeding complications ('complications hémorragiques') than women receiving physiotherapy alone (RR 5. 03; 95 % CI 2. 49 to 10. 18). In two additional trials, that compared LMWH with placebo, no difference between groups in bleeding episodes (major bleeding; major bruising; bleeding/bruising reported at discharge) were detected. No other differences in secondary outcomes were shown when LMWH was compared with UFH post-caesarean, nor when post-caesarean HES was compared with UFH, post-caesarean five-day LMWH was compared with 10 -day LMWH, or when UFH was compared to no heparin postnatally. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and the early postnatal period, with the small number of differences detected in this review being largely derived from trials that were not of high methodological quality. Large scale, high-quality randomised trials of currently used interventions are warranted. Emily Bain, Agnes Wilson, Rebecca Tooher, Simon Gates, Lucy-Jane Davis, Philippa Middleto...|$|E

Review content assessed as up-to-date: 30 September 2015. Background: Magnesium sulphate {{has been used}} to inhibit preterm labour to prevent preterm birth. There is no consensus as to the safety profile of different treatment regimens with respect to dose, duration, route and timing of administration. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of alternative magnesium sulphate regimens when used as single agent tocolytic therapy during pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing different magnesium sulphate treatment regimens when used as single agent tocolytic therapy during pregnancy in women in preterm labour. Quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross-over and cluster trials were not eligible for inclusion. Health outcomes were considered {{at the level of the}} mother, the infant/child and the health service. Intervention: intravenous or oral magnesium sulphate given alone for tocolysis. Comparison: alternative dosing regimens of magnesium sulphate given alone for tocolysis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Main results: Three trials including 360 women and their infants were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review. Two trials were rated as low risk of bias for random sequence generation and concealment of allocation. A third trial was assessed as unclear risk of bias for these domains but did not report data for any of the outcomes examined in this review. No trials were rated to be of high quality overall. Intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered according to low-dose regimens (4 g loading dose followed by 2 g/hour continuous infusion and/or increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment), or high-dose regimens (4 g loading dose followed by 5 g/hour continuous infusion and increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment, or 6 g loading dose followed by 2 g/hour continuous infusion and increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment). There were no differences seen between high-dose magnesium sulphate regimens compared with low-dose magnesium sulphate regimens for the primary outcome of fetal, neonatal and infant death (risk ratio (RR) 0. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 12 to 1. 56; one trial, 100 infants). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence for fetal, neonatal and infant death was considered to be VERY LOW quality. No data were reported for any of the other primary maternal and infant health outcomes (birth less than 48 hours after trial entry; composite serious infant outcome; composite serious maternal outcome). There were no clear differences seen between high-dose magnesium sulphate regimens compared with low-dose magnesium sulphate regimens for the secondary infant health outcomes of fetal death; neonatal death; and rate of hypocalcaemia, osteopenia or fracture; and secondary maternal health outcomes of rate of caesarean birth; pulmonary oedema; and maternal self-reported adverse effects. Pulmonary oedema was reported in two women given high-dose magnesium sulphate, but not in any of the women given low-dose magnesium sulphate. In a single trial of high and low doses of magnesium sulphate for tocolysis including 100 infants, the risk of respiratory distress syndrome was lower with use of a high-dose regimen compared with a low-dose regimen (RR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 88; one trial, 100 infants). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence for respiratory distress syndrome was judged to be LOW quality. No difference was seen in the rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, for those babies admitted, a high-dose regimen was associated with a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit compared with a low-dose regimen (mean difference - 3. 10 days, 95 % confidence interval - 5. 48 to - 0. 72). We found no data for the majority of our secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: There are limited data available (three studies, with data from only two studies) comparing different dosing regimens of magnesium sulphate given as single agent tocolytic therapy for the prevention of preterm birth. There is no evidence examining duration of therapy, timing of therapy and the role for repeat dosing. Downgrading decisions for our primary outcome of fetal, neonatal and infant death were based on wide confidence intervals (crossing the line of no effect), lack of blinding and a limited number of studies. No data were available for any of our other important outcomes: birth less than 48 hours after trial entry; composite serious infant outcome; composite serious maternal outcome. The data are limited by volume and the outcomes reported. Only eight of our 45 pre-specified primary and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes were reported on in the included studies. No long-term outcomes were reported. Downgrading decisions for the evidence on the risk of respiratory distress were based on wide confidence intervals (crossing the line of no effect) and lack of blinding. There is some evidence from a single study suggesting a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and a reduced risk of respiratory distress syndrome where a high-dose regimen of magnesium sulphate has been used compared with a low-dose regimen. However, given that evidence has been drawn from a single study (with a small sample size), these data should be interpreted with caution. Magnesium sulphate has been shown to be of benefit in a wide range of obstetric settings, although it has not been recommended for tocolysis. In clinical settings where health benefits are established, further trials are needed to address the lack of evidence regarding the optimal dose (loading dose and maintenance dose), duration of therapy, timing of therapy and role for repeat dosing in terms of efficacy and safety for mothers and their children. Ongoing examination of different regimens with respect to important health outcomes is required. Helen C McNamara, Caroline A Crowther, Julie Brow...|$|E
40|$|<b>Publication</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> date: Edited (no {{change to}} conclusions), {{published}} in Issue 4, 2017. Background: Cannabis use disorder {{is the most}} commonly reported illegal substance use disorder in the general population; although demand for assistance from health services is increasing internationally, {{only a minority of}} those with the disorder seek professional assistance. Treatment studies have been published, but pressure to establish public policy requires an updated systematic review of cannabis-specific treatments for adults. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (compared with inactive control and/or alternative treatment) delivered to adults in an out-patient or community setting. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulaive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and reference lists of articles. Searched literature included all articles published before July 2015. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled studies examining a psychosocial intervention for cannabis use disorder (without pharmacological intervention) in comparison with a minimal or inactive treatment control or alternative combinations of psychosocial interventions. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results: We included 23 randomised controlled trials involving 4045 participants. A total of 15 studies took place in the United States, two in Australia, two in Germany and one each in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil and Ireland. Investigators delivered treatments over approximately seven sessions (range, one to 14) for approximately 12 weeks (range, one to 56). Overall, risk of bias across studies was moderate, that is, no trial was at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias or reporting bias. Further, trials included a large total number of participants, and each trial ensured the fidelity of treatments provided. In contrast, {{because of the nature of}} the interventions provided, participant blinding was not possible, and reports of researcher blinding often were unclear or were not provided. Half of the reviewed studies included collateral verification or urinalysis to confirm self report data, leading to concern about performance and detection bias. Finally, concerns of other bias were based on relatively consistent lack of assessment of non-cannabis substance use or use of additional treatments before or during the trial period. A subset of studies provided sufficient detail for comparison of effects of any intervention versus inactive control on primary outcomes of interest at early follow-up (median, four months). Results showed moderate-quality evidence that approximately seven out of 10 intervention participants completed treatment as intended (effect size (ES) 0. 71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 63 to 0. 78, 11 studies, 1424 participants), and that those receiving psychosocial intervention used cannabis on fewer days compared with those given inactive control (mean difference (MD) 5. 67, 95 % CI 3. 08 to 8. 26, six studies, 1144 participants). In addition, low-quality evidence revealed that those receiving intervention were more likely to report point-prevalence abstinence (risk ratio (RR) 2. 55, 95 % CI 1. 34 to 4. 83, six studies, 1166 participants) and reported fewer symptoms of dependence (standardised mean difference (SMD) 4. 15, 95 % CI 1. 67 to 6. 63, four studies, 889 participants) and cannabis-related problems compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3. 34, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 5. 42, six studies, 2202 participants). Finally, very low-quality evidence indicated that those receiving intervention reported using fewer joints per day compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3. 55, 95 % CI 2. 51 to 4. 59, eight studies, 1600 participants). Notably, subgroup analyses found that interventions of more than four sessions delivered over longer than one month (high intensity) produced consistently improved outcomes (particularly in terms of cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence) in the short term as compared with low-intensity interventions. The most consistent evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and particularly their combination for assisting with reduction of cannabis use frequency at early follow-up (MET: MD 4. 45, 95 % CI 1. 90 to 7. 00, four studies, 612 participants; CBT: MD 10. 94, 95 % CI 7. 44 to 14. 44, one study, 134 participants; MET + CBT: MD 7. 38, 95 % CI 3. 18 to 11. 57, three studies, 398 participants) and severity of dependence (MET: SMD 4. 07, 95 % CI 1. 97 to 6. 17, two studies, 316 participants; MET + CBT: SMD 7. 89, 95 % CI 0. 93 to 14. 85, three studies, 573 participants), although no particular intervention was consistently effective at nine-month follow-up or later. In addition, data from five out of six studies supported the utility of adding voucher-based incentives for cannabis-negative urines to enhance treatment effect on cannabis use frequency. A single study found contrasting results throughout a 12 -month follow-up period, as post-treatment outcomes related to overall reduction in cannabis use frequency favoured CBT alone without the addition of abstinence-based or treatment adherence-based contingency management. In contrast, evidence of drug counselling, social support, relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation was weak because identified studies were few, information on treatment outcomes insufficient and rates of treatment adherence low. In line with treatments for other substance use, abstinence rates were relatively low overall, with approximately one-quarter of participants abstinent at final follow-up. Finally, three studies found that intervention was comparable with treatment as usual among participants in psychiatric clinics and reported no between-group differences in any of the included outcomes. Authors’ conclusions: Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention were raised and partially resolved. Generalisability of findings was unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable although comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention was shown, in comparison with minimal treatment controls, to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least in the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention provided over more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence-based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder.

40|$|Background: Publication bias compromises the {{validity}} of evidence-based medicine, yet {{a growing body of}} research shows that this problem is widespread. Efficacy data from drug regulatory agencies, e. g., the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), can serve as a benchmark or control against which data in journal articles can be checked. Thus one may determine whether publication bias is present and quantify the extent to which it inflates apparent drug efficacy. Methods and Findings: FDA Drug Approval Packages for eight second-generation antipsychotics—aripiprazole, iloperidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, risperidone long-acting injection (risperidone LAI), and ziprasidone—were used to identify a cohort of 24 FDA-registered premarketing trials. The results of these trials according to the FDA were compared with the results conveyed in corresponding journal articles. The relationship between study outcome <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> was examined, <b>and</b> effect sizes derived from the two data sources were compared. Among the 24 FDA-registered trials, four (17 %) were unpublished. Of these, three failed to show that the study drug had a statistical advantage over placebo, and one showed the study drug was statistically inferior to the active comparator. Among the 20 published trials, the five that were not positive, according to the FDA, showed some evidence of outcome reporting bias. However, the association between trial outcome <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> <b>status</b> did not reach statistical significance. Further, the apparent increase in the effect size point estimate due to publication bias was modest (8 %) and not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{submitted}} for publication. Please see the above URL for current <b>publication</b> <b>status.</b> As peer-to-peer <b>and</b> widely distributed storage systems proliferate, {{the need to}} perform efficient erasure coding, instead of replication, is crucial to performance and efficiency. Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have arisen as alternatives to standard erasure codes, such as Reed-Solomon codes, trading off vastly improved decoding performance for inefficiencies {{in the amount of}} data that must be acquired to perform decoding. The scores of papers written on LDPC codes typically analyze their collective and asymptotic behavior. Unfortunately, their practical application requires the generation and analysis of individual codes for finite systems. This paper attempts to illuminate the practical considerations of LDPC codes for peer-to-peer and distributed storage systems. The three main types of LDPC codes are detailed, and a huge variety of codes are generated, then analyzed using simulation. This analysis focuses on the performance of individual codes for finite systems, and addresses several important heretofore unanswered questions about employing LDPC codes in real-world systems.
