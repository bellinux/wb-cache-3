When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|The December 2000 {{opening of}} the final five Green Line {{stations}} (Branch Avenue, Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the Green Line. The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> filled. Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001. That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders {{a day on the}} second day the stations were open.|$|E

5|$|While recent discoveries {{have made}} it more {{difficult}} to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the synapomorphies of such a group.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis {{of the story of}} her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> over their opposition.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{began his}} {{four years as}} a state senator as a {{political}} unknown; he ended them {{as one of the}} most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even as he <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> in his political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems. It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the assassination of McKinley in September (he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Casson's uncle, Isambard Owen, {{vice-chancellor}} at University of Bristol, {{promised her}} a place studying medicine {{if she could}} be formally matriculated to the university. She struggled with her Latin exams for two years, but eventually <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> and registered to study medicine on 1 October 1913 {{at the age of}} 32. She graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1919, and took on a role at the West Hertfordshire Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. There she noticed that patients in the women's wards were enjoying using artistic talents, and decided that such pursuits were important to treatment. She realised that these pursuits were not only keeping the patients occupied but also helping them gain self-esteem and work through their issues.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then <b>passed</b> <b>them,</b> heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E

5|$|The Manchester Martyrs– William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien– {{were members}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an {{organisation}} dedicated to ending British rule in Ireland. They were executed for the murder of a police officer in Manchester, England, in 1867, during an incident that became known as the Manchester Outrages. The trio {{were members of}} a group of 30–40Fenians who attacked a horse-drawn police van transporting two arrested leaders of the Brotherhood, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, to Belle Vue Gaol. Police Sergeant Charles Brett, travelling inside with the keys, was shot and killed as the attackers attempted to force the van open by blowing the lock. Kelly and Deasy were released after another prisoner in the van took the keys from Brett's body and <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> to the group outside through a ventilation grill; the pair were never recaptured, despite an extensive search.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Plante {{was playing}} for five {{different}} teams – the local factory team, and {{teams in the}} midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his father {{told him that the}} other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week—a considerable sum in those days—to play for a team in England, and a similar offer to play for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> up because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he {{took a job as a}} clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.|$|E
5|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, a {{successful}} slave rebellion on the French colony, then known as Saint-Domingue, allowed the local population to gain control over the government. Despite their success in removing the French colonial authorities, the various political factions that had seized control of the colony were fractious, and fighting soon broke out among them. By 1800, the War of Knives between the pro-French André Rigaud and the pro-autonomy Toussaint L'Ouverture was in full swing and Saint-Domingue was divided in two. Rigaud controlled part of the southern portion of Saint-Domingue while L'Ouverture controlled the rest of the French colony. In need of supplies and materiel, Rigaud's forces attacked any non-French ship that <b>passed</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E

On lap110, Kurt Busch moved to the first position, but after four laps, he was passed by Bowyer. Bowyer was passed by Truex two laps later on lap116, but Truex, Jr. himself was passed by Busch on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|The Russian forces, however, kept advancing. The Polish army, {{under the}} command of Józef Poniatowski, was still {{retreating}} in order, yielding to the more powerful enemy as necessary to avoid annihilation, according to the Prince's judgement. In early July, near Dubno, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were betrayed by Michał Lubomirski, who was tasked with King Poniatowski with resupplying the troops; instead Lubomirski joined the Russian side, and either hid the supplies for the Polish army, or outright <b>passed</b> <b>them</b> to the Russians. Lubomirski, however, was a powerful magnate, and it took until late May for the King to officially relieve him of his command. Within about a month of the Russian invasion, the Poles have mostly retreated from Ukraine. On 7 July Kościuszko's forces fought a delaying battle with the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Battle of Włodzimierz). Meanwhile, Poniatowski's army retreated to the Bug River, where Kościuszko's units fought the Battle of Dubienka on 18 July to a draw. With about 5,300 troops Kościuszko defeated the attack of 25,000 Russians under General Michail Kachovski. Kośicuszko then had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians begun flanking his positions crossing the nearby Austrian border. Although the Poles had to retreat from the Bug River line, they were not defeated so far, and a decisive battle or battles at more favorable locations closer to Warsaw were expected.|$|E
