50|$|To have a {{well-developed}} flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) {{of straight}} pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel {{must contend with}} space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, {{it is common to}} use an elbow close-coupled to the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the <b>pump</b> <b>suction.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} mitigating the negative effect of vortex motion inside the <b>suction</b> <b>chambers</b> of centrifugal <b>pumps</b> {{in order to obtain}} better use of water resource and decrease the risk related to loss of prime. It was studied the influence of a rotating device on the vortex motion {{in the case of a}} vertical suction pipe. The device is consisting of three thin vertical cylinders symmetrically mounted on a horizontal rotating disk placed in front of the inlet section of the suction pipe. The experimental research was conducted for various diameters of the cylinders, water levels in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and <b>pump</b> flow rates. It was assessed the vortex type, frequency of arising and living life of vortices. The experimental results are compared with the case the device is absent in order to assess the efficiency of the solution. By using the device a decrease of about 12  15 % of vortex arising is observed for most of the water levels in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and for 80 - 90 % of the centrifugal pump flow rates. If high flow rates and low water level in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> are simultaneously present, violent vortex motion is blocking the rotating device and the volume of air entered the pipe is massive - extreme regime. The flow pattern in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> was visualized using a laser sheet. At the inlet section of the suction pipe one can observe two main flow patterns: central vortex entrance for high water level in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and reduce flow rates of the centrifugal pump and lateral vortex entrance for low water level and high flow rates. The conclusions of the experiment confirm the energy dissipation of the vortices arising in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber,</b> due to utilization of the rotating device, in most of the centrifugal pump regimes...|$|R

The maximum amplitude of the pressure fluctuations is reached at location S 3, which is nearest to the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> inlet tongue.

Typically, spray pond depths of between 0.9 m and 1.5 m are recommended in the literature, with a depth of 0.9 m being most common.

40|$|Dynamic flow {{losses in}} the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> play a very {{important}} if not the main role in the efficiency decrease in screw compressors. The design of these machines, together with the accounting of flow losses and how to reduce them, is still based only on the simple analysis. Since Computational Fluid Mechanics offers today a more accurate estimation of the velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration fields within the screw compressor, such studies can be thus extended to design a suction port with the minimized flow losses. This paper presents application of a CFD procedure to calculate a screw compressor suction flow. The numerical grid of a <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> is generated by a 2 -D transfinite interpolation combined with the layer meshing technique both facilitated by use of an independent and stand-alone interface program which connects a screw compressor geometry with a conventional numerical pre-processor.

40|$|Thermal {{mixing and}} boron {{dilution}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} were analyzed with COMMIX codes. The reactor system was the four loop Zion reactor. Two boron dilution scenarios were analyzed. In the first scenario, the plant is in cold shutdown and the reactor coolant system has just been filled after maintenance on the steam generators. To flush {{the air out of}} the steam generator tubes, a reactor coolant pump (RCP) is started, with the water in the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> line devoid of boron and at the same temperature as the coolant in the system.

50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of the pump. Operation of the <b>pump</b> creates <b>suction</b> (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the <b>pump's</b> <b>suction</b> and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|R
