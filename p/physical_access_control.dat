40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this article aims to describe how the processes of information security used in a manufacturing and packaging paper company influenced the attainment of knowledge on two innovations. The study was conducted through field research, using interviews, narratives, direct observation and thematic analysis for data collection and data processing. The research started from the assumption that even {{considering the importance of}} managing information security and its benefits to an organization, the processes of logical security, and <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> would undermine the process of obtaining and transference of knowledge required by innovations. It was observed the presence of five instruments of physical and logical security: "confidentiality", "general control of protection", "antivirus", "backups" and "facility security procedures" which did not interfere negatively in obtaining knowledge. The single barrier identified for the transfer of knowledge was the lack of absorptive capacity of knowledge workers. Therefore, the case describes a situation where a clearly and consistent information security policy allowed the obtaining and transferring of knowledge necessary for innovation. In other words, the assumption of the research was rejected by the findings...|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between the two types of smart cards is the manner with which the microprocessor on the card communicates with the outside world. A contact smart card has eight contact points, which must physically touch the contacts on the reader to convey information between them. Since contact cards must be inserted into readers carefully in the proper orientation, the speed and convenience of such a transaction is not acceptable for most access control applications. The use of contact smart cards as <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> is limited mostly to parking applications when payment data is stored in card memory, and when the speed of transactions is not as important.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> is {{a matter}} of who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was {{partially}} accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical locks and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. Mechanical locks and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the highly increasing cross-linking of computer systems in computer networks, the possibilities for accessing programs operated at these machines {{is becoming more and more}} independent from the possibilities of having <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> to them. Thus the former existing <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> have to be replaced by logical <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> which ensure that computer systems are only used for the intended purpose and that the stored data are handled securely and confidentially. The efficiency of such logical protection mechanism is verified by applying software security tests. During such tests it is proved whether security functions can be bypassed especially by exploiting software errors. In this diploma thesis approaches for the automation of software security tests are examined regarding their effectiveness and applicability. The results are used to introduce a requirement and evaluation model for the qualitative analysis of such security evaluation automation approaches. Additionally, the assertion is made that a highly automated software security evaluation is not a sensible development goal referring to the estimated cost-benefit ratio which is gained by trying to realise this goal. Based on this assertion, this diploma thesis discuss es how to join the capabilities of a human tester and a software evaluation assistance system in an efficient test process. Based on this considerations, the design and implementation of a software security evaluation system which has been developed prototypically for this diploma thesis is described. This system significantly involves the human tester in the evaluation process but provides approaches for automation where possible. Furthermore this proof-of-concept prototype is evaluated regarding its practical applicability...|$|R
40|$|A cross-layer {{optimization}} {{approach for}} the <b>physical</b> and medium <b>access</b> <b>control</b> layers of {{wireless sensor networks}} is introduced in this article. This approach includes a Markov chain model, simulations, and analytical derivations that are applied {{to the analysis of}} sensor networks using impulse radio ultra-wideband signals with noncoherent energy detection. This type of communication system has low-power transmission requirements and noise like signal characteristics with low interference to other wireless systems. The energy efficiency of different Reed-Solomon code rates and uncoded case are studied in a star topology network, where slotted Aloha, as defined in the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a standard, is used as the medium access protocol. Analytical and simulation results clearly show the potential energy gains that can be achieved with the proposed optimization approach that can be also used in the evaluation and optimization of other combinations of <b>physical</b> and medium <b>access</b> <b>control</b> protocols...|$|R
