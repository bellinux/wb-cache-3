40|$|Systematic reviews {{represent}} powerful {{tools to}} identify, collect, synthesize and evaluate <b>primary</b> research <b>data</b> on specific research {{questions in a}} highly standardized and reproducible manner. They enable the defensible synthesis of outcomes by increasing precision and minimizing bias whilst ensuring transparency of the methods used. This makes them especially valuable to inform evidence-based risk analysis and decision making in various topics and research disciplines. Although seen as a gold standard for synthesizing <b>primary</b> research <b>data,</b> systematic reviews are not without limitations as they are often cost, labor and time intensive and the utility of synthesis outcomes depends upon the availability of sufficient and robust <b>primary</b> research <b>data.</b> In this paper we 1) consider the added value systematic reviews could provide when synthesizing <b>primary</b> research <b>data</b> on genetically modified organisms (GMO) and 2) critically assess the adequacy and feasibility of systematic review for collating and analyzing data on potential impacts of GMOs {{in order to better}} inform specific steps within GMO risk assessment and risk management.

25|$|While {{considering}} {{the issue of}} reliability of the <b>primary</b> <b>data</b> provided by corrective labor institutions, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the following two circumstances. On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.|$|E

500|$|Author Clemens Range dates Hans Lehmann's Knight's Cross on 8 June 1945, thus {{after the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Dönitz-decree. Walther-Peer Fellgiebel, author of Die Träger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939-1945, indicates that Lehmann received the Knight's Cross on 11 May 1945, before the Dönitz-decree prohibited the awarding of the Knight's Cross. The sequential number 317 within the Kriegsmarine, 144 within the U-boat service, associated to Lehmann's Knight's Cross is based on author Clemens Range's work Die Ritterkreuzträger der Kriegsmarine and Busch and Röll's book Der U-Boot-Krieg 1939-1945 - Die Ritterkreuzträger der U-Boot-Waffe von September 1939 bis Mai 1945.
