The elasticity <b>of</b> the total <b>tax</b> revenue both {{with respect to the}} total GDP and the non-agricultural GDP base is less than unity.

40|$|The {{economic}} substance {{doctrine is}} a judicial method {{used to assess}} transactions suspected of being nothing more than elaborate (and illicit) tax avoidance. Courts vary in their formulation of the doctrine. Generally, the test consists of (1) a subjective inquiry into the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s motivations for entering the suspect transaction and (2) an objective inquiry into whether the transaction accomplished anything beyond tax effects. Both inquiries frequently revolve around the profit potential of the suspect transaction. In making an objective inquiry into profit, courts focus on the profit potential <b>exclusive</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> - the pre-tax landscape. This Article suggests that although a pre-tax inquiry has intuitive appeal, use of the pre-tax viewpoint is flawed first because it may foster overly imaginative speculation about alternate endings for the transaction. Second, the pre-tax viewpoint does not sufficiently account for the difficulty in separating the economics of a transaction from its tax consequences. In particular, the pre-tax viewpoint fails to account for implicit taxes and tax clienteles. This Article argues for a shift to a post-tax emphasis for the objective inquiry into profit, and it proposes a two-step method for making such a shift. First, the suspect transaction would be determined to be an illegitimate tax shelter if the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s after-tax result were substantially outside the after-tax result range available on economically comparable market transactions. The after-tax result on the comparable would be computed using the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s highest rate bracket. On the other hand, if the after-tax return on the suspect transaction were substantially similar to the return available on a comparable transaction, the taxpayer would satisfy the objective inquiry. Second, {{if it is not}} possible to determine with confidence the after-tax returns for economically equivalent market comparables, the court would undertake a factor-based analysis of whether the after-tax result more likely than not resulted from economic opportunity rather than tax arbitrage...|$|R

The ability of this tariff structure to capture the real cost and benefits of DG is analyzed for this case of intermittent generation using real wind and network data from Uruguay and a standard wind turbine. A comparison is made in relation to the case with no DG placed in the network, to the case with controllable DG and to the case of intermittent DG of different capacity factors. We find that in expectation intermittent wind DG does little to reduce overall line losses or reduce peak line utilization. Consequently, under nodal pricing and amp-mile tariffs the intermittent wind resource collects very little additional revenue over the case where the intermittent wind DG source is simply paid the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> power <b>exclusive</b> <b>of</b> losses and is not compensated for freeing up network capacity.

40|$|Within the EU the {{relation}} between financial and tax accounting will be significantly influenced by the regulation adopted in June 2002 that obliges all listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts according to International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). Since dependency <b>of</b> financial and <b>tax</b> accounting according to different degrees prevails in all EU member states a linkage between IAS/IFRS and tax accounting seems to be possible. Compared to national GAAP the advantage of IAS/IFRS {{as a starting point}} for tax accounting derives from the advantages of the creation <b>of</b> a common <b>tax</b> base in the EU. However, the adoption of IAS/IFRS has to be restricted to those standards that are convenient for tax purposes. In particular, this means that tax accounting still has to follow the realisation principle as a general principle; the IAS/IFRS "fair value-accounting" therefore cannot be adopted for tax purposes. In this paper we present estimates for the consequences <b>of</b> IAS/IFRS-based <b>tax</b> accounting on the comparative effective <b>tax</b> burdens <b>of</b> companies in 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the USA). Therefore, certain provisions of IAS/IFRS were considered {{as a starting point for}} the tax base. The effective tax burdens are calculated on the basis <b>of</b> the European <b>Tax</b> Analyzer model which was enhanced for the purposes of this study. A further question arises as to what extent an <b>exclusive</b> harmonisation <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> base will effectively reduce the current EU-wide differences <b>of</b> effective company <b>tax</b> burdens. It turns out that a common tax base cannot alleviate the current EU-wide differences <b>of</b> effective company <b>tax</b> burdens. A major finding of our study reveals that the effective tax burdens in all countries considered here (except Ireland) tend to increase slightly since the tax bases tend to become broader. This offers the possibility to member states to reduce the nominal tax rate leaving the overall effective tax burden unchanged. A <b>tax</b> policy <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> cut cum base broadening would not only tend to increase the attractiveness of the member states as a location for companies. At the same time, this would reduce dispersions <b>of</b> effective <b>tax</b> burdens across industries.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} role <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> {{advisers}} in large business tax compliance. The report compares the tax advisory industries in four EU Member States, the United Kingdom (UK), the Republic of Ireland (Ireland), the Netherlands and Germany. The {{focus is on}} the professional background <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> advisers and the regulatory frameworks in which advisers operate. In the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, tax advice is provided by different types <b>of</b> professionals – <b>exclusive</b> <b>tax</b> advisers, lawyers, accountants and others. The German system stands out as all tax related work is reserved to a strongly protected tax advisory profession. Due to high entrance criteria to the profession, as well as strict professional duties, German tax advisers enjoy a strong reputation. The non-protected status of the British, Irish and Dutch tax professions has resulted in a more dynamic and client oriented approach <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> advisers. In addition, the number <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> <b>tax</b> advisers the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands is smaller than in Germany, and, in contrast to the German situation, {{it is not so much}} tax advisory work that leads to access to non-tax work, but non-tax work leading to tax advisory assignments. Tax advisers in Europe are subject to  highly  different  regulatory  frameworks.  Two  main types of regulation can be distinguished. First, there are rules aimed at the tax profession directly, which are mostly documented in laws, codes, standards, or a combination thereof. Direct regulations are most strongly developed in Germany, and, with the exception of anti- terrorism financing regulations, virtually absent in the British, Irish and Dutch tax systems. Second, the regulatory framework provides indirect forms of regulation by setting out how services provided by tax advisers should be organised. These regulations are scarce in the German system, but prevalent in the British, Irish and Dutch tax systems. Hence, the report demonstrates that a low degree of regulation <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> advisory profession goes together with a high degree of regulation and supervision of the work in which tax advisers  are involved. The role <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> advisers in the British, German, and Dutch tax system has been eroded in recent years. The position <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> advisers has been affected most strongly in the Netherlands with the introduction of horizontal monitoring. A main conclusion of the report is that in order to adequately identify the  relationship between tax advisers and taxpayers’ compliance, a multidimensional analysis is required of the advisory profession within the wider regulatory landscape, not limited to regulations that directly apply to the tax profession but comprise all regulations that affect tax advisory work. What initially appear to be very heterogeneous European regulatory frameworks for tax advisers, are in practice systems that are much more convergent in terms of the regulatory output they produce regarding tax advisory work.
