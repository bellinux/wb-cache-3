25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, <b>pivotable</b> mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the anti-roll bar) to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar, and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the <b>pivotable</b> mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E
