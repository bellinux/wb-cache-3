5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing <b>paid</b> <b>work,</b> and that a man's time spent doing <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

I find that across wage deciles, within wage deciles, and within industry and occupation groups, the most highly <b>paid</b> <b>worked</b> fewer hours than the lowest paid in the 1890 s but that by 1973 differences in hours worked were small and by 1991 the highest <b>paid</b> <b>worked</b> the longest day. I examine several explanations for the compression in the length of the work day and investigate the implications of hours inequality for earnings inequality.

5|$|Middle-class {{families}} {{often use}} substitutes for domestic {{work to make}} up for the lost time while working in the paid sector. They buy time taking care of children by using hired help and day-care centers.

5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need.

5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as <b>paid</b> <b>work,</b> so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
40|$|The {{invaluable}} {{social and}} economic contribution that women collectively make is often undervalued and underestimated. This paper attempts to address this to some extent, by providing a contemporary assessment of women’s contribution to <b>paid</b> off-farm <b>work</b> in rural and agricultural communities in Australia. As part of the analysis, women’s contributions to <b>paid</b> off-farm <b>work</b> activities are examined. Measures of the contribution of women {{in terms of their}} contribution to <b>paid</b> off-farm <b>work</b> are calculated using values derived from specially constructed models. A brief literature review of relevant research concerning the determinants of women’s contribution to <b>paid</b> off-farm <b>work</b> in the agricultural and rural communities is also incorporated. The findings presented are thus largely based on current research, with one of the main goals of the exercise being to provide more complete information regarding the contribution of women to agricultural and rural communities, to improve future policy development and implementation in relevant areas...|$|R

5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and <b>paid</b> <b>work,</b> work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
40|$|There {{is now a}} large {{literature}} {{documenting the}} significance of <b>paid</b> domestic <b>work</b> as a sector of employment for women (Gregson and Lowe 1994; England and Steill 1997). In this article I focus on {{the ways in which}} gender hierarchies intersect with those of caste in the organisation of <b>paid</b> domestic <b>work</b> in a village on the outskirts of Delhi, India. The article has two broad aims. First, I seek to examine some {{of the ways in which}} <b>paid</b> domestic <b>work</b> is organised in India and highlight the social stratification that is central to the organisation of such work. I focus on part-time <b>paid</b> domestic <b>work</b> in which the tasks performed and the organisation of labour have specific spatial dimensions and are based on the caste division of labour. Part-time paid domestic workers usually live in their own households and visit the employer's house once or twice a day to perform the tasks for which they are <b>paid.</b> They often <b>work</b> in more than one house. Thus, part-time implies that the domestic worker's labour and time are not exclusively available to one employer, unlike the case of full-time domestic workers. Secondly, the article explores some aspects of the gendered re-negotiation of these tasks following urbanisation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Paid</b> {{informal}} <b>work</b> {{is often}} conceptualized {{as a form}} of economic activity conducted under work relations akin to formal employment, heavily imbued with profit motivations {{on the part of both}} the consumer and supplier. The aim of this article, however, is to evaluate critically this market-oriented reading of <b>paid</b> informal <b>work.</b> Drawing upon face-to-face interviews with 350 households in five localities in rural England, the finding is that just 7 percent of paid informal tasks are conducted for businesses and people that sup-pliers do not define as friends, neighbors, or kin, and only 17 percent for primarily profit-motivated purposes. This article thus displays the need to move away from a market-oriented reading of <b>paid</b> informal <b>work</b> and to recognize the heterogeneity of the social relations and motives involved in this sphere...|$|R
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} <b>paid</b> <b>work</b> vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

Changing labor supply elasticities explain the compression in the distribution of the length of the work day. In the 1890 s the labor supply curve was strongly backwards bending, perhaps because men preferred to smooth hours over their work lives rather than bunch them as they do today. In fact, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution was slightly negative in the 1890 s, but by 1973 was positive. I show that the unequal distribution of work hours in the past equalized income, but that between 1973 and 1991 it magnified weekly earnings inequality, accounting for 26 percent of earnings inequality between the top and bottom declines among men, more than all of the earnings inequality among women, and 17 percent of the increase in total household earnings inequality among husband and wife households. ...|$|R
