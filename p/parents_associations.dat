50|$|Group Membership is {{the most}} {{numerous}} class of membership, and the historical basis of the Society.

A Preschool Parents Association, in the Australian Capital Territory, is an organisation founded as a partner with {{the government for the}} establishment and material support of a particular preschool. Its members are the parents of the children enrolled in that preschool in any given year. Since 2006 the Territory Government has adopted a changed strategy for the foundation and management of preschools, now administering them {{as an integral part of}} a primary school; however the Preschool <b>Parents</b> <b>Associations</b> which previously existed have an independent corporate character and remain operational with their partnership arrangement now being conducted directly with a school instead of with the Department of Education.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{founding}} of the New York Charter Parents Association, Davids became the leader of an effort to make certain changes in New York State Education Law and the Charter Schools Act. For example, she [...] "fought to require public schools receive matching funds to renovate their space when co-located with a charter school." [...] Changes passed in 2010 as a result of Davids' activism include: requiring charter schools to accept a certain number of students with special needs and who speak English as a second language, requiring charter schools to form PTAs or <b>Parents</b> <b>Associations,</b> requiring New York City's Department of Education [...] "to provide matching renovation funds to district schools that are co-located with a charter school," [...] and requiring that [...] "every district and charter school co-located in a public school building have a shared-space committee consisting of a parent and teacher from the charter school and other schools in the building." [...] Another change Davids advocated for was the denial to the New York City Department of Education of the authority to authorize new charter schools.|$|E

5000|$|The AJCongress was {{involved}} in legal proceedings that sometimes conflicted with other Jewish American organizations. In 1966 the AJCongress joined the New York Civil Liberties Union, the United <b>Parents</b> <b>Associations</b> and the United Federation of Teachers in filing suit against provisions of the Federal Education Act, which would provide support to religious schools. Jewish day school educators and leaders in over 30 states and over 100 communities representing 330 Hebrew day schools insisted that the American Jewish Congress did not speak for American Jews on religious or educational issues and is viewed by some in the Jewish community as primarily a secular agency. Then president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (also known as the Orthodox Union), Rabbi Joseph Karasick, said that the American Jewish Congress “speaks for itself only and is under no circumstances to be taken as representing the American Jewish community. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, central spokesman for this country’s 3,100 Orthodox synagogues, {{as well as all}} Orthodox rabbinic bodies and every other Orthodox Jewish body, have given full support to the Federal Education Act and deem its provisions to be consonant with the principle of church-state separation.” ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the city}} became more {{congested}} and families {{moved out to}} the country, there was an urgent need to move the school as well. The 26 acre property known as The Orchards was purchased in 1928 from the Gordon family {{north of the city}} line, and the school spent several years acquiring the funds to gradually move out of its home downtown and into renovated and new buildings in the country. The Depression and then the Second World War made it difficult to sell the former school building to the eventual buyers, the German Singing Societies, but the Alumnae and the <b>Parents</b> <b>Associations</b> worked dutifully to raise funds for the needs of modern education. Over the years buildings have been added as needed. The same stone that had been used to build the Gatehouse in the 19th century was found at the Butler quarry in Baltimore County and was used in the construction of Garrett (1931), Hamilton (1953), and the North Building (2007). Other structures built of complementary materials include Howell (1969) which houses the Upper School and the Edith Hamilton Library, Hardy (1969) for science and math, the Cafeteria (1948), Katherine Van Bibber Gymnasium (1959), the Lower School complex designed by Marcel Breuer (1972), Centennial Hall (1987), the Barbara Landis Chase Dance Studio (1992), the Lower School Science building (1996), the Admissions Cottage (1997), and a variety of small outbuildings and additions. Many of these structures have been recognized for excellence in design.|$|E
