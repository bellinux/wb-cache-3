5|$|According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 {{residents}} of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, {{were killed and}} 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants</b> that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's {{infrastructure}} and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, {{it was a}} primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). During the counteroffensive, the IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants</b> had sought refuge. The siege lasted for 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the wanted militants to various foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants.</b> Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E

5|$|Recently, Israel has {{modified}} {{a number}} of its Merkava main battle tanks with ambulance features {{in order to allow}} rescue operations to take place under heavy fire in urban warfare. The modifications were made following a failed rescue attempt in which Palestinian gunmen killed two soldiers who were providing aid for a Palestinian woman in Rafah. Since M-113 armored personnel carriers and regular up-armored ambulances are not sufficiently protected against anti-tank weapons and improvised explosive devices, it was decided to use the heavily armored Merkava tank. Its rear door enables the evacuation of critically wounded soldiers. Israel did not remove the Merkava's weaponry, claiming that weapons were more effective protection than emblems since <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants</b> would disregard any symbols of protection and fire at ambulances anyway. For use as ground ambulances and treatment & evacuation vehicles, the United States military currently employs the M113, the M577, the M1133 Stryker Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), and the RG-33 Heavily Armored Ground Ambulance (HAGA) as treatment and evacuation vehicles, with contracts to incorporate the newly designed M2A0 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV), a variant of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (formerly known as the ATTV).|$|E
25|$|The IDF {{employed}} infantry, commando forces, {{and assault}} helicopters. <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants</b> had {{prepared for a}} fight, booby trapping the camp, and after an Israeli column walked into an ambush, the army began to rely more heavily {{on the use of}} armored bulldozers to clear out booby traps laid inside the camp. On April 11, <b>Palestinian</b> <b>militants</b> began to surrender. Israeli troops began withdrawing from the camp on April 18.|$|E
