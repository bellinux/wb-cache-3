40|$|For designers, a key {{consideration}} {{to improve the}} environmental performance of new products and services is energy and resource efficiency (eco-efficiency). This is particularly important for household energy using products (EuPs) as they consume significant energy during the consumption (use) phase of their lifecycle. EuPs incorporate many types of consumer electrical and electronic products, including televisions and computers {{as well as the}} many other <b>powered</b> <b>kitchen,</b> laundry, bathroom and personal electronic devices of which ownership, both individually and cumulatively has increased dramatically in modern households. A consequence of EuP ownership and changing behavioural patterns is that EuPs cumulative contribution to overall household energy use is increasing in Australia, at 4. 7 % per annum. This is despite the sustained efforts over many years to improve energy efficiency of individual EuPs that is claimed to have improved at a rate of 2 % per annum since 1970. This begs exploration of the drivers underpinning this divergence between predicted energy conservation through efficiency and actual energy use. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate why household energy use from EuPs continues to rise. Such situations are described as ‘rebound effects’ where ‘designed in’ energy savings are not achieved. Exploring the proposition of the rebound effect, this study investigates design, ownership and use parameters of televisions (and peripheral equipment), washing machines, dishwashers and refrigerators benchmarked over a period of time. Drawing upon a variety of technical and behavioural criteria, data is mapped and presented for analysis to locate, identify and remark upon the qualities and significance of a likely rebound effect. Such information, where identified, highlights the hidden implications and significance of product use and user behaviour in shaping the success, or otherwise, of design strategies to conserve energy and consumption...|$|R

However, until that happens, there will continue to be dehydrated and thermostablized foods providing the bulk of the astronauts food. In order for the astronauts to have adequate macronutrients, a food system must be developed including raising plants and food preparation, both a major challenge given the limited water, volume, and <b>power.</b> The lunar <b>kitchens</b> will be very different, but good food is essential to maintain good health...|$|R
5000|$|Electricity {{changed the}} lives of farm families, {{from the moment they}} got up early in the morning, through meals, chores, and work until they went to bed at night. Electricity brought power for lights to work, read, and sew at night; power for {{appliances}} like refrigerators and freezers to preserve food; <b>power</b> for small <b>kitchen</b> devices such as mixers and blenders; and power for other labor saving devices such as electric stoves, irons and clothes washers. Electricity brought changes that just made life safer and better - like colored lights instead of dangerous candles on Christmas trees, refrigerators to keep food fresh and electric fans to bring relief on a hot summer day.|$|R

On his way to the room, Bryan encounters someone shining a torch in his face, before he is attacked. Patty and Craig make it to Joanne's room but Bryan does not show up, so Joanne stays behind while Craig and Patty go downstairs to try to reconnect the <b>power.</b> In the <b>kitchen,</b> they get separated and Patty is grabbed from behind and knocked unconscious by the killer, who then drops her into an industrial pressure cooker and closes the lid.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{devices have}} {{permeated}} deeply into our daily living and activities. Microcontrollers are tiny, self-contained computers embedded into numerous electronic and electrical products. Microcontrollers are frequently {{used as the}} “silicon brain” for controlling products that we use daily, for examples, digital thermostats, garage door openers, <b>power</b> tools, <b>kitchen</b> stoves, etc. It is desirable to establish wireless connection between a mobile device and a microcontroller so that through a mobile device a user can initiate control actions for operating the electronic and electrical products that are embedded with microcontrollers. We have made such attempt for establishing a wireless communication link between an Android tablet/cellphone and a Freescale (formerly Motorola) microcontroller embedded in an electronic product. This was done in an undergraduate engineering project conducted in Summer 2014 and we have successfully established such link. Specifically, the electronic device is a speed measurement instrument controller by a Freescale microcontroller. We build this instrument in our microcontroller applications course. The mobile devices are a Samsung Galaxy Pro tablet and a Samsung Galaxy S 3 cellphone. Building upon Bluetooth technology we developed an Android app that runs on the tablet and the cellphone. Through the app the Android devices can reach into the Freescale microcontroller embedded in the speed measurement instrument wirelessly and captures the speed readings stored in the microcontroller. The app then displays these readings on the tablet and the cellphone screens. A benefit of our project is that the display panel of the instrument can be replaced by those of the Android devices and that will {{reduce the cost of}} the instrument. We were also able to transmit commands to the instrument. With necessary modification this app can be adapted to control other electronic or educational devices. In the symposium we are planning to present the details of this project and give a demonstration...|$|R

Introduction: As the heart by its ceaseless throbbing sends the stream of life through {{every part of the}} human system carrying disease or health, so the influence from the kitchen brings to the entire household weal or woe. No matter how the heart is affected, the whole system is similarly affected; and according to the working of the kitchen, the entire household is ruled. This has been true in past years, it is true of the present, and can we expect it to be less true in the future? As the <b>power</b> of the <b>kitchen</b> is more and more realized, changes for the better are made, not only in the utensils, but in the foods. The kitchen, therefore keeps pace with the general advancement of the country, in influencing and in turn being influenced by it. The first woman had one advantage over the rest of womankind, her husband could not compare her food with his mothers, yet she was justly blamed where sorrow followed after he partook of the food she offered him. From that day to this moreover woman has been censured for offering all too frequently injurious rather than good food. To realize the great progress in household economy, let us compare the past with the present and take a glance into the future. To appreciate the kitchen of today let us go back to our grandmothers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a low voltage direct current (DC) {{distribution}} {{system for a}} house or an apartment have been investigated. The feasibility of the low voltage DC systems for a home is investigated by evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages}} with respect to the existing alternating current (AC) system of homes. The goal is to make a energy efficient system that would be able to cope with local electricity generation and storage systems at the end-user level, from DC sources. Data obtained from measurements of power consumption for different household appliances such as refrigerator, microwave oven, rice cooker, dish washer etc. have been used to evaluating the systems. The performance of the 230 V AC system and the proposed low voltage DC system is analyzed by considering factors such as losses in the wire, internal loss of the device itself, investment cost for new wiring and energy consumption cost. From the investigation, it can be concluded that the 48 V DC system with optimized cable area is most economical system compared with the 230 V AC system and with a 20 years life time, it will save almost 13000 SEK. In the case of a low voltage DC distribution system, {{there is a problem with}} high power loss in the feeder for high power consuming loads. The stove is one of the high <b>power</b> consuming <b>kitchen</b> appliances and it consumes large amount of energy. This project focuses on an efficient stove design for a low DC voltage supply. To decrease the energy consumption of the stove, the idea is to combine it with the refrigerator. The heat extracted from the refrigerator is stored both in the stove, to be used for cooking and in a water tank to be used for other purposes, for example providing hot water to a dishwasher. Two individual thermoelectric modules (TEM) are used for the refrigerator and the stove. A water tank is used in the middle of the refrigerator and the stove unit. Some parts of the extracted heat from the refrigerator, is stored in paraffin inside the stove and the remaining parts of that extracted heat is stored in the water tank by raising its temperature. The calculated efficiency of the refrigerator unit is 54 %, the efficiency for heating up the water by storing the extracted heat is 154 % and for storing heat in the paraffin is 134 %. The stored heat in the water tank has the possibility to supply other devices such as a dishwasher with hot water. This would reduce the peak energy consumption of the dishwasher since it does not need to heat the water by using electricity in this case. The prototype was tested together with a dishwasher that runs on a low DC voltage and the peak power consumption was reduced by supplying hot water from water tank. The overall efficiency of the system was increased by storing the extracted heat from the refrigerator unit in a latent heat storage using paraffin and in a water tank...|$|R
