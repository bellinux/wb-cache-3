2500|$|Using vacuum <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> as {{the working}} fluid in a {{barometer}} {{has led to}} the creation of the new [...] "World's Tallest Barometer" [...] in February 2013. The barometer at Portland State University (PSU) uses doubly distilled vacuum <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> and has a nominal height of about 12.4m for the oil column height; expected excursions are in the range of ±0.4m over the course of a year. Vacuum <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> has very low vapor pressure and it is available in a range of densities; the lowest density vacuum oil was chosen for the PSU barometer to maximize the oil column height.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{allegations}} that decisions {{to go to}} war in Iraq were motivated at least partially by oil interests; for example, British newspaper The Independent reported that the [...] "Bush administration is heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law" [...] which would [...] "allow Western oil companies contracts to <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> out of Iraq up to 30 years, and the profits would be tax-free." [...] Whether motivated by it or not, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East appears to much of the world as to be motivated by an oil rationale.|$|E
2500|$|Before any {{of these}} ships entered service with the Royal Navy, they went to Burrards shipbuilders in British Columbia for some {{modifications}}. These modifications, 150 of them in total, were {{paid for by the}} Canadian government. Further modifications to turn the escort carriers into assault carriers were undertaken by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company in Dundee, Scotland. This included installing over 100 telephones in a shipboard network. A new briefing room with an army plot for operations ashore was installed and extra cabins were built, providing an additional 140 bunks. The carriers were also fitted for a secondary role of providing oil and provisions for their accompanying destroyers. Fueling could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to starting to <b>pump</b> <b>oil,</b> two hours to pump [...] of oil, and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the hose and secure the equipment.|$|E

50|$|John Henry Fairbank, a {{surveyor}} turned oil man {{who came}} to Oil Springs in 1861, bought some property and despite incurring debts and suffering family tragedies, Fairbank struck it rich, founding the successful Fairbank Oil Company that is now the oldest petroleum company in the world. He also invented the jerker line, a method used to <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> to the surface from multiple wells using a shared steam engine. Jerker lines are still used to <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> in Oil Springs today.|$|E

50|$|Electric <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are not used, {{again for}} reliability. Some 'turbo timer' {{electric}} auxiliary <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are sometimes fitted to turbocharged engines. These are a second <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing cooling oil to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{consideration}} for choosing a roughing pump {{is whether the}} pump uses lubricating oil that's exposed to the vacuum. This concern of [...] "hydrocarbon backstreaming" [...] where <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> as a gas makes {{its way into the}} vacuum chamber, has led to oil-free pump designs on the market.|$|E

50|$|As {{for other}} {{bearings}} that reciprocate, rather than rotating continuously, lubrication can be difficult. The oil wedge {{built up in}} a continuously rotating bearing is disrupted by the stop start motion of slewing. Instead, a hydrostatic bearing with <b>pumped</b> <b>oil</b> flow may be used.|$|R

5000|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a vessel {{that allows the}} transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 °C to 230 °C (140 °F to 446 °F). Investigators estimated that, due {{to the failure of}} the lean <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as [...] Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume <b>pumping</b> heated lean <b>oil</b> in to thaw it. When the lean <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> resumed operation, it <b>pumped</b> <b>oil</b> into the {{heat exchanger}} at —the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm.|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} an advanced cooling system (both lubrication and liquid-cooling) compared to many same-level new engines worldwide and also {{compared to the}} PSA TU5JP4. The EF7 has a direct-drive oil pump. The water <b>pump,</b> <b>oil</b> pump and oil coolant system are integrated in one place to reduce removal of parts for maintenance compared to other engines. Other parts are re-engineered to provide ease in changing the oil filter.|$|E
50|$|Maintenance {{cycles of}} cold cathode gauges are, in general, {{measured}} in years, {{depending on the}} gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> fractions, can result {{in the growth of}} delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.|$|E

No need for oil-filled crankcase or external <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> Instead, part of each piston acts as its own <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> circulating <b>oil</b> from reservoir. Annular space at bottom of piston and cylinder constitutes working volume of small <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> Depending on application, reservoir open to atmosphere, or sealed and pressurized in bellows to prevent contact between oil and atmosphere.

50|$|The {{earliest}} heave compensated systems came in {{the late}} 60's and were cylinder compensated systems. Such systems use hydraulic cylinders to compensate. Active heave systems <b>pump</b> <b>oil</b> into the cylinders to make them extend, or drain the oil to make them retract. Such systems may use control mechanisms based on oil-pressure rather than ship position, and can combine active and passive compensation. AHC Manipulator arms use cylinder compensation which always limits the actual working area.|$|E
50|$|The Control Actuator Section (CAS) {{is at the}} aft end of the missile. It {{receives}} commands {{from the}} missile autopilot and positions the fins. The missile fins steer and stabilize the missile in flight. A fin servo system positions the fins. The fin servo system consists of hydraulic actuators and valves and an electrohydraulic power supply. The electrohydraulic power consists of a battery, motor <b>pump,</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir, gas pressure bottle, and accumulator.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{purchased}} a used two-cylinder [...] "family cruiser" [...] lake boat at auction {{with the intention}} of customizing it. The model he purchased would have been from between the years 1900 and 1910 and was twenty-one feet in length. Among his modifications were: ignition system, water <b>pump,</b> <b>oil</b> system, spark plugs, and fuel tank. In the end, the cruiser's two-stroke engine was able to outpace the three-cylinder engine of his nemesis, Andy Foger.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who {{moves away from the}} OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> gears {{in the same way as}} Toyota's 1JZ GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII. This kit is available for most uprated RB26 <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> including Nissans own OEM, N1 and Nismo.|$|R

50|$|The oiling system {{inside a}} modern {{automotive}} or truck engine {{is similar in}} concept to the lube systems mentioned above, except that <b>oil</b> is <b>pumped</b> continuously. Much of this oil flows through passages drilled or cast into the engine block and cylinder heads, escaping through ports directly onto bearings, and squirting elsewhere to provide an oil bath. The <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> simply pumps constantly, and any excess <b>pumped</b> <b>oil</b> continuously escapes through a relief valve back into the sump.|$|R
