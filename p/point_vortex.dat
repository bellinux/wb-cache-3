We prove that there exists a 2 p-dimensional invariant dynamical system reduced by the p-shift transformation for arbitrary factor p of N. The p-shift invariant system is equivalent to the p-vortex points system generated by the averaged Hamiltonian with the modified pole vortices. It is also shown that the system can be reduced by the pole reversal transformation when the pole vortices are identical. Since the reduced dynamical systems are defined in the linear space spanned by the eigenvectors given in the linear stability analysis for the N-ring, we obtain the inclusion relation among the invariant reduced dynamical systems.

30|$|A {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to understand the kinetic theory of the 2 D <b>point</b> <b>vortex</b> system which describes the relaxation process toward a Boltzmann‐type thermal equilibrium state, especially under the negative absolute temperature. It has been anticipated that like gravitational N‐body systems, the <b>point</b> <b>vortex</b> system rapidly relaxes to a state near a thermal equilibrium state by the (collisionless) violent relaxation [2, 5]. After the violent relaxation, the system evolves to the genuine thermal equilibrium state described by the sinh‐Poisson equation [4] through a collisional slow relaxation. Its time scale can be proportional to the number of the point vortices. The <b>point</b> <b>vortex</b> gives a formal solution of the 2 D inviscid Euler equation. However, it has been anticipated that there is an viscous effect due to the discrete, pointwise distribution of the vortices [1, 3].
