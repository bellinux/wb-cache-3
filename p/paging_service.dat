25|$|Under {{its unique}} {{macro-economic}} and political environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special telecommunications policy and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at full competition. As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China Unicom was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote fair competition in the <b>paging</b> <b>service,</b> the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E

5000|$|After the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{standards}} {{had been}} fixed {{in the late}} 1970s, [...] there were thoughts about making a public digital mobile communication network. Mobitex, a Public Access Mobile Radio network standard had been conceived in 1981, and put into operation in the mid-1980s. The cooperation programme between France and Germany was known as S900 (from the 900Mhz waveband, and was analogue) and {{was expected to be}} in operation by 1986. It was decided to create a digital mobile network, GSM, in 1984, and for this to be in operation {{by the end of the}} decade. A prototype digital system, DF900, would be in place before GSM was ready. The new GSM system would have a radio <b>paging</b> <b>service.</b> The Europe-wide Eurosignal <b>paging</b> <b>service</b> had been in operation since 1974. Germany introduced its C-Netz analogue mobile phone network in 1985, based on the C450 standard; it had a digital switching system and digital control channels, and could have implemented a short data message system.|$|E
50|$|In {{a meeting}} in late October 1984, the French part of the DF900 project {{submitted}} a proposal {{for the provision of}} an enhanced <b>paging</b> <b>service,</b> with diffusion of alphanumeric messages to mobile users with acknowledgment capabilities. The messaging system would be two-way, unlike paging systems. On 12 November 1984 at {{a meeting in}} London, this proposal became simply the transmission of short alphanumeric messages with acknowledgement capabilities.|$|E

A pager need-only have signal from one network in order to operate and receive messages.SMS-Fallback Paging↵ Pagers that receive messages via standard paging channels and also include a SIM card to operate a GPRS data channel to receive messages in areas where there is poor paging reception.The combination of Dual-Frequency paging and SMS-Fallback provides a ''''Triple-Resilient' messaging service which is unique to PageOne.|$|E

50|$|The Interactive <b>Paging</b> <b>service</b> {{introduced}} wireless {{users to}} such features as peer-to-peer Delivery and Read Receipts and sending faxes and {{text to speech}} messages to a telephone. It also incorporated all the features of a traditional one way paging system (Interactive voice response, Telocator Alphanumeric input Protocol, etc..) and added two way extensions to those services. The devices communicated to the internet, peer users, and the PSTN via a Gateway which also served as the store and forward mailbox for the wireless user. Interactive Paging became known as Interactive Messaging Plus(sm) when BellSouth and SBC formed Cingular Wireless.|$|E
50|$|As {{wireless}} communication technologies {{increased in the}} late 1980s, the Pager service providers created a subscription service offered {{in a variety of}} plans and options {{to meet the needs of}} a subscriber and the type of device used. In general, all pagers are given unique telephone numbers so that callers could dial in and send a numeric message, such as their callback number or a numerically coded special message, such as room numbers to report to, etc. However, alphanumeric pagers could only receive text messages when the message sender had installed software on their PC to dial into the publicly accessible modems operated by the <b>paging</b> <b>service</b> provider to then transmit their message over-the-air through the network of radio towers.|$|E
