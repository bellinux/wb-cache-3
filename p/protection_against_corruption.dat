I examined corruption from the perspective of substantive criminal law, although it should be noted that this work cannot ignore the aspects of other disciplines such as sociology, criminology, philosophy etc., in order to make view of the detrimental phenomenon of corruption, for it undoubtedly is detrimental, complete. I am convinced that the chosen topic is relevant and needed. It is so, because only the effective and sustained efforts to combat corruption may lead to its reduction while avoiding the negative consequences of acts of corruption. These are mainly damages in the area of economic damage, although the negative impact of corruption on civil society should be also emphasized, for example corruption causes the loss of public confidence in politics, public administration and in a fair, objective, impartial decisions. If there isn't sharp fight against corruption, appropriate public education about the harmful effects of corruption and prevention, then the impression, that corruption is a necessary and integral part of our lives, raises [...] ...|$|E

The regulations of internal control doesn´t have an importance on the work against corruption. Instead, the authorities' efforts against corruption is characterized by education, work on values and policies. Further conclusions is that authorities do not use risk analyzes to counteract corruption because the risks is between what is manageable and not for the organization. Although, legitimacy and trust (reputational risk) is more important for the authorities than to actually prevent corruption (operational risk). Instead, authorities uses a more pragmatic institutionalized approach, ie work on values, policies and so on, which can be displayed for the government and citizens.

The main reason why I chose this topic is frequent complaining of the public, blaming the law enforcement authorities from dismal state of corruption in the Czech Republic.

The main aim of the thesis is therefore to answer the question, whether the instruments provided by the criminal law are sufficient for effective regulation of bribery and corruption in the Czech Republic. The thesis is composed of five chapters. Chapter one is devoted to the brief explanation of historical development of the phenomenon of corruption.

40|$|Two {{directions}} of amending the Polish penal code are {{considered by the}} authoress to be the leading ones. The first one {{is characterized by the}} strife to diminish the represiveness of the Polish penal law. The second one comprises the proposals aiming at the increase of the law abidingness. When discussing the first trend, the authoress considers the multiple changes of the penal code regulations concerning a capital punishment, deprivation of liberty pecuniary penalty and the directives of determining a penalty. The elimination of capital punishment, or its limitation to cases of manslaughter and high treason is suggested. The lower limit of deprivation of liberty is decreased (to equal one month) as well as other sanctions related to individual crimes. Deprivation of liberty up to three years is to alternate, as a rule, with a penalty of restricted liberty and a pecuniary penalty (fine). The adoption of the socalled "Scandinavian system" in meting out fines in days is advised. Varying regulations are called for in questions of criminal responsiblity of juveniles and young adult offenders. The regulation of recidivism has to be essentially changed. The conditional discontinuance of criminal proceedings is to be decided only in courts. The decrease in represiveness of penal law can also be effected by the new regulation of the conditional suspension of the enforcement of punishment and of the release on licence. The authoress advocates that the second trend of the proposed changes comprising postulates aiming at the increase of the law abidingness is out of proportion to the proposed amendments diminishing the represiveness of penal law. The scope of protection of criticism is not extended there and the grounds for the criminal responsibility of persons guilty of abuse of authority are not secured. The range of changes concerning <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> and speculation is not satisfactory either. No coordination with the provisions of the Code of Offences and the Speculation Control Act can be observed. It seems also necessary to verify the obsolete part of the detailed provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand, the extention of the smart money institution (paid by the perpetrator to the injured person) is to be classed among the changes of a right direction.

We find more than 400, 000 instances of checksum mismatches over the 41 -month period. We find many interesting trends among these instances including: (i) nearline disks (and their adapters) develop checksum mismatches an order of magnitude more often than enterprise class disk drives, (ii) checksum mismatches within the same disk are not independent events and they show high spatial and temporal locality, and (iii) checksum mismatches across different disks in the same storage system are not independent.

40|$|Abstract—Remote Data Checking (RDC) allows {{clients to}} {{efficiently}} check {{the integrity of}} data stored at untrusted servers. This allows data owners to assess the risk of outsourcing data in the cloud, making RDC a valuable tool for data auditing. A robust RDC scheme incorporates mechanisms to mitigate arbitrary amounts of data <b>corruption.</b> In particular, <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> small <b>corruptions</b> (i. e., bytes or even bits) ensures that attacks that modify a few bits do not destroy an encrypted file or invalidate authentication information. Early RDC schemes have focused on static data, whereas later schemes such as DPDP sup-port {{the full range of}} dynamic operations on the outsourced data, including insertions, modifications, and deletions. Robustness is required for both static and dynamic RDC schemes that rely on spot checking for efficiency. However, under an adversarial setting there is a fundamental tension between efficient dynamic updates and the encoding required to achieve robustness, because updating even {{a small portion of the}} file may require retrieving the entire file. We identify the challenges that need to be overcome when trying to add robustness to a DPDP scheme. We propose the first RDC schemes that provide robustness and, at the same time, support dynamic updates, while requiring small, constant, client storage. Our first construction is efficient in encoding, but has a high communication cost for updates. Our second construction overcomes this drawback through a combination of techniques that includes RS codes based on Cauchy matrices, decoupling the encoding for robustness from the position of symbols in the file, and reducing insert/delete operations to append/modify operations when updating the RS-encoded parity data.

40|$|Purpose – Are there {{different}} determinants in {{the fight}} <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> across African countries? Why are some countries more effective at battling corruption than others? To assess these concerns we examine the determinants of corruption-control throughout the conditional distribution of the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> using panel data from 46 African countries for the period 2002 - 2010. Design/methodology/approach – The panel quantile regression technique enables us to investigate if the relationship between corruption-control and the exogenous variables differs throughout {{the distribution of the}} fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption.</b> Findings – Results could be summarized in the following. (1) Greater economic prosperity leads to less corruption-control and the magnitude of the effect is more important in countries where the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> is high. (2) Regulation quality seems bimodal, with less positive effects in the tails: among the best and least fighters of corruption. (3) There is support for a less negative consequence of population growth in countries that are already taking the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> seriously in comparison to those that are lax on the issue. (4) Findings on democracy broadly indicate the democratization process increases the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> with a greater magnitude at higher quantiles: countries that are already taking the fight seriously. (5) The relevance of voice and accountability in the battle <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> decreases as corruption-control is taking more seriously by the powers that be. (6) Good governance dynamics of political stability, government effectiveness {{and the rule of law}} gain more importance {{in the fight}} <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> when existing levels of corruption-control are already high. Social implications – Our results suggest that the determinants of corruption-control respond differently across the corruption-control distribution. This implies some current corruption-control policies may be reconsidered, especially among the most corrupt and least corrupt African nations. As a policy implication, the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption</b> should not be postponed, doing so will only reduce the effectiveness of policies in the future. The rewards of institutional reforms are more positive in countries that are already seriously engaged in the corruption fight. Originality/value – This paper contributes to existing literature on the determinants of corruption by focusing on the distribution of the dependent variable(control of corruption). It is likely that good and poor corruption fighters respond differently to factors that influence the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption.</b> There are subtle institutional differences between corrupt and clean nations that may affect corruption-control determinants and government efficacy in the fight <b>against</b> <b>corruption.</b> ...|$|R
