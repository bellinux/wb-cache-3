He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship.
