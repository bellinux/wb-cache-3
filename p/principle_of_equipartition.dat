40|$|In this thesis, {{elastic wave}} {{propagation}} in metamaterials and strongly scattered random media is studied in two dimensions. Based on dispersed-inclusion geometry, an effective medium theory (EMT) is {{developed in the}} long-wavelength limit for certain elastic metamaterials, which are composed of isotropic scatterers embedded in a solid host. The effective bulk modulus, shear modulus and mass density determined by the EMT can turn negative near resonances with properly chosen resonant scatterers. The EMT is capable of predicting both the dispersion relations {{in the case of}} triangular lattices and the angle-averaged dispersion relations in the case of square lattices. By using the multiple-scattering theory (MST) method and the radiative transfer equation (RTE), the elastic wave propagation through a strongly scattered random media is numerically studied. The equilibration of the shear and compressional energy densities due to the mode conversions is clearly observed in both calculations. However, the ratio of the shear energy density to the compressional energy density obtained from MST is higher than that obtained from the RTE, which has the value predicted by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equipartition</b> <b>of</b> wave modes. The discrepancy is due to a negative interference energy inside the sample, which contradicts the common belief that the interference energy should always average to zero inside a random medium. The negative interference energy occurs close to the boundary of the cylinder and therefore cannot be averaged to zero. Various distribution functions of the transmitted fields before the establishment of the energy equilibration are studied. They are described by a random-phasor-sum model and exhibit crossover behavior from ballistic to diffusive transport...|$|R

A 4 % in the relative temperature difference across the object around room temperature suffices to excite two modes of a macroscopic oscillator, as if they were at equilibrium, respectively, at temperatures about 20 % and a factor 3. 5 higher.

40|$|We analyze {{a simple}} {{classical}} Hamiltonian system within {{the hypothesis of}} renormalizability and isotropy that essentially led Maxwell to his ubiquitous Gaussian distribution of velocities. We show that the equilibrium-like power-law energy distribution emerging within nonextensive statistical mechanics satisfies these hypothesis, in spite of not being factorizable. A physically satisfactory renormalization group emerges in the (q, T_q) space, where q and T_q respectively are the entropic index characterizing nonextensivity, and an appropriate temperature. This scenario enables the conjectural formulation of the one to be expected for d-dimensional systems involving long-range interactions (e. g., a classical two-body potential ∝ r^-α with 0 <α/d < 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipartition</b> of (kinetic) {{energy for}} all-atom Cartesian {{molecular}} dynamics states that each momentum phase space coordinate {{on the average}} has kT/ 2 of kinetic energy in a canonical ensemble. This principle is used in molecular dynamics simulations to initialize velocities, and to calculate statistical properties such as entropy. Internal coordinate molecular dynamics (ICMD) models differ from Cartesian models in that the overall kinetic energy depends on the generalized coordinates and includes cross-terms. Due to this coupled structure, no such equipartition principle holds for ICMD models. In this paper, we introduce noncanonical modal coordinates to recover some of the structural simplicity of Cartesian models and develop a new equipartition principle for ICMD models. We derive low-order recursive computational algorithms for transforming between the modal and physical coordinates. The equipartition principle in modal coordinates provides a rigorous method for initializing velocities in ICMD simulations, thus replacing the ad hoc methods used until now. It also sets the basis for calculating conformational entropy using internal coordinates. 1...|$|E

The Fluctuating hydrodynamics approach and the Deterministic method are both employed. We ensure that the fluctuation-dissipation relation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>equipartition</b> <b>of</b> energy are both satisfied. The major focus is on the effect of the confining boundary. Results for the velocity and angular velocity autocorrelations (VACF and AVACF), diffusivities, and drag and lift forces as functions of shape, aspect ratio, inclination angle, and proximity to the wall are presented. For the parameters considered, the boundary modifies the VACF and AVACF such that three distinct regimes are discernible [...] - an initial exponential decay, followed by an algebraic decay culminating in a second exponential decay. The first is due to thermal noise, the algebraic regime is due to both thermal noise and hydrodynamic correlations, while the second exponential decay shows the effect of momentum reflection from the confining wall. Our predictions display excellent comparison with published results for the algebraic regime (the only regime for which earlier results exist). We also discuss the role of off-diagonal elements of the mobility and diffusivity tensor that enables the quantification of the degree of lift and margination of the NC in the vessel.

40|$|Abstract. The {{statistical}} mechanics of 3 -D helical flows is re-examined for a continuum truncated at a top wavenumber. Based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipartition</b> {{of the flow}} enstrophy between helical modes, the emerging (i) energy spectrum law “− 2 ” and (ii) formal mathematical analogy between the helicity and the thermodynamic entropy are discussed. It is noted that the “− 2 ” scaling law is consistent with both spectral equilibrium and spectral cascade paradigms. In an attempt to apply the obtained results to a turbulent flow regime within the Earth’s outer liquid core, where the net helicity of a turbulent flow component is presumably explained by Earth’s rotation, it has been noticed {{that it is the}} energy spectral law “− 1 ”, but not “− 2 ”, which is likely realized there and within the logarithmic accuracy corresponds to the case of the velocity structure function [u (l) ] 2 independency on the spatial scale l, the latter is consistent with observations.

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{behavior}} of biomolecules can be sensitive to temperature, the ability to accurately calculate and control the temperature in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is important. Standard analysis of equilibrium MD simulationsseven constant-energy simulations with negligible long-term energy driftsoften yields different calculated temperatures for different motions, however, in apparent violation of the statistical mechanical <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipartition</b> of energy. Although such analysis provides a valuable warning that other simulation artifacts may exist, it leaves the actual value of the temperature uncertain. We observe that Tolman’s generalized equipartition theorem should hold for long stable simulations performed using velocity-Verlet or other symplectic integrators, because the simulated trajectory is thought to sample almost exactly from a continuous trajectory generated by a shadow Hamiltonian. From this we conclude that all motions should share a single simulation temperature, and we provide a new temperature estimator that we test numerically in simulations of a diatomic fluid and of a solvated protein. Apparent temperature variations between different motions observed using standard estimators do indeed disappear when using the new estimator. We use our estimator to better understand how thermostats and barostats can exacerbate integration errors. In particular, we find that with large (albeit widely used) time steps, the common practice of using two thermostats to remedy so-called hot solvent-cold solute problems can have the counter-intuitive effect of causing temperature imbalances. Our results, moreover, highlight the utility of multiple-time step integrators for accurate and efficient simulation. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of non-equilibrium phenomena, nonlinear behavior, gravitational effects and fluid compressibility {{in a wide}} range of problems related to high-temperature gas-dynamics, especially in thermal, mechanical and nuclear engineering, calls for a concerted approach using the tools of the kinetic theory of gases, statistical physics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and mathematical modeling in synergy with advanced numerical strategies for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The reason behind such a need is that in many instances of relevance in this field one witnesses a departure from canonical models and the resulting inadequacy of standard CFD approaches, especially those traditionally used to deal with thermal (buoyancy) convection problems. Starting from microscopic considerations and typical concepts of molecular dynamics, passing through the Boltzmann equation and its known solutions, we show how it is possible to remove past assumptions and elaborate an algorithm capable of targeting the broadest range of applications. Moving beyond the Boussinesq approximation, the Sutherland law and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>equipartition,</b> the resulting method allows most of the fluid properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and diffusivity, etc.) to be derived in a rational and natural way while keeping empirical contamination to the minimum. Special attention is deserved as well to the well-known pressure issue. With the application of the socalled multiple pressure variables concept and a projection-like numerical approach, difficulties with such a term in the momentum equation are circumvented by allowing the hydrodynamic pressure to decouple from its thermodynamic counterpart. The final result is a flexible and modular framework that on the one hand is able to account for all the molecule (translational, rotational and vibrational) degrees of freedom and their effective excitation, and on the other hand can guarantee adequate interplay between molecular and macroscopic-level entities and processes.
