25|$|In organic {{egg-laying}} systems, chickens {{are also}} free-range. Organic systems {{are based upon}} restrictions on the routine use of synthetic yolk colourants, in-feed or in-water medications, other food additives and synthetic amino acids, and a lower stocking density and smaller group sizes. The Soil Association standards used to certify organic flocks in the UK, indicate a maximum outdoors stocking density of 1,000 birds per hectare and a maximum of 2,000 hens in each <b>poultry</b> <b>house.</b> In the UK, organic laying hens are not routinely beak-trimmed.|$|E
500|$|In free-range husbandry, {{the birds}} can roam freely {{outdoors}} {{for at least}} part of the day. Often, this is in large enclosures, but the birds have access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours. A more intensive system is yarding, in which the birds have access to a fenced yard and <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> at a higher stocking rate. Poultry can also be kept in a barn system, with no access to the open air, [...] but with the ability to move around freely inside the building. The most intensive system for egg-laying chickens is battery cages, often set in multiple tiers. In these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner. The eggs are laid on the floor of the cage and roll into troughs outside for ease of collection. Battery cages for hens have been illegal in the EU since January 1, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Point du Sable {{settled on}} the north bank of the Chicago River close to its mouth {{at some time in}} the 1780s. The {{earliest}} known record of Point du Sable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on May 10, 1790 during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Pointe du Sable's house en route to the Chicago portage; they swapped their canoe for a pirogue that belonged to Point du Sable, and they bought bread, flour and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point du Sable as a large man who was a wealthy trader. In 1800 he sold his farm to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres; the bill of sale, which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, outlined all of the property Point du Sable owned as well as many of his personal artifacts. This included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a <b>poultry</b> <b>house,</b> a dairy and a smokehouse. The house was a [...] log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.|$|E
50|$|For most nematodes, control {{measures}} consist of sanitation and breaking {{the life cycle}} rather than chemotherapy.

40|$|Improved {{monitoring}} {{tools are}} important for the control of Campylobacter bacteria in broiler production. In this study, we compare the sensitivities of detection of Campylobacter by PCR with feces, dust, and air samples during the lifetimes of broilers in two <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> and conclude that the sensitivity of detection of Campylobacter in air is comparable to that in other sample materials. Profiling of airborne particles in six <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> revealed that the aerodynamic conditions were dependent on {{the age of the}} chickens and very comparable among different <b>poultry</b> <b>houses,</b> with low proportions of particles in the 0. 5 - to 2 -μm-diameter range and high proportions in the 2 - to 5 -μm-diameter range. Campylobacter could also be detected by PCR in air samples collected at the hanging stage during the slaughter process but not at the other stages tested at the slaughterhouse. The exploitation of airborne dust in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> as a sample material for the detection of Campylobacter and other pathogens provides an intriguing possibility, in conjunction with new detection technologies, for allowing continuous or semicontinuous monitoring of colonization status...|$|R

40|$|This {{baseline}} study evaluated prevalence and antibiotic resistance of food-borne bacteria as conventional poultry facilities transition to organic practices. Poultry litter, feed, soil, water samples and poultry questionnaire responses {{were collected from}} 10 conventional and 10 organic-transitioning <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> from March to June 2008.

Prevalence of Enterococcus spp. on organic-transitioning and conventional poultry farms was 100 %; and prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 100 % and 40 %, respectively.

40|$|Local {{emissions}} from poultry production appear to significantly {{contribute to the}} spatial distribution of N and pitch canker disease in managed slash pine ecosystems. Pitch canker disease (Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg & O’Donnell) causes serious shoot dieback, reduced growth and mortality in pines found in the southern and western USA, and {{has been linked to}} nutrient imbalances. <b>Poultry</b> <b>houses</b> with forced-air ventilation systems produce nitrogen (N) emissions. This study analyzed spatial correlations between pitch canker disease and foliar, forest floor, soil, and throughfall N in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii Engelm.) plantation adjacent to a poultry operation in north Florida, USA. Tissue and throughfall N concentrations were highest near the <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> and remained elevated for 400 m.

40|$|During an {{outbreak}} of avian influenza in the Netherlands in spring 2003, the disease was controlled by destroying all the poultry on the infected farms and on all the farms within a radius of 3 km. In total, 30 million birds were killed on 1242 farms and in more than 8000 hobby flocks, by using mobile containers filled with carbon dioxide, mobile electrocution lines and by gassing whole <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Observations of these methods were used to compare their effectiveness and capacity, and their effects on the welfare of the birds. Gassing whole <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> had a much greater capacity than mobile equipment, and catching live birds to bring them to a mobile killing device caused extra stress and could cause pain due to injuries inflicted when catching and handling them. Gassing whole <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> with carbon monoxide requires strict safety regulations and, therefore, gassing with carbon dioxide was considered preferable. However, this method is not suited to all types of housing, and in these circumstances mobile killing devices were a useful alternativ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{stringent}} biosecurity measures, infections by bacterial food pathogens such as Campylobacter are {{a recurrent}} problem in industrial <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> As the main transmission route remains unclear, persistence of these infections {{has been linked}} to bacterial survival and possibly multiplication within protozoan vectors. To date, however, virtually no information is available on the diversity and occurrence of free-living protozoa in these environments. Using a combination of microscopic analyses of enrichment cultures and molecular methods (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE]) on natural samples, we show that, despite strict hygiene management, free-living protozoa are common and widespread throughout a 6 -week rearing period in both water and dry samples from commercial <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> Protozoan communities were highly diverse (over 90 morphotaxa and 22 unique phylotypes from sequenced bands) and included several facultative pathogens and known bacterial vectors. Water samples were consistently more diverse than dry ones and harbored different communities, mainly dominated by flagellates. The morphology-based and molecular methods yielded markedly different results: amoebic and, to a lesser degree, ciliate diversity was seriously underestimated in the DGGE analyses, while some flagellate groups were not found in the microscopic analyses. Some recommendations for improving biosecurity measures in commercial <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> are suggested...|$|R
