In 1914 Palestine had a <b>population</b> <b>of</b> 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews.

According to the historian Dr. Krisztián Ungváry, the 1931 census showed that the <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Bačka and Baranja included 150,301 Serbs and 3,099 Croats.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{evolutionary}} significance of molecular variation in natural <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> Drosophila melanogaster, we have started a comprehensive genetic variation study program employing a relatively large number of gene-protein loci and an array <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> obtained from various geographic locations throughout the world. In this first report we provide estimates of gene flow based on the spatial distributions of rare alleles at 117 gene loci in 15 worldwide <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster. Estimates of Nm (number of migrants exchanged per generation among populations) range from 1. 09 in East-Asian populations (Taiwan, Vietnam and Australia) to 2. 66 in West-Coast <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> North America. These estimates, among geographic populations separated by hundreds or even thousands of miles, suggest that gene flow among neighboring <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster is quite extensive. This means that, for selectively neutral genes, we should expect little differentiation among neighboring <b>populations.</b> A survey <b>of</b> eight West-Coast <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster (geographically comparable to Drosophila pseudoobscura) showed {{that in spite of}} extensive gene flow, <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster show much more geographic differentiation than comparable <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> D. pseudoobscura. From this we conclude that migration in combination with natural selection rather than migration alone is responsible for the geographic uniformity of molecular polymorphisms in D. pseudoobscura...|$|R
