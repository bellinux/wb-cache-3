50|$|SPV melts do {{not require}} much capital {{investment}} because the only construction necessary is the cavern that must be dug and the retrieval of the vitrified mass after the melt. SPV melts cost roughly $355-461 per ton of <b>processed</b> <b>waste.</b> When compared to the disposal cost of $555 per kilogram (or $500,000 per ton) of nuclear waste, SPV is very cost-effective. There is also very little risk of worker injury on the job because the melting process happens underground {{and away from the}} workers at the site. Finally, the melt caverns have no size restrictions, so SPV can handle very large volumes of waste at once.|$|E

50|$|ICV melts {{have their}} downsides as well. The most {{immediate}} concern of ICV melts is the cost. ICV requires a treatment facility, meaning {{a new facility}} must be built or an existing facility must be renovated to accommodate the new process. Both methods require considerable capital investment. Even after the facility is prepared for the process, ICV melts cost about $1,585 per ton of <b>processed</b> <b>waste</b> (3-4 times {{the cost of an}} SPV melt). This extra cost is due to the necessary safety precautions in the facility. For example, the melting process occurs at very high (1200 to 2000 °C) temperatures and some of this heat is dispersed throughout the facility, so adequate cooling and ventilation are needed for areas where workers are present.|$|E

This work was conducted because periodic hydraulic overloads caused poor water-softening performance in the PWTC- 3544 softener, which was detrimental to the performance and operating costs of downstream ion-exchange operations. Over a 2 -month time frame, the modified reactor/clarifier was tested with nonradiological wastewater and then with radioactive wastewater to optimize softening performance.

Operations that take place inside the HHE include raising and lowering the hearth using a hydraulic lift table, transporting the hearth within the HHE using an overhead monorail and hoist system, sampling and disassembly of the <b>processed</b> <b>waste</b> and hearth, weighing the hearth, rebuilding a hearth, and sampling HEPA filters.
