40|$|Uracil in DNA {{may result}} from {{incorporation}} of dUMP during replication and from spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of cytosine, resulting in U:A pairs or U:G mismatches, respectively. Uracil generated by activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) in B cells is a normal intermediate in adaptive immunity. Five mammalian uracil-DNA glycosylases have been identified; these are mitochondrial UNG 1 and nuclear UNG 2, both encoded by the UNG gene, and the nuclear proteins SMUG 1, TDG and MBD 4. Nuclear UNG 2 is apparently the sole contributor to the <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> of U:A lesions and to the removal of uracil from U:G contexts in immunoglobulin genes as part of somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination processes in adaptive immunity. All uracil-DNA glycosylases apparently contribute to U:G repair in other cells, but {{they are likely to}} have different relative significance in proliferating and non-proliferating cells, and in different phases of the cell cycle. There are also some indications that there may be species differences in the function of the uracil-DNA glycosylases...|$|E
40|$|Okazaki {{fragment}} processing is {{an integral}} part of DNA replication. For a long time, we assumed that the maturation of these small RNA-primed DNA fragments did not necessarily have to occur during S phase, but could be postponed to late in S phase after the bulk of DNA synthesis had been completed. This view was primarily based on the arrest phenotype of temperature-sensitive DNA ligase I mutants in yeast, which accumulated with an almost fully duplicated set of chromosomes. However, many temperature-sensitive alleles can be leaky and the re-evaluation of DNA ligase I-deficient cells has offered new and unexpected insights into how cells keep track of lagging strand synthesis. It turns out that if Okazaki fragment joining goes awry, cells have their own alarm system in the form of ubiquitin that is conjugated to the replication clamp PCNA. Although this modification results in mono- and poly-ubiquitination of PCNA, it is genetically distinct from the known <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> mark at lysine 164. In this Extra View, we discuss the possibility that eukaryotic cells utilize different enzymatic pathways and ubiquitin attachment sites on PCNA to alert the replication machinery to the accumulation of single-stranded gaps or nicks behind the fork...|$|E
40|$|Most {{bacterial}} organisms rely on {{homologous recombination}} to repair DNA double-strand breaks {{and for the}} <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> of DNA single-strand gaps. Homologous recombination {{can be divided into}} three steps: (i) a pre-synaptic step in which the DNA 3 '-OH ends are processed, (ii) a recA-dependent synaptic step allowing the invasion of an intact copy and the formation of Holliday junctions, and (iii) a post synaptic step consisting of migration and resolution of these junctions. Currently, little is known about factors involved in homologous recombination, especially for the post-synaptic step. In Escherichia coli, branch migration and resolution are performed by the RuvABC complex, but could also rely on the RecG helicase in a redundant manner. In this study, we show that recG and ruvABC are well-conserved among Streptomyces. AruvABC, ArecG and AruvABC ArecG mutant strains were constructed. A ruvABC A recG is only slightly affected by exposure to DNA damage (UV). We also show that conjugational recombination decreases in the absence of RuvABC and RecG, but that intrachromosomal recombination is not affected. These data suggest that RuvABC and RecG are indeed involved in homologous recombination in Streptomyces ambofaciens and that alternative factors are able to take over Holliday junction in Streptomyces...|$|E

We found that frameshifts, but not general mutation rates are unusually high in Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, despite the absence of mismatch correction, M. smegmatis establishes a strong barrier to recombination between homeologous DNA sequences. We show that 10 - 12 % of DNA sequence heterology restricts initiation of recombination but not extension of heteroduplex DNA intermediates. Together, the lack of mismatch correction and a high stringency of initiation of homologous recombination provide an adequate strategy for mycobacterial genome evolution, which occurs by gene duplication and divergent evolution...|$|R
40|$|Rates of {{spontaneous}} mutation determine {{the ability of}} viruses to evolve, infect new hosts, evade immunity and undergo drug resistance. Contrarily to RNA viruses, few mutation rate estimates have been obtained for DNA viruses, because their high replication fidelity implies that new mutations typically fall below the detection limits of Sanger and standard next-generation sequencing. Here, {{we have used a}} recently developed high-fidelity deep sequencing technique (Duplex Sequencing) to score spontaneous mutations in human adenovirus 5 under conditions of minimal selection. Based on > 200 single-base spontaneous mutations detected throughout the entire viral genome, we infer an average mutation rate of 1. 3 × 10 - 7 per base per cell infection cycle. This value is similar to those of other, large double-stranded DNA viruses, but an order of magnitude lower than those of single-stranded DNA viruses, consistent with the possible action of <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair.</b> Although the mutation rate did not vary strongly along the adenovirus genome, we found several sources of mutation rate heterogeneity. First, two regions mapping to transcription units L 3 and E 1 B-IVa 2 were significantly depleted for mutations. Second, several point insertions/deletions located within low-complexity sequence contexts appeared recurrently, suggesting mutational hotspots. Third, mutation probability increased at GpC dinucleotides. Our findings suggest that host factors may influence the distribution {{of spontaneous}} mutations in human adenoviruses and potentially other nuclear DNA viruses...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{fidelity}} in {{the humans}} is continuously challenged by genotoxic {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) generated both endogenously during metabolic processes, and by exogenous agents. Mispairing of most ROS-induced oxidized base lesions during DNA replication induces mutations. Although bulky base adducts induced by ultraviolet light and other environmental mutagens block replicative DNA polymerases, most oxidized base lesions do not block DNA synthesis. In 8 -oxo-G:A mispairs generated by the incorporation of A opposite unrepaired 8 -oxo-G, A is removed by MutYH (MYH) for <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair,</b> and other oxidized base lesions must be repaired prior to replication {{in order to prevent}} mutation fixation. Our earlier studies documented S phase-specific overexpression of endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL 1) DNA glycosylase (DG), one of five oxidized base excision repair (BER) -initiating enzymes in mammalian cells, and its high affinity for replication fork-mimicking single-stranded (ss) DNA substrates. We recently provided experimental evidence for the role of NEIL 1 in replicating-strand repair, and proposed the “cowcatcher” model of pre-replicative BER, where NEIL 1 ’s nonproductive binding to the lesion base in ssDNA template blocks DNA chain elongation, causing fork regression. Repair of the lesion in the then re-annealed duplex is carried out by NEIL 1 in association with the DNA replication proteins. In this commentary, we highlight the critical role of pre-replicative BER in preventing mutagenesis, and discuss the distinction between pre-replicative vs. post-replicative BER...|$|E
40|$|Viral {{mutation}} rates {{vary widely}} in nature, yet the mechanistic and evolutionary determinants of this variability remain unclear. Small DNA viruses mutate {{orders of magnitude}} faster than their hosts despite using host-encoded polymerases for replication, which suggests these viruses may avoid <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair.</b> Supporting this, the genome of bacteriophage /X 174 is completely devoid of GATC sequence motifs, which are required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that restoration of the randomly expected number of GATC sites leads to an eightfold reduction {{in the rate of}} spontaneous mutation of the phage, without severely impairing its replicative capacity over the short term. However, the efficacy of mismatch repair in the presence of GATC sites is limited by inefficient methylation of the viral DNA. Therefore, both GATC avoidance and DNA under-methylation elevate the mutation rate of the phage relative to that of the host. We also found that the effects of GATC sites on the phage mutation rate vary extensively depending on their specific location within the phage genome. Finally, the mutation rate reduction afforded by GATC sites is fully reverted under stress conditions, which up-regulate repair pathways and expression of error-prone host polymerases such as heat and treatment with the base analog 5 -fluorouracil, suggesting that access to repair renders the phage sensitive to stress-induced mutagenesis.

The role of DNA mismatch repair in response to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage has been historically controversial.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, adenine {{methylation}} at {{the sequence}} GATC allows coupling of cellular processes to chromosome replication and the cell cycle. The transient presence of hemimethylated DNA after replication facilitates <b>post-replicative</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> induces transcription of some genes and allows transposition of mobile elements. We {{were interested in}} estimating the half-life of hemimethylated DNA behind the replication fork in plasmid molecules and in determining whether Dam methyltransferase restores N 6 adenine methylation simultaneously on both replicative arms. We show that remethylation takes place asynchronously on the leading and lagging daughter strands shortly after replication. On the leading arm the fully methylated adenine is restored approximately 2000 bp (corresponding to 2 s) behind the replication fork, while remethylation takes twice as long (at 3500 - 4000 bp or approximately 3. 5 - 4 s) on the lagging replicative arm. This observation suggests that Dam remethylation of the lagging arm requires ligated Okazaki fragments...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} {{is mediated}} by a multi-protein complex {{known as the}} replisome. With the hexameric MCM (minichromosome maintenance) replicative helicase at its core, the replisome splits the parental DNA strands, forming replication forks (RFs), where it catalyses coupled leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. While replication is a highly effective process, intrinsic and oncogene-induced replication stress impedes the progression of replisomes along chromosomes. As a consequence, RFs stall, arrest, and collapse, jeopardizing genome stability. In these instances, accessory fork progression and repair factors, orchestrated by the replication checkpoint, promote RF recovery, ensuring the chromosomes are fully replicated and can be safely segregated at cell division. Homologous recombination (HR) proteins play key roles in negotiating replication stress, binding at stalled RFs and shielding them from inappropriate processing. In addition, HR-mediated strand exchange reactions restart stalled or collapsed RFs and mediate error-free <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair.</b> DNA transactions at stalled RFs further involve various DNA editing factors, notably helicases and nucleases. A study by Ölmezer et al. (2016) has recently identified a role for the structure-specific nuclease Yen 1 (GEN 1 in human) in the resolution of dead-end DNA replication intermediates after RF arrest. This new function of Yen 1 is distinct from its previously known role as a Holliday junction resolvase, mediating the removal of branched HR intermediates, and it becomes essential for viable chromosome segregation in cells with a defective Dna 2 helicase. These findings have revealed greater complexity in the tasks mediated by Yen 1 and expose a replicative role for the elusive helicase activity of the conserved Dna 2 nuclease-helicase...|$|E
40|$|DNA polymerases (Pol) α, δ, and ϵ {{replicate}} {{the bulk of}} chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic cells, Pol ϵ being the main leading strand and Pol δ the lagging strand DNA polymerase. By applying chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR we found that at G 1 /S arrest, all three DNA polymerases were enriched with DNA containing the early firing lamin B 2 origin of replication and, 2 h after release from the block, with DNA containing the origin at the upstream promoter region of the MCM 4 gene. Pol α, δ, and ϵ were released from these origins upon firing. All three DNA polymerases, Mcm 3 and Cdc 45, but not Orc 2, still formed complexes in late S phase. Reciprocal ChIP of the three DNA polymerases revealed that at G 1 /S arrest and early in S phase, Pol α, δ, and ϵ {{were associated with the}} same nucleoprotein complexes, whereas in late S phase Pol ϵ and Pol α/δ were largely associated with distinct complexes. At G 1 /S arrest, the replicative DNA polymerases were associated with lamins, but in late S phase only Pol ϵ, not Pol α/δ, remained associated with lamins. Consistently, Pol ϵ, but not Pol δ, was found in nuclear matrix fraction throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, Pol ϵ and Pol α/δ seem to pursue their functions at least in part independently in late S phase, either by physical uncoupling of lagging strand maturation from the fork progression, or by recruitment of Pol δ, but not Pol ϵ, to post-replicative processes such as translesion synthesis or <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} and evolutionarily conserved Smc 5 -Smc 6 complex (Smc 5 / 6) {{is critical for}} the maintenance of genome stability. Partial loss of Smc 5 / 6 function yields several defects in DNA repair, which are rescued by inactivation of the homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Thus HR is thought to be toxic to cells with defective Smc 5 / 6. Recent work has highlighted a role for Smc 5 / 6 and the Sgs 1 DNA helicase in preventing the accumulation of unresolved HR intermediates. Here we investigate how deletion of MPH 1, encoding the orthologue of the human FANCM DNA helicase, rescues the DNA damage sensitivity of smc 5 / 6 but not sgs 1 Δ mutants. We find that MPH 1 deletion diminishes accumulation of HR intermediates within both smc 5 / 6 and sgs 1 Δ cells, suggesting that MPH 1 deletion is sufficient to decrease the use of template switch recombination (TSR) to bypass DNA lesions. We further explain how avoidance of TSR is nonetheless insufficient to rescue defects in sgs 1 Δ mutants, by demonstrating a requirement for Sgs 1, along with the <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR) and HR machinery, in a pathway that operates in mph 1 Δ mutants. In addition, we map the region of Mph 1 that binds Smc 5, and describe a novel allele of MPH 1 encoding a protein unable to bind Smc 5 (mph 1 -Δ 60). Remarkably, mph 1 -Δ 60 supports normal growth and responses to DNA damaging agents, indicating that Smc 5 / 6 does not simply restrain the recombinogenic activity of Mph 1 via direct binding. These data as a whole highlight a role for Smc 5 / 6 and Sgs 1 in the resolution of Mph 1 -dependent HR intermediates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} <b>post-replicative</b> DNA-mismatch <b>repair</b> {{seems to be}} highly {{evolutionarily}} conserved. In Escherichia coli, DNA mismatches are recognized by the MutS protein [1, 2]. Homologues of the E. coli mutS and mutL mismatch-repair genes {{have been identified in}} other prokaryotes, as well as in yeast and mammals (see [3] for review). Recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH 2 (MSH for MutS homologue) [4] and human hMSH 2 proteins [5, 6] have been shown to bind to mismatch-containing DNA in vitro. However, the physiological role of hMSH 2 is unclear, as shown by the recent finding that the mismatch-binding factor hMutSα isolated from extracts of human cells is a heterodimer of hMSH 2 and another member of the MSH family, GTBP [7, 8]. It has been reported that S. cerevisiae possesses a mismatch-binding activity, which most probably contains MSH 2 [9]. We show here that, as in human cells, the S. cerevisiae binding factor is composed of MSH 2 and a new functional MutS homologue, MSH 6, identified by its homology to GTBP...|$|R
40|$|The RAD 6 pathway {{is central}} to <b>post-replicative</b> DNA <b>repair</b> in {{eukaryotic}} cells; however, the machinery and its regulation remain poorly understood. Two principal elements of this pathway are the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD 6 and the MMS 2 -UBC 13 heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING-finger proteins RAD 18 and RAD 5, respectively. Here we show that UBC 9, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) - conjugating enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -a DNA-polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair-is a substrate. PCNA is monoubiquitinated through RAD 6 and RAD 18, modified by lysine- 63 -linked multi-ubiquitination-which additionally requires MMS 2, UBC 13 and RAD 5 -and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC 9. All three modifications affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, suggesting that they label PCNA for alternative functions. We demonstrate that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage, and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans...|$|R

In addition, evidence from model organisms 3 - 6 and from human genetics 7 suggests that cohesin {{plays a role in}} the control of gene expression 8, 9. This non-canonical role has recently been rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSS) and to conserved non-coding sequences by the DNA binding protein CTCF 10 - 13. CTCF functions at insulators (which control interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure) 14, and cohesin contributes to CTCF’s enhancer blocking activity 10, 11. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be elucidated. Here we show that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, cohesin’s ability to constrain chromosome topology is utilized not only for the purpose of {{sister chromatid}} cohesion 1, 2, but also to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci.

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Clinical staging {{classification}} is generally insufficient to provide a reliable prognosis, particularly for early stages. In addition, prognostic factors are therefore needed to better forecast life expectancy and optimize adjuvant therapeutic strategy. Recent evidence indicates that alterations of the DNA replication program contribute to neoplasia from its early stages and that cancer cells are frequently exposed to endogenous replication stress. We therefore hypothesized that genes involved in the replication stress response may represent an under-explored source of biomarkers. Expressions of 77 DNA replication-associated genes implicated in different aspects of chromosomal DNA replication, including licensing, firing of origins, elongation, replication fork maintenance and recovery, lesion bypass and <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> were determined in primary tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 93 patients suffering from early- or mid-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We then investigated a statistically significant interaction between gene expressions and survival of early-stage NSCLC patients. The expression of five genes, that is, POLQ, PLK 1, RAD 51, CLASPIN and CDC 6 was associated with overall, disease-free and relapse-free survival. The expression levels are independent of treatment and stage classification. Except RAD 51, their prognostic role on survival persists after adjustment on age, sex, treatment, stage classification and conventional proliferation markers, with a hazard ratio of 36. 3 for POLQ (95 %CI 2. 6 – 517. 4, P 0. 008), 23. 5 for PLK 1 (95 %CI 1. 9 – 288. 4, P 0. 01), 20. 7 for CLASPIN (95 %CI 1. 5 – 275. 9, P 0. 02) and 18. 5 for CDC 6 (95 %CI 1. 3 – 267. 4, P 0. 03). We also show that a five-gene signature including POLQ, PLK 1, RAD 51, CLASPIN and CDC 6 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups, with a hazard ratio of 14. 3 (95 % CI 5. 1 – 40. 3...|$|E
40|$|Our genome is {{constantly}} exposed to endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging factors. In {{order to prevent}} accumulation of mutations and to maintain genome integrity, cells must repair induced lesions. This occurs through a DNA damage response involving {{a wide variety of}} proteins. One of these responses has been classified as base excision repair (BER), mainly responsible for removal of damaged and mis-incorporated bases. XRCC 1 and PCNA are proteins with no enzymatic activity that act as scaffolding proteins in separate BER pathways, but PCNA is also essential in normal replication. The DNA glycosylase UNG 2 interacts with PCNA and carries out post-replicative removal of uracil. Additionally, XRCC 1 interacts and co-localizes with PCNA in replication foci. As UNG 2 creates a single-strand break (SSB) and XRCC 1 is central in single-strand break repair (SSBR) a model where XRCC 1 complexes were localized close to replication forks were suggested. In this thesis, isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) has been conducted to identify BER proteins on nascent DNA. In particular, it has been of interest to investigate the presence of XRCC 1 on nascent DNA, as it functions as a binding platform for many core BER proteins and a post-replicative function of these has not been elucidated. UNG 2 interacts with PCNA through the PIP-box similar to many replication proteins. Recently, another PCNA interacting motif, APIM, was identified. APIM is found in many proteins involved in defence against cellular stress. One of the goals of this thesis has been to mutate the PIP-box to APIM in UNG 2 and investigate how this mutation affects the affinity to PCNA and loading on nascent DNA. BER proteins, including XRCC 1, were verified in close proximity of replication forks, indicating that XRCC 1 protein complexes are involved in <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair.</b> This was supported by coupling iPOND with both Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the mutation from PIP to APIM in UNG 2 most likely decreased its affinity to PCNA in absence of DNA damage. However, after stalling of replication by MMS and MMC the mutant seemed to have increased affinity to a fraction of the PCNAs in replication foci, indicating that APIM-PCNA interactions have greater importance upon cellular stress. Both the wild type and mutant fusion proteins were poorly loaded on nascent DNA by iPOND, indicating that the smaller endogenous UNG 2 more easily access PCNA </p...|$|E
40|$|Most {{chemotherapeutic}} treatments rely on induction {{of severe}} DNA damage {{to kill the}} cancer cells. However, DNA repair pathways can repair the induced lesions, leading to survival of the tumor cells. Thus, inhibition of DNA repair pathways may increase the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) functions as a binding platform for many proteins and has {{an essential role in}} co-ordination of DNA replication, DNA repair and other crucial processes for cell survival. In 2009, Gilljam and co-workers identified the peptide sequence AlkB homologue 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM), important for binding of proteins to PCNA. APIM is found in proteins involved in epigenetics, genome maintenance and cell cycle control, many of which are important after DNA damage. Studies have shown that APIM peptides sensitize cells to DNA damaging agents; hence APIM has a potential in cancer therapy. One hypothesis is that overexpressed APIM blocks the binding sites on PCNA and impairs the binding of APIM-containing proteins to PCNA, thus prevent optimal response to DNA damage. Isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) is a newly developed method for analysis of proteins involved in replication-related processes. The method relies on incorporation of the thymidine analog 5 -ethynyl- 2 ?-deoxyuridine (EdU) to nascent DNA. Crosslinking of proteins to DNA and biotin-conjugation to EdU results in biotin-tagged fragments of nascent DNA with bound proteins. The DNA-protein complexes are purified by exploiting the strong binding of biotin to streptavidin, before the proteins are eluted and analyzed by Western blotting. The aim of this Master thesis has been to optimize iPOND to function with the Flp-INTM T-RexTM- 293 APIM-YFP cell line and for the detection of APIM-containing proteins with low abundance close to replication forks. Furthermore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to analyze how close proteins involved in epigenetics and DNA repair are to the replisome, and to evaluate if overexpression of APIM affects the presence of these proteins on nascent DNA, both before and after inducing DNA damage. During optimization of iPOND, it was found that 3 x 107 cells/dish gives optimal EdU-incorporation and that 2 x 108 cells/sample is necessary for detection of proteins with low abundance close to replication forks. To maintain the proliferation rate, the cells need to be passaged the day before adding tetracycline, at a concentration of 0, 02 µg/mL to induce and sustain APIM-expression. Finally, it was found that 0. 5 - 1 mM methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) introduces DNA damage without excessive stalling of the replication machinery. iPOND detected proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) (XPA and XPF)) and direct repair (hABH 2) at newly replicated DNA, suggesting a function of these proteins in <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair.</b> iPOND also verified the chromatin remodeling factors UHRF 1 and hSNF 5 as replisome proteins and trimethylated H 3 K 9 (H 3 K 9 me 3) and acetylated H 4 K 16 (H 4 K 16 ac) as chromatin-bound proteins. Furthermore, a slightly reduced presence of XPA, hABH 2 and hSNF 5 (APIM-containing proteins) and of H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 4 K 16 ac on nascent DNA was observed in MMS-treated APIM-expressing cells compared to cells not expressing APIM. The APIM-containing proteins EHMT 1 and MRG 15 are found in protein complexes that participate in trimethylation of H 3 K 9 and acetylation of H 4 K 16, respectively. Thus, overexpressed APIM seems to perturb the binding of APIM-containing proteins to nascent DNA, and to affect the function of APIM-containing protein complexes responsible for certain histone modifications...|$|E

Three types of methylated nucleobases are known: N- 6 -methyladenine, 5 -methylcytosine and N- 4 -methylcytosine. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a method to detect all three types of DNA methylation in complete genomic DNA.

We extended this method to include N- 4 -methylcytosine detection in both in vitro and in vivo methylated DNA. Furthermore, application of intersequence trace comparison was extended to bacterial genomic DNA. Finally, we present evidence that intrasequence comparison suffices to detect methylated sites in genomic DNA. In conclusion, we present a method to detect all three natural types of DNA methylation in bacterial genomic DNA.

It is {{involved}} in <b>post-replicative</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> control of DNA replication and gene regulation. We show that E. coli dam acts as a functional monomer and methylates only one strand of the DNA in each binding event. The preferred way of ternary complex assembly is that the enzyme first binds to DNA and then to S-adenosylmethionine. The enzyme methylates an oligonucleotide containing two dam sites and a 879 bp PCR product with four sites in a fully processive reaction. On l-DNA comprising 48, 502 bp and 116 dam sites, E. coli dam scans 3000 dam sites per binding event in a random walk, that on average leads to a processive methylation of 55 sites. Processive methylation of DNA considerably accelerates DNA methylation. The highly processive mechanism of E. coli dam could explain why small amounts of E. coli dam are able to maintain the methylation state of dam sites during DNA replication. Furthermore, our data support the general rule that solitary DNA methyltransferase modify DNA processively whereas methyltransferases belonging to a restriction-modification system show a distributive mechanism, because processive methylation of DNA would interfere with the biological function of restriction-modification systems...|$|R

Secondly, it facilitates the efficient replication of chromosome ends by controlling the activities of telomerase and Pol-α primase. The work in this thesis shows that RAD 6 is require for DNA post replication repair at the telomere when STN 1 is compromised. Rad 6 p is an E 2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that, through its interactions with E 3 ubiquitin ligases, promotes DNA post-replication repair via Rad 18 p as well as histone modification via Bre 1 p. Histone modification via Bre 1 p is also require for telomere maintenance and recombination repair. Our objective is to design experiments to show that both E 3 ubiquting ligases. through its interaction with Rad 6 p, promote DNA post-replication repair and recombination repair. In addition, Stn 1 p has additional role in facilitating DNA replication at non-telomeric sites in the genome (Stewart et al, 2012). The overall hypothesis in this thesis is that Stn 1 p require Rad 6 p for post replication repair of single stranded gaps left behind by loss of function of STN 1 {{and it may have}} non-telomere role. I have shown that the genetic interaction between STN 1 and RAD 6 is synthetically lethal by constructing the double mutant combinations. The percentage of viable spores from the double mutant stn 1 - 281 rad 6 ∆ is extremely low and synthetic. I have shown that the double mutants stn 1 - 281 rad 6 ∆have a synthetic phenotype caused by the replicative problems arising at repetitive sequences, such as the rDNA locus. The double mutants stn 1 - 281 rad 18 ∆ show that cells are very sick, suggesting that post-replication repair at the telomere is essential under defective STN 1 background. Interestingly, the double mutant stn 1 - 281 bre 1 ∆ revealed a greater synthetic phenotype, suggesting that histone modification is essential for repair when STN 1 is compromised. Beside STN 1, defects in Ten 1 also showed synthetic interaction. The double mutant ten 1 - 105 rad 6 ∆ showed negative synthetic interaction. The genetic analysis has revealed that both Stn 1 p and Ten 1 p mutants require all three arms of the RAD 6 pathways involving <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways for cell viability. This {{suggested that}} Stn 1 p and Ten 1 p may have a role in facilitating DNA repair at damaged sites, presumably single stranded gaps. Another portion of this thesis is trying to show that Stn 1 p may have nontelomeric role elsewhere in the genome. The question of whether Stn 1 p has nontelomeric functions in DNA repair and maintenance have also been explored. Pulse field gel electrophoresis has shown that Stn 1 p mutants have fragmented or shattered chromosomes when treated with S 1 endonuclease, suggesting that there are single-stranded DNA gaps outside of telomere. In addition, the double mutants stn 1 - 281 rad 18 ∆ and stn 1 - 281 bre 1 ∆ have fragmented chromosomes when treated with S 1 endonuclease. The Klenow synthesis assay has detected single stranded DNA gaps in the Stn 1 p mutants at repetitive regions. These data have suggested that Stn 1 p may have nontelomeric function outside of the telomere such as DNA replication and repair...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{damage is}} a common threat to all cells, {{as it is a}} driver of {{malignant}} transformation. However, it can also be exploited in cancer therapy. Commonly used chemotherapeutics induce a high load of DNA lesions, which overwhelm the repair capacity of replicating tumor cells. Novel approaches aim at targeting backup DNA repair pathways in order to induce synthetic lethality in cancer cells that display specific defects in certain DNA repair enzymes. PARP inhibitors, such as Olaparib, are the prime example and have proven to be highly effective in the treatment of BRCA 1 - and BRCA 2 -deficient tumors. PARP 1 is an enzyme involved in the repair of DNA single- strand breaks (SSBs). These small lesions may collapse into deleterious double-strand breaks (DSBs) when they collide with the replication machinery. In normal cells, DSBs are repaired in an accurate manner by the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, which relies on the activity of functional BRCA proteins. HR-deficient tumor cells die when treated with PARP inhibitors due to an accumulation of cytotoxic DSBs, which are then channeled into alternative, error-prone pathways, leading to genome rearrangements and ultimately apoptosis. PARP inhibitors are used as single-agent therapies, suggesting that the origin of lesions that rely on PARP activity must be endogenous. Intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) can lead to an accumulation of 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (GO) in genomic DNA, which is potentially mutagenic due to its base-pairing properties with both cytosine (C) as well as adenine (A). GO-containing lesions are repaired by the base-excision repair (BER) pathway, initiated by two different glycosylases: MYH addresses GO:A pairs, removing the misincorporated A, while OGG 1 excises the oxidized guanine (GO) directly, but only from GO:C base-pairs. Transient SSBs are generated during BER, which likely activate PARP that primes them for repair. Due to the abundance of endogenous oxidative DNA damage, we reasoned that their repair by BER leads to the generation of transient SSBs, which are the main contributors to the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in cells lacking active HR. Indeed, we show that MYH-depletion attenuates the sensitivity and genomic instability induced by Olaparib in HR-deficient cells. These results prove that processing of oxidative DNA lesions contributes to PARP inhibitor toxicity and therefore imply that tissue oxygenation and MYH status affect the efficacy of treatment. An additional study in this thesis focused on another putative DNA repair factor, ATAD 5, which has been proposed to be a suppressor of genome instability. Also we observed a hypersensitivity of ATAD 5 -deficient cells to certain DNA damaging drugs, such as the methylating agent MNNG, the interstrand crosslinking agent MMC and the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Interestingly, ATAD 5 -deficiency causes retention of PCNA and ubiquitylated PCNA on chromatin, suggesting that ATAD 5 is involved in their unloading from DNA. However, it is unclear at the moment if, and how, PCNA retention on chromatin leads to genome instability. The interaction with PCNA further suggests a role for ATAD 5 in DNA replication, but we show here that this is in fact not the case. Instead, it might be required for <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> or other DNA repair processes, which remains to be investigated in the future. We have generated a useful set of tools to study the contribution of PCNA modifications on the genomic instability induced by ATAD 5 -deficiency, which will hopefully shed light onto important functions of both ATAD 5 and PCNA in DNA metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{instability}} is {{a characteristic}} of almost all human cancers and {{is a prerequisite for}} acquisition of further hallmarks of cancer. While in hereditary cancers it arises due to mutations in DNA repair genes, in sporadic cancers it appears that oncogene-induced replication stress is the main cause for genomic instability. Hence, faithful DNA replication and repair are crucial to preserve genome integrity, thus contributing to cancer prevention, and to properly transmit genetic information across generations. Dna 2 is an essential enzyme that is conserved from yeast to humans and is involved in the maintenance of genome stability at multiple levels. It plays a role in unperturbed DNA replication as well as under conditions of replication stress. In addition, Dna 2 functions together with Sgs 1 (in yeast; Bloom or Werner in humans) in the repair of genotoxic double-strand DNA breaks, specifically in DNA end resection, which is the commitment step to mostly error-free homologous recombination pathway. Furthermore, Dna 2 was described to be part of telomeric and mitochondrial DNA maintenance systems, and to mediate checkpoint activation in yeast. During my PhD I was investigating the functions of Dna 2 in Saccaromyces cerevisiae and was mainly working with purified yeast proteins. First, we expressed and purified yeast Dna 2 and were able to show that it possesses not only a nuclease, but also a vigorous helicase activity. Then we set out to analyze the regulation of the two activities within the Dna 2 protein. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that yeast Dna 2 is regulated by a post-translational modification termed sumoylation. On the biochemical level, sumoylation of the N-terminus of Dna 2 selectively attenuated its nuclease activity, thus changing the balance between the helicase and the nuclease within the protein. In vivo, we show that sumoylation of Dna 2 is increased in the late S/G 2 phases of the cell cycle and appears to be involved in regulation of Dna 2 upon treatment with alkylating agents. Next, we addressed the essential function of Dna 2 in lagging strand DNA replication, where it acts together with Fen 1 (Flap endonuclease I) in the processing of long DNA flap structures arising during the maturation of Okazaki fragments. The nucleolytic cleavage of these flaps is required for removal of the potentially mutagenic RNA/DNA primer initially used for the synthesis of the Okazaki fragment and allows ligation of the neighboring fragments. While short flaps are processed by Fen 1, long flaps that are bound by replication protein A (RPA) need sequential cleavage by both Dna 2 and Fen 1 enzymes. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that Dna 2 is capable of processing the long flaps to products that can be subsequently ligated by DNA ligase I and that Dna 2 is highly efficient as a sole nuclease in Okazaki fragment maturation in concert with replication, without the requirement of a second nucleolytic activity of Fen 1. We suggest that Fen 1 processes most of the flaps in S phase, where it is mainly expressed, and Dna 2 is responsible for the cleavage of DNA flaps at later replication time points or possibly also during <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> processes. Furthermore, we examined the role of Dna 2 motor activity in the context of DNA end resection, which initiates homologous recombination. Employing biochemical approaches we show that on long stretches of ssDNA the motor activity of Dna 2 acts as a ssDNA translocase, especially in presence of RPA, and highly stimulates efficient DNA degradation, an effect that we also see when it acts together with Sgs 1. We propose that in resection the motor activity of Dna 2 functions as a ssDNA translocase, rather than a helicase, and is thus allowing Dna 2 to keep up with Sgs 1 and promoting efficient DNA degradation. Moreover, in collaborative projects we were able to show that Dna 2 is also involved in the processing of replication forks that reversed upon replication stress and provide further evidence that human DNA 2 cooperates with BLM and WRN to promote long-range resection. Additionally, another collaboration yielded proof that the helicase activity of Dna 2 is required for the response to replication stress and for the completion of replication. Lastly, single-molecule analysis of RPA association to forked DNA substrates done by our collaborators sheds light on its mechanistic role during DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|MutS, {{a member}} of the ABC ATPases superfamily, is a {{mismatch}} DNA-binding protein constituent of the DNA <b>post-replicative</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system (MMRS). In this work, it is shown that the ATPase activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli MutS is inhibited by ortho- and decavanadate. Structural comparison of the region involved in the ATP binding of E. coli MutS with the corresponding region of other ABC ATPases inhibited by vanadate, including the myosin– orthovanadate–Mg complex, showed that they are highly similar. From these results it is proposed that the orthovanadate inhibition of MutS ATPase can take place by a similar mechanism to that described for other ATPases. Docking of decavanadate on the ATP-binding region of MutS showed that the energetically more favorable interaction of this compound would take place with the complex MutS– ADP–Mg, suggesting that the inhibitory effect could be produced by a steric impediment of the protein ATP/ADP exchange. Besides the effect observed on the ATPase activity, vanadate also affects the DNA-binding capability of the protein, and partially inhibits the oligomerization of MutS and the temperature-induced inactivation of the protein. From the results obtained, and considering that vanadate is an intracellular trace component, this compound could be considered as a new modulator of the MMRS...|$|R

RNA interference-mediated depletion of SMC 1 sensitized HeLa cells to X-rays. Repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, measured by gammaH 2 AX/ 53 BP 1 foci analysis, was slower in SMC 1 - or Rad 21 -depleted cells than in controls in G 2 but not in G 1. Inhibition of the DNA damage kinase DNA-PK, but not ATM, further inhibited foci loss in cohesin-depleted cells in G 2. SMC 1 depletion had no effect on DNA single-strand break repair in either G 1 or late S/G 2. Rad 21 and SMC 1 were recruited to sites of X-ray-induced DNA damage in G 2 -phase cells, but not in G 1, and only when DNA damage was concentrated in subnuclear stripes, generated by partially shielded ultrasoft X-rays. Our results suggest that the cohesin complex contributes to cell survival by promoting the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in G 2 -phase cells in an ATM-dependent pathway...|$|R
50|$|Mismatch repair {{contributes}} to the overall fidelity of DNA replication and is essential for combating the adverse effects of damage to the genome. It involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element (Klenow fragment) of the DNA polymerase complex. The <b>post-replicative</b> Mismatch <b>Repair</b> System (MMRS) of Escherichia coli involves MutS (Mutator S), MutL and MutH proteins, and acts to correct point mutations or small insertion/deletion loops produced during DNA replication. MutS and MutL are involved in preventing recombination between partially homologous DNA sequences. The assembly of MMRS is initiated by MutS, which recognizes and binds to mispaired nucleotides and allows further action of MutL and MutH to eliminate a portion of newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mispaired base. MutS can also collaborate with methyltransferases in the repair of O(6)-methylguanine damage, which would otherwise pair with thymine during replication to create an O(6)mG:T mismatch. MutS exists as a dimer, where the two monomers have different conformations and form a heterodimer at the structural level. Only one monomer recognises the mismatch specifically and has ADP bound. Non-specific major groove DNA-binding domains from both monomers embrace the DNA in a clamp-like structure. Mismatch binding induces ATP uptake and a conformational change in the MutS protein, resulting in a clamp that translocates on DNA.|$|R
40|$|The Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), {{also known}} as Lynch Syndrome (LS), is an {{autosomal}} dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that accounts for about 3 - 5 % of all colorectal cancers (CRCs). It is commonly associated with germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The loss of function {{of one or more}} of these proteins results in a significant genomic instability at somatic level, particularly in repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites) present in many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This mutator phenotype promotes the tumorigenesis process that justifies the earlier age of onset of the disease (approximately 45 years). LS is characterized by high lifetime risk for tumor development, especially CRC, endometrial cancer and other extracolonic tumors. These extra-colonic malignancies include carcinomas of the small intestine, stomach, pancreas, biliary tract, ovarium, upper urinary tract and brain. The MLH 1 and MSH 2 mutations account for about 40 % and 39 % of HNPCC cases, respectively, while mutations in minor MMR genes, MSH 6, PMS 2, MLH 3 and MSH 3, justify a total of 21 % of cases, in which the MSH 6 gene gives a greater contribution (11 %). The molecular characterization of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Lynch Syndrome relies on the identification of point mutations by DHPLC and direct sequencing, and large rearrangements by MLPA, in the major MMR genes, MLH 1 and MSH 2. This strategy does not always provide exaustive information for genetic counseling. Indeed, we analyzed 117 families selected according to international diagnostic criteria (Amsterdam Criteria, Lynch HT et al, ICG-HNPCC, Gastroenterology 1999 and Bethesda Guidelines, Umar et al, J Natl Cancer Inst., 2004). Molecular diagnosis was achieved for 53 families while no MLH 1 /MSH 2 mutations were identified in the remaining 64 families. Moreover, we identified genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (missense, intronic and silent variants) in several other patients. Therefore, in this study we have characterized the VUS that we had identified in the major MMR genes, in order to classify them as pathogenic, using the following approaches: segregation analysis, population studies to exclude the polymorphic nature of the variant, assessment of Microsatellite Instability (MSI), gene expression studies both at mRNA and protein levels and in silico analysis with a variety of bioinformatics tools such as HSF (Human splicing Finder), PolyPhen (Polymorphism Phenotyping), SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant), and PredictProtein. According to literature data (Colon Cancer Family Registry in 2009, Insight Variant Interpretatioin Committee 2011), a combination of these strategies has been used for each variant in order to assess the pathogenicity of uncertain variants. We performed phenotypic and functional characterization of some of the most interesting variants of uncertain significance identified (three variants in the MLH 1 gene and one in the MSH 2 gene) that were associated with severe disease phenotypes. In particular, the study of two mutations detected in the 3 'untranslated regions (3 'UTR) of the MLH 1 and MSH 2 genes (c* 30 _ 32 delTTC in the MLH 1 gene and c* 226 A>G in the MSH 2 gene) gave very interesting results. The c* 30 _ 32 delTTC was reported as a benign variant in the MMR gene variants database (Insight-group database). Our results showed lower levels both at RNA and protein levels. These data are in agreement with recent literature studies reported on this variant (Mao G. et al., J Biol Chem, 2008). In particular, the region in which falls the mutation has been identified as a putative target point of the miR- 422 a and a mechanism of feedback regulation between MLH 1 and this miRNA was also demonstrated (Mao G. et al., Cell Res, 2012). In our study, in more aggressive phenotypes, this mutation has always been identified in association with another variant, the c. 454 - 51 t> c. Therefore, a likely pathogenetic additive effect between these two genetic alterations could be proposed. The multivariate analysis of the other 3 'UTR variant, the c. * 226 A>G in MSH 2 gene, also provided very interesting data in order to assess the correlation with the disease phenotype. In our study, this variant was found associated with both typical Lynch Syndrome features (colorectal and endometrial tumors) and atypical phenotypes such as Hodgkin Lymphoma. This analysis showed increased mRNA and protein levels, as also confirmed by a functional luciferase assay. In order to clarify the molecular mechanism at the basis of this over-expression, in silico analysis was performed for prediction of miRNA target sites (TargetScan and MiRanda) and transcriptional regulation factor binding sites (TRANSFAC). The region in which falls the mutation is identified as a putative target point of two miRNAs (hsa-miR- 137, hsa-miR 47953 p), and four trans-acting protein factors, ZNF 333, POU 6 F 1, CDP and PMX 1, known also as transcriptional repressors. Therefore, we hypothesized that this variant could prevent the binding of these factors with the MSH 2 3 'UTR leading to unregulated expression of the MSH 2 gene. In agreement with several literature data showing a deleterious effect derived from overproduction of MMR proteins (H. Zhang et al., Canc Res 1999; Shcherbakova PV. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 2001), it is conceivable that the variant c. * 226 A> G in the MSH 2 gene has a pathogenic role in the development of the disease. In our study we also analyzed the minor MMR genes, MSH 6, PMS 2, MLH 3 and MSH 3, for the presence of germline variants in patients who had been resulted to be negative for germline mutations in the major MMR genes. Recently, literature data suggest that the MMR proteins, including the minor MMR factors, may have other functions in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, in addition to the <b>post-replicative</b> <b>repair</b> role, that could be highly relevant for the carcinogenesis process (Jiricny J. et al. Mol Cell Biol 2006, Ji et al., BMC Med 2012, Mao G., et al., Cell Res, 2012). According to these data, we undertook a mutational analysis on the minor MMR genes and were able to identify 77 variants, five of which were pathogenic mutations, 5 missense variants already described in the literature as pathogenic mutations and 67 unclassified variants (missense, silent and intronic variants). A detailed phenotypic characterization, as described above for the MLH 1 and MSH 2, was also carried out for some of these variants, in order to classify them as likely pathogenetic. The most relevant result of this mutational analysis on minor MMR genes was the simultaneous presence of multiple molecular alterations in different genes or in a single gene in several unrelated patients. We proposed that some (or all) of these variants could constitute low penetrance alleles, with an additive effect on the risk of the disease (Duraturo F. et al., Int J Cancer 2011). This hypothesis is confirmed by an exhaustive molecular analysis performed for one of the 64 subjects analyzed in this study. Two literature studies on the yeast genome also demonstrated our hypothesis (Martinez SL. et al. PNAS, 2010, Kumar C. et al. Mol Biol, 2011). The probability of a synergistic effect between low-penetrance alleles could also explain the loss of segregation observed for two pathogenetic variants identified in the MSH 6 gene, c. 3261 _ 62 insC and c. 3296 _ 97 delTT. These two mutations have been found associated with variants in other minor MMR genes in some of affected members of the families analyzed. Moreover, we can not exclude the concomitant presence of alterations in other genes involved in carcinogenesis but not investigated in this study. In conclusion, this study allowed to clarify the genotype-phenotype correlations in Lynch syndrome, demonstrating the importance of a multifactorial likelihood analytical approach, also in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the MMR protein and their putative prognostic and therapeutic implications in Lynch Syndrome. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of molecular alterations in several genes (major and minor MMR genes) could suggest an additive effect of these mutations in cancer predisposition, against the classical monogenic transmission and in favor of a polygenic inheritance, although further studies on other familial cases will be needed to confirm this hypothesis...|$|E

UV-B treatment modulated MSH 2 expression and silencing of MSH 2 gene expression using small interfering RNA technology regulated UV-B-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human MeWo. We show that MSH 2 -deficient non-malignant mouse fibroblasts (MEF-/-) are partially resistant against UV-B-induced apoptosis and show reduced S-Phase accumulation. In addition, we show that an Msh 2 point mutation (MEFGA) that affects MMR does not affect UV-B-induced apoptosis.

40|$|Misincorporation of non-complementary bases by DNA polymerases is a {{major source}} of the {{occurrence}} of promutagenic base-pairing errors during DNA replication or repair. Base-base mismatches or loops of extra bases can arise which, if left unrepaired, will generate point or frameshift mutations respectively. To counteract this mutagenic potential, organisms have developed a number of elaborate surveillance and repair strategies which co-operate to maintain the integrity of their genomes. An important replication-associated correction function is provided by the <b>post-replicative</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system. This system is highly conserved among species and appears to be the major pathway for strand-specific elimination of base-base mispairs and short insertion/deletion loops (IDLs), not only during DNA replication, but also in intermediates of homologous recombination. The efficiency of repair of different base-pairing errors in the DNA varies, and appears to depend on multiple factors, such as the physical structure of the mismatch and sequence context effects. These structural aspects of mismatch repair are poorly understood. In contrast, remarkable progress in understanding the biochemical role of error-recognition proteins has been made in the recent past. In eukaryotes, two heterodimers consisting of MutS-homologous proteins have been shown to share the function of mismatch recognition in vivo and in vitro. A first MutS homologue, MSH 2, is present in both heterodimers, and the specificity for mismatch recognition is dictated by its association with either of two other MutS homologues: MSH 6 for recognition of base-base mismatches and small IDLs, or MSH 3 for recognition of IDLs only. Mismatch repair deficiency in cells can arise through mutation, transcriptional silencing or as a result of imbalanced expression of these genes...|$|R
40|$|Cohesin enables <b>post-replicative</b> DNA <b>repair</b> and {{chromosome}} segregation by holding sister chromatids together {{from the time}} of DNA replication in S phase until mitosis. There is growing evidence that cohesin also forms long-range chromosomal cis-interactions and may regulate gene expression in association with CTCF, mediator or tissue-specific transcription factors. Human cohesinopathies such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome are thought to result from impaired non-canonical cohesin functions, but a clear distinction between the cell-division-related and cell-division-independent functions of cohesion-as exemplified in Drosophila-has not been demonstrated in vertebrate systems. To address this, here we deleted the cohesin locus Rad 21 in mouse thymocytes at a time in development when these cells stop cycling and rearrange their T-cell receptor (TCR) Î ± locus (Tcra). Rad 21 -deficient thymocytes had a normal lifespan and retained the ability to differentiate, albeit with reduced efficiency. Loss of Rad 21 led to defective chromatin architecture at the Tcra locus, where cohesion-binding sites flank the TEA promoter and the EÎ ± enhancer, and demarcate Tcra from interspersed Tcrd elements and neighbouring housekeeping genes. Cohesin was required for long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, Tcra transcription, H 3 K 4 me 3 histone modifications that recruit the recombination machinery and Tcra rearrangement. Provision of pre-rearranged TCR transgenes largely rescued thymocyte differentiation, demonstrating that among thousands of potential target genes across the genome, defective Tcra rearrangement was limiting for the differentiation of cohesin-deficient thymocytes. These findings firmly establish a cell-division-independent role for cohesin in Tcra locus rearrangement and provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms by which cohesin enables cellular differentiation in a well-characterized mammalian system. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Abstract: Cancers arise as {{a result}} of {{stepwise}} accumulation of mutations which may occur at the nucleotide level and/or the gross chromosomal level. Many cancers particularly those of the colon display a form of genomic instability which may facilitate and speed up tumor initiation and development. In few instances, a “mutator mutation ” has been clearly implicated in driving the accumulation of other carcinogenic mutations. For example, the <b>post-replicative</b> DNA mismatch <b>repair</b> deficiency results in dramatic increase in insertion/deletion mutations giving rise to the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype and may predispose to a spectrum of tumours when it occurs in the germline. Although many sporadic cancers show multiple mutations suggesting unstable genome, the role of this instability in carcinogenesis, as opposed to the power of natural selection, has been a matter of controversy. This review gives an update of the latest data on these issues particularly recent data from genome-wide, high throughput techniques as well as mathematical modelling. Throughout this review, reference will be made to the relevance of genomic instability to the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma particularly its hereditary and familial subsets...|$|R
