From the theoretical point of view this thesis focuses on definition of concepts such as <b>public</b> and <b>public</b> <b>opinion,</b> examination of how these concepts are approached within <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls</b> and investigation of possible influence of mediated <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls</b> on recipient of media messages. The main part of this thesis describes results of academic studies that address an issue of media coverage of pre-election polls. Analytic part is divided into two parts. The first part deals with media content analysis, the second one deals with journalists' attitudes towards polls. We can conclude that interviewed journalists are rather skeptical about <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls</b> while this scepticism is not followed by critical interpretation of pre-election poll results. This conclusion rises a question why journalists' sceptical attitude doesn't correspond with media coverage of polls that was found rather uncritical. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
