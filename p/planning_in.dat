5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission <b>planning.</b> <b>In</b> 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R.

During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E

5|$|Haifa has {{developed}} in tiers, {{from the lower}} to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part {{to make way for}} government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise international atomic inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense <b>planning.</b> <b>In</b> 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council, {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, Thomas was part of a group that persuaded Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to establish DARPA.|$|E
5|$|Kennan lost {{influence}} with Acheson, who {{in any case}} relied much less on his staff than Marshall had. Kennan resigned as director of policy <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much {{more comfortable with the}} calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E

5|$|Obrenović {{feared that}} Karađorđe's return would prompt the Ottomans to renege on the {{agreement}} {{reached by the}} Porte and Obrenović's followers in November 1815. By extension, Karađorđe's murder precluded the Serbs of the Pashalik from {{taking part in the}} Balkan-wide rebellion that the Filiki Eteria had been <b>planning.</b> <b>In</b> Constantinople, Karađorđe's head was impaled on a stake and left on public display for a week. His body was buried on Serbian soil, but his skull ended {{up in the hands of}} a Constantinople museum. It was stolen some years later and buried in Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor (called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters) was a {{surprise}} military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, {{on the morning of}} December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan and the Philippines). The attack was intended as a preventive action {{in order to keep the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia against the overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Tunnel is an abandoned, {{incomplete}} railway/subway tunnel in New York City. It {{was intended}} to connect railways on Staten Island (precursors to the modern-day Staten Island Railway) to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, in Brooklyn, via a new crossing under the Narrows. Planned to extend , the tunnel would {{have been among the}} world's longest {{at the time of its}} <b>planning,</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The freeway bears several {{names in}} {{addition}} to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the Detroit–Toledo Expressway during <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the Fisher Freeway or the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway, named for pioneers in the auto industry. Sections {{on either side of the}} Mackinac Bridge are the G. Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway, named for politicians who helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the American Legion Memorial Highway, after the organization of the same name. Various sections carry components of the four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state.|$|E
5|$|The station, its {{surrounding}} {{streets and the}} railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> a house overlooking the railway. When they fall out, members of the gang are dropped into passing goods wagons from the parapet of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} {{completed}} in 1825 and was an early example of town <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> England, replacing a number of earlier roads including Swallow Street. Nash's street layout has survived, although all the original buildings except All Souls Church have been replaced following reconstruction in the late 19th century. The street {{is known for its}} flagship retail stores, including Liberty, Hamleys, Jaeger and the Apple Store. The Royal Polytechnic Institution, now the University of Westminster, has been based on Regent Street since 1838.|$|E

5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines.

5|$|While {{there are}} no known records of {{military}} <b>planning,</b> <b>in</b> early May the notables of Nablus, Jerusalem and Hebron coordinated an assault against Jerusalem. On 8 May armed peasants from Nablus, Jerusalem, Hebron and Gaza besieged the city and about 10,000 fighters attempted to storm the walls. They were initially repulsed by the Egyptian garrison. An earthquake occurred in the city on 13 May and fighting ceased for several days.|$|E
5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber {{served as}} acting {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; {{it was difficult to}} find a permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure as acting president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes and integration for his eventual successor. After the selection of a replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D. Harrison, Weber remained a Georgia Tech administrator and was named Vice President for <b>Planning</b> <b>in</b> 1966.|$|E
