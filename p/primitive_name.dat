50|$|Lièpvre (Leberau in German, Lebera or Lebraha in Latin) {{is a large}} village {{situated}} on the Lièpvrette. The village was founded by Fulrad, a future abbot of Saint Denis, whose parents had extensive possessions in Alsace. People from {{opposite sides of the}} Rhine met with each other in the valley of Lièpvre. Fulrad was a Carolingian supporter and probably built a convent in this location as a way to access other side of the border. Fulrad was also very close to benefactors of Wissembourg's abbey, which included Fulrad's brother, Boniface. Fulrad had two brothers, Gausbert and Boniface, and a sister named Waldrade.

But, it is unclear the origin of the parish's name; there are various hypothesises. Some indicate that the <b>primitive</b> <b>name</b> was actually Água de Penha and not Pena: a common mistake/corruption during the era. The use of penha (rock) is a better translation for the description recounted by Frutuoso, since the story indicated that the water sprang from a pebble or rock. A similar tale from the parishes early history also recounts that the parish's name [...] "...was derived from a crystalline spring on the abandoned lands of Henrique Teixeira, who had many lands to the west of the village of Machico". Similarly, pena is the Portuguese word for feather, but it is also the Portuguese term for the moulding surfaces of an anvil (parte espalmada da bigorna), which was also inferred from the promontory on which the parish was built, which is also like an anvil (bignora).|$|E
50|$|Some {{authorities}} {{have sought to}} fix {{the date of the}} foundation of this diocese (under its <b>primitive</b> <b>name</b> of Britonia) earlier than {{the second half of the}} 6th century, but the later date seems the more probable when we consider that, at the Second Council of Braga (572), Mailoc, Bishop of Britonia, was ranked lowest because of the more recent origin of his see. It seems to have been founded by the Suevian king, Theodomir, converted to Catholicism by St Martin of Dumio and to have included in its jurisdiction the Churches of the Britones (a territory coinciding with that of Mondoñedo) and some of those of the Asturias. In the beginning it was a suffragan of Lugo, until the Goths placed Lugo under the jurisdiction of Braga. After Mailoc no mention is found of the bishops of Britonia for a long time, doubtless because the great distance from Toledo made it impossible for them to assist at the councils. In 633 Metopius, Bishop of Britonia, assisted at the Fourth Council of Toledo, presided over by St Isidore of Seville. Sonna, his successor, was one of the bishops who signed at the Seventh Council of Toledo (646) and sent a representative to the Eighth Council of Toledo (16 December 653). When Britonia was invaded and destroyed by the Saracens, the bishop and priests took refuge in Asturias. In 899, during the reign of Alfonso III of Asturias, Theodesimus, Bishop of Britonia assisted with other prelates at the consecration of the church of Santiago de Compostela. It may also be noted that, in the repartition of the parishes, the church of San Pedro de Nova was assigned as the residence of the bishops of Britonia and Orense, when they should come to assist at the councils of Oviedo. By that time, however, the See of Britonia had been translated to the town of Mondumetum and the church of St. Martin of Dumio, or Mondoñedo. The diocese has since been most generally known by this name, although the episcopal residence has again changed. After the time of St. Martin it was transferred to Villamayor de Brea, from which it derived the name of Villabriensis, and afterwards to Ribadeo, but it was nevertheless known as Mindoniense, as a document of the year 1199 bears witness. At first, its patron was St. Martin of Tours, but St. Martin of Dumio was afterwards chosen patron.|$|E

Instead of enabling a user to retrieve a bit (or a block) from a database {{as in the case}} of PIR, an EPIR protocol enables a user to evaluate a function f which takes a string chosen by the user and a block from the database as input. Like PIR, EPIR can also be considered as a special case of the secure two-party computation problem (and more specifically the oblivious function evaluation problem). We propose two EPIR protocols, one for testing equality and the other for computing Hamming distance. As an important application, we show how to construct strong privacy-preserving biometric-based authentication schemes by employing these EPIR protocols. ...|$|R

A group of the particles are distributed inside the simulation domain based on a turbulence energy model with turbulence viscosity. A particle in particular moves obeying the generalized Langevin equation, a well known stochastic differential equation that describes the particle’s motion as a random Markov process. The resultant particle trajectory shows self-adapted fluctuation in accordance to the turbulence energy, while following the global flow dynamics. We then feed back Langevin forces to the simulation based on the stochastic trajectory, which drive the flow with necessary turbulence. The new hybrid flow simulation method features nonrestricted particle evolution requiring minimal extra manipulation after initiation. The flow turbulence is easily controlled and the total computational overhead of enhancement is minimal based on typical fluid solvers...|$|R

To do this, he pointed out that compound words and phrases have a range of correctness.

30|$|Catalano and Fiore [12] formalized a {{powerful}} cryptographic <b>primitive</b> <b>named</b> vector commitment. Informally speaking, {{the notion of}} vector commitment allows one to commit to an vector (m_ 1,...,m_q) {{in such a way}} that the committer can later open the commitment at specific positions. Also, nobody should be able to open a commitment to two different values at the same position (this is called position binding). Besides, the vector commitment should be concise, i.e., the size of the commitment string and the opening are both independent of the vector commitment q. Additionally, the vector commitment should be updatable for constructing a VDB scheme. That is, it is required that the committer is able to update the original commitment value by changing a specific component of the vector and the opening would still be valid for the updated commitment. The detailed formal definition of vector commitment can be found in [12].|$|R

5000|$|When {{disabling}} interrupts {{are used}} to prevent priority inversion, {{there are only two}} priorities: preemptible, and interrupts disabled. With no third priority, inversion is impossible. Since there's only one piece of lock data (the interrupt-enable bit), misordering locking is impossible, and so deadlocks cannot occur. Since the critical regions always run to completion, hangs do not occur. Note that this only works if all interrupts are disabled. If only a particular hardware device's interrupt is disabled, priority inversion is reintroduced by the hardware's prioritization of interrupts. In early versions of UNIX, a series of <b>primitives</b> <b>named</b> splx(0) ... splx(7) disabled all interrupts up through the given priority. By properly choosing the highest priority of any interrupt that ever entered the critical section, the priority inversion problem could be solved without locking out all of the interrupts.

When combined into the BubbleStorm system, bubblecast on this topology performs exhaustive search with adjustable probabilistic guarantees and no hotspots. If every query must rendezvous with every datum, this approach has optimal per-node bandwidth complexity. Indeed, rather than suffering from heterogeneity, it is exploited fully...|$|R
