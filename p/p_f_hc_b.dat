40|$|The 4 F 2 {{molecule}} {{belongs to}} the set of cell surface antigens which is induced following lectin- or antigen-mediated T-cell activation. The increase in 4 F 2 cell surface expression following lectin-mediated stimulation {{has been shown to}} be accompanied by a parallel increase in the steady-state levels of 4 F 2 heavy-chain (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC)</b> mRNA. The studies described in this report were designed to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for induction of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene expression following activation of normal resting human peripheral blood T cells. The low levels of mature 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> mRNA in resting T cells were shown to be the result of a block to transcription elongation within the exon 1 -intron 1 region of the 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene rather than promoter inactivity. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of resting T cells resulted in a 20 -fold increase in steady-state 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> mRNA levels which was mediated by removal of this block to transcription elongation. The phorbol myristate acetate-induced increase in 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene expression is distinct from previously described AP- 1 -mediated, phorbol ester-induced gene expression in that it requires new protein synthesis. Treatment of resting T cells with ionomycin plus PMA resulted in a 60 -fold increase in 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> mRNA levels. This induction was mediated by both an increase in promoter utilization and removal of the block to transcription elongation. Finally, by increasing the half-life of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> mRNA, cycloheximide treatment of resting T cells induced an approximately five fold increase in the levels of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene expression, although the physiologic significance of this mechanism remains unclear. These results demonstrate that the level of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene expression in normal peripheral blood T cells can be regulated by at least three distinct molecular pathways: (i) changes in promoter utilization, (ii) modulation of a block to transcription elongation, and (iii) alteration in mRNA stability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> is a type-II {{glycoprotein}} whose covalent-bound {{association with}} one of several described light chains yields a heterodimer mainly involved in large neutral amino acid transport. Likewise, {{it is well known}} that the heavy chain interacts with β-integrins mediating integrin-dependent events such as survival, proliferation, migration and even transformation. 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> is a ubiquitous protein whose overexpression has been related to tumor development and progression. Stable silencing of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> in HeLa cells using an artificial miRNA impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and leads to an ineffective proliferation response to mitogens. 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> colocalizes with β 1 -integrins and CD 147, but this interaction does not occur in lipid rafts in HeLa cells. Moreover, silenced cells present defects in integrin- (FAK, Akt and ERK 1 / 2) and hypoxia-dependent signaling, and reduced expression/activity of MMP- 2. These alterations seem to be dependent on the inappropriate formation of CD 147 / 4 F 2 hc/β 1 -integrin heterocomplexes on the cell surface, arising when CD 147 cannot interact with 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc.</b> Although extracellular galectin- 3 accumulates due to the decrease in MMP- 2 activity, galectin- 3 signaling events are blocked due to an impaired interaction with 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc,</b> inducing an increased degradation of β-catenin. Furthermore, cell motility is compromised after protein silencing, suggesting that 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> is related to tumor invasion by facilitating cell motility. Therefore, here we propose a molecular mechanism by which 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> participates in tumor progression, favoring first steps of epithelial–mesenchymal transition by inhibition of β-catenin proteasomal degradation through Akt/GSK- 3 β signaling and enabling cell motility...|$|R
40|$|A kidney cortex cDNA clone (rBAT) has {{recently}} been isolated, which upon in vitro transcription and capping complementary RNA (cRNA) and injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes induces a system b 0,(+) -like amino acid transport activity. This cDNA encodes a type II membrane glycoprotein that shows significant homology to another type II membrane glycoprotein, the heavy chain of the human and mouse 4 F 2 surface antigen (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc).</b> Here we demonstrate that injection of human 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA into oocytes results in the activation of a cation-preferring amino acid transport system {{that appears to be}} identical to the y(+) -like transport already present in the oocyte. This is based on the following results: (i) Injection of in vitro transcripts from 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cDNA (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA) into oocytes stimulates up to 10 -fold the sodium-independent uptake of L-arginine and up to 4. 1 -fold the sodium-dependent uptake of L-leucine. In contrast, 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA does not increase the basal sodium-independent uptake of L-leucine. (ii) Basal and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA-stimulated sodium-independent uptake of L-arginine is completely inhibited by L-leucine in the presence of sodium. Similarly, the basal and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA-stimulated sodium-dependent uptake of L-leucine is entirely inhibited by L-arginine. (iii) The stimulation of sodium-independent uptake of L-arginine and the stimulation of sodium-dependent uptake of L-leucine induced by injection of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA are both completely inhibited by dibasic L amino acids {{and to a lesser extent}} by D-ornithine. (iv) Both basal and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> cRNA-stimulated sodium-independent uptake of L-arginine show two additional characteristics of the system y+ transport activity: inhibition of L-arginine uptake by L-homoserine only in the presence of sodium and an increase in the inhibition exerted by L-histidine as the extracellular pH decreased. Our results allow us to propose that an additional family of type II membrane glycoproteins (composed by rBAT and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc)</b> is involved in amino acid transport, either as specific activators or as components of amino acid transport systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractColletotrichum acutatum {{is known}} as an {{important}} anthracnose pathogen {{of a wide range}} of host plants worldwide. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. Multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB 2, CHS- 1, GAPDH, HIS 3) of 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and other related taxa, including strains from numerous hosts with wide geographic distributions, confirmed the molecular groups previously recognised and identified a series of novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not previously been recognised. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. There is a high phenotypic diversity within this complex, and some of the species appear to have preferences to specific hosts or geographical regions. Others appear to be plurivorous and are present in multiple regions. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture, although sexual morphs have been described from other taxa (especially as laboratory crosses), and there is evidence of hybridisation between different species. One species with similar morphology to C. acutatum but not belonging to this species complex was also described here as new, namely C. pseudoacutatum.

BackgroundSystem x-c is a heterodimeric transporter, comprised {{of a light}} chain, xCT, and heavy chain, 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc,</b> which mediates the sodium-independent exchange of cystine and glutamate at the plasma membrane. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that stable transfection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with human xCT and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> results in the expression of functional system x-c. MethodsMDCK cells were transfected stably with human clones for xCT and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc.</b> Analyses of time- and temperature-dependence, saturation kinetics, and substrate specificity of L-cystine and L-glutamate transport were carried out in control and xCT- 4 F 2 hc-transfected MDCK cells. We also measured the uptake of L-cystine inXenopus oocytes expressing human xCT and/or 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> or xCT and/or rBAT (a heavy chain homologous to 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc).</b> ResultsAll of the different sets of data revealed that transport of L-cystine and L-glutamate increased significantly (twofold to threefold) in the MDCK cells subsequent to transfection with xCT- 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc.</b> Moreover, uptake of L-cystine also increased (about tenfold) inXenopus oocytes expressing hxCT and h 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc.</b> Biochemical analyses of L-cystine uptake in oocytes verified our findings in the transfected MDCK cells.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{significance}} of expression of system L amino acid transporter 1 (LAT 1) and 4 F 2 heavy chain (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc)</b> in the developing intestine, immunohistochemical investigation and molecular analysis were performed in the human embryonic and/or fetal intestines, ranging from 28 – 30 days to 34 – 35 weeks gestation. The molecular analysis {{for the expression of}} LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> mRNAs was done in the pure epithelial cell samples prepared after laser assisted microdissection. The immunoreactivities against LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> were detected along the basolateral cell membrane of the primitive gut epithelium at 28 – 30 days gestation. According to advance in gestational age of up to 24 – 25 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of LAT 1 was predominantly observed in the supranuclear cytplasmic localization with a granular or dot-like staining pattern. Up to 8 – 9 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> showed almost {{the same as that of}} LAT 1. However, after the age of 12 – 13 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> was predominantly localized along the cell membrane of apical surface of the epithelial cells. No apical and linear membranous localization of LAT 1 was observed until nearly 20 weeks gestation. In the late gestational stage, both the immunoreactivities against LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> were localized along the apical surface of the epithelial cells. In conclusion, the expression of LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> in early developing intestine suggests they have a more important role in cell proliferation rather than functional differentiation. The predominant cytoplasmic localization of LAT 1 during mid-fetal life seems to be largely inactive as amino acid transporter. On the other hand, the apical and linear membranous co-localization of LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> in the late fetal life suggests that these molecules may play a role as a functional amino acid transporter in the fetal intestinal epithelium...|$|R
40|$|System L-type {{transport}} of large neutral amino acids is mediated by ubiquitous LAT 1 - 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> and epithelial LAT 2 - 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc.</b> These heterodimers {{are thought to}} function as obligatory exchangers, but only influx properties have been studied in some detail up until now.

Quantification of amino acid influx and efflux by HPLC demonstrated an obligatory amino acid exchange with 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Strong, differential trans-stimulations of amino acid influx by injected amino acids showed that the intracellular substrate availability limits the transport rate and that the efflux selectivity range resembles that of influx. Compared with high extracellular apparent affinities, LAT 1 - and LAT 2 - 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> displayed much lower intracellular apparent affinities (apparent Km in the millimolar range). Thus, the two system L amino acid transporters that are implicated in cell growth (LAT 1 - 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc)</b> and transcellular transport (LAT 2 - 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc)</b> are obligatory exchangers with relatively symmetrical substrate selectivities but strongly asymmetrical substrate affinities such that the intracellular amino acid concentration controls their activity...|$|R

In quiescent T-cells, the LAT 1 protein was heterocomplexed with 4 F 2 heavy chain (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc)</b> in the plasma membrane. During T-cell activation, the amounts of 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> and LAT 1 heterocomplex were significantly elevated compared with those in quiescent T-cells.

In nuclear run-on assay, the LAT 1 and 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>hc</b> genes were actively transcribed even in quiescent T-cells, but the low levels of both transcripts were shown {{to be the result of}} a block to transcription elongation within the exon 1 intron 1 regions.

Seven of the new species are only known from New Zealand, perhaps reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was made, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and the name replaced with C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are the conidiogenous cells with rather prominent periclinal thickening that also sometimes extend {{to form a new}} conidiogenous locus or annellations as well as conidia that have a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture. TAXONOMIC NOVELTIES: New combination - Colletotrichum phyllanthi (H. Surendranath Pai) Damm, <b>P.</b> <b>F.</b> Cannon & Crous.

5000|$|The happy wren (Pheugopedius felix) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is endemic to the Pacific slope of western Mexico, {{from the state of}} Sonora to the state of Oaxaca, and also on islands west of the Mexican coast. As with other species of Pheugopedius, older sources (e.g. Howell and Webb) {{classify}} it within genus Thryothorus. Some authorities have treated it as a subspecies of P. rutilus or P. sclateri. There is significant geographical variation, and six subspecies are recognized: <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> sonorae is found in southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa; <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> pallidus is found in central Sinaloa, western Durango and southwards to Jalisco and Michoacán; <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> lawrencii and <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> magdalenae are found on different islands of the Islas Marías; <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> grandis is found in the Balsas River basin, and the nominate subspecies, <b>P.</b> <b>f.</b> felix in southwestern Mexico from Jalisco to Oaxaca ...|$|R
40|$|The murine 4 F 2 {{molecule}} is a 125 kilodalton disulfide-linked heterodimeric cell-surface glycoprotein {{which has}} been shown to be involved in the processes of cellular activation and proliferation (1). To elucidate the structure, expression, and regulation of the 4 F 2 molecule, a murine 4 F 2 heavy chain (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC)</b> cDNA has been isolated and structurally characterized. The murine 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> is a 526 amino acid (aa) type II membrane glycoprotein which is composed of a 75 aa N-terminal intracytoplasmic region, a single hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain, and a 428 aa C-terminal extracellular domain. Comparison with the human 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> cDNA reveals the highest degree of sequence identity within the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains. Northern blot analyses have demonstrated that the 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene is expressed at relatively high levels in adult testis, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen, and at significantly lower levels in adult liver and cardiac and skeletal muscle. Studies designed to elucidate the pattern of regulation of the murine 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene have demonstrated that it is induced during the process of cell activation, but is subsequently expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle in exponentially growing cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{utilized}} the human 4 F 2 heavy-chain (4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC)</b> gene {{as a model}} system to study the regulation of inducible gene expression during normal human T-cell activation. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> gene expression is induced during normal T-cell activation and that the activity of the gene is regulated, at least in part, by the interaction of a constitutively active 5 '-flanking housekeeping promoter and a phorbol ester-responsive transcriptional attenuator element located in the exon 1 -intron 1 region of the gene. We now report that 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> intron 1 contains a transcriptional enhancer element which is active on a number of heterologous promoters in a variety of murine and human cells. This enhancer element has been mapped to a 187 -base-pair RsaI-AluI fragment from 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> intron 1. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analyses demonstrated that this fragment contains two nuclear protein-binding sites (NF- 4 FA and NF- 4 FB) which flank a consensus binding site for the inducible AP- 1 transcription factor. Deletion analysis showed that the NF- 4 FA, NF- 4 FB, and AP- 1 sequences are each necessary for full enhancer activity. Murine 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> intron 1 displayed enhancer activity similar to that of its human counterpart. Comparison of the sequences of human and murine 4 <b>F</b> 2 <b>HC</b> intron 1 s demonstrated that the NF- 4 FA, NF- 4 FB, and AP- 1 sequence motifs have been highly conserved during mammalian evolution...|$|R

Of note, <b>P</b> <b>F</b> was <  100  mmHg for 132  + between 100 and 200 for 191  + and between 200 and 300 for 29. Pairwise correlations of truth <b>P</b> <b>F</b> with estimated <b>P</b> <b>F</b> was good (Rice—Spearman’s rho =  0.84, p <  0.001 –Ellis—rho = . 85 p <  0.001). Bland–Altmann test showed an important {{variability of results}} (<b>P</b> <b>F</b> vs Rice (Figure)— 0.02  ±  57.8 –P F vs Ellis— 14.3  ±  45.5). The variability decreased with lower <b>P</b> <b>F.</b> Caution {{may be used to}} interpret our results because we did not reported the quality of SpO 2 signal at the bedside.|$|R
40|$|Every variable-free logic program induces a Pf <b>P</b> <b>f</b> -coalgebra {{on the set}} {{of atomic}} {{formulae}} in the program. The coalgebra p sends an atomic formula A to the set of the sets of atomic formulae in the antecedent of each clause for which A is the head. In an earlier paper, we identified a variable-free logic program with a Pf <b>P</b> <b>f</b> -coalgebra on Set and showed that, if C(Pf <b>P</b> <b>f)</b> is the cofree comonad on Pf <b>P</b> <b>f,</b> then given a logic program P qua Pf <b>P</b> <b>f</b> -coalgebra, the corresponding C(Pf <b>P</b> <b>f)</b> -coalgebra structure describes the parallel and-or derivation trees of P. In this paper, we extend that analysis to arbitrary logic programs. That requires a subtle analysis of lax natural transformations between Poset-valued functors on a Lawvere theory, of locally ordered endofunctors and comonads on locally ordered categories, and of coalgebras, oplax maps of coalgebras, and the relationships between such for locally ordered endofunctors and the cofree comonads on the...|$|R
