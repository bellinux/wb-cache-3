50|$|Another {{classic case}} of a {{full-blown}} martial law in recent history took place in Iran in 1978. On September 7, Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, appointed the chief of army staff, General Gholam Ali Oveisi as the military governor of the capital city, Tehran. The army divisions took <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> locations in the city. (Martial law was also declared in some other cities.) On September 8, the army opened fire on protesters, killing somewhere from 300 to 4000 (estimates vary). The day {{is often referred to}} as Black Friday. Unable to control the unrest, Shah dissolved the civil government headed by Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami on November 6, and appointed General Gholam Reza Azhari as the prime minister. Azhari's military government also failed to bring order to the country. As a last-ditch effort, as he was preparing to leave the country, Shah dissolved the military government and appointed Shapour Bakhtiar, a reformist critic of his rule, as the new prime minister on January 4, 1979. Bakhtiar's government fell on February 11, and with it, the history of over two thousand years of monarchy in Iran came to an end.|$|E
50|$|During the cutbacks, Ericsson {{had reduced}} its CDMA organization. This standard, used largely in North America, Japan and {{mainland}} Asia, was a rival to GSM, and Ericsson had a global {{market share of}} 25%, but the overall volumes were too low so Ericsson wound down its CDMA commitment, ending it completely by 2006. Ericsson started a series of acquisitions to strengthen its <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> technologies and market segments. The first of these was Marconi, a company {{dating back to the}} dawn of radio whose assets included a strong portfolio in transmission, fiber optic and fixed network services. Further acquisitions included Redback Networks (carrier edge-routers), Entrisphere (fiber) and LHS Telekommunikation (customer care services) in 2007, and Tandberg Television in 2008. Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies the same year. Ericsson re-entered the CDMA market after acquiring North American vendor Nortel’s CDMA operations and assets in 2009. The acquisitions followed Ericsson’s general strategy of expanding into next-generation network technologies and multimedia, a combined offering that became more important as video became the dominant form of data traffic on mobile broadband networks.40% of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks. Ericsson created a division to develop its multimedia business in early 2007.|$|E
40|$|This study {{included}} {{an analysis of}} the trend of performance indicators for the technical college sector of higher education in South Carolina. In response to demands for accountability and transparency in higher education, the state of South Carolina developed sector specific performance indicators to measure various educational outcomes for each of the 34 public colleges and universities in the state. Performance indicators allow an institution to compare its <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> strategic areas to peers, to past performance, or to previously set goals. The state assigned 13 performance indicators to the technical colleges. The study analyzed six specific indicators which measure faculty credentials, faculty compensation, program accreditation, graduation rates, graduate scores on professional examinations, and institutional accessibility. The results reflected on the effectiveness of the performance system and its impact on two-year technical colleges. The overall mean of the trend data changed from 2. 645 in 1998 - 1997 to 2. 703 in 2004 - 2005. The researcher found that there was a very significant curvilinear relationship between the variables.

40|$|The world {{wine market}} {{is facing a}} {{particularly}} difficult situation. Both the EU and New World (NW) Countries are trying to manage this critical moment by filling reciprocal gaps {{in order to increase}} their competitiveness at a global level and to strengthen their <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> strategic markets. On the EU side, one of the fundamental aspects of this changing framework is the evolution of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for the wine sector. The first pivotal change is the fact that a parcel of land cannot host more than one designation of origin (either Geographical Indication – GI – Denominazione di Origine Controllata – DOC – or Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita – DOCG), thus completely changing the approach to vintage choices, which characterised the Italian production in the last 50 years. A second important variation is the introduction of the possibility to show grape varieties and the vintage year on table wines (a strategy often used by NW producers). Conversely, on the NW side, the changes are mainly relative to the increase in the use of European grape varieties and the emphasis on the region-grape combination as an element of excellence.

40|$|Background: The Cancer Testis Antigens (CTAs) are a {{group of}} genes that are highly {{expressed}} in the normal testis and several types of cancer. Due to their restricted expression in normal adult tissues, CTAs have been attractive targets for immunotherapy and biomarker development. In this work, we discovered that Centrin 1 (CETN 1) which {{is found in the}} centrosome of all eukaryotes, may be a member of this group and is highly expressed in prostate and pancreatic cancer. Three members of the centrin family of calcium binding proteins (CETN) are localized to the centrosome in all eukaryotes with CDC 31 being the sole yeast homolog. CETN 1 is a retrogene that probably arose from a retrotransposition of CETN 2, an X-linked gene. A previous mouse study shows that CETN 1 is expressed solely in the testis, while CETN 2 is expressed in all organs. Results: In this work, we show that CETN 1 is a new member of the growing group of CTAs. Through the mining of publicly available microarray data, we discovered that human CETN 1 expression but not CETN 2 or CETN 3 is restricted to the testis. In fact, CETN 1 is actually down-regulated in testicular malignancies compared to normal testis. Using q-PCR, CETN 1 expression is shown to be highly up-regulated in cancer of the prostate and in pancreatic xenografts. Unexpectedly however, CETN 1 expression was virtually absent in various cell lines until they were treated with the DNA demethylation agent 5 ’AZA- 2 ’Deoxycytidine (AZA) but showed no increased expression upon incubation with Histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin-A (TSA) alone. Additionally, like most CTAs, CETN 1 appears to be an intrinsically disordered protein which implies that it may occupy a hub <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> protein interaction networks in cancer. Neither CETN 1 nor CETN 2 could compensate for loss of CDC 31 expression in yeast which is analogous to published data for CETN 3. Conclusions: This work suggests that CETN 1 is a novel CTA with expression in cancer of the prostate and pancreas. In cell lines, the expression is probably regulated by promoter methylation, while the method of regulation in normal adult tissues remains unknown...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : THEMES AND ISSUESInternational audienceThe U. S. President’s Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative {{calls for}} the {{deployment}} of sensors to help protect federal enterprise networks. Because of the reported cyber intrusions into America’s electric power grid and other utilities, {{there is the possibility}} that sensors could also be <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> privately-owned infrastructure assets and the associated cyberspace. Sensors provide situational awareness of adversary operations, but acting directly on the collected information can reveal key sensor attributes such as modality, location, range, sensitivity and credibility. The challenge is to preserve the secrecy of sensors and their attributes while providing defenders with the freedom to respond to the adversary’s operations. This paper presents a framework for using deception to shield cyberspace sensors. The purpose of deception is to degrade the accuracy of the adversary’s beliefs regarding the sensors, give the adversary a false sense of completeness, and/or cause the adversary to question the available information. The paper describes several sensor shielding tactics, plays and enabling methods, along with the potential pitfalls. Well-executed and nuanced deception with regard to the deployment and use of sensors can help a defender gain tactical and strategic superiority in cyberspace...|$|R

After developing a theoretical framework for analysing the concept of profession, and addressing some of the confusion which often arises from the different discourses of professionalism, the work focuses on the key issues of knowledge and power. An extended literature review includes analyses of the Training and Development Agency for Schools, the National College for Leadership of Schools and Children's Services and the General Teaching Council for England. The empirical component of the study presents data from a series of interviews with a number of people <b>in</b> senior <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> education organisations which were conducted over a period stretching from June 2004 to January 2006. The thesis' main argument is that, because of political imperatives expressed through the policy interventions of successive governments, the logic of professionalism is being marginalised for teachers in England. Instead of serving the ideals of their profession, teachers in England find themselves working in an increasingly commercialized public sector and squeezed between the bureaucratic aspects of managerialist and market policies.

40|$|AbstractStudy regionThe area {{of study}} is the {{northern}} part of Belgium (Flanders). The seven evaluated Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems are <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>key</b> aquifers, which contain major groundwater resources for the region. Study focusThe increasing number of ATES systems leads to concerns by drinking water companies and environmental regulators about the long term impacts of ATES systems on the groundwater quality. This study assesses the influence of ATES on groundwater chemistry by means of a literature review, and a comparison of groundwater quality monitoring data at seven ATES systems with ambient groundwater quality values from 69 monitoring wells. New hydrological insights for the regionThe results of the analysis of the hydrochemical data confirm that the small temperature differences (ΔT≤ 10) at which the ATES systems are operating do not influence the concentrations of the main chemical constituents. Mixing of shallow with deeper groundwater during ATES operation, on the other hand, can alter groundwater quality. The results of this study, however, suggest that the groundwater quality changes are rather small, so that there is no immediate risk for the drinking water supply. However, the installation of ATES systems in the vicinity of public drinking water supply well fields should be handled with care, especially in phreatic aquifers...|$|R
