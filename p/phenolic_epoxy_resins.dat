40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{internally}} reinforced aggregate polymer ceramic composites were evaluated against fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs) of various calibers to investigate their ballistic impact response. Samples were prepared by mechanically mixing B 4 C and cBN over {{a range of}} ratios and combinations with either thermosetting <b>phenolic</b> or <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> and aramid pulp. Dry mixtures were then molded in a closed die using a heated platen press.

40|$|Besides polyurethanes and polyesters, <b>phenolic</b> and <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> are {{the most}} {{prominent}} applications for technical lignins in thermosetting materials. To evaluate the potential application of lignin raw materials in phenol formaldehyde and <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins,</b> three types of alkaline lignins were characterized {{in terms of their}} structures and thermal properties. The lignin samples analyzed were kraft lignin (LIG- 1), soda–rice straw lignin (LIG- 2), and soda-wheat straw lignin (LIG- 3). FTIR and 1 H-NMR methods were used to determine their structure. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight distribution (MWD). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the glass transition temperature (Tg), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the thermal stability of lignin samples. Results showed that kraft lignin (LIG- 1) has moderate hydroxyl-group content, is rich in G-type units, and has good thermal stability. These properties make it more suitable for direct use in phenol formaldehyde resins, and it is therefore a good raw material for this purpose.

40|$|Biomass {{liquefaction}} {{with organic}} solvents {{is a unique}} thermochemical conversion process for biomass utilizations. It combines the useful functional groups from both biomass and organic solvents used in liquefaction, thus obtaining a large variety of polymers. This review {{is focused on the}} resin products synthesized from organic solvent liquefied biomass, including <b>phenolic,</b> polyurethane, <b>epoxy,</b> polyesters, etc. Many biomass species, such as wood, corn stover, waste paper, and wood bark, have been investigated as the feedstocks for liquefied biomass-based resin products. Phenol liquefied biomass was studied the most mainly based on expectation to utilize the aromatic structures of lignin in biomass as the substitute for phenol in phenolic resin synthesis. Further condensation reaction of phenol liquefied biomass with formaldehyde to synthesize novolac or resol phenolic resins was proven to be an efficient route to convert the un-reacted phenol from liquefaction to resins and improve the physical mechanical properties of the resulting resins. Except for phenolic resins, most other polymers from liquefied biomass were synthesized based on the utilization of hydroxyl groups in liquefied biomass. Polyhydric alcohols liquefied biomass was used as polyols to synthesize polyurethanes, epoxy, and polyesters. To achieve comparable mechanical strength of resulting resin products, the common liquefaction solvent to biomass ratio was 3 / 1, which indicates a biomass substitution around 25 % to petroleum raw materials. A few cases could reach 50 % substitution with biomass pretreatment before liquefaction. Three main concerns with the liquefied biomass-based resins were their relatively higher viscosities, highly hydrophilic characters, and relatively lower cross-linking density in cured resins.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} feasibility of curing <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> layers using microwaves for physical models and prototypes. Investigations {{have been carried out}} to use <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> or a combination of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> mixed with a different material in powder form followed by a curing process using microwave radiation. The microwave radiation supports the polarisation of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> through heating based on the effect of the dielectric property. The curing process of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> using microwave radiation takes place more rapidly and supports the temperature rise, as the dielectric value of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> rises with an increase in temperature, primarily through changes in frequency. The maximum increase in temperature takes place at a critical frequency. The penetration of the microwaves through the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> is controlled by the wavelength of microwave radiation {{as a function of the}} frequency. Reducing the operational frequency of microwave radiation compensates an increase in thickness of the layer. In this work attempts have been made to determine the relationship between curing time, curing temperature for different mixtures of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> and hardener.

40|$|<b>Epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} thermosetting polymers with diverse applications. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> are mainly produced from the reaction of bisphenol-A (BPA) and epichlorohydrin. The consumption of bisphenol-A is facing growing concerns over its carcinogenic effects and its sustainability. Lignin can be a promising renewable substitute of bisphenol-A in the synthesis of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> In this thesis work, a novel method has been developed for the synthesis of bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with reduced side reactions, employing de-polymerized lignin from organosolv lignin (DOL), kraft lignin (DKL) and hydrolysis lignin (DHL) under alkaline condition in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). The preliminary results showed that the reaction temperature, reaction time, NaOH/lignin molar ratio and epichlorohydrin/lignin molar ratio influenced the reaction yield and the molecular weights of the final products. The synthesis process has been optimized by using response surface methodology to produce bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with a higher epoxy content and greater yield. Under the optimum conditions using DOL, DOL-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with an <b>epoxy</b> content as high as ~ 8 was produced at 99 % yield. The synthesis using DKL at the optimum conditions led to a DKL-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> with an <b>epoxy</b> content of 5. 6 at 97 % yield. In addition, bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> derived from hydrolysis lignin (HL) have also been synthesized with lower amount of catalyst using DHL. The DHL-epoxy resin obtained at the optimum conditions has an epoxy content of ~ 5 and 95 % yield. The curing kinetics of admixtures of the synthesized lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and a conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> at various blending ratios were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with two kinds of curing agents, i. e. diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM), diethylenetriamine (DETA). The kinetic parameters were evaluated by the model-free kinetics and the activation energy for the curing reaction was calculated as a function of conversion. The activation energy changed with the progress of curing process and it revealed that the curing of a lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> is a complex process with several reactions occurring at the same time. The fluctuation of activation energy depended on the content of the lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> in the blended mixture, type of lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> and the type of curing agent used. The synthesized lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were blended with a conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> at a blending ratio of 0 - 100 wt. % and used as polymer matrixes for manufacturing fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs). The thermal stability of the obtained lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> was also characterized using TGA-FTIR analysis. The mechanical/thermal characterization results indicated that the lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> have excellent mechanical/thermal properties and can be used as a substitute for conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> at a ratio up to 75 wt% in FRPs without compromising their properties...|$|R

40|$|Interphase {{reactions}} between cured <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and isocyanates are investigated. The <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> contain secondary hydroxyl {{groups as}} reactive groups only or secondary hydroxyl plus amine. The isocyanate diffuses into the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> forming an interphase with a thickness of some micrometers. Depending on the functional groups {{available in the}} <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin,</b> urethane and urea groups are formed in the interphase.

If the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> react with bifunctional isocyanates, a crosslinked interphase is formed. Due to the higher reactivity between amine and isocyanate compared to hydroxyl and isocyanate, the urea is formed first. The resulting cross-links restrict the further diffusion of isocyanate into the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin.</b> The consequence is a lower urethane content in the interphase and a thinner interphase compared to the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> containing hydroxyl only.

This improvement in properties was {{probably due to the}} compatibility between the NMFs and the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> matrix, and also because of the inclusion of fiberglass. The viscosity of the compound with the NMFs was comparable to the compound with powder. The bond strength of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> with casts of NMFs was sufficient, that is, it was almost equal to the mold with calcium carbonate, talc or silica.|$|R
40|$|The {{graphene}} nanosheets-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> coating (0, 0. 1, 0. 4 and 0. 7 wt %) {{was prepared}} by a situ-synthesis method. The effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone/reduced graphene oxide (PVP-rGO) on mechanical and thermal properties of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> coating was investigated using nanoindentation technique and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. A significant enhancement (ca. 213 % and 73 °C) in the Young modulus and thermal stability of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> coating was obtained at a loading of 0. 7 wt %, respectively. Furthermore, the erosion resistance of graphene nanosheets-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> coating was investigated by electrochemical measurement. The results showed {{also that the}} Rrcco (ca. 0. 3 mm/year) of graphene nanosheets-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> coating was far lower than neat <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> (1. 3 mm/year). Thus, this approach provides a novel route for improving erosion resistance and mechanical-thermal stability of polymers coating, {{which is expected to}} be used in mechanical-thermal-corrosion coupling environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to {{research}} requests of encapsulating {{materials used in}} anti-impact precision electron apparatus parts, the materials system was designed on the relation of mechanics performance and techniques properties. Then <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> E- 51 was toughening modified {{with a kind of}} self-synthesized polyester <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> which had liquid crystal groups. The results showed that the optimized <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> encapsulating materials has high compression strength and favorable operating properties. The impact strength of prepared <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> encapsulating materials increased 4. 0 times, and the gel time at room temperature was over 100 minutes. ...|$|R
