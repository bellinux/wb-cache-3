The use of a percussion hammer tool as a surgical instrument to insert acetabular cup implants was investigated in current work. <b>Pull-out,</b> lever-out and <b>torque</b> tests were carried out on cup implants inserted into test block specimens of polyurethane (PU) using specifically designed experimental setups as a means of comparing the current mallet and cup introducer (manual impaction) technique against the percussion hammer tool (powered impaction) technique.

40|$|Loosening of {{implants}} is {{a frequent}} complication in orthopaedic surgery. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate hydroxyapatite coating of pedicle screws with mechanical and histological methods and to correlate the results with the radiological findings. Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating of pedicle screws was investigated in experimental studies in sheep. Nine sheep were operated on with destabilising laminectomies at L 2 -L 3 and L 4 -L 5 and stabilised with pedicle screw instrumentations, where HA coated and uncoated screws were used in a randomised fashion. After both 6 and 12 weeks of implantation, the HA coated screws demonstrated a higher bone-to-implant contact and a higher amount of bone in the area close to the screw. The pull-out resistance, stiffness and total energy to failure was higher for the HA coated screws after 12 weeks of implantation. HA coating of pedicle screws was examined in two clinical studies. In the first series, the patients were stabilised with pedicle screw instrumentations, where HA coated screws were used in either the upper or lower instrumented level in a randomised fashion. After 10 - 22 months of implantation, the extraction torque was markedly higher for the HA coated screws. In the second series, instrumentations with uncoated, partly HA coated or fully HA coated screws were used. After 11 - 16 months implantation, the extraction torques were recorded. There were significant differences between all three groups, with the lowest extraction torques for the uncoated screws and the highest torques for the fully HA coated screws. The frequency of radiolucent zones surrounding the screws was higher for the uncoated screws than for the HA coated screws. Radiographs from both experimental and clinical studies were examined. Screws demonstrating radiolucent zones were compared to screws without zones with respect to <b>pull-out</b> resistance, extraction <b>torque,</b> bone-to-implant contact and amount of bone surrounding the screws. All these variables demonstrated higher values for the screws without radiolucent zones. The frequency of radiolucent zones surrounding uncoated screws in the clinical study was 53 %. Conclusions: Radiolucent zones are good predictors of screw loosening. The frequency of radiolucent zones is higher than previously described. Hydroxyapatite coating improves the purchase of pedicle screws and reduces the frequency of screw loosening...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} certain impedimental {{issues related}} to the use of magnetic gearbox and magnetic coupling technologies in high performance servo control systems. A prototype magnetic coupling is used as a basis for demonstrating that the underlying torque transfer characteristic is significantly nonlinear when transmitted torque approaches the maximum designed <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque</b> of the device. It is shown that linear controllers for speed control proportional plus integral (PI) and position control proportional plus derivative (PD) result in acceptable performance provided the magnetic coupling operates below 80 % of designed <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque.</b> To fully compensate for the inherent nonlinearity of the torque transfer characteristic, feedback linearizing control laws and state transformations are derived resulting in exactly linear input-output characteristic for position and speed control of magnetically-geared drive-trains. With the addition of state feedback, the closed-loop dynamics for both position and speed control of a magneticallygeared drive-train can be designed to satisfy the integral of time multiplied by absolute error (ITAE) optimized linear response for a step input.

40|$|A Pseudo Direct Drive (PDD) is a {{permanent}} magnet machine with an integrated magnetic gear. It has two magnetically coupled rotors. When subjected to a load torque higher than the <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque,</b> slip between the two rotors may occur. Although this may not cause any damage to the PDD or the load, it could, if left uncontrolled, result in undesirable consequences such as loss of power transfer, excessive speed on the high-speed rotor (HSR), incorrect commutation signal, and/or loss of load speed/position control. This paper proposes a technique for a PDD equipped with a position/speed sensor on each rotor to control the slip caused by external overload torques and to enable a swift recovery when they are removed. However, when the PDD is equipped with only one sensor on the HSR, {{it is impossible to}} determine the position/speed of the low-speed rotor using an observer after slip occurs, which precludes a swift and controlled recovery. Therefore, a novel technique which prevents the slip between the two rotors under overload conditions is also proposed.

In these couplings, parallelepiped magnets with nonclassical magnetization direction are used and stuck in ironless cores.

Its structural topology and operation principles are initially presented. Then an investigation on the performance comparison between the HSM and the SHSM, in terms of PM flux density, PM torque, detent torque, positional holding accuracy, stator core saturation issue, PM flux leakage, and PM utilization rate is carried out theoretically to make an assessment of the performance superiorities of the SHSM. A prototype of a 2 -phase 8 -pole 50 -rotor-tooth SHSM is fabricated and experimentally compared with the HSM by using finite element analysis (FEA) to verify the motor’s operational feasibility and the theoretical analysis. The FEA and experimental results show that the proposed SHSM has performance advantages such as higher torque density, higher power grade, and higher <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque,</b> holding torque, and torque-speed property, although it has performance defects such as higher torque ripple and relatively lower positional holding accuracy in the open-loop operation than the conventional HSM.

Advantages and disadvantages of various types of direct-driven wind turbine generators are discussed, and a radial-flux permanent-magnet generator connected to a forced-commutated rectifier is chosen for a detailed theoretical investigation. Further, a design method is developed for the electromagnetic part of the chosen generator type. The generator is optimized with a simplified cost function which, besides including {{the cost of the}} active generator parts and the cost of the structure, also includes the cost of the average losses. Therefore, a method to calculate the average losses is derived. The design method is used to investigate the optimization of a 500 kW generator, and the size, efficiency and active weight of optimized generators from 30 kW to 3 MW are presented. A result of the investigation is that the outer diameters of the direct-driven generators are only slightly larger than the width of conventional wind energy converter nacelles. A comparison of average efficiency shows that direct-driven generators, including the losses in the frequency converters, are more efficient than conventional wind energy converter drive trains. Compared with other direct-driven generators, the proposed generator type is small, mainly because of the forced-commutated rectifier and because the generator is not required to produce a <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque</b> higher than the rated torque...|$|E

The work is focused on theperformance differences between aluminium and copper casted rotors. A method to predict the stator current when starting direct-on-line isdeveloped. This includes modelling of skin-effect, saturation of the leakageflux paths and additional iron losses. The results are verified by measurements. An analytical model accounting for inter-bar currents is derived, andthe dependency of the harmonic rotor currents on the inter-bar resistivity isinvestigated. It is found that the inter-bar currents can have considerableeffect on motor starting performance and stray-load losses, the amount beingstrongly dependent on the harmonic content of the primary MMF. Based on measurements of inter-bar resistivity, the starting performanceof an aluminium and a copper casted rotor is simulated. The results indicatea higher <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque</b> of the aluminium rotor than for the equivalent copperrotor. This is rather due to an increase of the fundamental starting torque ofthe aluminium rotor, than due to braking torques from the space harmonicsin the copper rotor. The results are verified by measurements. It is foundthat the difference between the pull-out torques is even larger than calculatedfrom the model. Thereby, it can be concluded that the inter-bar currents havea considerable effect on motor starting performance. At rated speed the braking torques are larger in the aluminium rotor thanin the copper rotor. This is seen as increased harmonic joule losses in the rotorcage.

40|$|A novel spherical two-degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) hybrid {{stepping}} motor is proposed in this paper, {{which has a}} simple and compact mechanical structure and is easy to manufacture, assemble, control and apply. The motor is composed of two sub-motors, {{each of which is}} a hybrid stepping type with an arc-shaped stator and a specially designed bearing structure. The rotational axes of these two sub-motors cross at the sphere center, and this structure enables the 2 -DOF motor to move in any direction. Due to the mutual influence of permanent magnet (PM) leakage flux between the two sub-motors, the 3 -D magnetic field distribution inside the motor becomes more complex, and thus the 2 -D equivalent magnetic field analysis method is proposed, with two types of 2 -D equivalent motor models established. The accurate one can take into account of the PM leakage flux influence yet is only suitable for solving motor’s static and steady state problem, whilst the simplified one can solve all the problems and is applicable for the more typical situation where the PM leakage flux influence can be almost neglected via optimal structure design. A prototype of the proposed spherical 2 -DOF motor with outside diameter of 50 mm is newly manufactured and experimented to validate the feasibility of motor’s operational principle, and the accuracy of both 2 -D equivalent motor models is verified by the 3 -D finite element analysis (3 -D FEA) calculation results.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} inter-bar current effects on induction motors with die-cast aluminium and die-cast copper rotors. The parasitic effects introduced by these currents are analyzed and possible solutions to these problems are presented. This is realized by developing analytical tools for the simulation of inter-bar current effects. The methods used are verified by measurements on prototype machines. It is shown that the inter-bar currents can have a considerable effect on the motor starting performance, which {{can result in a}} reduced <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque.</b> At rated operation, this is seen as increased harmonic rotor currents, having a negative effect on the motor performance. Results from calorimetric measurements show, that the efficiency gained when substituting a skewed die-cast aluminium rotor with a skewed die-cast copper rotor, is less than the theoretical expectation. It is shown that this is a result of a reduced power factor for the copper rotor. High inter-bar currents are believed to be the origin of this effect, increasing the harmonic content in the rotor magnetomotive force. This would be seen as an increased rotor leakage reactance. Results from locked-rotor tests, and simulations using measured values of inter-bar resistance, support this theory. It is shown, that these negative effects are suppressed to a negligible level by the use of an unskewed rotor, but to the expense of a large synchronous torque at a low speed. By using a modulated rotor concept, having an asymmetrical rotor slot distribution, an unskewed rotor is designed to reduce this parasitic torque. Measurements on a prototype machine show that the modulated rotor suppresses both the inter-bar currents and the synchronous torque, resulting in an improved starting performance, without any significant change of the motor efficiency. The presented results strengthen the potential of the modulated rotor concept, introducing new possibilities for the reduction of negative effects appearing in induction machines.

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} starting performance and losses at rated operation for a 15 kW, 4 -pole industrial induction motor, mounted with standard skewed, unskewed and unskewed asymmetrical die-cast aluminium rotors through measurements and simulations. It is a well-known fact that rotor skewing suppresses the synchronous torques at low speeds and also reduces the audible noise of the machine. However, the casting process results in a low resistive path between the rotor bars and the iron laminations, for skewed rotors, this promotes the flow of inter-bar currents. These currents, flowing between the rotorbars, increase the harmonic torques during a start and create additional losses at rated operation. For standard unskewed rotors, these losses are ideally zero, but these rotors may produce high audible noise. Studies have shown that rotors with asymmetrical rotor slot pitch can reduce the audible noise level in unskewed machines. By removing the skew, the inter-bar current losses are suppressed to a negligible level; ultimately increased machine efficiency is obtained. In this work the electrical performance is verified through measurements on the built prototypes. Direct-on-line starts and rated performance for motors with different rotor slot arrangements is simulated using 2 D FEM tool FCSmek. The three prototypes are tested in the laboratory according to IEC 60034 - 2 - 1 standard and the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured results. An additional test for the measurement of high frequency delta connected stator winding currents for each prototype machine is also performed, in order to study the losses induced in the stator winding. Results have shown that by introducing the proposed asymmetry in the rotor slots, the synchronous torques at low speeds are suppressed effectively, thus, improving the starting performance of the asymmetrical rotor compared to the standard unskewed rotor. Additionally, a higher <b>pull-out</b> <b>torque</b> is obtained for the unskewed rotor motor compared to the standard skewed rotor motor. However, the losses {{were more or less}} re-distributed in the unskewed rotor motor, resulting in similar efficiency as the standard skewed rotor motor. One important observation is that; to capture the inter-bar current losses which are estimated to be 5. 5 % of the total losses, requires more accurate methods of measurements than the existing. And sufficient repeatability must be achieved; alternatively one should rely on statistical data obtained from measurements on several number of motors...|$|E
