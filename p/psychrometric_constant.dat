40|$|A general {{expression}} {{based on}} the Claperon-Clausius differential equation that relates saturation vapor pressure, absolute temperature, and the latent heat of transformation was derived that expresses saturation vapor pressure {{as a function of}} absolute temperature. This expression was then used to derive general expressions for vapor pressure, absolute humidity, and relative humidity as functions of either dewpoint and ambient temperature or <b>psychrometric</b> parameters. <b>Constants</b> for all general expressions were then evaluated to give specific expressions in both the international system of units and U. S. customary units for temperatures above and below freezing...|$|R

40|$|Good {{irrigation}} water management requires accurate, automated, non-destructive and simple techniques to measure crop water consumption. The actual evaporation from a cabbage crop was measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance technique (BREB), the surface temperature technique and the Penman-monteith method. All models used the shortened energy balance equation to estimate latent heat in which the advected energy {{is assumed to be}} negligible. Four irrigations were applied and 17 rainfall events were recorded during the experiment. The soil at the experimental field was a clay loam. An attempt to detect and reduce measurement error that could result from using inaccurate sensors was performed by calibrating the sensors. Data from inaccurate sensors were not used to compute the latent heat. Error and sensitivity analyse were performed, and the integrity of the weather data using the estimates of weather data from an appropriate model were checked. In addition, a comparative study showed that, for daily totals, there was a very small error in the latent heat calculations when fixed "constants " (density of air, specific heat capacity of air, <b>psychrometric</b> <b>constant,</b> slope of the saturation water vapour pressure vs temperature relationship and specific heat capacity of soil) were used instead of calculated ones...|$|E
40|$|The bowen ratios {{shown in}} the Penman(1948) (PE) and Priestley-Taylor(1972) (PT) equations, widely used to {{estimate}} evaporation rate from saturated surface, were studied theoretically, and a new method was proposed based on the structures of equations. 　　The PE equation has two terms. The first term X uses the decline of saturation vapor pressure curve Δ, and uses the parameter of γ/Δ (γ is <b>psychrometric</b> <b>constant)</b> {{as a substitute for}} the actual Bowen ratio β. And the second term Υ uses the vapor pressure deficit Δe and wind function ｆ(u), and uses the parameter of Ea (=f(u) Δe) as a substitute for the actual flux caused by the actual vapor pressure difference. Because these of γ/Δ and Ea are the provisional parameters which differ according to reference height, both value of X and Y is also provisional in the estimation of evaporation rates. That is to say, the Penman equation has a structure that divides the evaporation rate into two parts, X and Y, and estimates each value using the provisional parameters γ/Δ and Ea, which are variables that change with changes in height. The Penman equation can be applied at any reference height if the wind function is known at that height. Under natural average conditions with a positive Bowen ratio, the constant Bowen ratio line in psychrometric chart is the shape of going to upper right. Therefore, the ratio of X to the whole rate increases as the reference height nears the surface. 　　On the other hand, the PT equation consists of one term which has the structure of multiplying the first term X of PE equation by coefficient α. The α is a coefficient to correct the error due to ignore the second term Y of PE equation, and also to correct the difference of γ/Δ from actual Bowen ratio β. Hence, coefficient α is also provisional parameter which differ according to reference height. As {{it is clear from the}} characteristic of the X and Y of PE equation, and as Priestley and Taylor(1972) have already mentioned, if the reference height nears surface this α becomes to be nearly equal 1. This suggests that under natural average conditions of evaporation occuring, the Bowen ratio can be approximated γ/Δs (Δs is the decline of saturation vapor pressure curve at saturated surface). 　If we assume that the thin layer on the saturated surface has the Bowen ratio β as the form of the γ/Δs, the temperature and vapor pressure at any height should fall along the constant Bowen ratio line shown as Δs in the psychrometric chart. If so, the equations of PE and PT are resulted end in the equation of Bowen ratio method, and we can decide β from the observation data of only one height because we can easily estimate Δs using computer calculation. The advantage of this method are; only one point data at the height of z is needed, the wind speed data and wind function of PE equation are not needed, and coefficient α of PT equation become useless. In this study, this method was proposed as the name of Surface Bowen Ratio (SBR) method, and it was verified using data from two lakes, Hokkaido, Japan. The resulting values calculated from the SBR method were close to those from the original Penman method and it was thus proven that this method has potential as an effective method for estimating evaporation rates more easily. The SBR method is on the basis of above assumption. Hence, it is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of assumption hereafter...|$|E
