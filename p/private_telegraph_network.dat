In 1881, Roach added {{a number of}} hydraulic and pneumatic riveting machines to the yard—amongst the first such machines in the country. In the same year, he installed a <b>private</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> to accelerate communications between his various plants, and he also installed an Edison electric lighting system at the yard which allowed longer working hours in winter and a second shift when required.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the nationwide telephone network following the expi-ration of the Bell patents in 1894, along with expansion of <b>private</b> wire <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks,</b> created the “nerve center ” necessary for rapid growth in the decentral-ized, dealer-intermediated, over-the-counter security markets. Using member-ship roles from the National Quotation Bureau—the predecessor of the NASDAQ—I link {{growth in the number}} of dealers to the expansion of these communication networks prior to World War I. Moreover, trading activity on the organized stock exchanges fell during this period, suggesting that these tech-nologies provided a competitive advantage to the over-the-counter markets. econdary security markets play an important role in economic de-velopment by making bonds and stocks liquid and facilitating price discovery. Historically, two different mechanisms have been used to fa-cilitate trading: the organized exchange and over-the-counter (or unor-ganized) markets.

It {{consisted}} of a zinc anode dipped in sulfuric acid and a platinum cathode dipped in nitric acid, separated by porous earthenware. The Grove cell provided a high current and nearly twice the voltage of the Daniell cell, which made it the favoured cell of the American <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> for a time. However, it gave off poisonous nitric oxide fumes when operated. The voltage also dropped sharply as the charge diminished, which became a liability as <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> grew more complex. Platinum was also very expensive.|$|R

By 1877 the service was used to transfer almost $2.5 million each year.
