25|$|From the beginning, the Resistance {{attracted}} <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>walks</b> of {{life and}} with diverse political views.

A further difficulty was the shortage of weapons, which explained why the early resistance groups that were founded in 1940 focused on publishing journals and underground newspapers as the lack of guns and ammunition made armed resistance almost impossible.

[...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain.
