5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Sovnarkom {{passed a}} decree that inaugurated the Red Terror, {{a system of}} {{repression}} orchestrated by the Cheka. Although sometimes described {{as an attempt to}} eliminate the entire bourgeoisie, Lenin did not want to exterminate all members of this class, merely those who sought to reinstate their rule. The majority of the Terror's victims were well-to-do citizens or former members of the Tsarist administration; others were non-bourgeois anti-Bolsheviks and <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> undesirables such as prostitutes. The Cheka claimed the right to both sentence and execute anyone whom it deemed to be an enemy of the government, without recourse to the Revolutionary Tribunals. Accordingly, throughout Soviet Russia the Cheka carried out killings, often in large numbers. For example, the Petrograd Cheka executed 512 people in a few days. There are no surviving records to provide an accurate figure of how many perished in the Red Terror; later estimates of historians have ranged between 10,000 and 15,000, and 50,000 to 140,000.|$|E

For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be unaesthetic, unattractive and embarrassing.

The studies examine consequences of social change in Russia and Mongolia after the dismantlement of the Soviet Union. They focus on the impact of social changes that are numerous, negative, and rapid. Specifically, an integration of relative deprivation and social identity theories is pro-posed. According to hypotheses, it is found that the more people <b>perceive</b> <b>social</b> change as numerous and negative, the more they experience social collective relative deprivation. In addition, the more people <b>perceive</b> <b>social</b> change as rapid and negative, the more they express temporal collective relative deprivation. Both types of collective relative deprivation are linked to collective esteem: Whereas the path from temporal collective relative deprivation is negative in both studies, the valence of path from social collective relative deprivation to collective esteem depends on perceived in-group status of the cultural group...|$|R

A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

40|$|<b>Perceiving</b> <b>social</b> {{information}} such as the cooperativeness of another person {{is an important part}} of human interaction. But can people perceive the cooperativeness of others even without any visual or auditory information? In a novel experimental setup, we connected two people with a rope and made them accomplish a point-collecting task together while they could not see or hear each other. We observed a consistently emerging turn-taking behavior in the interactions and installed a confederate in a subsequent experiment who either minimized or maximized this behavior. Participants experienced this only through the haptic force-feedback of the rope and made evaluations about the confederate after each interaction. We found that perception of cooperativeness was significantly affected only by the manipulation of this turn-taking behavior. Gender- and size-related judgments also significantly differed. Our results suggest that people can <b>perceive</b> <b>social</b> {{information such}} as the cooperativeness of other people even in situations where possibilities for communication are minimal...|$|R

Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> support.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} perceived control and a persons perceptions of their neighborhood environment may mediate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health. This crosssectional study assessed whether perceptions of informal social control mediated the association between SES and self-reported health, and if these two constructs represented distinct mechanisms linking SES with self-reported health. The sample consisted of 869 adults residing in 300 census tracts in Montreal, Canada. Multilevel methods were used to assess the associations among self-reported health, SES, perceived control, and <b>perceived</b> informal <b>social</b> control adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Perceived control (mediation estimate 5 0. 16, po. 001) and <b>perceived</b> informal <b>social</b> control (mediation estimate 5 0. 05, po. 05) partially mediated the association between SES and self-reported health.
