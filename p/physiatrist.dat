500|$|SCI {{patients}} {{often require}} extended treatment in specialized spinal unit or an intensive care unit. [...] The rehabilitation process typically {{begins in the}} acute care setting. Usually the inpatient phase lasts 8–12 weeks and then the outpatient rehabilitation phase lasts 3–12 months after that, followed by yearly medical and functional evaluation. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, nurses, social workers, psychologists {{and other health care}} professionals work as a team under the coordination of a <b>physiatrist</b> to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the person’s condition.|$|E

In addition to its efforts as a national society, the Academy places a priority on assisting physiatrists at the state level through grassroots advocacy on critical practice issues.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{of physical and}} rehabilitation medicine (PRM) physicians in musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS) is increasing. In this study, we aimed to explore the attitudes {{of a group of}} Italian <b>physiatrists</b> on this topic before and after a 2 ½-day MSUS course. A 15 -question survey (designed ad-hoc for this study) was administered before the first session of an MSUS course held in the PRM Department of Tor Vergata University, Rome. At the end of the course, a repeat questionnaire with eight of the original 15 questions (on awareness) was administered. The survey contained multiple-choice and open-ended questions addressing three main aspects: personal background, MSUS experience, and awareness about MSUS. All of the course participants (17 <b>physiatrists)</b> completed the precourse and postcourse questionnaires. Almost two-thirds of the participants (11 / 17) reported that they had never received education on MSUS. Overall, the participants rated MSUS as either ‘essential’ (8 / 16) or ‘useful to some of my practice’ (8 / 16). All of them stated at both times that <b>physiatrists</b> should perform MSUS themselves and that MSUS education is necessary for <b>physiatrists.</b> Participants’ awareness significantly increased on the indications for MSUS, the advantages and the structures that could be evaluated with it. We draw {{attention to the fact that}} PRM physicians are increasingly becoming aware of the need for MSUS in clinical practice. Unfortunately, the two barriers (i. e. lack of education and lack of device) against the use of MSUS by <b>physiatrists</b> still seem to exist. Finally, we acknowledge the paramount role of international collaborative efforts (e. g. EURO-MUSCULUS) to speed up and standardize the education process and the clinical application of MSUS in our field...|$|R
