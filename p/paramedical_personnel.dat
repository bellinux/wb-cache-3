40|$|Background: The {{current study}} {{outlines}} {{some of the}} main particularities of both real and simulated mass casualty incidents (MCI) and disasters in Romania as reported by medical and <b>paramedical</b> participating <b>personnel.</b> Methods: A non-profit organization in Romania trained 1250 doctors, nurses and paramedics for proper MCI interventions through a dedicated programme for {{the last part of the}} year 2013. Half a year later, an email with a unique link to an online questionnaire was sent to each participant to assess their opinion over the participation in real or already simulated MCI or disasters. The questionnaire consisted of 25 specific topics, out of which only a fraction were considered for the current study. Results: Out of all participants, 145 doctors, 184 nurses and 115 paramedics provided valid answers, totaling 444 responders. Most participants were satisfied with the information about the location and type of the incident they would respond to. The amplitude of a given event is generally well anticipated under simulation conditions as compared to real events, where the amplitude tends to be higher rather than lower than expected (p= 0. 0082). About three quarters of participants under real or simulated events repeated or demanded repeating the information trafficked through mobile radios, almost a quarter misinterpreted the information, and almost a half reported delayed operations due to miscommunication. Conclusions: Simulations are a proper method of communication evaluation for mass casualty incidents and disasters, which can also stress the common communication issues encountered during a real MCI unfolding...|$|R

50|$|In {{patients}} with symptoms typical of myocardial ischemia an electrocardiogram must be immediately obtained - e.g., within 10 minutes from first contact with medical or <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel,</b> including prehospital setting; the electrocardiographic findings will guide the subsequent management.

Serum cardiac biomarkers are routinely obtained and their elevation is necessary for confirming diagnosis of myocardial infarction; however, reperfusion must not be delayed by waiting for the results. Patients without the above findings are initially classified as suffering from non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, and subsequent cardiac biomarker results will differentiate between true non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina.|$|E
50|$|The hospital's {{premises}} {{were seized}} by Japanese forces on 18 February 1942. The General Hospital subsequently functioned as the Japanese military's primary surgical centre in Southeast Asia {{until the end}} of the war- the upper block was used by the Japanese army; the lower by the navy. During the Japanese Occupation, the hospital faced severe water shortages after its water supply was cut. Consequently, hundreds of patients and staff- both locals and expatriates- perished and were buried in a mass grave on hospital grounds. Following the Japanese surrender and liberation of Singapore in 1945, the three main blocks of the hospital- previously known as the Upper, Middle and Lower blocks- were renamed Bowyer, Stanley and Norris blocks in memory of three doctors who were intimately involved in hospital administration and perished during the Occupation. The Occupation had severely crippled both manpower and medical supplies infrastructure- the hospital faced a dire shortage of trained doctors, nurses and <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel.</b> The hospital also faced the daunting task of treating a severely malnourished population and curbing the spread of Malaria and other diseases that had become rampant during the Occupation.|$|E

At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors.

Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year medical schools. Health care in urban areas was provided by <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel</b> assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to find out if the}} psychological contract and organizational justice perceptions of <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel</b> were affected by their socio-demographic factors and to determine whether there is a significant relation between their psychological contract and organizational justice perceptions.

We aimed at reaching all of the <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel</b> without any sampling. Of 600 questionnaires distributed, we collected 458 (76, 3 %). The questionnaire used for collecting data consists of three parts. The first part concentrates on the individual characteristics of health workers while the second part contains the 17 item Psychological Contract Scale developed by Millward and Hopkins (1998) that is based on the quantitative approach of psychological contract. ln the third part, we used the and ldquo;Organisational Justice Measurement'' with 17 statements developed by Colquitt (2001). One of the statements refers to the study of Iscan and Naktiyok (2004). The results of the study showed that the psychological contract and organizational justice perceptions of <b>paramedical</b> <b>personnel</b> were very low. Also, their psychological contract and organizational justice perceptions were significantly affected by gender (p 0, 05).
