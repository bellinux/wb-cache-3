5000|$|Asiago ( [...] or [...] ) is an Italian cow's milk cheese {{that can}} assume {{different}} textures, {{according to its}} aging, from smooth for the fresh Asiago (Asiago <b>Pressato)</b> to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese (Asiago d'allevo), the flavor of which is reminiscent of Parmesan. The aged cheese is often grated in salads, soups, pastas, and sauces while the fresh Asiago is sliced to prepare panini or sandwiches; {{it can also be}} melted on a variety of dishes and cantaloupe.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} this type of cheese is {{associated}} with the Alps located in Germany/Austria. Emmental in nature like its cousin the Swiss cheese, it is featured with tiny holes known as 'teardrops". Similar to the majority of hard/semi-hard cheese, the more it is matured, the more flavour it develops. The alpkase cheese from Trentino Alto Adige is made from cow milk. Some of those cheese varieties, exceeding 60 products, native to that place include, Asiago Antico Maso Rosso, Arunda, Asiago d'allevo, Asiago Mezzano cheese and Asiago <b>Pressato</b> Trentino cheese.|$|E
40|$|During cheesemaking, the brines {{employed}} undergo modification, {{during which}} NaCl and various organic and inorganic compounds are {{transferred to the}} cheese. To evaluate the suitability of Delvosalt (Gist Brocades, Milan), a commercial mineral-based ionic integrator/salting agent incorporating chloride and lactates, 3 different cheeses - Montasio, Asiago <b>pressato</b> and Pannarello (a caciotta dolce variety) - were made, with addition of recommended levels of Delvosalt to the brine. Changes in the brines' physicochemical characteristics (pH, acidity, NaCl, Be, N), microbial load (total count, fungi, osmophilic microorganisms) and turbidity, and in the cheeses' composition (moisture, ash, NaCl, protein, fat) and rheological properties were analysed, results being discussed separately {{for each type of}} cheese. Use of Delvosalt did not affect the typical characteristics of the cheeses or rate of salt diffusion; use of this agent led to formation of a more consistent crust due to the low pH (< 4. 6) required, helped to standardize the brining process, and prolonged the life of the brine...|$|E
