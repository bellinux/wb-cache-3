5|$|Elvis Presley is {{a supreme}} figure in American life, one whose presence, {{no matter how}} banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.... The {{cultural}} range of his music has expanded {{to the point where}} it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.... Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E
5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E

25|$|Josiah Crackenthorpe, <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> tea biscuits, built Rutherford Hall in 1884. His son, Luther, now a semi-invalid widower, had {{displayed}} spendthrift qualities in his youth. To preserve the family fortune, Josiah has left his considerable fortune in trust, the income from {{which is to}} be paid to Luther for life. After Luther's death, the capital is to be divided equally among Luther's children. Luther Crackenthorpe is merely the trustee of Rutherford Hall and hence, according to the will, cannot sell the house. The house itself will be inherited by Luther Crackenthorpe's eldest surviving son or his issue.|$|E
25|$|Boyar greed gave Rostislav {{the pretext}} for {{reviving}} {{his quest for}} Halych where the local magnates acknowledged Daniil Romanovich (his uncle) as their prince, but appropriated authority to themselves. In 1241, Rostislav marshaled the princes of Bolokhoveni, and besieged Bakota which was an important <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> salt. When he failed to take the city, he withdrew to Chernigov, but later he redirected his attack against the more important towns of Halych and Przemyśl. He had strong support from the local boyars who cajoled the townsmen of Halych itself into capitulating without a fight. After occupying Halych, Rostislav made prince Konstantin Vladimirovich Ryazansky the ruler of Przemyśl. The bishops of the only two eparchies in Halych also supported Rostislav.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an acrid level. The <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, knew what was going to happen but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E

25|$|Aston Martin Lagonda Limited is a British {{manufacturer}} of luxury sports cars and grand tourers. It {{was founded in}} 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. Steered from 1947 by David Brown, it became associated with expensive grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional character James Bond following his use of a DB5 model in the 1964 film Goldfinger. Their sports cars are regarded as a British cultural icon. Aston Martin has held a Royal Warrant as <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> motorcars to HRH the Prince of Wales since 1982. It has over 150 car dealerships in over 50 countries on 6 continents making them a truly global automobile brand.|$|E
25|$|Semiotics {{operates}} {{under the}} theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> meaning, even {{to the extent that}} an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it. Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

25|$|A {{club for}} cricket was opened in 1877 at Longwood Estate, a place {{named after the}} house Napoleon Bonaparte stayed at while exiled to Saint Helena. Located on the {{outskirts}} of Boston, cricketers and baseball players put Longwood on the sports map. Specifically, Harry Wright, first player-manager of the Boston Red Stockings, played cricket for the United States, as did his brother George Wright. George Wright combined with tennis pro Charlie Chambers in league games throughout New England and played at Longwood against Lord Harris' XI in 1891. George Wright was the co-proprietor of Wright and Ditman, <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> fine sports goods. Wright brought the first tennis gear to Boston on his return from a baseball-cricket tour of England in 1874. Wright also taught tennis to Harvard students and toured with them in California in 1890. It was George Wright who deserves the credit for Longwood's broad-based sporting tradition, having excelled in baseball and cricket as a paid professional and at tennis as an imaginative promoter of the game. A lawn tennis court was laid in 1878, two years after the organization of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. On January 5, 1888, Longwood member and US cricket team captain C.L. Bixby led the team to a win over the West Indies cricket team at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana. Richard D. Sears, who won seven United States Championships, would soon become a club member as well.|$|E

500|$|Icelandic singer Björk was a {{prominent}} <b>purveyor</b> <b>of</b> art pop for her wide-ranging integration of disparate forms of art and popular culture.

Discussing Björk in 2015, Jason Farago of The Guardian wrote: [...] "The last 30 years in art history are in large part a story of collaborative enterprises, of collapsed boundaries between high art and low, and {{of the end of}} divisions between media. Few cultural figures have made the distinctions seem as meaningless as the Icelandic singer who combined trip hop with 12-tone, and who brought the avant garde to MTV just before both those things disappeared." ...|$|E
