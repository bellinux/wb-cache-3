40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} effects of regular aerobic {{training}} combined with range of motion (ROM) exercises on aerobic capacity, quality of life, and function in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods. Thirty patients with JIA and 20 healthy age-matched controls (mean age ± SD, 11. 3 ± 2. 4 versus 11. 0 ± 2. 3, resp.; P> 0. 05) were included. All patients performed aerobic walking (4 {{days a week for}} 8 weeks) and active and <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> of involved joints. All patients completed the childhood health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ) and the child health questionnaire. ROM measurements of joints were performed by using universal goniometer. Aerobic capacity was determined by measuring peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) during an incremental treadmill test. Results. Peak oxygen uptake and exercise duration were significantly lower in JIA group than in controls (32. 5 ± 6. 6 versus 35. 9 ± 5. 8 and 13. 9 ± 1. 9 versus 15. 0 ± 2. 0, resp.; P< 0. 05 for both). Eight-week combined exercise program significantly improved exercise parameters of JIA patients (baseline versus postexercise VO 2 peak and exercise duration, 32. 5 ± 6. 6 to 35. 3 ± 7. 9 and 13. 9 ± 1. 9 to 16. 3 ± 2. 2, resp.; P< 0. 001 for both). Exercise intervention significantly improved CHAQ scores in JIA patients (0. 77 ± 0. 61 to 0. 20 ± 0. 28, P< 0. 001). Conclusion.

This {{study was to investigate}} the consensus and different perspectives on the treatment of supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children. Methods: A questionnaire was designed for this study, which included the choice of pinning technique, methods of elbow motion, and perception on the restoration of elbow ROM. Seventy-six orthopedic surgeons {{agreed to participate in the}} study and survey was performed by a direct interview manner in the annual meetings of Korean Pediatric Orthopedic Association and Korean Society for Surgery of the Hand.

40|$|Background: Symphalangism {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} difference {{characterized by}} ankylosis of interphalangeal (IP) joints of the fingers and toes. In adults, there were several attempts to restore the stiff joints into mobile ones, but these treatment options resulted in poor outcomes {{and could not be}} applied to growing children. Here, we report our experiences on surgical treatment for children who had symphalangism of the hand. Methods: We treated 36 joints in 17 children with symphalangism of the hand using dorsal capsulotomy and collateral ligament release. The diagnoses were based on history, physical examination, and simple radiographs. Affected fingers were classified according to our grading system. Simple compressive dressing was applied using Coban after surgery. Passive range of motion (ROM) exercise was started on day one or 2 postoperative, {{with the help of a}} hand therapist and patients ’ parents. The patients were prescribed <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> for at least 2 hours a day over a period of 6 months. Results: A single surgeon operated on 30 proximal IP joints, 3 distal IP joints, and 3 IP joints of the thumb. Twenty six joints were classifi ed as grade I, and 10 as grade II. The ROM of affected joints, which was 7. 8 ± 8. 1 (mean ± SD) degrees preoperatively, increased to 46. 8 ± 18. 6 degrees at fi nal follow-up. The final ROM was significantly better in grade I joints, especially when the children had operations at ages 24 months or younger.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Physical therapy {{treatment}} following Total knee Arthroplasty (TKA) {{consists of}} a combination of strengthening and range of motion exercises. The exercise technique, church pew exercise (CPE), has been proposed to enhance quadriceps facilitation and improve function. This is a technique that has the patient standing and rocking forward/back. The backward motion is arrested by engagement of the upper calf against a solid object, creating a sudden flexion torque at the knee and a sudden extension torque at the hip. The combination of CPE with standard physical therapy is claimed to provide better quadriceps control and faster walking post TKA. In this case study, a 51 -year-old female with decreased knee active and passive range of motion (ROM), decreased lower extremity (LE) muscle strength, and limited ambulation post left knee TKA, received conventional physical therapy treatment plus CPE. Methods: The patient received 11 physical therapy home sessions. The first 8 sessions were used to strengthen her knee and increase active and passive ROM. The CPE intervention was performed 3 weeks post-surgery, during the last 3 physical therapy sessions. At these three sessions the patient performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) before and after CPE. Outcomes: At initial evaluation, 4 days post left knee TKA, this patient’s left knee active ROM was only 15 to 76 degrees, and manual muscle testing at her hip and knee indicated strengths of 2 - (hip flexors), 3 - (hamstrings and quadriceps), and 3 + (hip abductors), all out of 5, and her times on two trials of the TUG were 30. 31 and 30. 65 sec, indicating impaired functional ability. At all CPE sessions (3 weeks post-surgery) the patient demonstrated increased gait speeds (i. e. shorter times) on the TUG after the CPE (pre CPE mean = 13. 2 sec; post CPE mean = 11. 2), increased stance time on her affected lower extremity, and increased step length on her contra-lateral lower extremity. The patient reported increased knee stability. Clinical Relevance: Rationale for CPE is based on neurological facilitation of quadriceps and other lower extremity muscles. However, to engage in this exercise the patient must have the ability to balance and to control the hip and knee joints. This patient required several weeks of strengthening and active and <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> before she could perform the CPE. Once able to perform the CPE, she demonstrated improvements in her walking ability, and she expressed greater confidence. Conclusion: Provided a minimal level of strength and active and passive ROM has been attained, CPE may be a valuable short-term supplement to current strengthening regimens addressing quadriceps functional deficits following TKA. Other conditions that involve gait problems related to quadriceps insufficiency might also benefit. The long-term efficacy of CPE remains to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Ovarian steroids such as {{estrogen}} and progesterone {{have been reported}} to influence knee laxity. The effect of testosterone, however, remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of testosterone on the knee range of motion (ROM) and the molecular mechanisms that might involve changes in the expression of relaxin receptor isoforms, Rxfp 1 and Rxfp 2 in the patella tendon and lateral collateral ligament of the female rat knee. Ovariectomized adult female Wistar rats received three days treatment with peanut oil (control), testosterone (125 and 250 μg/kg) and testosterone (125 and 250 μg/kg) plus flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker or finasteride, a 5 α-reductase inhibitor. Duplicate groups received similar treatment however in the presence of relaxin (25 ng/kg). A day after the last drug injection, knee <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> was measured by using a digital miniature goniometer.

We also evaluated arm function using Box and Block, arm reach, 9 -hole pegboard, power grip, and pinch grip force tests. The rTMS-induced MEP amplitude of the paretic side significantly increased whereas the non-paretic side showed a decrease through every session. However, the MEP latency significantly in-creased on the non-paretic hand at post-rTMS with exercise, but a tendency of decrement on paretic hand at same ap-plication. Motor function showed improvement in the 9 -hole pegboard and arm reach tests at post-rTMS with exercis...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{definitive}} evidence showing that serial casting does {{or does not}} improve ankle <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> and functional mobility in the head-injured adult. Five of the eight reviewed articles indicate an improvement in <b>passive</b> ankle dorsiflexion <b>ROM,</b> suggesting a potential benefit for the appropriate patient. However, all eight articles had significant threats to internal and external validity such as small sample size, no control group, and lack of adequate follow-up. These threats limit {{the applicability of the}} results. Further research is necessary, specifically focusing on functional mobility and long-term effects. Based on these results, it is recommended that clinical judgment be a key factor in determining the appropriateness of serial casting per patient presentation in the head-injured population...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the associations between leg length and specific ballet movements in different skill groups. Volunteers were from an undergraduate dance programme (n= 18), a pre-professional school (n= 43) and from an elite classical ballet company (n= 45). Individual {{data were collected}} for anthropometry, vertical jump, leg dexterity, and leg active and <b>passive</b> <b>ROM.</b> ANCOVA identified both main effects as significant with regard to vertical jump (gender P< 0. 001 and skill P= 0. 017); leg length was also identified as a significant covariate (P= 0. 023). Analysis of leg dexterity identified no significant effects with gender, skill or leg length. Active and passive range of motion noted gender (P= 0. 001) and skill (P< 0. 001) differences. Leg length {{was found to be}} negatively associated with both active and <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> (P= 0. 002). In conclusion, the present data highlight the diverse and conflicting effects of leg length on fundamental ballet skills. The longer legs that benefit vertical jump have a negative influence on range of motion and leg dexterity except for highly skilled skilled dancers, who through skill, seem to have overcome the effects of some of these dichotomies...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: Ankle plantar flexor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{susceptible}} muscles to plasticity and contracture after acquired brain injury. The application of thermal agents was introduced before muscle stretch or active exercises in spastic patients for their relaxation effects. The main aim of the present study was to compare the short-term effect of the ultrasound (US) and infrared (IR) on patients with plantar flexor muscle spasticity. Materials and Methods: 21 patients were randomly allocated placed to either US(n= 11) or IR(n= 10) groups. The main outcome measures were, H max / M max  ratio, Original Ashworth Scale(OAS), active and passive range of motion (ROM). These tests  performed before, immediately after and 15 minutes after the intervention. Results: There were no significant changes in H max / M max ratio and OAS after the intervention in both groups. The significant changes of the H max / M max were observed 15 minutes after intervention in the US group. The change in OAS was also statistical significant in IR group in this period. The changes in active and <b>passive</b> ankle dorsiflexion <b>ROM</b> after the intervention were statistically significant in US group. These changes show the significant changes for ankle <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> after 15 minutes of  the intervention in IR group. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that one session application of the ultrasound and infrared are not effective in the treatment of muscle spasticity. The ultrasound improved the ankle active and <b>passive</b> <b>ROM.</b> Further research is needed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} stretching training and chronic stretching regimens on muscle performance {{have not yet}} been systematically investigated on a wider scale. Studies that have investigated possible correlations between stretching and muscular performance are scarce and inconclusive in the literature. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effect of long-term (24 weeks) stretching exercise on muscle contractile properties. Method: Eighteen subjects (five men and thirteen women; 21. 82 ± 1. 74 yrs, 71. 80 ± 11. 65 kg, 1. 77 ± 5. 56 m) volunteered to participate in this study. The training leg was randomly drawn and unilateral static stretching exercises (SS) were applied every day for twenty-four weeks. The SS protocol consisted of four repetitions of stretch, each lasting for one minute with a sixty second rest in between, aiming to increase the passive range of motion (ROM) in ankle dorsiflexion. The testing protocol consisted of measurements pre- and post-intervention in <b>passive</b> <b>ROM,</b> <b>passive</b> resistance torque (PRT), isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) (10 ˚, 0 ˚, - 5 ˚ and - 10 ˚), isokinetic peak torque (PT) and angle at PT (30, 45, 60 and 90 ˚/sec). Results: The ROM significantly increased pre- to post-test for the training leg by 10. 42 ˚ (58. 42 %) (P> 0. 05). For the PRT test a significant difference was found only at the angle of - 10 ˚ between pre- to post-test for the training leg (P> 0. 05). No significant changes were observed for isometric MVC, isokinetic PT and angle at PT pre- to post-test or between groups (P> 0. 05). For the control leg no significant differences were found. Discussion: These results suggest that the present long-term stretching intervention was effective in increasing <b>passive</b> <b>ROM.</b> Despite this highly significant change in <b>passive</b> <b>ROM,</b> no changes were seen in muscle-contractile properties. Additional longitudinal interventions are needed to better understand the long-term effects of stretching training on the angle/torque relationship and the impact on force production throughout ROM...|$|R
30|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>ROM</b> of {{the wrist}} (flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation) and active forearm {{pronation}} and supination were evaluated using a double-armed goniometer. A Jamar dynamometer {{was used to test}} grip strength. Data were recorded while the upper extremity was kept in a standardized position (patient seated with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90 °, forearm and wrist in neutral position); values were compared to those in the opposite hand.

40|$|Background: Using a {{cross-sectional}} design comparison {{was made}} of two overhead press techniques (in-front of the head or behind the head). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the impact of behind the head or in-front of the head overhead pressing technique on shoulder range of movement (ROM) and spine posture. The overhead press is commonly prescribed exercise. The two techniques (in-front of the head or behind the head) may influence joint mechanics and therefore require an objective analysis. Methods: <b>Passive</b> shoulder <b>ROM</b> quantified using goniometric measures, dynamic ROM utilised three dimensional (3 D) biomechanical measures (120 Hz) of 33 participants performing overhead pressing in a seated position. The timing and synchronisation of the upper limb shoulder and spine segments were quantified and influence of each technique investigated. Results: The in-front technique commenced in lordotic position, whilst behind the head technique commenced in kyphotic position. Behind the head technique started with less thoracic extension than in-front condition. The thoracic spine remained extended and moved between 12 ° and 15 ° regardless of gender or technique. The techniques resulted in a significant difference between genders. Males were able to maintain a flat or normal lumbar lordosis, whereas females tended to kyphotic. Conclusion: Shoulder <b>ROM</b> was within <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> for all measures except external rotation for males with the behind the head technique. To avoid possible injury <b>passive</b> <b>ROM</b> should be increased prior to behind the head protocol. Females showed greater spine movements, suggesting trunk strengthening may assist overhead pressing techniques. For participants with normal trunk stability and ideal shoulder ROM, overhead pressing is a safe exercise (for the shoulder and spine) when performed either in-front or behind the head...|$|R
