In the above context particularly due to constraints of funding especially capital cost, adopting <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> for implementation of water supply projects after the prefeasibility study is a timely need. It will enable the NWSDB officials to justify their decisions to select the priority order of implementation of water supply projects on a rational basis. Prioritization is being done at present in NWSDB for urban water supply schemes and resettlements. However, there is no such <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> developed for selection of RWS schemes for funding at the NWSDB at present. Consequently this study was undertaken to prepare a <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> for the selection of RWS schemes which are carried out under RWS Section of NWSDB. The main parameters included in the <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> to select whether a proposed project is appropriate for implementation are source adequacy, acceptability of technical option, source extraction and service level to the community, willingness and capacity of the community to perform O&M function, to contribute to capital cost sharing, Tariff / O&M expenses and supply labour and material and justified unit capital cost per house hold. Parameters used for prioritizing the project are water quality and impact of water borne diseases before the project, whether children below 14 years are engaged in water hauling, whether the water hauling distance is above 200 m whether the community pays unjustifiably on drinking water, existing sanitary practices, availability of alternative sources and percentage of vulnerable people in the community. A set of conditions coming under each parameter were determined by formulating ranges to measure the effect of that parameter. Then scores were assigned to parameters and subsequently to conditions. The project that gets the highest score is at the highest priority. Prepared criteria were checked with 10 hypothetical cases. It was found that the resulting priority order is directly relevant to the expected outcome. Then real data related to four projects were applied and tested to ascertain practical problems with the developed <b>Priority</b> <b>Criteria.</b> The <b>Priority</b> <b>Criteria</b> could be applied after making the respective officers preparing pre-feasibility reports aware of how to include the required information.

40|$|AbstractLarge-scale {{penetration}} of electric vehicles (EVs) would significantly increase the load requirements of buildings in highly urbanized cities. EVs exhibit {{higher degree of}} charging flexibility {{when compared to other}} interruptible loads in buildings. Hence, EVs can be assigned lower priority and interrupted before interrupting any other loads. Any temporary interruption will have minimum impact on EV owner's satisfaction/comfort. However, it should be ensured that the EVs could be charged to the owner's required state of charge (SOC) by the time of departure. The scheduling algorithms that are used to manage the EV charging process ensure that the charging requirements are fulfilled even when there are temporary interruptions. The capability of the scheduling algorithms to manage mismatches decreases with the decrease in time available for charging. In this paper, the impact of demand response management (DRM) on the chargeability of the EVs while using different <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> is examined. Subsequently, the proportion of interruption for each EV with different <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> and the need for determining the chargeability of EVs before shedding them are studied.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} multi-criteria {{decision}} making (MCDM) problems with multiple priorities, in which priority weights {{associated with the}} lower <b>priority</b> <b>criteria</b> {{are related to the}} satisfactions of the higher <b>priority</b> <b>criteria.</b> To do so, we first propose a prioritized weighted aggregation operator based on ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator and triangular norms (t-norms). In order to preserve the tradeoffs among the criteria in the same priority level, we suggest that the satisfaction degree regarding each priority level is viewed as a pseudo criterion. On the other hand, t-norms are used to model the priority relationships between the criteria in different priority levels. In particular, we show that strict Archimedean t-norms perform better in inducing priority weights. As Hamacher family of t-norms provides a wide class of strict Archimedean t-norms ranging from the product to weakestt-norm, Hamacher parameterized t-norms are used to induce the priority weight for each priority level. Furthermore, considering decision maker (DM) ’s requirement toward higher priority levels, a benchmark based approach is proposed to induce priority weight for each priority level. In particular, Lukasiewicz implication is used to compute benchmark achievement for crisp requirements;target-oriented decision analysis is utilized to obtain the benchmark achievement for fuzzy requirements. Finally, some numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed prioritized aggregation technique as well as to compare with previous researches...|$|E

They are derived from the ethical principles established by the Swedish parliament 1997 but have been used only to a limited extent in primary care. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and analyse: 1) GPs', nurses', and patients' prioritising in routine primary care 2) The association between the three key <b>priority</b> setting <b>criteria</b> and the overall priority assigned by the GPs and nurses to individual patients. Methods Paired questionnaires were distributed to all patients and the GPs or nurses they had contact with during a 2 -week period at four health centres in Sweden. The staff registered the health conditions or health problem, and the planned intervention. Then they estimated the severity of the health condition, the expected patient benefit, and the cost-effectiveness of the planned intervention. Both the staff and the patients reported their overall prioritisation of the patient. In total, 1851 paired questionnaires were collected. Results Compared to the medical staff, the patients assigned relatively higher priority to acute/minor conditions than to preventive check-ups for chronic conditions. Severity of the health condition was the <b>priority</b> setting <b>criterion</b> that had the strongest association with the overall priority for the staff as a whole, but for the GPs it was cost-effectiveness. Conclusions The challenge for primary care providers is to balance the patients' demands with medical needs and cost-effectiveness.
