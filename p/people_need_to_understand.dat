However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it.

[...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?"

5000|$|The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a {{principle}} of dialogic learning, {{should not be confused}} with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in Habermas (1984), the instrumental and communicative rationality are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p. 16). In addition, [...] "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> other positions and express their own" [...] (Flecha, 2000, p. 16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.|$|E

This expansion develops through success in specific situations and a growing sense of personal agency.• As people’s competencies are enhanced, they are able to create new contents where choices are more likely to be made, actualized, and sustained.• Maintenance of personal change is necessary for sustainability of development.|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} {{intended}} to give a general view of the United States Extension Service in preparing {{to work in a}} less developed country. The object has been to collect data and information on the U. S. Extension work including the contemporary staff, local leaders and farmers, for use in considering the U. S. experiences and practices for the Ugandan situation. The results of the study, which are difficult to summarize briefly, will be listed as important points. 1. American leaders as evidenced by this study, have been genuinely interested in Agriculture and not merely as means of furthering their political interests. 2. Agricultural Extension is the U. S. owes much of its progress to the alertness of the American government. 3. A Memorandum of Understanding is necessary in Extension Organization and functioning. People trained in administrative theory are needed. 4. The American experience shows that democratic agricultural societies, Farmers’ Institutes and Farm Organization are important agencies for community development. Research shows the agricultural societies and farm organizations in America are better and earlier indicators of the <b>people’s</b> felt <b>needs</b> than the government or the Congressmen. 5. Cooperation is better than control, and this is true of the U. S. Extension Organization and functioning. 6. The farmers must take some initiative if they want aid. 7. Past attempts show it is beneficial to plan extension programs combining instruction, recreation, and entertainment. 8. Extension should be based on sound education case principles. <b>Peoples</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> their own <b>needs</b> in order <b>to</b> ask for the necessary aid. 9. Agricultural progress has been promoted by the professional and business people in the entire community. In less developed countries, those is charge do not care about farmers or their needs. 10. There is a need for cooperation between Extension, Research and the University and Agricultural Colleges. Also, {{it is important to have}} ongoing learning and teaching for this department. 11. This study reveals a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be concerned, for there is a clear lacking of trained people in Extension Administration in Uganda.

40|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food in Bangladesh. Thus, {{the price of}} rice is an {{important}} economic factor in Bangladesh especially for poor people. In Bangladesh, during the price hike of 2008 - 09, rice price increased by 40 % on an average across the country. Interestingly, the consumption of rice in some rural parts of Bangladesh also increased during that period. Thus, {{the focus of this}} paper is to examine the practical evidence of this positive relationship between the consumption of rice and increasing price which is addressed as Giffen behavior (inverse of normal behavior) for rice consumption in Bangladesh. By analyzing secondary data obtained from some specific rural parts namely Patharghata (Barguna), Chaddagham (Comilla), Sadar (Jamalpur), Kaligang (Jhenaidaha), Sreemangal (Moulvibazar) and Sadar (Naogaon) of Bangladesh, we have found a new insight in this context. We find that the price elasticity of staple food for the poor people depends significantly and nonlinearly on the severity of their poverty. In order to have an effective design of welfare for the poor <b>people,</b> we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> this heterogeneity of their consumption behavior...|$|R

5000|$|Quantum {{field theory}} is a {{generalization}} of quantum mechanics. Krivchenkov believed that <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{at least the}} non-relativistic theory. He almost asked students to excuse him for the field theory, where only perturbation theory can be offered. Not only do the perturbation theory series diverge, but each perturbational term also in some sense is infinite, and a special renormalization of the interaction constant is required to give the result the physical sense. One of the colleagues of Krivchenkov, Yurii Shirokov tried to construct quantum field theory in terms of wave packets, without divergences, using the algebra of generalized functions, but even now this approach is not sufficiently developed. Krivchenkov told students that {{they are supposed to}} build up a [...] "true" [...] theory, not just a perturbation, that always gives a divergent series. This statement (dogma) applies not only to Field Theory and quantum mechanics, but to any perturbation theory with respect to any distributed system; the perturbation series always diverges. Krivchenkov had realized this and brought this knowledge to students. Many problems in his books stress this property of perturbation theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{collaboration}} in e-science and business environments {{is no longer}} limited to the boundary of a single organization. People belonging to different organizations collaborate together to achieve a common goal by establishing virtual teams. The current trend is to rely on SOA-based tools and services for virtual teams and their collaborative processes because SOA offers many technologies to simplify the integration and interoperability of services belonging to different organizations and to allow the user to easily access existing services and tools. In complex environments comprising distributed software services and <b>people,</b> we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how <b>people</b> and software services interact in order to adapt activities and services to the change of their operating environments {{as well as to}} allow them to self-manage their behaviors during the collaboration. We observed that {{there is a lack of}} tools supporting the analysis of interactions in such ad-hoc collaborative processes at runtime. In this paper we present our VOIA(Vienna Online Interaction Analysis) framework which aims at analyzing interactions within collaborative processes in SOA-based environments. We present a comprehensive list of interaction metrics and patterns associated with ad-hoc collaborations and techniques used to determine these metrics and patterns. We discuss how metrics and patterns can be used in process adaptation and illustrate VOIA’s capabilities with several experiments. ...|$|R
