40|$|In data envelopment analysis, {{there are}} several methods for {{measuring}} efficiency change over time, e. g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between consecutive two terms. These carry-overs {{play an important role}} in measuring the efficiency of decision making units in each term as well as over the whole terms based on the long-term viewpoint. Dynamic DEA model proposed by Färe and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called Dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we classify them into four categories, i. e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to <b>profit</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and net earned surplus carried to the next term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, loss carried forward, bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed carry-overs indicate, respectively, discretionary and non-discretionary ones. We develop Dynamic SBM models that can evaluate the overall efficiency of decision making units for the whole terms as well as the term efficiencies. DEA, Dynamic DEA, DSBM, Carry-over...|$|E

However, an adverse aspect for companies is related to taxation of this subsequent distribution, due to the risk that tax authorities might reclassify this operation and, implicitly, apply penalties for late payment of dividends, starting with the 1 st of January of the financial year following {{the one in which}} the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of the <b>profits</b> of the previous financial year has been approved, and until the payment of related tax. ...|$|R

30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and <b>carried</b> backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|R
