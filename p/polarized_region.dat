40|$|A {{gradient}} of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) plays a {{major role}} in specifying the antero-posterior pattern of structures that develop in the distal part of the vertebrate limb, in particular, the antero-posterior pattern of the digits. Classical embryological experiments identified the <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> (or zone of polarizing activity, ZPA), a signaling region at the posterior margin of the early chick wing bud and, consistent with a model in which production of a diffusible morphogen specifies antero-posterior positional information, <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> signaling was shown to be dose dependent and long range. It is now well established that the vertebrate hedgehog gene, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which encodes a secreted proteis expressed in the <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> of the chick wing and that Shh signaling has the same characteristics as <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> signaling. Shh expression at the posterior of the early limb bud and the mechanism of Shh signal transduction are conserved among vertebrates including mammals. However, it is unlikely that a simple Shh gradient is responsible for digit pattern formation in mammalian limbs and there is still little understanding of how positional information specified by Shh signaling is encoded and translated into digit anatomy. Alterations in Shh signaling underlie some congenital limb abnormalities and also changes in timing and extent of Shh signaling appear to be related to the evolution of morphological diversity of vertebrate limbs...|$|R
40|$|Using {{one-dimensional}} models, we {{show that}} a helical magnetic field with an appropriate sign of helicity can compensate the Faraday depolarization resulting from the superposition of Faraday-rotated polarization planes from a spatially extended source. For radio emission from a helical magnetic field, the polarization {{as a function of}} the square of the wavelength becomes asymmetric with respect to zero. Mathematically speaking, the resulting emission occurs then either at observable or at unobservable (imaginary) wavelengths. We demonstrate that rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows for the reconstruction of the underlying Faraday dispersion function in the former case, but not in the latter. The presence of positive magnetic helicity can thus be detected by observing positive RM in highly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions</b> in the sky and negative RM in weakly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions.</b> Conversely, negative magnetic helicity can be detected by observing negative RM in highly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions</b> and positive RM in weakly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions.</b> The simultaneous presence of two magnetic constituents with opposite signs of helicity is shown to possess signatures that can be quantified through polarization peaks at specific wavelengths and the gradient of the phase of the Faraday dispersion function.

Analysis of the clakel 2 mutant indicated that ClaKEL 2 was required {{for the establishment of}} cellular polarity essential for proper morphogenesis of appressoria {{and that there is a}} plant signal-specific bypass pathway for appressorium development which circumvents ClaKEL 2 function.

Normal appressorium formation on the artificial substrate by the clakel 2 mutants was restored when cells were incubated in the presence of CaCl 2 or exudates from cucumber cotyledon.

HD 100546 b likely has extremely red infrared colors compared to field brown dwarfs, qualitatively similar to young cloudy superjovian planets, however, these colors may instead indicate that HD 100546 b is still accreting material from a circumplanetary disk.

Most of the near-infrared (NIR) polarizations are dichroic, with position angles of polarization agreeing, both globally and locally, with previous far-infrared (FIR) and submillimeter observations, having taken into account the 90 ^∘ difference in angles between dichroic absorption and emission. This {{is consistent with the}} idea that both NIR dichroic polarizations and FIR/submillimeter thermal polarizations trace the magnetic fields in the OMC- 1 region. The magnetic fields inferred from these observations show a pinch at scales less than 0. 5 pc with a centroid near IRc 2. The hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern is explained by the models in which the magnetic field lines are dragged along with the contracting gas and then wound up by rotation in a disk. The highly <b>polarized</b> <b>region</b> to the northwest of IRc 2 and the low-polarized region near the bright bar are also common among NIR and FIR/submillimeter data, although a few regions of discrepancy exist.

The size and nature (concentration or dilution) of polarizations which were found to occur was found to depend on the magnitude of the equilibrium partition coefficient of the solute in the two-phase system, as well as the direction of migration across the interface. These polarizations are in addition to those commonly known to occur near regions where electrophoretic flux changes radically, such as near interfaces.

All models demonstrated a characteristic noted in experimental studies, concentration at interfaces when electrophoresis is from equilibrium preferred phase towards non-preferred phase.

Detailed analyses have revealed that Shh has the properties of the long sought after <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> morphogen that specifies positional values across the antero-posterior axis (e. g., thumb to little finger axis) of the limb. Shh has also been shown to control the width of the limb bud by stimulating mesenchyme cell proliferation and by regulating the antero-posterior length of the apical ectodermal ridge, the signaling region required for limb bud outgrowth and the laying down of structures along the proximo-distal axis (e. g., shoulder to digits axis) of the limb. It has been shown that Shh signaling can specify antero-posterior positional values in limb buds in both a concentration- (paracrine) and time-dependent (autocrine) fashion. Currently there are several models for how Shh specifies positional values over time in the limb buds of chick and mouse embryos and how this is integrated with growth. Extensive work has elucidated downstream transcriptional targets of Shh signaling. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how antero-posterior positional values are encoded and then interpreted to give the particular structure appropriate to that position, for example, the type of digit.

Available experimental evidence and qualitative intuition about the complex anatomical structure support the viewpoint that different (average) conductivities are characteristic of the direction along the fiber axis, as compared with the cross-fiber direction, in intracellular as well as extracellular space. This report analyzes two-dimensional anisotropic cardiac tissue and achieves integral equations for finding intracellular and extracellular potentials, longitudinal currents, and membrane currents directly from a given description of the transmembrane voltage. These mathematical results are used as a basis for a numerical model of realistic (though idealized) two-dimensional cardiac tissue. A computer simulation based on the numerical model was executed for conductivity patterns including nominally normal ventricular muscle conductivities and a pattern having the intra- or extracellular conductivity ratio along x, the reciprocal of that along y. The computed results are based on assuming a simple spatial distribution for Vm, usually a circular isochrone, to isolate the effects on currents and potentials of variations in conductivities without confounding propagation differences. The results are in contrast to the many reports that explicity or implicitly assume isotropic conductivity or equal conductivity ratios along x and y. Specifically, with reciprocal conductivities, most current flows in large loops encompassing several millimeters, but only in the resting (<b>polarized)</b> <b>region</b> of the tissue; further, a given current flow path often includes four or more rather than two transmembrane excursions. The nominally normal results showed local currents predominantly with only two transmembrane passages; however, a substantial part of the current flow patterns in two-dimensional anisotropic bisyncytia may have qualitative as well as quantitative properties entirely different from those of one-dimensional strands...|$|E

Here we address the underlying cellular mechanisms. We show in the intact bud that connexin 43 (Cx 43) and Cx 32 gap junctions are at higher density between distal posterior mesenchyme cells {{at the tip of}} the bud than between either distal anterior or proximal mesenchyme cells. These gradients disappear when the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is removed. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF 4) produced by posterior AER cells controls signaling by polarizing cells. We find that FGF 4 doubles gap junction density and substantially improves functional coupling between cultured posterior mesenchyme cells. FGF 4 has no effect on cultured anterio...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{circular}} polarization structure of solar active regions has been made from data obtained at 9. 5 mm. All important active regions observed at 9. 5 mm are bipolar in nature, the degree of polarization {{is about the same}} for both right and left circular components, and it ranges up to about 4 %. These oppositely polarized components correspond with the Mt. Wilson magnetic regions of opposite polarity; the line of zero polarization delineates clearly the neutral line between the regions of opposite polarity on magnetograms. Unipolar regions in magnetograms also show up as unipolar regions at 9. 5 mm. Magnetic fields as low as 5 - 10 G on magnetograms manifest as distinctly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions</b> on 9. 5 mm maps...|$|R

In addition to the normal set of digits (234), extra digits form in a mirror-symmetrical arrangement, creating digit patterns such as a 432234. These retinoic acid-induced pattern duplications closely mimic those found after grafts of <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> cells to the same positions with regard to dose-response, timing, and positional effects. To elucidate the mechanism by which retinoic acid induces these pattern duplications, we have studied the temporal and spatial distribution of all-trans-retinoic acid and its potent analogue TTNPB in these limb buds. We find that the induction process is biphasic: there is an 8 -h lag phase followed by a 6 -h duplication phase, during which additional digits are irreversibly specified in the sequence digit 2, digit 3, digit 4. On average, formation of each digit seems to require between 1 and 2 h. The tissue concentrations, metabolic pattern, and spatial distribution of all- trans-retinoic acid and TTNPB in the limb rapidly reach a steady state, in which the continuous release of the retinoid is balanced by loss from metabolism and blood circulation. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that the half-time of clearance from the bud is 20 min for all-trans- retinoic acid and 80 min for TTNPB. Manipulations that change the experimentally induced steep concentration gradient of TTNPB suggest that a graded distribution of retinoid concentrations across the limb is required during the duplication phase to induce changes in the digit pattern. The extensive similarities between results obtained with retinoids and with <b>polarizing</b> <b>region</b> grafts raise the possibility that retinoic acid serves as a natural "morphogen" in the limb...|$|R

These defects are assumed to suppress locally the electric dipoles. It is found that with increasing defect concentration the dipole lattice configuration evolves from a normal ferroelectric state to a two-phase coexisted state, where highly <b>polarized</b> <b>regions</b> are embedded in a paraelectric matrix.

40|$|The {{developing}} limb {{is one of}} {{the first}} systems where it was proposed that a signalling gradient is involved in pattern formation. This gradient for specifying positional information across the antero-posterior axis is based on Sonic hedgehog signalling from the <b>polarizing</b> <b>region.</b> Recent evidence suggests that Sonic hedgehog signalling also specifies positional information across the antero-posterior axis by a timing mechanism acting in parallel with graded signalling. The progress zone model for specifying proximo-distal pattern, involving timing to provide cells with positional information, continues to be challenged, and there is further evidence that graded signalling by retinoic acid specifies the proximal part of the limb. Other recent papers present the first evidence that gradients of signalling by Wnt 5 a and FGFs govern cell behaviour involved in outgrowth and morphogenesis of the developing limb...|$|R
