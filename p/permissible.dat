5|$|In May 2015, Indian {{food safety}} {{regulators}} {{in the state}} of Uttar Pradesh found that samples of Maggi 2 Minute Noodles contained lead up to 17 times beyond <b>permissible</b> limits. On 3 June 2015, New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi noodles in New Delhi stores for 15 days because it was found to contain lead beyond the <b>permissible</b> limit. The Gujarat FDA on June 4, 2015 banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with objectionable levels of metallic lead, among other things. Some India's biggest retailers like Future Group, Big Bazaar, Easyday and Nilgiris have imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi noodles. Many other states too have banned Maggi noodles.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set the}} <b>permissible</b> {{exposure}} limit for elemental chlorine at 1 ppm, or 3mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has designated a recommended {{exposure limit}} of 0.5 ppm over 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The game is open stakes. This {{is unusual}} in modern times and almost never allowed in casinos, but <b>permissible</b> in home games and was common for the time period of the film.|$|E
5|$|The villanelle has no {{established}} meter, {{although most}} 19th-century villanelles have used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles have used pentameter. Slight alteration of the refrain line is <b>permissible.</b>|$|E

5|$|To decree that {{it shall}} be <b>permissible</b> to {{continue}} the Jewish services under the conditions of decency and decorum characteristic of a sacred custom that has been carried on for many centuries without infringement upon the religious rights of others.|$|E
5|$|After {{the date}} of the writ of {{election}} and at least two clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from <b>permissible</b> donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence. He must also submit to the Registrar a declaration stating, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report, and that only donations from <b>permissible</b> donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted. If this paperwork is in order, the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a {{personal}} service award, it is <b>permissible</b> and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and starboard bridge wings. Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.|$|E
5|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organize resistance units to attack the British and Jews. He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, which ruled that the struggle against the British and the Jews was <b>permissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has {{designated}} a <b>permissible</b> exposure limit (PEL) for copper dust and fumes {{in the workplace}} as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 100mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set {{the legal}} limit (<b>Permissible</b> {{exposure}} limit) for selenium in the workplace at 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1mg/m3, selenium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|The Torah, {{although}} disallowing {{the use of}} most insects as food, {{permits the}} consumption of certain locusts; specifically, the red, the yellow, the spotted grey, and the white are considered <b>permissible.</b> In Islamic jurisprudence, eating locusts is considered halal. The Prophet Muhammad {{was reported to have}} eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.|$|E
5|$|The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set the}} <b>permissible</b> {{exposure}} limit (PEL) for cadmium at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has not set a recommended {{exposure limit}} (REL) and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for cadmium is 9mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} the {{evidence}} against Thornton was not overwhelming, and that trial by battle was a <b>permissible</b> option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle. Ashford declined the offer of battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished by statute in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} trial by battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E
5|$|The king {{cannot be}} in check, nor can the king pass through squares {{that are under}} attack by enemy pieces, or move to a square where it {{would result in a}} check. Note that castling is <b>permissible</b> if the rook is attacked, or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} issues {{considered}} by the High Court were whether the Migration Act 1958 (the legislation governing immigration to Australia) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and if so, whether this was <b>permissible</b> under the Constitution of Australia. A majority of the court decided that the Act did allow indefinite detention, and that the Act was not unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a <b>permissible,</b> neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently <b>permissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is an {{essential}} element for life in minute amounts. The LD50 value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500mg/kg. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a <b>permissible</b> exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.05mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 20mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was <b>permissible</b> {{if there was}} mutual consent, while {{remarriage}} {{after the death of}} a spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E
5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal <b>permissible</b> exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{exposure}} in United States is {{regulated by the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit (<b>permissible</b> exposure limit) for manganese {{exposure in}} the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3mg/m3. At levels of 500mg/m3, manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum <b>permissible</b> molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum <b>permissible</b> amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to hafnium in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (<b>Permissible</b> exposure limit) for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50mg/m3, hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to iodine in the {{workplace}} by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (<b>Permissible</b> exposure limit) for iodine exposure in the workplace at 0.1 ppm (1mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 ppm (1mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. At levels of 2 ppm, iodine is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to rhodium in the {{workplace}} by inhalation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified the legal limit (<b>Permissible</b> exposure limit) for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL), at the same level. At levels of 100mg/m3, rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or health. For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to {{tantalum}} in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (<b>permissible</b> exposure limit) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 2500mg/m3, tantalum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations {{associated}} with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not <b>permissible</b> in the church. In contrast, the Christian Church may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Saudi law recognizes only {{corporate}} or partnership entities established under Sharia or the Saudi Company Law of 1982. A {{contract with}} {{any other type of}} company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company's name will be personally liable for it. Under Sharia, corporations can take a number of forms, but the most common in Saudi Arabia is Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight <b>permissible</b> forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Thallium and its {{compounds}} {{are extremely}} toxic, and should be handled with care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (<b>permissible</b> exposure limit) for thallium exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 15mg/m3, thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|The Corporation of Doncaster sought {{powers in}} 1727 {{to improve the}} river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. The Bill passed through {{parliament}} uneventfully, and again included detailed restrictions on what could {{and could not be}} done, designed to protect the landowners. The details were very specific in that they included the <b>permissible</b> heights of dams, the maximum length of cuts, and many other details of the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was <b>permissible.</b> The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those decisions are impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and is not required to comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are <b>permissible,</b> a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum <b>permissible</b> current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be <b>permissible</b> if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
