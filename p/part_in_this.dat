5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later the rebellion of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is presumed that Earl Harald played a <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this.</b> The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Bruyneel's {{announcement}} about leaving Astana during the Tour, Contador {{said that he would}} not consider his future until after the race was over.

5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the parkway is the section north of the Southern State Parkway. This portion carries an average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old Country Road serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the Southern State Parkway, the Meadowbrook Parkway sees only {{an average of about}} 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the Southern State Parkway, which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook Parkway, as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not taking}} <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{edition of the}} Giro, Tondó {{had participated in the}} 2010 edition and was a popular, well-liked rider.

Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was provisionally best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who won the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tondó, as the two were acquainted despite never having been teammates.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions.

They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E

Mario Vargas Llosa takes <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{saw that}} the Umayyads' left wing was holding steady, Ibn al-Ashtar changed tack and ordered his troops to attack the Umayyads' center, believing if he could {{disperse}} the core of the Umayyad army, the latter's right and left wings would likewise disperse. Ibn al-Ashtar himself took <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> assault and is said to have slew several Umayyad soldiers with his coterie of close companions. Amid the heavy clashes, numerous men on both sides were killed and the Umayyads were routed, Upon witnessing this, Umayr ibn al-Hubab communicated to Ibn al-Ashtar if he should defect to his camp; Ibn al-Ashtar told him to hold off because he feared his men would harm Umayr amid their anger.|$|E
5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries were {{a period}} of huge {{economic}} growth in England. The population of England rose from around 1.5million in 1086 to around 4or 5million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for {{the years of the}} Anarchy, most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, those who worked, in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or the clerics. Trade and merchants played little <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> model and were frequently vilified {{at the start of the}} period, although they were increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session was {{performed}} to find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was originally cast {{to play the role}} of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns. Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher. As a result, the role was recast and given to Barney Martin — who had no idea that another actor had already established the <b>part.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> episode Kramer greets Morty by name.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF {{would be a huge}} boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach {{at least as far as}} Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E

5|$|At St Peter's School, Crawford {{combined}} {{his teaching}} role with supervision of sports, including acting as {{coach for the}} cricket team. On several occasions, he had to request leave from the headmaster to play first-class cricket. After arriving in Australia in December 1909, he was playing district cricket for East Torrens within a week, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the Sheffield Shield competition; the team {{went on to win}} the trophy for the first time since 1893–94. Crawford played a large <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> success. There was some controversy over his eligibility to play; New South Wales initially protested, but there was a precedent for ignoring the requirement of a three-month qualification period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee accepted this in the case of Crawford, to the displeasure of the full NSWCA. Over four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 runs at an average of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green suggests that such a performance would have earned him Test selection if he had been Australian, and Wisden noted that his record in Australia was impressive.|$|E
5|$|By July the Allied armies {{were having}} {{difficulty}} advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In {{an attempt to}} create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions. The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near Caen, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No.460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No.466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No.460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July. All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of Operation Goodwood, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near Caumont ahead of Operation Bluecoat; 693 heavy bombers took <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the target area. All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support Operation Totalize, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the target area. The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of Operation Tractable; visibility was clear over most of the target area, and the raids were considered successful. By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Australians {{participated in}} the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945. Ten RAAF squadrons, {{hundreds}} of Australians in RAF units and about 500Australian sailors serving with the Royal Navy formed part of the force assembled for the landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944; overall, {{it has been estimated}} that about 3000 Australian personnel took <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation. From 11 June until September 1944 the Spitfire-equipped No.453Squadron RAAF was often based at forward airfields in France and it and Australian light bomber and heavy bomber squadrons supported the liberation of France. RAAF light bomber and fighter squadrons continued to support the Allied armies until the end of the war in Europe by attacking strategic targets and escorting bomber formations. No.451 and 453Squadrons formed part of the British Army of Occupation in Germany from September 1945, and it was planned that there would be a long-term Australian presence in this force. Few RAAF personnel volunteered to remain in Europe, however, and both squadrons were disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
