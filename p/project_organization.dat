Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated <b>project</b> <b>organization.</b> This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Project Management {{competency}} has been recognised {{as a critical}} source of competitive advantage and key to successful project delivery. For this reason {{it is important that}} the competency frameworks used to achieve competence in <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> are effective and fit for purpose. The European Construction Institute (ECI) developed eight principles through the ACTIVE (Achieving Competitiveness Through Innovation and Value Enhancement) initiative in an attempt to add value to the delivery of projects. This research explored the congruence and scope for incorporating the ACTIVE principles into current competency frameworks in use by <b>project</b> <b>organizations.</b> An interpretive and qualitative research approach was adopted, using semi-structured interviews with eight Project Managers and Learning and Development Managers in <b>project</b> <b>organizations.</b> The use of competency frameworks is not as widespread as first thought. Current competency frameworks in use in <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> are based on a fairly comprehensive body of knowledge and largely congruent with the ACTIVE principles centered around concept definition, team management, supply chain relationship management, communication, risk management, innovation, project execution and performance measurement. However, ACTIVE principles’ underpinning ethos of creating a collaborative working environment in projects is a missing piece worthy of incorporation into competency frameworks currently in use in <b>project</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Capturing {{and sharing}} {{experiences}} {{that may be}} applicable in several projects is generally recognized {{as a way of}} enhancing the performance of construction projects. Several studies have reported difficulties in applying learning approaches that could be applicable {{for a wide range of}} projects. The learning behaviour in three types of construction project: housing, service and infrastructure, is examined by the means of a questionnaire study including 51 construction projects and more than 800 responses from clients, designers, contractors' managers, contractors' workers and subcontractors. The effects of leadership, openness and influence are considered. Based on a factor analysis, three approaches to learning were identified: organizing for learning, experimenting and networking. While housing <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> do not demonstrate any specific preferences, service <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> show a focus on networking and infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> show the highest interest in experimenting. On the basis of these results it can be concluded that learning approaches are dependent on the type of project. Thus adopting different learning approaches for different types of construction project seems to be a more relevant strategy than implementing a 'one size fits all' learning approach for all construction <b>project</b> <b>organizations.</b> Organizational learning, questionnaire, leadership,...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedCorporate {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} {{and will continue to}} be the most important means of ensuring firm survival and prosperity. To cope with a dynamically competitive environment and overcome various limitations, firms form collaborative entrepreneurships. Evidence from the practice shows that short-term collaboration among firms has become valuable for corporate entrepreneurship projects. My dissertation is a study of short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> for corporate entrepreneurship. Specifically, I examined two important and interconnected issues concerning short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> — formation and acquisition of new capabilities.; Due to its complex nature, corporate entrepreneurship sits in the crosshairs of numerous theoretical lenses. I examined literature about corporate entrepreneurship, short-term organizations, and mobility. Using behavioral theory of the firm and organizational learning as guiding theoretical perspectives, I viewed corporate entrepreneurship as a series of problem-solving activities. Specifically, the nature of corporate entrepreneurship demanded non-local search activity beyond firm boundaries. With this understanding, I investigated the novelty of entrepreneurship projects and internal and external resource conditions as factors responsible for the formation of short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations.</b> Then, I examined whether corporate entrepreneurship could contribute to the acquisition of new capabilities. I theorized that the mobility of external experts in and out of corporate entrepreneurship projects, firms’ own experience in entrepreneurship, and previous experience in capability acquisition could predict firms’ chances of acquiring new capabilities. I systematically examined these claims by testing hypotheses with a sample of 645 Japanese TV animation programs produced by 83 unique animation studios and 288 directors between 2000 and 2008.; Results strongly supported theories of the formation of short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> by providing evidence that the Novelty of Project, External Resource Availability, and Internal Resource Constraints increased the likelihood of a corporate entrepreneurship project being carried out by short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations.</b> The results also provided supporting evidence that mobility of external experts and previous experience in capability acquisition enhanced firms’ chances to learn new capabilities.; My dissertation contributes to corporate entrepreneurship literature by examining the conditions that lead to the formation of short-term collaborative entrepreneurship activities. It contributes to organizational learning theory by providing evidence that short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations</b> offer learning experiences to participating firms and people. It speaks to the growing audience of mobility studies by showing that different types of mobility have different values in corporate entrepreneurship. It also provides valuable insights to managers who seek sustainable competitiveness through corporate entrepreneurship by emphasizing the value of short-term <b>project</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R
