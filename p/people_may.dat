40|$|The {{framework}} of transitional justice, originally devised to facilitate reconciliation in countries undergoing transitions from authoritarianism to democracy, is used {{with increasing frequency}} to respond to certain types of human rights violations against indigenous peoples. In some cases, transitional justice measures are employed in societies not undergoing regime transition. This paper outlines some of the potential complexities involved in processing indigenous demands for justice through a transitional justice framework. First, governments and indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>may</b> differ over the scope of injustices that transitional justice measures can address. Second, governments may try to use transitional justice {{to draw a line}} through history and legitimate present policy, whereas indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>may</b> try to use the past to critique present policy and conditions. Third, governments may try to use transitional justice to reassert their sovereignty and legal authority, whereas indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>may</b> try to resist this strategy, and even make competing claims to sovereignty and legal authority...|$|R

5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. <b>People</b> <b>may</b> be given levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping {{to confirm the}} PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases <b>people</b> <b>may</b> not realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E

5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing {{the length of}} hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some <b>people</b> <b>may</b> benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E

5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. <b>People</b> <b>may</b> remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape.

Several who made it off the ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|<b>People</b> <b>may</b> be {{released}} after assessment from hospital or emergency {{room to the}} care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as: change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears.|$|E

5|$|Potassium-argon dating {{has yielded}} ages of 16,000 {{years ago for}} the Salton Buttes, later {{superseded}} by an age estimate of 33,000 ± 35,000 years ago and finally with a date of 2,480 ± 470 years before present {{on the basis of}} uranium-thorium dating. Despite this age, some of them still release steam. Cerro Prieto appears to be 108,000 ± 46,000 years old based on potassium-argon dating, but legends of native Cucupah <b>people</b> <b>may</b> indicate Holocene activity.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population.
