40|$|INTRODUCTION: Expertise by experience' is {{a highly}} valued element of service {{delivery}} in recovery-oriented mental health care, but is unacknowledged within the mental health nursing literature. AIM: To explore the extent and influence of mental health professionals' <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental ill health on clinical practice. METHOD: Twenty seven mental health nurses with their own <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental ill health were interviewed about how their <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> informed their mental health nursing practice, {{as part of a}} sequential mixed methods study. RESULTS: The influence of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> in nursing work was threefold: first, through overt disclosure; second, through the 'use of the self as a tool'; third, through the formation of professional nursing identity. DISCUSSION: Mental health nurses' experience of mental illness was contextualised by other life experiences and by particular therapeutic relationships and clinical settings. In previous empirical studies nurses have cited <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental illness as a motivator and an aspect of their identity. In this study there was also an association between <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and enhanced nursing expertise. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: If drawing on <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> is commonplace, then we must address the taboo of disclosure and debate the extent to which personal and professional boundaries are negotiated during clinical encounters...|$|R

Something of {{a departure from the}} band's previous work, the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own <b>personal</b> <b>experiences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, Rashomon, that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that human cooperative behaviour towards other individuals is often conditioned on information about previous interactions. This information derives both from <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> (direct reciprocity) and from experience of others (i. e. reputation; indirect reciprocity). Direct and indirect reciprocity have been studied separately, but humans often have access to both types of information. Here, we experimentally investigate information use in a repeated helping game. When acting as donor, subjects can condition their decisions to help recipients with both types of information at a small cost to access such information. We find that information from direct interactions weighs more heavily in decisions to help, and participants tend to react less forgivingly to negative <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> than to negative reputation. Moreover, effects of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and reputation interact in decisions to help. If a recipient’s reputation is positive, the <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the donor has a weak effect on the decision to help, and vice versa. Yet if {{the two types of}} information indicate conflicting signatures of helpfulness, most decisions to help follow <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> To understand the roles of direct and indirect reciprocity in human cooperation, they should be studied in concert, not in isolation...|$|R
40|$|Researchers in {{the past}} have found that <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and formal {{training}} lead to better accuracy when predicting research outcomes in areas of psychology. <b>Personal</b> <b>experience</b> and formal training were compared in this study on the ability of students to predict research outcomes in social psychology. Students completed questionnaires that measured their social engagement (a proxy to <b>personal</b> <b>experience),</b> their academic history and status, and their knowledge of social psychological findings. Students with more psychology classes taken in college were better able to predict research outcomes (r =. 24). Psychology majors knew more findings in social psychology than nonpsychology majors (d =. 28). Students with higher academic status were better able to correctly identify research findings (η=. 31). Measures of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> (i. e., social engagement) did not predict accuracy in identifying correct research findings. Formal training was a better predictor of accuracy than <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> Students had the opportunity to change their misconceptions about the social world when they were taught research findings in the classroom. People might also learn about human social behavior vicariously or from small amounts of social interaction rather than from high amounts of social engagement...|$|R

5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan as a {{girl next}} door archetype and intended for the character to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> {{as well as those}} of single women in his life. The role was originally written for Mary-Louise Parker, who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of the character is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' debut season, both the character and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, the character was received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the series.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of illness and family history of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD), adjusted for gender, education and nationality, affects risk behaviour. Subjects were 2054 men and women of age 50 from two countries, Sweden (n= 1011) and Poland (n= 1043), who were recruited from screening program in primary health care. Family history, <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and risk behaviours (smoking habits, exercise habits, BMI-level) were self-reported. The results show that smoking behaviour is affected by <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of illness but not by family history of CVD. No effects of these variables were found on the remaining risk related variables that were tested in this study.  These results suggest that individuals with a <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of illness may be inclined to change smoking behaviour more than the average person. Smoking prevention strategies may thus benefit from targeting this group in particular. ...|$|R
