60|$|I {{soon had}} {{occasion}} {{to note that the}} patriarchal government of Thousandacres was of a somewhat decided and <b>prompt</b> <b>character.</b> A few words went a great way in it, as was now apparent; for in less than two minutes after Aaron had issued his decree, those namesakes of the prophets and law-givers of old, Nathaniel, and Moses, and Daniel, were quitting the clearing on diverging lines, each carrying a formidable, long, American hunting-rifle in his hand. This weapon, so different in the degree of its power from the short military piece that has become known to modern warfare, was certainly in dangerous hands; for each of those young men had been familiar with his rifle from boyhood; gunpowder and liquor, with a little lead, composing nearly all the articles on which they lavished money for their amusement. I trembled for Susquesus; though I knew he must anticipate a pursuit, and was so well skilled in throwing off a chase as to have obtained the name of the Trackless. Still, the odds were against him; and experience has shown that the white man usually surpasses the Indian even in his own peculiar practices, when there have been opportunities to be taught. I could do no more, however, than utter a mental prayer for the escape of my friend.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} of “The Golden Key” to the numinous {{in the development of}} what George MacDonald calls the “childlike child” or individual who finds meaning in stories that illuminates his or her relationship to God. The numinous reveals the presence of the divine, is made manifest in symbols found in the natural world, and evokes specific feelings of awe or dread. Such elements awaken our imagination to perceive God. The numinous acts as a catalyst for change by <b>prompting</b> <b>characters</b> and readers to respond to the presence of the divine. Various objects including the golden key, rainbow, shadows, and arguably stories are infused with numinous qualities to awaken the childlike imagination of the minds of his readers. The elements of myth and the numinous serve as two ingredients of the alchemical elixir that provides the opportunity for both protagonist and reader to experience transformation and purification...|$|R

40|$|The Drowned Girl is a novel-in-stories that {{depicts the}} lives of eight {{characters}} living in a small Connecticut town. This work is one told through varying perspectives. Characters are mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, daughters, sons, and lovers. Their lives intersect physically, and emotionally, and the separate stories reveal the facets and repercussions of events both past and present: {{the death of a}} son and brother in a car accident, {{the life and death of}} a notorious town figure, the past and tragic future of a young woman, Jules, whose body is found one spring in the Connecticut river. The Jules stories, six in all, document her spiral into despair, and involve the other characters as friends, lovers, and parents. As the locus of the cycle, Jules and the mystery of her death <b>prompt</b> <b>characters</b> to re-view their own circumstances, and the way in which past decisions have played a part. These revelations-of betrayal, and loss, and the way they affect key characters, are effectively inscribed in the story cycle 2 ̆ 7 s ability to convey a communal disparateness. Each character 2 ̆ 7 s story brings a new perspective, and the accumulation of the parts provides a more encompassing view of the whole. The focus on an upper middle class neighborhood called Ridgewood-a subdivision built on dairy farm land in the mid-sixties-is key to the thematic link that ties the stories together. I am interested in revealing the corruption of the natural landscape, the carving up of rural areas after World War II to create suburban communities in which family incomes and demographics are almost completely homogenous. The suburb of Ridgewood is mapped by roads designed to conform to a hierarchy that includes cul-de-sacs, and a pattern leading to residential areas of greater affluence. This setting serves as a backdrop to the complex disintegration of the family...|$|R

50|$|In 1939, Daigh put {{the project}} {{in the hands of}} Fawcett writer William Parker and Fawcett staff artist Charles Clarence Beck. The {{character}} they devised, Captain Marvel, was introduced in Whiz Comics #2 (February, 1940) and quickly caught on, moving into his own title, Captain Marvel Adventures, early in 1941. The success <b>prompted</b> spin-off <b>characters,</b> beginning with Captain Marvel, Jr. in 1941 and Mary Marvel in 1942. Fawcett's line of comics expanded with such colorful characters as Captain Midnight, Bulletman and Bulletgirl, Nyoka the Jungle Girl and Spy Smasher (who became Crime Smasher after World War II). The circulation of Captain Marvel Adventures continued to soar until it outsold Superman during the mid-1940s.
