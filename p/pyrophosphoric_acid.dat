25|$|Upon heating orthophosphoric acid, {{condensation}} of the phosphoric units can {{be induced}} by driving {{off the water}} formed from condensation. When one molecule of water has been removed for each two molecules of phosphoric acid, the result is <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (H4P2O7). When an average of one molecule of water per phosphoric unit has been driven off, the resulting substance is a glassy solid having an empirical formula of HPO3 and is called metaphosphoric acid. Metaphosphoric acid is a singly anhydrous version of orthophosphoic acid and is sometimes used as a water- or moisture-absorbing reagent. Further dehydrating is very difficult and can be accomplished only {{by means of an}} extremely strong desiccant (and not by heating alone). It produces phosphoric anhydride (phosphorus pentoxide), which has an empirical formula P2O5, although an actual molecule has a chemical formula of P4O10.

50|$|<b>Pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{also known}} {{under the name}} diphosphoric acid, is colorless, odorless, {{hygroscopic}} and is soluble in water, diethyl ether, and ethyl alcohol. The anhydrous acid has two different forms, which melt at 54.3 °C and 71.5 °C. It is best prepared by ion exchange from sodium pyrophosphate or by reacting hydrogen sulfide with lead pyrophosphate. When phosphoric acid is dehydrated <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> is produced {{as one of the}} products.

40|$|The {{formation}} of phosphomolybdic acid has widely been utilized in the separation and the de-termination of phosphate ions. However, the optimum conditions presented so far, have been de-termined empirically and contradict {{one to the}} others, {{because of the lack}} of knowledges on the species of the acid formed in solutions. In the present paper, the authors demonstrate that the solution always contains a series of species of phosphomolybdic acids in equilibrium; especially noticeable at around pH 3 are the one which absorbs light at 255 nm and is predominantly found when [P]/[Mo]> 1, and the other which absorbs light at 310 nm and becomes the major component when [P]/[Mo]< 1 / 15.

Further evaporation of water yields superphosphoric acid with a P2O5 concentration above 70% (corresponding to nearly 100% H3PO4; however, <b>pyrophosphoric</b> and polyphosphoric <b>acids</b> will start to form, making the liquid highly viscous).|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} kinds of phosphoric acids and phosphates. Of the many {{phosphorus}} oxoacids, the phosphoric acids constitute {{the largest and most}} diverse group. The simplest phosphoric acid series begins with monophosphoric (orthophosphoric) acid, continues with many oligophosphoric acids such as diphosphoric (<b>pyrophosphoric)</b> <b>acid</b> and concludes in the polyphosphoric acids. But, phosphoric acid units can bind together into rings or cyclic structures, chains (catenas), or branched structures, with various combinations possible. Each of these can form phosphates (salts or esters of phosphoric acids).|$|E

Its mechanism of action as a flame retardant is as follows: first, during thermal decomposition, phosphoric acid is formed. This reacts to form <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid,</b> which, when in its condensed phase, acts to block heat transfer. One of the most effective flame retardants for certain polymers, TPhP is only active as an additive flame retardant in its gas phase.

5000|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> is also {{shown in the}} illustration. Three orthophosphoric acid molecules can condense in a row to obtain tripolyphosphoric acid (H5P3O10), which is also shown in the illustration.

40|$|Anodic oxide {{fabricated}} by anodizing {{has been}} widely used for nanostructural engineering, but the nanomorphology is limited to only two oxides: anodic barrier and porous oxides. Therefore, the discovery of an additional anodic oxide with a unique nanofeature would expand the applicability of anodizing. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of a third-generation anodic oxide, specifically, anodic alumina nanofibers, by anodizing in a new electrolyte, <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b> Ultra-high density single nanometer-scale anodic alumina nanofibers (1010 nanofibers/cm(2)) consisting of an amorphous, pure aluminum oxide were successfully fabricated via <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing. The nanomorphologies of the anodic nanofibers can be controlled by the electrochemical conditions. Anodic tungsten oxide nanofibers can also be fabricated by <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eutectic AuSn 20 solder is an {{important}} material for electronic packaging technology due to its superior mechanical and thermal conductive properties.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{behavior of}} anodic alumina nanofibers via anodizing in a concentrated <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> {{under various conditions}} was investigated using electrochemical measurements and SEM/TEM observations. <b>Pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing at 293 K resulted {{in the formation of}} numerous anodic alumina nanofibers on an aluminum substrate through a thin barrier oxide and honeycomb oxide with narrow walls. However, long-term anodizing led to the chemical dissolution of the alumina nanofibers. The density of the anodic alumina nanofibers decreased as the applied voltage increased in the 10 – 75 V range. However, active electrochemical dissolution of the aluminum substrate occurred at a higher voltage of 90 V. Low temperature anodizing at 273 K resulted in the formation of long alumina nanofibers measuring several micrometers in length, even though a long processing time was required due to the low current density during the low temperature anodizing. In contrast, high temperature anodizing easily resulted in the formation and chemical dissolution of alumina nanofibers. The structural nanofeatures of the anodic alumina nanofibers were controlled by choosing of the appropriate electrochemical conditions, and numerous high-aspect-ratio alumina nanofibers (> 100) can be successfully fabricated. The anodic alumina nanofibers consisted of a pure amorphous aluminum oxide without anions from the employed electrolyte...|$|E

Hydrolysis of (HO) 3 SiOSi(OH) 3 (g) is found to be slightly endothermic, and only an asymmetric energy minimum is found for this silicic acid dimer. Four stable conformations are determined for the <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> system (HO) 2 OPOPO(OH) 2 (g). Depending on the choice of reference structure and basis set, the hydrolysis energetics ranges from 14 – 26 kJ/mol exothermic to 3 – 7 kJ/mol endothermic.

Significant differences in the water chemistry of the final monomeric products, Si(OH) 4 (g) and PO(OH) 3 (g), appear in the first solvation shell.

40|$|Phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole {{membranes}} are {{a promising}} candidate {{for use as}} electrolyte membrane in high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEFC). They present high thermal stability and excellent proton conductivity at low humidity [1]. Although polybenzimidazole membranes are routinely doped with phosphoric acid, few studies on {{the exact nature of}} the acid inside the membrane have been published. It is not known whether the phosphoric acid is present as ortho- or <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> at all operating conditions and how it interacts with the membrane at a high operating temperature of 160  °C. In this study, we investigated cross-linked poly(2, 5 -benzimidazole) (ABPBI) membranes obtained from FuMA-Tech GmbH which were doped in 85  % phosphoric acid. Conductivity measurements of the doped membrane under dry conditions show a maximum conductivity at 160 [*]°C. At higher temperatures, the conductivity decreases as the dehydration of the orthophosphoric acid to the less conductive <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> becomes relevant. Thermogravimetric analyses of pure phosphoric acid and doped membranes help to assess the amount of dehydrated phosphoric acid as well as the content of water and phosphoric acid inside the doped membrane. The thermal signals show two distinct weight losses between 30 [*]°C and 200 [*]°C, whose onset varies with the doping level of the membrane. An explanation for this effect, besides limited heat transfer, could be the bonds formed between the phosphoric acid molecules and the imidazole rings of the polymer. While free phosphoric acid molecules, found in pure phosphoric acid or in highly doped membranes, are free to condensate to <b>pyrophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> molecules as soon as the activation energy is reached, bonded molecules need more energy to first break the bond and then dehydrate. To further consolidate these results, the structure of the as-received and phosphoric acid doped membranes were analyzed and compared by means of Raman spectroscopy [2].
