40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores Kant’s {{theory of}} perceptual experience. A reconstruction of Kant’s conception of <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> is pursued through {{an examination of}} two interpretations given by Wilfrid Sellars and John McDowell. The two interpretations defended by Sellars and McDowell emphasize on the conceptual synthesis of the understanding in shaping the sensory consciousness. Also, the two interpretations seek to articulate a conception of external constraint in perceptual activity that is answerable to independent reality. The external constraint is necessary to explain the occurrence of perceptual experience. The manifold of sense is considered as an external constraint in <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Sellars takes sheer receptivity as providing this constraining element in perceptual experience, whereas McDowell argues that sensations as informed by the understanding can sufficiently provide this constraining content. After examining both interpretations, I will argue that Sellars and McDowell incorrectly take external constraint as appropriated by the concepts of the understanding. To defend this claim, I will reconstruct Kant’s conception of perceptual experience by demonstrating that Kant posits the manifold of sensations as independent of {{the operation of the}} understanding. The manifold of sensations constrains the conceptual content of experience through the synthesis of apprehension. In this synthesis, the manifold of sensations resists the figurative synthesis of imagination from being re-constituted through the extensive forms of space and time...|$|E
40|$|A {{real-time}} synthesis engine which {{models and}} predicts the timbre of acoustic instruments based on perceptual features extracted from an audio stream is presented. The thesis describes the modeling sequence including {{the analysis of}} natural sounds, the inference step that finds the mapping between control and output parameters, the timbre prediction step, and the sound synthesis. The system enables applications such as cross-synthesis, pitch shifting or compression of acoustic instruments, and timbre morphing between instrument families. It is fully implemented in the Max/MSP environment. The <b>Perceptual</b> <b>Synthesis</b> Engine was developed for the Hyperviolin as a novel, generic and perceptually meaningful synthesis technique for non-discretel...|$|E
40|$|Perception {{involves}} {{the processing of}} sensory stimuli and their translation into conscious experience. A novel percept can, once synthesized, be maintained or discarded from awareness. We used event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to separate the neural responses associated with the maintenance of a percept, produced by single-image, random-dot stereograms, from the response evoked {{at the onset of the}} percept. The latter was associated with distributed bilateral activation in the posterior thalamus and regions in the occipito-temporal, parietal and frontal cortices. In contrast, sustained perception was associated with activation of the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus. This observation suggests that sustaining a visual percept involves neuroanatomical systems which are implicated in memory function and which are distinct from those engaged during <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{time domain}} {{oriented}} technique using periodic func-tions composed of first order segments was {{employed in the}} development of a real-time interactive computer audio synthesis system. A general purpose analog computer was programmed to create non-monotonic function generators which are used to generate sequences of periodic functions that can be frequency and amplitude modulated. The system is appropriate for experiments in psychoacoustics. Explo-ration of the relationships between the physical and the <b>perceptual</b> significance of <b>synthesis</b> parameters of the tech-nique is aided by real-time frequency analysis programs and an audio output capability. The system includes an inter-active graphics terminal for conversational I/O and conven-tional peripheral devices for creating permanent records...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we explain how <b>perceptual</b> control of <b>synthesis</b> {{processes}} can be achieved through a multidisciplinary approach relating physical and signal properties of sound sources to evocations induced by sounds. This approach is applied to environmental and abstract sounds in 3 different experiments. In the first experiment a perceptual control of synthesized impact sounds evoking sound sources of different materials and shapes is presented. The second experiment describes an immersive environmental synthesizer simulating different kinds of environmental sounds evoking natural events such as rain, waves, wind and fire. In the last example motion evoked by abstract sounds is investigated. A tool for describing perceived motion through drawings is proposed in this case...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{parameter}} matching {{for multiple}} wavetable synthesis uses relative error {{to measure the}} quality of the matched spectrum to guide the search for a near-optimal solution. It is supposed that the smaller the relative error, the better is the match. This is generally, but not always true. This document describes a perceptual relative error, which takes into account the masking characteristics of our auditory system, as an improved measure of the perceived quality of the match. Selected instrument tones have been matched and resynthesized by both traditional and <b>perceptual</b> wavetable matching <b>synthesis,</b> and the listening test results show that perceptual wavetable matching outperforms traditional wavetable matching in general, especially for instrument tones with some masking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{contents}} of perception in Kant's first Critique and Husserl's later writings. Both Kant and Husserl {{are known for their}} appeal to synthesis in their transcendental accounts of perceptual experience and objective judgment. Especially regarding Kant, the precise nature of <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> has recently been the cause of much debate. Whereas some argue that for Kant perception must have nonconceptual content, others believe he is a conceptualist. After offering an alternative solution to this interpretative problem in Kant's philosophy, I turn to Husserl's later theory of perception. My main claims here are that Husserl departs from Kant specifically regarding (i) the sort of synthetic contents that govern affective perception and (ii) the role of conceptual capacities in the contents of attentive perception...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 4 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD), Palo Alto, California, November 2 - 5, 1997. This paper {{examines}} the two basic philosophies of spatial audio reproduction, {{with reference to}} their application to teleconferencing services. Sound Field Simulation, as exemplified by multiple loudspeakers techniques such as Ambisonics, encodes information about a remote or virtual sound field, and allows the reproduction of that field across a listening space. Alternatively, an application might employ <b>Perceptual</b> <b>Synthesis,</b> in which measured or simulated sound localisation cues (e. g. Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) data) are imposed on the signals reproduced over headphones or a suitably set-up pair of loudspeakers. The relative merits and drawbacks of each approach are {{discussed in terms of}} cost, implementation logistics, flexibility, specification and, critically, perceived performance...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{typically}} associated with higher-level cognitive symptoms, such as disorganized thoughts, delusions, and hallucinations. However, deficits in visual processing have been consistently reported with the illness. Here, we provide strong neurophysiological evidence for a marked perturbation at the earliest level of cortical visual processing in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and adapting a well-established approach from electrophysiology, we found that orientation-specific contextual modulation of cortical responses in human primary visual cortex (V 1) -a hallmark of early neural encoding of visual stimuli-is dramatically reduced in patients with schizophrenia. This indicates that contextual processing in schizophrenia is altered at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing and supports current theories that emphasize the role of abnormalities in <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> (eg, false inference) in schizophrenia. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} connectionist model that maps <b>perceptual</b> controllers to <b>synthesis</b> parameters {{to allow for}} an intuitive and powerful musical control of audio synthesis. This model, or system, allows the extraction, abstraction, reproduction and transformation of relevant features of a musician’s style. All the information is deduced exclusively from audio. No prior knowledge of the musician’s performance is implied. We will first define the general underlying principles of the model. After, the neural network specific requirements for the learning and synthesis of sound information will be presented. With this foundation, the many advantages of using a principal component based synthesis will be argued. This dissertation concludes with an overview of some musical applications, including the re-tuning of a melody, pitch shifting, time stretching, crosssynthesis and compression...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{unsupervised}} prominence {{prediction method}} for expressive speech synthesis. Prominence patterns are learned by {{statistical analysis of}} prosodic features extracted from speech data. The advantages of our unsupervised datadriven prominence prediction include: easy adaptation to new speakers, speech styles, and even languages without requiring expert knowledge or complicated linguistic rules. In this approach, first, prominence predictive prosodic features are extracted at the foot level. Next, the extracted prosodic features are clustered, each cluster representing a prominence level. Based on just-noticeable-differences of prosodic features, the optimal number of perceptually distinct prominence levels is determined. Finally, the proposed prominence prediction is applied to prosody prediction for unit selection speech <b>synthesis.</b> <b>Perceptual</b> evaluation results show a preference for a 4 -level unsupervised prominence prediction over a rule-based baseline in terms of naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.

40|$|The {{organisational}} factors, {{which are}} {{critical to the success}} of e-banking, are investigated. Different pieces of literature report different factors as key to success and generally based on subjective, <b>perceptual</b> data. A <b>synthesis</b> of existing literature is a basis for survey questions. The data was collected from UK based financial sector organisations who are offering their services on electronic channels, using postal questionnaires. The top factors found to be most critical for the success in e-banking are: quick responsive products/services, organisational flexibility, services expansion, systems integration and enhanced customer service. An important lesson from this research is that organisations need to view the e-banking initiative as a business critical area rather that just a technical issue. They need to give attention to internal integration, which may include channels, technology and business process integration, and improving the overall services to their customers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade the {{importance}} of synchronized dynamics in the brain has emerged from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Fast dynamic synchronous interactions of an oscillatory or nonoscillatory nature may constitute a form of temporal coding that underlies feature binding and <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The relationship between synchronization among neuronal populations and the population firing rates addresses two important issues: the distinction between rate coding and synchronization coding models of neuronal interactions {{and the degree to}} which empirical measurements of population activity, such as those employed by neuroimaging, are sensitive to changes in synchronization. We examined the relationship between mean population activity and synchronization using biologically plausible simulations. In this article, we focus on continuous stationary dynamics. (In a companion article, Chawla (forthcoming), we address the same issue using stimulus-evoked transients.) By manipulating parameters such as extrinsic input, intrinsic noise, synapti...|$|E
40|$|Consciousness {{is defined}} as {{cognizance}} about cosmic secrets in the causal level (sookshma thala jnanam). It is the insight on the invisible and inexplicable realms {{of the nature of}} nature. It is the intuitive perception, logical analysis, <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> and conviction on Truth within truth and beyond in its pure and primordial state which is hitherto imperceptible to normal human beings who stays in the mundane plane. In its subtle sense there is only single consciousness and all the states of consciousness with other prefixed appellations should have to be attained by inner transformation happening within the progressive layers of consciousness. Awakening consciousness is really the enlightenment on the consciousnesses in progression. Soul is the seat of consciousness. This supranano cosmic biochip is the boundless mine of knowledge, intelligence, awareness, memory, understanding, wisdom, love, intuition and prescience that is confined with elemental limitations.

40|$|Illustrators embody their experiences. The {{personification}} of {{experience is a}} fundamental device in the way illustrative imagery and visual communication perpetuates ideologies, metaphors, mythologies, {{and in particular the}} anthropomorphisation of the human condition. Illustrators translate experiences, and the <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> (Merleau-Ponty 2013) of those experiences into the illustration and design of fictitious narratives, worlds, characters, and environments. Drawing becomes a crucial part of articulating the world and capturing perception of experience and reality. Audiences can relate to the experiences of designed characters through observed similarities with their own experience. If we take the understanding that individuals tacitly negotiate the world, and their interactions with other people, through interpretation of aesthetics, physiology, psychology, socio-economic class and culture- then the design of characters that exhibit a range of these factors can help define a reflexive relationship between the illustrator, the character, and the audience. This paper will examine the implicit role an illustrator's habitus (Bourdieu 1977) has in the development of their characters, and provide conceptual tools that outline this unique relationship. Habitus is a unifying concept that generates tastes and dispositions based on an individual's physiology, psychology and sociology...|$|E
40|$|Self-supervised {{models of}} how the brain {{represents}} and categorises the causes of its sensory input {{can be divided into}} two classes: those that minimise the mutual information (i. e. redundancy) among evoked responses and those that minimise the prediction error. Although these models have similar goals, the way they are attained, and the functional architectures employed, can be fundamentally different. This review describes the two classes of models and their implications for the functional anatomy of sensory cortical hierarchies in the brain. We then consider how empirical evidence can be used to disambiguate between architectures that are sufficient for <b>perceptual</b> learning and <b>synthesis.</b> Most models of representational learning require prior assumptions about the distribution of sensory causes. Using the notion of empirical Bayes, we show that these assumptions are not necessary and that priors can be learned in a hierarchical context. Furthermore, we try to show that learning can be implemented in a biologically plausible way. The main point made in this review is that backward connections, mediating internal or generative models of how sensory inputs are caused, are essential if the process generating inputs cannot be inverted. Because these processes are dynamical in nature, sensory inputs correspond to a non-invertible nonlinear convolution of causes. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i. e. backward connections) to enable approximate recognition and suggests that feedforward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient. Moreover, nonlinearities in generative models, that induce a dependence on backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory; so that estimated causes in higher cortical levels can interact t...|$|R
40|$|The {{voice source}} {{contains}} important lexical and non-lexical information. The non-lexical information can convey, for example, prosodic events, emotional status, {{as well as}} cues pertaining to {{the uniqueness of the}} speaker's voice. A better understanding, and eventually a better model of the voice source, would benefit various speech applications, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker identification, age/gender classification, as well as clinical assessments. This dissertation has three main goals. The first is to better understand the voice source through analyzing images of the vocal folds using laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) recordings. A new automatic method is proposed to compactly summarize the overall spatial synchronization pattern of vocal fold vibration for the entire laryngeal area from HSV data. Additionally, a new measure is proposed to adequately capture perceptually-important variations in glottal area pulse shapes, which are extracted from HSV data. The second goal is to study the acoustic consequence of a physiological vocal-fold vibration pattern [...] -the glottal gap effect, and apply our findings to a gender classification task of children's voices. Voice source related measures are found to improve classification accuracy, especially for younger (10 - 15 year old) speakers. The third goal is to propose new voice source models and evaluate them in different applications. In the first application, a new source model and a noise-robust automatic source estimation algorithm are proposed to estimate the voice source from speech signals. Results in both clean and noisy conditions show that the proposed model and algorithm are robust in accurately estimating the voice source signal. The second application is to use the proposed source model for vowel <b>synthesis.</b> <b>Perceptual</b> listening experiments show that the proposed model provides a better perceptual match to the target voice than do traditional models...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenic {{disorders}} {{are thought to}} involve widespread abnormalities in information processing. The present study used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and a simple and robust paradigm that involved auditory and visual activation to examine basic sensory input circuits. Our aim was to determine which stages of the input processing network are disturbed in first-episode schizophrenic patients. METHODS: Twelve neuroleptic-naive inpatients (paranoid subtype) were compared with 11 healthy subjects by means of echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a block design, the paradigm included the simultaneous presentation of a moving 6 -Hz checkerboard and auditory stimuli in the form of drumbeats. The subjects were asked to simply look and listen. RESULTS: In comparison with control subjects, patients showed reduced activation in the right thalamus, the right prefrontal cortex, and the parietal lobe (restricted to the dorsal visual pathway) bilaterally. There were no notable differences in the primary visual cortex or the object-specific occipitotemporal pathway. In addition, patients presented with a reduced signal change to auditory stimulation in the left acoustic cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the concept of widespread cortical and subcortical deficits in schizophrenia. Our findings suggest abnormal functioning early in the information processing and in high-order association cortices already at illness onset, before the administration of medication or the most confounding effects of illness duration. The main regions have been implicated in visual motion perception and discrimination as well as in attention to sensorial events and <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} psychotic {{symptoms in}} terms of false inferences or beliefs. It {{is based on the}} notion that the brain is an inference machine that actively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspective provides a normative (Bayes optimal) account of action and perception that emphasises probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We will consider hallucinosis, abnormal eye movements, sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision. From a cognitive perspective, this represents a pernicious failure of metacognition (beliefs about beliefs) that can confound perceptual inference. In the embodied setting of active (Bayesian) inference, it can lead to behaviours that are paradoxically more accurate than Bayes optimal behaviour. Crucially, this normative account is accompanied by a neuronally plausible process theory based upon hierarchical predictive coding. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the postsynaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling postsynaptic gain – such as NMDA receptor function and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using biologically plausible simulations of <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis,</b> smooth pursuit eye movements and attribution of agency – that all use the same predictive coding scheme and pathology: namely, a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an active inference scheme for visual searches and the <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> entailed by scene construction. Active inference assumes that perception and action minimize variational free energy, where actions are selected {{to minimize the}} free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalizes risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty {{about the causes of}} ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorizing a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes. In future work, we hope to use this scheme to model empirical saccadic searches and identify the prior beliefs that underwrite intersubject variability in the way people forage for information in visual scenes (e. g., in schizophrenia).

40|$|In the {{burdened}} {{scenes of}} everyday life, our brains must select from among many competing inputs for <b>perceptual</b> <b>synthesis</b> - {{so that only}} the most relevant receive full attention and irrelevant (distracting) information is suppressed. At the same time, we must remain responsive to salient events outside our current focus of attention - and balancing these two processing modes is a fundamental task our brain constantly needs to solve. Both the physical saliency of a stimulus, as well as top-down predictions about imminent sensations crucially influence attentional selection and consequently the response to unexpected events. Research over recent decades has identified two separate brain networks involved in predictive top-down control and reorientation to unattended events (or oddball stimuli) : the dorsal and ventral fronto-parietal attention systems of the human brain. Moreover, specific electrophysiological brain responses are known to characterize attentional orienting {{as well as the}} processing of deviant stimuli. However, many key questions are outstanding. What are the exact functional differences between these cortical attention systems? How are they lateralised in the two hemispheres? How do top-down and bottom-up signals interact to enable flexible attentional control? How does structural damage to one system affect the functionality of the other in brain damaged patients? Are there sensory-specific and supra-modal attentional systems in the brain? In addition to these questions, it is now accepted that brain responses are not only affected by the saliency of external stimuli, but also by our expectations about sensory inputs. How these two influences are balanced, and how predictions are formed in cortical networks, or generated on the basis of experience-dependent learning, are intriguing issues. In this Research Topic, we aim to collect innovative contributions that shed further light on the (cortical) mechanisms of attentional control in the human brain. In particular, we would like to encourage submissions that investigate the behavioural correlates, functional anatomy or electrophysiological markers of attentional selection and reorientation. Special emphasis will be given to studies investigating the context-sensitivity of these attentional processes in relation to prior expectations, trial history, contextual cues or physical saliency. We would like to encourage submissions employing different research methods (psychophysical recordings, neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, MEG, EEG or ECoG, as well as neurostimulation methods such as TMS or tDCS) in healthy volunteers or neurological patients. Computational models and animal studies are also welcome. Finally, we also welcome submission of meta-analyses and reviews articles that provide new insights into, or conclusions about recent work in the field...|$|E
