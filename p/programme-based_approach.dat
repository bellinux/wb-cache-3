40|$|The EEA Grants in {{the current}} period have been {{allocated}} to programmes defined at national level, instead of to individual projects. These programmes have been implemented according to the Regulation and after a process of negotiation between the donors and the European Commission and then between the donors and the beneficiary countries. This negotiation has concerned, first, the Memorandum of Understanding and, second, the specific Programme Agreements. The process of negotiation and of preparing open calls for proposals has taken significantly longer than expected. This has led to severe delays in the allocation of funds and significantly reduced the time available to implement projects. However, there is broad support for the <b>programme-based</b> <b>approach,</b> as it could further improve the strategic focus and simplify the management arrangements. Given the time and effort that has been expended in setting up the <b>programme-based</b> <b>approach,</b> consideration should be given as to whether this approach should be retained for the next period. Stakeholders from the donor and beneficiary countries should consider whether negotiations can be concluded much more easily the second time round and whether programme management capacity can be retained. Where this is the case, the <b>programme-based</b> <b>approach</b> should be continued. There would be potential benefits from extending the end-date for completing expenditure and/or extending the programme period from 5 to 7 years. Monitoring indicators are appropriate, although many outcomes do not easily lend themselves to measurement and quantification. Qualitative reporting therefore remains important alongside monitoring of quantitative outputs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose/objectives: The aim of {{this article}} is to look at the experiences, {{problems}} and the potential contribution of employment creation programmes in alleviating the unemployment problem in other African countries through the construction of public infrastructure through the use of labour-intensive methods. The article then describes the problems and experiences that have been encountered in South Africa in relation to employment creation through the construction of public infrastructure. Problem investigated: In South Africa the levels of unemployment and poverty are extremely high and unemployment is one of South Africa's most pressing problems. At the same time there is a lack of capacity and skills at institutional, community and individual levels. Labour-intensive programmes generate more direct and indirect local employment opportunities and income by using locally available inputs (materials, simple tools and local labour) and thus creating a greater demand for local products and services than do high-technology programmes reliant on imported technology and equipment. Design/Methodology/Approach: Drawing on research on labour-intensive, public works programmes and projects, the paper is mainly a literature review. From a theoretical perspective supported by experience elsewhere in Africa, there are reasons for considering that properly formulated employment creation programmes based on the use of labour-intensive methods could be established to construct and maintain the required physical infrastructure, thus creating employment, skills and institutional capacities. The article closes with some recommendations for the future programmes success. Findings/Implications: The article attributes the failure of projects and programmes in South Africa to different factors which must be avoided in future in order for projects and programmes to be successful in South Africa. Investment in infrastructure has a huge potential to redress the high unemployment and poverty levels in South Africa and also to correct the skill shortages. Originality/Value: This article challenges the project-based approach and recommends a <b>programme-based</b> <b>approach</b> which is long-term as to address the problem of unemployment and skills shortages in South Africa. Conclusion: Public works programmes and projects in South Africa should change as the policy environment changes, from relief, emergency to a long-term structured employment-generation programme. The approach should link economic growth, employment and investment policies. </p...|$|E
50|$|SWAp's are {{represented}} in {{the basic principles of}} <b>programme-based</b> <b>approaches</b> (PBAs), which must form 66% of aid from signatories to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. While research in sectors, such as in agriculture, demonstrate improvements in process and dialogue there is a debate over whether these results are substantial enough to justify the investment. This concern has created a fatigue amongst certain policymakers. SWAp principles are also threatened by shifts in the source of international aid, with the growing importance of Brazil, China and NGOs such as the Gates Foundation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and seeks}} to quantify the effects of improved donor coordination on aid effectiveness. Empirical estimates are first provided of the reductions in transaction costs {{that can be achieved}} by better donor coordination via concentration to fewer partner countries and a shift from project aid to <b>programme-based</b> <b>approaches.</b> Further estimates are presented showing how much could be gained in terms of poverty reduction by optimizing aid allocation across countries. The potential gains of a coordinated reallocation would be huge, but there are severe political implementation constraints. Still, the overall conclusion of the paper is that there are huge potential gains from donor coordination...|$|R
