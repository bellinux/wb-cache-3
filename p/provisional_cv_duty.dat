These include AD duties imposed on products exported to the United States at unfairly low prices (i. e., dumped) and <b>CV</b> <b>duties</b> on products exported to the United States that were subsidized by foreign governments. These uncollected duties show that the U. S. government has not fully remedied the unfair trade practices for U. S. industry and has lost out on a substantial amount of duty revenue to the U. S. Treasury. This statement summarizes key findings from prior GAO reports on (1) past initiatives to improve AD/CV duty collection and (2) additional options for improving AD/CV duty collection. ...|$|R

The policy potentially significantly increases the amount of the bonds for affected importers. Following the application of the policy to imports of shrimp as a "test case," U.

GAO examined why and how CBP revised its CB policy, how CBP implemented the revised policy, and the effects of the revised policy. ...|$|R
40|$|We study U. S. {{agricultural}} antidumping (AD) and {{countervailing duty}} (CVD) cases from 1980 to 2005, and gauge {{the effectiveness of}} trade remedy law {{as a form of}} protection. The purpose is to measure the investigation and trade diversion effects resulting from AD and CVD cases initiated by U. S. agricultural producers against imports from named countries. Unlike previous papers, we construct more precise data, so a case initiated in June has an “investigation year ” that runs from June-May, instead of the typical calendar year. Previous research on trade in manufactured products has shown that the domestic protection offered by AD and <b>CV</b> <b>duties</b> is largely offset by trade diversion. In contrast, we find that for agriculture, trade diversion is relatively unimportant. So AD and CVD cases are very effective forms of protection for U. S. agriculture...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) {{has been unable to}} collect {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in antidumping (AD) and countervailing (<b>CV)</b> <b>duties.</b> The Department of Commerce imposes these duties to remedy injurious unfair foreign trade practices (unfairly low prices or subsidies). The noncollection of AD/CV duties means that the U. S. government has not fully remedied the unfair trade practices and bears a substantial loss of revenue. GAO was asked to examine the (1) nature and extent of uncollected AD/CV duties, (2) factors contributing to uncollected AD/CV duties and steps taken to address these factors, and (3) options for aiding duty collections. To analyze these issues, GAO reviewed CBP data for fiscal years 2001 through 2007, agency documents and reports, and interviewed government officials and private sector representatives...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Some {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SME) [...] which are defined by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy as independent businesses with fewer than 500 employees [...] have petitioned for the imposition of antidumping (AD) and countervailing (<b>CV)</b> <b>duties</b> to seek relief from unfair trade practices. Among the 56 petitions filed between 2007 and 2012, GAO found 21 that included at least 1 SME petitioner. In addition, the 56 petitions represented a total of 147 petitioners, of which 38 were SMEs. The majority of these SME petitioners had annual sales revenue of at least $ 10 million. Close to half of the total SME petitioners were in the iron and steel industry. Since participation in the petitions is not mandatory, producers, including SMEs, may benefit from a successful petition even if they choose not to join as a petitioner. ...|$|R
40|$|Contingent {{protection}} measures were {{originally intended to}} protect domestic producers from what {{were considered to be}} “unfairly” cheap imports. However, due {{to the way in which}} these policies are designed and implemented, they have been heavily criticised for their greatly disruptive effects on markets, and particularly on competition. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to the debate by studying the impact of US Antidumping (AD) and Countervailing (<b>CV)</b> <b>duties</b> on domestic producers’ price-cost margins (PCM). To this end, the study takes advantage of a long panel of 4 -digit industries in the US covering 26 years of AD/CV activity, including the periods before and after the changes to AD/CV laws introduced following the Uruguay Round (UR). It finds evidence of a positive effect of AD/CV duties on PCM for the period prior to the UR, but the effect seems to disappear in the years following the UR. The analysis accounts for potential endogeneity in AD/CV duties, as well as the intensity of the protection granted...|$|R
40|$|In {{this third}} {{of a series of}} papers related to cataclysmic {{variables}} (CVs) and related objects, we analyse the population of CVs in a set of 12 globular cluster models evolved with the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, for two initial binary populations (IBPs), two choices of common-envelope phase (CEP) parameters, and three different models for the evolution of CVs and the treatment of angular momentum loss. When more realistic models and parameters are considered, we find that present-day cluster <b>CV</b> <b>duty</b> cycles are extremely-low (≲ 0. 1 per cent) which makes their detection during outbursts rather difficult. Additionally, the IBP plays a significant role in shaping the CV population properties, and models that follow the Kroupa IBP are less affected by enhanced angular momentum loss. We also predict from our simulations that CVs formed dynamically in the past few Gyr (massive CVs) correspond to bright CVs (as expected), and that faint CVs formed several Gyr ago (dynamically or not) represent the overwhelming majority. Regarding the CV formation rate, we rule out the notion that it is similar irrespective of the cluster properties. Finally, we discuss the differences in the present-day CV properties related to the IBPs, the initial cluster conditions, the CEP parameters, formation channels, the CV evolution models, and the angular momentum loss treatments.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States {{and many of its}} trading partners have enacted laws to remedy the unfair trade practices of other countries and foreign companies that cause injury to domestic industries. U. S. law authorizes the imposition of additional duties on importers to remedy these unfair trade practices. Specifically, antidumping (AD) duties are imposed on imports that are "dumped" in the United States (i. e., sales in the U. S. market at less than the market price in the item's home market) and countervailing (<b>CV)</b> <b>duties</b> are imposed on imports that are subsidized by foreign governments. Importers are responsible for paying all duties, taxes, and fees on products when they are brought into the United States (including AD/CV duties). Importers can be located either domestically or overseas. Since fiscal year 2001, U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is responsible for collecting import duties, has been unable to collect {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in AD/CV duties. In March 2008, we reported that over $ 600 million in AD/CV duties were uncollected. Our analysis revealed four key factors contributing to uncollected AD/CV duties: (1) the retrospective component of the U. S. AD/CV duty system, (2) "new shipper" reviews, (3) insufficiency of CBP's standard bond requirements for importers, and (4) minimal information required from importers. We identified two sets of options for Congress and agencies to consider in attempting to improve the collection of AD/CV duties. One option was to eliminate the retrospective component of the U. S. AD/CV duty system and make it prospective; the other was to adjust specific aspects of the current U. S. AD/CV duty system while retaining its retrospective nature. Under the current U. S. AD/CV duty system, importers pay cash deposits equal to the estimated AD/CV duties at the time of importation, but the final duty amount is determined much later and may exceed the amount of cash deposited. On average, this process takes more than 3 years, during which importers could cease operations or become unable to pay additional duties. To address this situation and help improve the collection of AD/CV duties, we suggested several improvements to Congress and executive branch agencies. As a result, this report describes agencies' views on (1) obstacles (if any) to strengthening international agreements to help the United States collect AD/CV duties from importers without attachable assets in the United States and (2) whether strengthened international agreements would improve duty collection. ...|$|R
40|$|This article proposes several {{amendments}} to the Anti-Dumping (AD) Agreement and the chapter on Countervailing Duties (CVD) of the Subsidies Agreement, drawing {{from the experience of}} the State of Israel in AD and CVD administration over more than a decade. In particular, the Article argues for the need for international regulation of the institutional settings of such administration within Member States. To this end, provisions should be added to the relevant WTO agreements that relate to the nature and composition of the national administering authorities, with the guiding principle being to ensure independence of the authorities and objectivity, fairness and transparency of their investigations and determinations. International Law must try to guarantee that these authorities are immune to political pressures from interested parties. We suggest that the authority in these matters be transferred to independent, quasi-judicial bodies, as opposed to administrative agencies that are part of government ministries or controlled by them or by political organs. We argue, based on reason, as well as on evidence from several countries, that such bodies are more likely to produce balanced decisions, taking into account interests of both domestic industry and consumers, and also show that there are precedents within existing WTO law of such institutional regulation. We then proceeded to discuss amendments of the substantive law, particularly in relation to the definition of dumping. Here we propose granting clear priority to the establishment of normal value on the basis of actual sales by the foreign producer in his home market, and to restrict the use of the other options offered by the AD Agreement. To this end, we suggest, inter alia, to abolish or restrict the use of the methodology that allows sales made at prices below per unit (fixed and variable) costs of production to be treated as not being “in the ordinary course of trade” by reason of price and therefore disregarded in determining normal value. With respect to the assessment of AD and <b>CV</b> <b>duties,</b> we recommend to require compliance with the “Lesser Duty Rule”. We present statistical data from Israel, which shows the significant influence that the application of this Rule has had on the rate of AD duties in Israel. We further recommended the adoption of the Israeli methodology on how to apply the Rule, namely to generally base the calculation upon the price undercutting rate, and not on a target price. In {{view of the fact that}} anti-dumping and anti-subsidy procedures and measures are on the rise, and that more and more countries adopt such procedures based on the WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies Agreements, it is exceedingly important that these agreements are amended so as to minimize the damage to international trade caused by their use, while at the same time preserving them as a safeguard measure that will allow continued multilateral trade liberalization. This article suggests some ways in which this could be achieved...|$|R
