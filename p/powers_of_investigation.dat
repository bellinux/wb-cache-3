25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, state {{attorneys}} general have pursued consumer rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E

The chairmanship of the governmental probe was originally offered to former minister of education, Amnon Rubinstein, but he refused. Israeli Defense MinisterAmir Peretz]] has already appointed a military inspection probe headed by Shahak, but it ceased operating after a day due to public criticisms. It appears it will be revived in its hitherto composition. The third probe to examine the Home Front {{was expected to be}} announced soon thereafter. What was decisive about Olmert's decision was that the commissions were to have limited <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> censure, and that the political, military and civilian realms were to become split. Critics argued that these inspection probes amounted to a whitewash, due to their limited authority, limited investigatory scope, their self-appointed basis, and that neither will be headed by a retired judge. On August 30, about one hundred Movement for Quality Government members protested {{in front of the house}} of the law Professor Yaakov Dror, a member of the governmental inspection probe, calling on him to refuse to participate. Dror told the protesters that he [...] "respects [...] opinion, but they should respect [...] ", and said that he is in favour of Olmert's plan.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{striking}} example {{of the difficulty of}} getting people to use their own <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> accurately, that this form of the doctrine of evolution should have held its ground so long; for it was thoroughly and completely exploded, not long after its enunciation, by Casper Friederich Wolff, who in his [...] "Theoria Generationis," [...] published in 1759, placed the opposite theory of epigenesis upon the secure foundation of fact, from which it has never been displaced.

40|$|Abstract The main aim of {{this article}} is the mutual {{implication}} in the administrative process between the principle of the two levels of jurisdiction and the principio della domanda (the principle of the right to bring proceedings) and the principio dispositivo (the principle of the parties delimiting the scope of the case). The principio della domanda performs in the fi rst instance all its legal signifi cance, giving the parties the absolute rule on the issues that the Court should defi ne. The principio dispositivo, on the contrary, presents it self in the administrative procedure in that particular form defi ned “principio dispositivo with an acquisitive method. ” The principle of two levels of jurisdiction and, in particular, the interpretation the Code of Administrative Procedure provides through the discipline of the appeal affect principio della domanda and principio dispositivo. On appeal, the parties do not have the power to bring new evidence or to produce new documents in respect to the fi rst instance. Hence, it can be asserted that the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the parties is compressed compared to that exercised in the fi rst instance, while the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> the Court of its own motion, does not know a similar limitation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Most {{occupational}} diseases {{do not fit}} {{the paradigm}} of medical interpretation of the health-disease process based on linear causality, in which {{it would be possible}} to find a single cause for each type of disease. Objectives: to conduct a systematic review in order to investigate the association between whole-body vibration (WBV) and musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) in professional truck drivers (PTD). Methods: The scientific databases of PubMed, Cochrane, Lilacs and Scielo were used to collect articles published from 2000 until the present time. Two independent reviewers adopted inclusion and quality criteria to evaluate the selected articles. Results: From adopted inclusion and quality criteria, nine articles were chosen to identify the association between MSD and WBV in PTD. The results showed that MSD seems to be closely associated to exposure to WBV in these workers, mainly due to high prevalence and symptoms of low back pain. Two cohort studies showed exposure to WBV as risk for MSD. Only one, with case-control design, did not show WBV as a significant factor. Conclusions: In this study the importance of exposure analysis of WBV in the occurrence of MSD in PTD was elucidated. This study showed the importance of WBV exposure analysis on the occurrence of MSD in PTD. There is adequate information to provide rationale for the reduction of WBV exposure to the lowest possible level, to ensure the health of these workers. Studies with a greater <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> <b>of</b> a prospective, design, should be encouraged, supplanting those only of association...|$|R
