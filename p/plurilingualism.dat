50|$|<b>Plurilingualism</b> is a {{situation}} wherein {{a person who has}} competence in more than one language can switch between languages - from one language to another and vice versa - according to the circumstances at hand for the purpose of coping with a social matter. There is a distinction between <b>plurilingualism</b> and multilingualism. Multilingualism, on the other hand, is connected to situations wherein multiple languages exist side-by-side in a society but are utilized separately. <b>Plurilingualism</b> is derived from bilingualism. A consequence of <b>plurilingualism</b> is pluricultural competence. In general, persons who are identified as plurilinguals had contact with foreign languages through educational institutions, however the education system plays only a small role in the linguistic competence of these individuals.|$|E

5000|$|Barbara Seidlhofer {{argues that}} {{language}} acquisition programs {{should not be}} teaching language {{with the intention of}} achieving native-speaker competence, but that they should be [...] "embracing the emergent realistic goal of intercultural competence achieved through a <b>plurilingualism</b> that integrates rather than ostracizes” International Englishes. [...] This pedagogical strategy necessitates translanguaging as a means through which to accomplish such <b>plurilingualism.</b> For Seidlhofer, the incorporation of such International Englishes into educational systems would be more beneficial for second language learners than current dominant language acquisition pedagogies, which emphasize standard American and British varieties of English. Since achieving native-speaker status is nearly impossible without years of study, translanguaging presents students with opportunities to learn language in a more supportive space, fostering their language acquisition in all varieties rather than enforcing the participation in and acquisition of a single dominant variety.|$|E

5000|$|Pluriculturalism is an {{approach}} to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react {{from the perspective of}} multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures. As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity. [...] It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification. [...] The term pluricultural competence is a consequence of the idea of <b>plurilingualism.</b> [...] There is a distinction between pluriculturalism and multiculturalism.|$|E

This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.|$|E
40|$|In {{this volume}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between <b>plurilingualism</b> and verbal communication, in order to outline the different aspects of language contact and plurilingual competence at social, personal and educational level, referring to the major studies on this topic. After considering the spread of <b>plurilingualism</b> in the world, as a value and a resource for society and the person, we present the different types of <b>plurilingualism,</b> and then we concentrate on individual <b>plurilingualism</b> and on the concept of plurilingual competence. We then analyse the ways in which a person is influenced by <b>plurilingualism,</b> in relation to cognitive and psycholinguistic, sociolinguistic and neurolinguistic aspects. The relationship between <b>plurilingualism</b> and verbal communication is situated at the intersection between individual <b>plurilingualism</b> and social plurilingualism; so we focus our attention on the different manifestations of language contact in discourse, which are traceable both in the variability of the speaker’s language choice, and in formal phenomena of speech that are the result of the influence of one language on another one (interference, borrowing, code-switching, etc.). As part of an interactional approach to language acquisition we outline the development of plurilingual communicative competence, considering both the situation of the simultaneous acquisition of two languages in childhood and the situation in which a L 1 is subsequently joined by other languages, in a natural or guided learning context. Particular attention is paid to the role of L 1 in the acquisition of L 2, in order to highlight the contribution that the perspective of <b>plurilingualism</b> can offer to the perspective of the acquisition in educational contexts. Finally, we discuss the objectives of a language and educational policy aiming at promoting <b>plurilingualism,</b> with particular attention to the European context and to the concrete actions in the field of language teaching and learning, such as the spread of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) methodology...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the correlation between}} students’ beliefs towards <b>plurilingualism</b> with their English academic achievement and language learning styles both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

To collect the data, the researcher distributed questionnaire and conducted interview. From the regression calculation, it was revealed that students’ beliefs towards <b>plurilingualism</b> correlated with their English academic achievement and language learning styles. Furthermore, from the interview, students’ views towards people who have the ability in many languages and their self-confidence from the aspects of belief towards <b>plurilingualism</b> held an important role for students’ English academic achievement.

40|$|Post-industrial {{societies}} {{are characterized by}} {{a high degree of}} mobility which manifests itself through waves of migration and affects all knowledge domains and all aspects of both individual and collective lives. This situation presents challenges under the pressure of a powerfully uniformizing globalization. However, the exponential increase of diversity linked to intensified mobility is also conducive to social transformations since, when the numerous languages and cultures of the migrants encounter the languages and cultures of the host countries, they act as catalyzers of change. This article considers such social transformation {{in the light of the}} concept of <b>plurilingualism</b> as distinct from multilingualism, explaining the advantages of the former over the latter in such contexts, and analyzes possible synergies between <b>plurilingualism</b> and creativity through the lens of complexity theories and the theory of affordances, with the related concepts of ‘affordance spaces’ and landscape of affordances. After a brief introduction of the main tenets of complexity theories and affordances, the article builds on three complementary models of creativity, using complexity theories as a framework and discusses the specific characteristics and potential of <b>plurilingualism</b> by explaining how it can transform diversity from an obstacle into an opportunity, a possibility for action. The triadic relationship between creativity, <b>plurilingualism,</b> and complexity is considered. As a result, the article suggests that <b>plurilingualism</b> can create conditions conducive to creativity thanks to its multiple and flexible nature that values all forms of cross-fertilization and the uniqueness of the resulting individual trajectories. Without claiming any causal relationship between <b>plurilingualism</b> and creativity, the paper explains the reasons why it is crucial to nurture and foster <b>plurilingualism</b> in order to provide favorable conditions for creativity and change. The article explains the characteristics and implications of plurilanguaging, and the potential for individuals to embrace a holistic, complex view of languages and cultures and to experience empowerment in the process of perceiving and exploring linguistic and cultural diversity, hybridity and interconnections, thus discovering and liberating their full creative repertoire...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} recent proposals in Vanuatu for a new, plurilingual education system. The article discusses these proposals {{with reference to}} three principles of <b>plurilingualism</b> upon which the proposals are ostensibly based: the need to value the linguistic repertoires with which children start school, the development of further linguistic resources to enhance individual potential, and the holistic integration of these resources within linguistic repertoires. The author argues that the proposals are driven not by concerns for the fostering of individual <b>plurilingualism,</b> but rather by an agenda of an imagined societal multilingualism within which certain languages are prioritised over all others. The result {{is an attempt to}} engineer plurilingual competence by following a blueprint for multilingualism, thus working against the needs of individuals. The article proposes a more flexible model of <b>plurilingualism,</b> within which teachers and learners have the freedom to negotiate meaning through whichever linguistic resources are available to them, rather than stipulating which languages should be used at any given time...|$|E

30|$|Participants {{point out}} that plurilingual people (here, learners) often {{attribute}} different functions to their languages. These functional attributes however {{have little to do}} with linguistic diversity, or being able to speak many languages. <b>Plurilingualism</b> rather often involves identity issues, social perspectives on professional development and success. In this respect, there is pressing need to enable professionals to implement, exploit and foster multilingualism and <b>plurilingualism</b> at both the conceptual and practical levels (Byrnes 2009; Crookes 1997, Jessner 2008). Concomitantly, when a language teacher deals with individuals, who face multilingualism at different levels – something that has become common even beyond the European context – he or she does not only have to teach the language for the learner to be able to use the language, but needs to pay increasingly close attention to the various dimensions (e.g. functional, identity, social). The language will resonate differently for any given individual and at different moments across the lifespan (e.g., one out of two or more family languages, languages of higher educational success, languages of tourism). Regarding pre- and in-service teacher training, a multilingual environment will challenge the trainee teacher and require him or her to develop a certain stance towards multilingualism in its most tangible forms. He or she will train to teach one language as an entity and to teach within a framework with multifaceted <b>plurilingualism.</b> Participants highlight the need for the construction of a methodological and conceptual basis for dealing with multilingualism at its core. Otherwise, debates on how to make teacher education in Europe more multilingual, in any one of the two perspectives of multilingualism and <b>plurilingualism,</b> will fail to respect the fact that the language teacher is to act as a primary agent and placed at the centre of multilingualism and education.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plurilingualism</b> and {{interculturality}} {{are clearly}} stated {{objectives of the}} Council of Europe’s education project (CEFR, 2001).

40|$|The paper explores plurilingual {{competence}} {{in respect to}} language proficiency, language education and pluri- and multilingualism. The notion of communicative competence was introduced by Hymes (1972) {{as a reaction to}} chomskyan view of language as an autonomous system. Hymes’ notion of communicative competence originally included <b>plurilingualism.</b> The concept of communicative competence was quickly adopted to applied linguistics but the idea of a linguistic repertoire consisting of the competencies of linguistic varieties was not imported to SLA or language testing. The Hymesian perspective to <b>plurilingualism</b> as an essential dimension of communicative competence was revived in the Common European Framework (CEFR). However,the practice of applying the CEFR has mostly neglected the dimension on <b>plurilingualism</b> and plurilingual competence. The focus {{in the use of the}} CEFR has been on the different areas of language skills within one single language at a time, while the application of plurilingual practices has gained very little attention. The Hymesian notion of communicative competence has lived on in the sociolinguistic research tradition, especially within interactional sociolinguistics. The present paper relates the notion of plurilingual competence to its hymesian origin, to recent trends in plurilingual and pluricultural education, and to the sociolinguistic study of style and linguistic variation in multilingual communities. The article uses Finnish L 2 data to show how plurilingual competence is used as an interactional resource. From the perspective of language learning, plurilingual competence enables speakers with different linguistic backgrounds to use their shared linguistic repertoire in order to ensure smooth interaction and achieve mutual understanding...|$|E

30|$|In {{regards to}} the {{pressing}} contradiction between <b>plurilingualism</b> {{as a mode of}} living on the one hand (cf.

For instance, language teachers have to be ready to develop practices that aim at dealing with multilingualism and <b>plurilingualism</b> on multiple levels (e.g., syllabi policies, individual learners) and to various degrees (e.g., develop a general understanding, develop specific techniques for dealing with multilingual literacies). Language teachers faced with the challenge of multilingualism and plurilingual repertoires can no longer draw on single resources like bringing in materials in a given language or from experienced multilingual practices (e.g., Erasmus exchange) (Goodman 2009). More than in the past, language teachers have to integrate language resources of multiple kinds, often available from the learners themselves – on site (e.g., classroom community), in parallel (e.g., videogames, music videos) and in a continued active form (e.g., languages used in play).|$|E
