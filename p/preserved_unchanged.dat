60|$|Five {{years of}} {{disappointment}} and sorrow had sadly changed her to outward view. Her face looked thinner and longer; the once delicate {{red and white}} of her complexion was gone; her figure had wasted {{under the influence of}} some weakness, which had already made her stoop a little when she walked. Her manner had lost its maiden shyness, only to become unnaturally quiet and subdued. Of all the charms which had so fatally, yet so innocently, allured her heartless husband, but one remained--the winning gentleness of her voice. It might be touched now and then with a note of sadness, but the soft attraction of its even, natural tone still remained. In the marring of all other harmonies, this one harmony had been <b>preserved</b> <b>unchanged.</b> Her brother, though his face was careworn, and his manner sadder than of old, looked less altered from his former self.

5000|$|Houses. Among {{the most}} famous {{photographic}} motifs in Greetsiel is the row of houses on Sielstraße flanking the harbour. The houses at No. 11 and No. 15, with their bell-shaped gables based on Dutch designs, are particularly striking. While the former is dated 1741, No. 15 was built in 1792. The Poppingas Old Bakery (Poppingas Alte Bäckerei), No. 21, from the 19th century is also found on Sielstraße and is used now as a museum, cafe and gallery; its interior has been <b>preserved</b> <b>unchanged.</b> Near the church is the so-called High House (Hohes Haus) at 1, Hohe Straße, a two-storey, sideways-on, brick building, which once served as {{the seat of the}} treasurer or Rentmeister. According to the anchor plate on the gable it dates to [...] "1696", but is thought to have already been in decline {{by the middle of the}} 16th century. Today the building, whose street façade is covered with an ashlar facing, houses a hotel. The Amtmannshaus on Neuer Deich is probably from the same period, but was extensively renovated during the 19th century. In the latest renovation the exterior appearance of the house and its associated Gulf barn was changed significantly by the addition of modern dormers. In Mühlenstraße is Haus von Halem, built in 1794 and one of the most important residential examples of neoclassical architecture in East Frisia. The two-storey brick building with a hip roof is divided by a huge pilasters. The portal has a richly carved fanlights in the late rococo style.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study {{of the destruction of}} quantum multifractality in the presence of perturbations. We study diverse representative models displaying multifractality, including a pseudointegrable system, the Anderson model and a random matrix model. We apply several types of natural perturbations which can be relevant for experimental implementations. We construct an analytical theory for certain cases, and perform extensive large-scale numerical simulations in other cases. The data are analyzed through refined methods including double scaling analysis. Our results confirm the recent conjecture that multifractality breaks down following two scenarios. In the first one, multifractality is <b>preserved</b> <b>unchanged</b> below a certain characteristic length which decreases with perturbation strength. In the second one, multifractality is affected at all scales and disappears uniformly for a strong enough perturbation. Our refined analysis shows that subtle variants of these scenarios can be present in certain cases. This study could guide experimental implementations in order to observe quantum multifractality in real systems. Comment: 20 pages, 27 figure...|$|E

More than twenty years ago there was a discussion between Jasanoff (1983) and Schmalstieg (1983) about final syllables in Slavic. As I pointed out in my comment (1983), the discussion was strongly reminiscent of the one which almost a century earlier took place between Streitberg (1892) and Hirt (1893), the former author insisting upon tonal distinctions and the latter upon the place of the stress for the explanation of timbre distinctions in final syllables. In his contribution, Jasanoff came up with solutions that had been proposed eighty years earlier by Holger Pedersen (1905) in an article which he evidently had not seen.

40|$|A {{low energy}} method for grain size {{separation}} in heterogeneous sediments without using chemicals and in thermostatic condition, was tested {{in order to}} <b>preserve</b> <b>unchanged</b> the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the porous medium. The method consisted of wet sieving, to divide the sandy fraction from the fine fraction (< 63 µm), and of wet gravitational separation to divide the clayey from the silty fraction. Deionised water was Lused as dispersive phase for sequential gravitational separation of silt and clay. Stokes’ law was applied to calculate the settling time for the silty fraction in order to siphon out the resulting supernatant containing the clay particles. The procedure was systematically tested and proved to be highly reproducible and the degree of purity was 90 % for silt and 95 % for clay. This method can be conveniently applied in many studies on contaminant fate and partitioning between liquid and solid phases, where physical and chemical integrity of each granulometric fraction is a prerequisite...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis was {{realised}} {{within the}} framework of the Doctoral Student programme at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research CERN, which is situated near Geneva. The aim of this thesis was to develop a method for reliable firmware implementation and to use that method to implement a new firmware for the Safe Machine Parameters (SMP) system. That system relies heavily on the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and it is one of the key machine protection systems of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The conception of the SMP hardware originates from the fully tested Beam Interlock System (BIS) being a result of another PhD thesis. For that reason the reliable SMP hardware was <b>preserved</b> <b>unchanged.</b> The first version of the SMP was ready for the LHC startup in the year 2008. Nevertheless the quality of the SMP firmware was objectionable. There were new requirements and therefore the SMP specification was extended. On that occasion it was decided that the existing SMP firmware will not be continued and that it should be started from scratch. For the new version the firmware implementation should be carried out on the basis of the strictly defined approach, which will ensure high quality and therefore reliability of the SMP. The starting point of the work was the IEC~ 61508 standard, which was supposed to be matched for the specific needs of the facility carrying out the high energy physics experiments like CERN. As the result of that thesis a full electronic protection system lifecycle was proposed, form the conception through the risk analysis to the implementation and deployment. The method proposed was applied to the critical firmware implementation of the SMP. Examples of the most critical functions realised by the SMP system are shown in the final chapters of the thesis. The second version of the SMP was deployed to be used in the LHC accelerator in the year 2010. Since then it performs its role without failures and therefore it is foreseen to be operated without any changes up to the end of the LHC project. The second result of the thesis is the proposed lifecycle, which can be used for the evaluation of the existing project or for the implementation of the new programmable protection systems for the high energy particle experiments at CERN or in the similar scientific laboratory...|$|E
