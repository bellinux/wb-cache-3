This paper proposed an active interference management scheme that the secondary system can coexist with the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> in the same frequency band without interference. Using the proposed protocol, the secondary user acquires interference channel information and transmit/receive filter information and designs precoding matrix using these information.

30|$|In this paper, a {{cooperative}} transmission protocol for cognitive radio systems is proposed. In this protocol, the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> comprises a transmitter (PT), a receiver (PR), and a decode-and-forward relay (Relay), while the secondary system comprises a transmitter (ST) and a receiver (SR). Both the ST and the Relay assist the transmissions {{of the primary}} users together. The outage probabilities of the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> and the secondary system are analyzed and verified through simulations. In order to decrease outage probability of the secondary system, power allocation is performed at the ST.

40|$|A {{conventional}} passive tuned {{vibration absorber}} (TVA) is effective {{when it is}} precisely tuned to the frequency of a vibration mode; otherwise, it may amplify the vibrations of the <b>primary</b> <b>system.</b> In many applications, the frequency often changes over time. For example, adding or subtracting external mass on the existing <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> results in changes in the systemโs natural frequency. The frequency changes of the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> can significantly degrade the performance of TVA. To cope with this problem, many alternative TVAs (such as semiactive, adaptive, and active TVAs) have been studied. As another alternative, this paper investigates the use of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) in passive TVAs {{in order to improve}} the robustness of the TVAs subject to mass change in the <b>primary</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed SMA-TVA employs SMA wires, which exhibit variable stiffness, as the spring element of the TVA. This allows us to tune effective stiffness of the TVA to adapt to the changes in the <b>primary</b> <b>system's</b> natural frequency. The simulation model, presented in this paper, contains the dynamics of the TVA along with the SMA wire model that includes phase transformation, heat transfer, and the constitutive relations. Additionally, a PID controller is included for regulating the applied voltage to the SMA wires {{in order to maintain the}} desired stiffness. The robustness analysis is then performed on both the SMA-TVA and the equivalent passive TVA. For our robustness analysis, the mass of the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> is varied by ยฑ 30 % of its nominal mass. The simulation results show that the SMA-TVA is more robust than the equivalent passive TVA in reducing peak vibrations in the <b>primary</b> <b>system</b> subject to change of its mass...|$|R
