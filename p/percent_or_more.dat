5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

Despite this, the AIF remained the Australian Army's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 Militia infantry battalions, later organised into three Militia divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.|$|E

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: To {{determine}} whether retrograde nailing of distal femoral fractures is beneficial {{for the elderly}} patient. METHODS: Prospective study of consecutive patients, aged sixty-five years or older, whose distal femoral fractures were treated with a retrograde femoral nail between January 3, 1993, and April 30, 1996. RESULTS: Twenty-four of twenty-six patients were followed for more than twelve months. There were twenty AO/ASIF 33 A and four AO/ASIF 33 C fractures. Twenty-three were closed. There was one Gustilo type 1 fracture. All fractures healed. Six patients did not walk before injury. Using the Neer scoring system, there were ten (56 <b>percent)</b> excellent (85 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> points), six (33 <b>percent)</b> good (70 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> points), and two (11 <b>percent)</b> fair (55 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> points) results; none of the cases were considered as failures (less than 55 points). CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde intramedullary nailing makes possible a biological osteosynthesis of distal femoral fractures. It also produces good functional results in elderly patients. The two major technical problems encountered with this implant are the poor hold of the distal interlocking screws and difficulties with proximal interlocking. Early weight-bearing is not advisable. status: publishe...|$|R

Third, to illustrate the variation in thresholds that define frequent utilization {{in terms of the number}} of emergency department encounters by the predictors within the model. Primary data collection over an eight week period within a level- 1 trauma urban hospital's emergency department. Representative randomized sample of 1, 443 adult patients triaged ESI levels 4 - 5. Physicians and research staff interviewed patients as they received services. Relationships with the outcome variable, utilization, were tested using logistic regression to establish odds-ratios. 70. 6 percent of patients have two <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> 48. 3 <b>percent</b> have three <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> 25. 3 <b>percent</b> have four <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> and 14. 9 <b>percent</b> have five <b>or</b> <b>more</b> emergency department visits within 12 months. Factors associated with frequent utilization include gender, race, poor mental health, mental health drugs, prescription drug abuse, social networks, employment, perceptions of service quality, seriousness of condition, persistence of condition, and previous hospital admittance. Interventions targeting associated factors will change global emergency department encounters, although the mutability varies. Policy interventions to address predisposing factors such as substance abuse or access to mental health treatment as well as interventions that speak to enabling factors such as promoting the resiliency of social networks may result in decreased frequency of emergency department utilization...|$|R
