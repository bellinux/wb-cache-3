Highly time-resolved atmospheric mercury measurements in the Antarctic have shown that mercury depletion events do also occur in the Antarctic at Neumayer Station {{during the first three}} months after polar sunrise. This phenomenon leads to an increased input of atmospheric mercury into the <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> A possible explanation for mercury depletion events may involve chemical or photochemical oxidation of Hg" 0 to Hg" 2 "+ [resulting either in particle-associated mercury (Total Particulate-Phase Mercury: TPM) and/or reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) species] and significantly enhanced deposition fluxes of mercury leading to unequivocally increased input of atmospheric mercury into the <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The Antarctic mercury depletion phenomenon is strongly correlated with ground-level ozone depletion episodes. These trophospheric ozone loss events in the Antarctic are associated with enhanced bromine monoxide concentrations in the free troposphere. It is hypothesized that Br atoms and/or BrO radicals are involved in a chemical reaction which destroys ozone. The following depletion of atmospheric boundary layer mercury (at times up to an altitude of #approx# 1 km) is due to a reaction between gaseous elemental mercury and BrO free radicals. In addition methods for the determination of GEM, TPM, and RGM were applied at Neumayer Station during antarctic summer and on board of the German research vessel ''Polarstern''.

40|$|Due to {{different}} oceanographic and geological characteristics, benthic algal communities of Antarctica and the Arctic differ strongly. Antarctica {{is characterized by}} high endemism, whereas in the Arctic only few endemic seaweeds occur. In contrast to the Antarctic region, where nutrient levels never limit algal growth, nutrient levels in the Arctic regions are depleted during the summer season. Both regions have a strong seasonally changing light regime, fortified by an ice covering throughout the winter months. After months of darkness algae are suddenly exposed to high light caused by the breaking up of sea ice. Simultaneously, harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) entersthe water column and can significantly affect algal growth and community structure. In the intertidal zone fluctuations of temperature and salinity can be very large. Ice scours can further influence growth and settlement of intertidal algae. The subtidal zone offers a more stable habitat than the intertidal,permitting the growth of larger perennial algae and microbial mats.

Intertidal communities were dominated by single cell diatoms and green algal propagules. Limpet grazing reduced the algal biomass and macroalgal recruit density and further introduced a shift in both macro- and microalgal species composition. There were no negative UVR effects on the diatom assemblage. In contrast, significant UVR effects on the macroalgal assemblage were detected.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. A major {{objective}} of the multidisciplinary Palmer Long Term Ecolog-ical Research (LTER) program is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of various components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem—the assemblage of plants, animals, ocean, sea ice, and island components south of the Antarctic Convergence. Phytoplankton production {{plays a key role}} in this <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> and factors that regulate production include those that control cell growth (light, temperature, nutrients) and those that control cell accumulation rate and hence population growth (water column stability, advection, grazing, and sinking). Several of these factors are mediated by the annual advance and retreat of sea ice. In this study, we examine the results from nearly a decade (1991 – 2000) of ecological research in the western Antarctic Peninsula region. We evaluate the spatial and temporal var-iability of phytoplankton biomass (estimated as chlorophyll-a concentration) and primary production (determined in-situ aboard ship as well as estimated from ocean color satellite data). We also present the spatial and temporal variability of sea ice extent (estimated from passive microwave satellite data). While the data record is relatively short from a long-term perspective, evidence is accumulating that statistically links the variability in sea ice to the variability in primary pro-duction. Even though this marine ecosystem displays extreme interannual vari-ability in both phytoplankton biomass and primary production, persistent spatial patterns have been observed over the many years of study (e. g., an on to offshore gradient in biomass and a growing season characterized by episodic phytoplankton blooms). This high interannual variability at the base of the food chain influences organisms at all trophic levels...|$|E

The influences of ice cover to CHL, AOD and NAO were determined. In general, the peak of ICE was in March. ICE began to melt until September. The polar front was located in the region 70 ° N– 75 ° N where ICE was almost totally melted. The region 75 ° N– 80 ° N was our focus area for the correlation study. ICE, CHL, AOD and NAO were correlated with a time lag. In general, ICE reached a peak 3 months ahead of CHL. When ice started melting, CHL started to increase. The melting ice contributed ice algae {{for the growth of}} phytoplankton biomass. ICE had an influence on AOD with a 1 month time lag ahead of AOD. EViews statistical software was used to conduct lag regression analysis and then cointegration analysis was carried out. There was cointegration between CHL and ICE and AOD and ICE, which means that they both had a long-term equilibrium relationship. NAO and melting ice had a positive correlation, melting ice lagged 3 months behind NAO, which explained why NAO had an influence on ICE. CHL and NAO had negative correlations.

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80 °N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end we analysed remote-sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979 - 2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick-growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This {{had a profound impact on}} little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within < 5 km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4 % decrease in adult body mass.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{theory of}} ecology and algal bloom formation (Reply to comment by López-Urrutia) The comment by López-Urrutia {{draws attention to}} the similarity between the temperature–growth rate relationships reported by Rose and Caron (2007) and the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). Rose and Caron (2007) noted different responses of the maximal growth rates of heterotrophic and phototrophic protists to temperature that provide one potential explanation for massive phytoplankton blooms that characterize many <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> López-Urrutia has noted that these relationships match quite well some predictions of the MTE, which provides a (potentially) unifying mechanistic theory of the interaction of body size, temperature, and stoichiometry (chemical composition) on biological structure and function at scale...|$|R

Sustained observations at the West Antarctic Peninsula show that in this region, rapid environmental change has coincided with shifts in the food web, from its base up to apex predators. New strategies will be required to gain further insight into how the marine climate system has influenced such changes and how it will do so in the future. Robotic networks, satellites, ships, and instruments mounted on animals and ice will collect data needed to improve numerical models that can then be used to study the future of <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystems</b> as climate change progresses...|$|R
