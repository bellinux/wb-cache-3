40|$|The {{usage of}} {{alternative}} energy beside fossil fuel in maritime industry is necessary {{due to the}} fluctuating fuel cost. In {{order to reduce the}} operational cost by reducing the fuel consumption, some ships are equipped with solar-wind assisted devices. The lower oils consumption in ships could reduce environmental pollutions and increase cruising range. This study investigates the feasibility of using solar assisted rigid wind–sail as a <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>device</b> on University Malaysia Terengganu’s (UMT) research boat. The attachment of solar assisted rigid wind-sail device may affect the performance, operation and stability of the boat. Generally, the performance of boat will increase when there are additional energies. Thus, the operational cost of the boat may decrease due to lower oil usage. Attempts were made to study the feasibility of using solar assisted rigid wind-sail in technical aspects including stability and performance as well as operational and economical aspects. The results of the study shown that the application of solar assisted rigid wind-sail to UMT research boat reduced the annual cost of operation from USD 20390 to USD 17815. 9. It can also save up to 20 % of power consumption. Further, the attachment of solar assisted rigid wind-sail to UMT research boat does not affect the stability of the boat and the stability of boat still meet the IMO requirement. Therefore, it can be summarized that the solar assisted rigid windsail has a high potential {{as an alternative to the}} conventional fossil fuel ships in the future...|$|E

As the devices scaled down in nanometer regime the threshold voltage is also scaled, consequently the leakage power increases.

Techniques of <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> for user <b>devices</b> using mobile communication systems such as WiMAX and LTE (Long-Term Evolution) are parts of the major focuses in the literature. In this paper, two revised schemes of the authors’ previously proposed <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> schemes for IEEE 802.16 are proposed to be applied in LTE. The proposed schemes, namely LTE-LBPS-Aggr and LTE-LBPS-Merge, estimate the input load by traffic measurement and the channel capacity by channel quality indicator (CQI) reports, calculate {{the length of the}} sleep cycle, and notify related user equipments (UEs) of the next radio-on time for receiving data. The difference between LTE-LBPS-Aggr and LTE-LBPS-Merge lies in the grouping of UEs for sleep scheduling. LTE-LBPS-Aggr treats all UEs in a group, while LTE-LBPS-Merge allows multiple groups of UEs in sleep scheduling. The simulation study shows that in comparison with standard-based mechanisms, the proposed schemes can achieve better <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> efficiency at the cost of moderate increase on delays and the signaling overhead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{popularity}} of mobile devices for personal entertainment, video streaming over mobile networks has seen a dramatic increase. We observe that users are often interested in just the supporting audio within the videos rather than the visual content, for example, when users play videos to listen to music. New mobile device capabilities such as gaze tracking enable easy detection of such use-cases. We propose to exploit such capabilities to selectively stream audio/video content based on user gaze. This eliminates unnecessary streaming, with two-fold advantages: first, it saves precious network bandwidth for ISPs, and second, reduction in video processing decreases device power. Using an android-based gaze-aware media application, we evaluate three strategies: a maximal saving scheme that cuts off video stream at source when user gaze is directed away from the screen; a conservative scheme that reduces video resolution, aimed at maintaining user experience, and a third, intermediate scheme that streams the videos at a reduced frame rate. Our evaluation shows that gaze awareness during video streaming can lead to high bandwidth savings that are linearly proportional to Gaze-OFF ratios, and up to 46 % <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> on <b>device</b> (up to 28 % <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> considering gaze tracking overheads).

The {{move to a}} {{pervasive}} computing environment, with {{the increasing use of}} laptops, netbooks, smartphones and tablets, means that we are more reliant on wireless networking and batteries for our daily computational needs. Specifically, this includes applications which have sensitive data that must be securely communicated over VPNs. However, the use of VPNs and mobile, wireless computing creates conflicting needs: VPNs traditionally assume a stable network connection, which is then secured; in contrast, wireless computing assumes a transitory network connection due to mobility or energy-saving protocols. In this work we study the ability to use traditional VPN protocols, specifically IPsec, in mobile environments while permitting for energy savings. Energy savings come from power-cycling the wireless radio when it is not in use. More specifically, we develop a mathematical model for determining potential <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> when power-cycling the radio in IPsec use settings. Next, we perform performance measurements on IPsec session resumption protocols IKEv 2 [1], MOBIKE [2], and IPsec Gateway Failover (IGF) [3] to provide data for our model.

A central server is allocated to keep all the data, based on which the queries issued by the clients are answered. There are basically two approaches to disseminating spatial data to clients: 1) on-demand access: a mobile client submits a request, which consists of a query and the query’s issuing location, to the server. The server returns the result to the mobile client via a dedicated point-to-point channel. 2) periodic broadcast: data are periodically broadcast on a wireless channel open to the public. Afte...|$|R

The 5 :th Generation telecommunications standard is partly embodied by the Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and standards to handle a big part of these devices and connections. An example within the IoT paradigm is military training systems where each system can consist of thousands of battery operated mobile devices and their shifting requirements shall be fullled in an energy-aware manner to increase battery operating times. Military training radio networks enables realistic combat training. The services and features provided in commercial telecommunications networks are desirable in these often proprietary and task specic networks, increasing capabilities and functionalities. To facilitate the current and future R&D of LTE based networks for adoption in military training networks and services this doctoral thesis intends to provide the starting ground for the energy-aware LTE based wireless communications. The thesis first presents general solutions on how to meet traffic deadlines in wireless networks for large number of nodes, and then continues with solutions for energy-aware LTE-based communications for the User Equipments (UEs). The work builds on the problem formulation how to provide energy-aware resource handling for LTE-based military training networks from where three research questions are derived. From the research questions we derive different hypotheses and then test these within the investigated area to answer the research questions.

This thesis is going to investigate the impact of the data compression and reduction on the system power of a wearable and wireless biomedical device and trying to find a proper compression technique that can achieve <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> of the <b>device.</b> The thesis first examines some widely used lossy and lossless data compression and reduction techniques for biomedical data, especially EEG data.

The thesis then moves on to the biomedical data compression evaluation of the Log 2 sub-band encoding and an existing 2 -stage technique consisting of the DPCM and the Huffman encoding. The next part of this thesis explores the signal classification potential of the Log 2 sub-band encoding. It was found that some of the signal features extracted as a by-product during the Log 2 sub-band encoding process could be used to detect certain signal events like epileptic seizures, with a proper method. The final section of the thesis focuses on the power analysis of the hardware implementation of two compression techniques referred to earlier, as well as the system power analysis.
