5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness.

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

40|$|A robust, {{bistable}} switch {{regulates the}} fluctuations between wakefulness and natural sleep {{as well as}} those between wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unresponsiveness. We previously provided experimental evidence for the existence of a behavioral barrier to transitions between these states of arousal, which we call neural inertia. Here we show that neural inertia is controlled by processes that contribute to sleep homeostasis and requires four genes involved in electrical excitability: Sh, sss, na and unc 79. Although loss of function mutations in these genes can increase or decrease sensitivity to anesthesia induction, surprisingly, they all collapse neural inertia. These effects are genetically selective: neural inertia is not perturbed by loss-of-function mutations in all genes required for the sleep/wake cycle. These effects are also anatomically selective: sss acts in different neurons to influence arousal-promoting and arousal-suppressing processes underlying neural inertia. Supporting the idea that anesthesia and sleep share some, but not all, genetic and anatomical arousal-regulating pathways, we demonstrate that increasing homeostatic sleep drive widens the neural inertial barrier. We propose that processes selectively contributing to sleep homeostasis and neural inertia may be impaired in pathophysiological conditions such as coma and <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of single proton emission tomography (SPECT) with 99 mTc-HMPAO in the diagnosis of brain death (BD). DESIGN: Prospective study in comatose and brain-dead patients. SETTING: Neurologic ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty comatose patients (age range: 10 days- 75 years) were submitted to SPECT study. In 21 of them (42 %) reversible factors (e. g., influence of drugs affecting the central nervous system) were present. Thirty-eight patients were clinically brain-dead, while the remaining 12 were tested both in pre-terminal conditions and after the clinical onset of BD. INTERVENTIONS: Brain SPECT following i. v. injection of 99 mTc-HMPAO (300 - 1100 MBq), using a 4 -headed gamma-camera (20 min, 360 degrees, 88 images). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients tested in pre-terminal conditions showed preserved brain perfusion. Two of them had flat EEGs despite the absence of any reversible cause of coma; three patients survived, but remained in <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states.</b> SPECT confirmed the diagnosis of BD in 45 out of 47 patients (95. 7 %), clearly showing the arrest of brain perfusion (picture of "empty skull"); in two clinically brain-dead children (aged 10 days and 12 months, respectively) weak perfusion of the basal ganglia, thalamus and/or brain stem was still present, precluding the diagnosis of BD; both of them died a few days later. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the reliability of SPECT in the diagnosis of BD. A problem arises about its effectiveness in brain-dead children, but this seems {{to be a matter of}} definition of BD and cerebral viability, rather than a limit of SPEC...|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, British and Belgian {{researchers}} reported {{in an article}} in the New England Journal of Medicine that some patients in <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states</b> actually had enough consciousness to [...] "answer" [...] yes or no questions on fMRI scans. However, it is unclear whether the fact that portions of the patients' brains light up on fMRI will help these patient assume their own medical decision making. Professor Geraint Rees, Director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, responded to the study by observing that, [...] "As a clinician, it would be important to satisfy oneself that the individual that you are communicating with is competent to make those decisions. At the moment it is premature to conclude that the individual able to answer 5 out of 6 yes/no questions is fully conscious like you or I." [...] In contrast, Jacob M. Appel of the Mount Sinai Hospital told the Telegraph that this development could be a welcome step toward clarifying the wishes of such patients. Appel stated: [...] "I see no reason why, if we are truly convinced such patients are communicating, society should not honour their wishes. In fact, as a physician, I think a compelling case can be made that doctors have an ethical obligation to assist such patients by removing treatment. I suspect that, if such individuals are indeed trapped in their bodies, they may be living in great torment and will request to have their care terminated or even active euthanasia." ...|$|R
40|$|A public lecture by Professor Nikolas Rose, Kings College London, {{delivered}} at ANU in August 2014. The human body was made legible long ago. But {{what of the}} human mind? Is it possible to ‘read’ the mind, for one human being to know what another is thinking or feeling, their beliefs and intentions? And if I can read your mind, how about others – could our authorities, {{in the criminal justice}} system or the security services? Some developments in contemporary neuroscience suggest the answer to this question is ‘yes’. On the one hand, evolutionary neurobiologists and cognitive neuroscientists argue that humans have an evolved capacity to ‘read the minds’ of others, and that this is a condition for human sociality; as a corollary the lack of this capacity in some humans – from autists to psychopaths – is argued to underlie their particular pathologies. On the other, a range of novel technologies of brain imaging have been used to claim that specific mental states, and even specific thoughts, can be identified by characteristic patterns of brain activation; this has led some to propose their use in practices ranging from lie detection to the assessment of brain activity in persons in <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states.</b> In this talk, Professor Rose explores the history of these developments, sketches their scientific and technical bases, and considers some of the epistemological and ontological mutations involved. He points to the ecological niches where they have – or have not – found a hospitable environment. He ends by asking whether a new expertise of the readable, knowable, transparent mind is taking shape, and if so, with what consequences.  ...|$|R
40|$|This review {{has been}} written at an unfortunate time. Novel {{questions}} are being asked of the old therapies {{and there is an}} abundance of new strategies both to lower ICP and protect the brain against cerebral ischaemia. In the United Kingdom, the problem is to ensure that appropriate patients continue to be referred to centres where clinical trials of high quality can be undertaken. One of the success stories of the past decade has been the {{decline in the number of}} road accidents as a result of seat belt legislation, improvements in car design and the drink/driving laws. Hence, fortunately there are fewer patients with head injuries to treat and it is even more important that patients are appropriately referred if studies to assess efficacy of the new strategies are not to be thwarted. The nihilistic concept that intensive investigation with ICP monitoring for patients with diffuse head injury or brain swelling following evacuation of a haematoma or a contusion has no proven beneficial effect on outcome, requires revision. A cocktail of therapies may be required that can be created only when patients are monitored in sufficient detail to reveal the mechanisms underlying their individual ICP problem. Ethical problems may arise over how aggressively therapy for intracranial hypertension should be pursued and for how long. There has always been the concern that cranial decompression or prolonged barbiturate coma may preserve patients but with unacceptably severe disability. Some patients may be salvaged from herniating with massive cerebral infarction with the use of osmotherapy but is the outcome acceptable? Similar considerations apply to some children with metabolic encephalopathies. Where such considerations have been scrutinised in patients with severe head injury, the whole spectrum of outcomes appears to be shifted so that the number of severe disabilities and <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states</b> are not increased. However, it is important to be sensitive to such issues based on experience of the particular cause of raised intracranial pressure in a given age group...|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} 96 people {{died as a}} result of the disaster.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Little {{is known}} about {{prevalence}} of <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and comparisons between countries. The aim of this column was to explore reasons for the comparable count of patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> found in prevalence studies in nursing homes in 1 European country (Netherlands) compared with a single European city (Vienna, Austria). DESIGN: The column {{is based on a}} literature review of <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> in the Netherlands and Vienna in the period 2007 - 2008, in the context of professional interactions with families and physicians of patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> In addition, in both countries, families and physicians were interviewed to illustrate views. RESULTS: Comparable between the 2 settings are the population characteristics and the definition of, and criteria, for <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> A difference {{can be found in the}} development of authoritative policy guidelines in the Netherlands, after public debates and jurisdiction, which did not exist in Vienna at the time. There also seem to be different societal values concerning rehabilitation and end-of-life decisions for patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> DISCUSSION: The most important explanation for the <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> prevalence differences between the Netherlands and Vienna can be found in the different societal values about patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> and their treatment and rehabilitation. In the Netherlands, life prolonging medical treatment, including artificial nutrition and hydration, is considered futile and can be withdrawn if there is no prospect of recovery. In Vienna, however, patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> are regarded as severely disabled and in need of long-term rehabilitation and social reintegration.

40|$|This project {{represents}} one of the foundation steps to a collaboration between the Department of Human Physiology, University of Pretoria and the Nuclear Medicine Department at Steve Biko Academic hospital. Following the initial discovery of the surprising effect zolpidem has on patients in <b>persistent</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>states</b> in 1999 by Dr H. W. Nel - namely that zolpidem administration results in a significant qualitative increase in brain function, to the extent that patients were able to once again communicate and respond appropriately to their surroundings - much data has been collected by both Dr Nel as well as the Nuclear Medicine Department of Steve Biko Hospital. Over the course of twelve years SPECT scans have been carried out on patients of various pathologies both before and after a course of zolpidem. To this day, both assessment and follow up of these and new patients is still being done by the Nuclear Medicine Department and Dr Nel. As this vast collection of data grows it has become increasingly daunting for a single research team to consolidate all this information into a usable form and an outside team has been deemed necessary to facilitate this process. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} quantify the neurological perfusion changes following zolpidem administration within responder patients. This was achieved through reprocessing and semi-quantification of the existing SPECT scan records held by the Pretoria Academic Hospital. Within the group of responder patients (n = 29), 22 patients (~ 76 %) presented a significant increase in perfusion within at least one lesion with a range of 4. 5 - 46. 1 % (mean = 11. 9 %). In opposition to this finding non-responsive lesion perfusion decreased with a significant mean change of - 14. 5 %. For both sets the p-value was determined to be < 0. 01. Of all lesions measured (n = 85) 32 % displayed increased perfusion after zolpidem administration, whereas 30. 6 % presented with a perfusion decrease. It was determined that only one lesion is required to respond to zolpidem in a positive manner to facilitate positive functional improvements with a given patient. In a small minority of patients post-zolpidem functional improvements seems to be connected to wide-spread cortical changes as opposed to singular lesional improvements. This study provides further evidence of zolpidem’s paradoxical action in a subset of brain damaged individuals. Unique quantification of results allows for additional insight and provides further understanding the physiological changes associated with zolpidem administration.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>persistent</b> or permanent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> (PVS) raises ethical and legal problems.

However, few would regard this as an appropriate outcome when the person clearly has no capacity to interact with the environment and has no likelihood of recovery. However, the ethical and legal commitment to the sanctity of life has led courts to employ a variety of approaches to this situation in order to find a way in which the person in PVS can be allowed to die. It is argued that each of the approaches is disingenuous and ultimately unhelpful. What the law is doing is endorsing non-voluntary euthanasia, but dressing it up as something else.
