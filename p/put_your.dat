You have to <b>put</b> <b>your</b> foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

[...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't <b>put</b> <b>your</b> finger on it, {{it just makes}} you feel like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said.

He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities.
