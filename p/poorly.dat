5|$|On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. <b>Poorly</b> {{equipped}} and <b>poorly</b> trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army {{was quickly}} defeated. At this time, Dangić {{was assigned to}} command the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II to Nikšić Airport {{as he left the}} country.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of {{intramolecular}} hydrogen bonds within proteins, <b>poorly</b> shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.|$|E
5|$|According to editor Paul Hirsch, in the {{original}} cut, the museum scene fared <b>poorly</b> at test screenings until he switched sequences around and Hughes changed the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained <b>poorly</b> organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a <b>poorly</b> organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Australia started <b>poorly,</b> and Davidson made a duck as the {{tourists}} were dismissed for 190. Davidson then took 3/67, removing Pullar, May and Subba Row as England took a sizeable 177-run lead.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{reported}} they were attacked first. The <b>poorly</b> defined border, {{as well as}} a history of Taliban fighters moving around the Afghan border regions, were cited as possible contributing factors to the incident.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{positive}} critical response, {{the song}} charted <b>poorly,</b> peaking at 51 on the ARIA Singles Chart.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} <b>poorly</b> {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and <b>poorly</b> built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are <b>poorly</b> sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; <b>poorly</b> sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Film adaptations in the 1990s {{have been}} <b>poorly</b> received. The {{character}} has {{been featured in}} several radio programs, two television shows, and comics.|$|E
5|$|However, some pet {{cats are}} <b>poorly</b> socialized. In particular, older cats may show {{aggressiveness}} towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; {{this type of}} behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, in an {{internal}} memo, CEO Dick Costolo {{said he was}} 'frankly ashamed' at how <b>poorly</b> Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.|$|E
5|$|In its later years, DuMont {{was carried}} mostly on <b>poorly</b> watched UHF {{channels}} or had only secondary affiliations on VHF stations. DuMont ended most operations on April 1, 1955, but honored network commitments until August 1956.|$|E
5|$|Like many large, active sharks, {{this species}} adapts <b>poorly</b> to captivity; {{it tends to}} bump into the sides of its enclosure, and the {{resulting}} abrasions then become infected with often fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|Maryland, {{which was}} third-best in the ACC in third down {{attempts}} (40.4%), did comparatively <b>poorly</b> during the game, converting {{only four of}} 14third downs (28.6%).|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play <b>poorly.</b> On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was <b>poorly</b> done, and traveled only 15yards before going out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|Room 1 was {{extremely}} <b>poorly</b> preserved {{and is the}} southernmost of the rooms. Only one doorjamb and a portion of wall belonging to a rear bench were found during excavations.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{township}} seats {{have a small}} clinic. Most have only a health station, usually <b>poorly</b> supplied.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were <b>poorly</b> trained and <b>poorly</b> supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|Stela 28 and Stela 29 were {{erected in}} 623 {{and are the}} {{earliest}} monuments to survive from Late Classic Calakmul. They depict a royal couple but the texts are too <b>poorly</b> preserved to reveal their names.|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon <b>poorly</b> constructed doors and windows. <b>Poorly</b> constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Games, held in St. Louis, were <b>poorly</b> organized, with {{participation}} of only 12 nations, and many events contested only by athletes from the host United States.|$|E
5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for <b>poorly</b> constructed and <b>poorly</b> maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a <b>poorly</b> maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{announced}} {{intentions to}} commence flights to Guangzhou and Kunming in China in summer 2014. Former Biman board director Kazi Oahedul Alam criticised the expansion as <b>poorly</b> planned and not commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was <b>poorly</b> received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic. Reviewers {{generally agreed that}} presenting a cooking guide as a video game was a good idea, but {{they found that the}} game was <b>poorly</b> executed and mediocre as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{high number}} of {{casualties}} was {{a consequence of the}} wooden construction of the building, the <b>poorly</b> marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna is <b>poorly</b> studied. There are 80 Bulgarian and 4 local endemics, {{as well as}} 34 relict species.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies {{occurs in}} the western and central parts of the winter range, although some birds occur as far east as Kenya. S. b. woodwardi winters in eastern and southern Africa. Movements in Africa are <b>poorly</b> known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years. There are {{only a handful of}} records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from Corsica, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes are <b>poorly</b> known, but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean. This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Yemen, Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Madeira.|$|E
5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in mammalian innate immunity is <b>poorly</b> understood, and relatively little data is available. However, {{the existence of}} viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as <b>poorly</b> substantiated.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} disc {{is still}} <b>poorly</b> understood: no {{model of the}} formation of the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc has yet been proposed that explains all their observed properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} Scots culture from Dalriada north of Ardnamurchan is <b>poorly</b> {{understood}} and little is recorded of Raasay's early Christian period. The placename Kilmaluag suggests {{the presence of}} St Moluag in the late sixth century.|$|E
5|$|Two {{protactinium}} oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); {{the former}} is isomorphic with ThO2 and the latter is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, <b>poorly</b> soluble base.|$|E
5|$|A second sequel, called , was {{released}} on August 1, 2008. The story takes place in China with the Terracotta Emperor inspiring the villain, while Rachel Weisz was replaced with Maria Bello. A prequel to The Scorpion King, , {{was released}} direct-to-DVD. Both films were <b>poorly</b> received by critics.|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is <b>poorly</b> known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|After Kennedy's assassination, Congress {{altered the}} Secret Service's mandate to include {{protection}} for presidential candidates. The remaining candidates were immediately protected under {{an executive order}} issued by Lyndon Johnson, putting a strain on the <b>poorly</b> resourced Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{movements}} are <b>poorly</b> known, tagging patterns {{indicate that the}} smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past brackish areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish {{were found in the}} Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway—34km (21mi) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas.|$|E
