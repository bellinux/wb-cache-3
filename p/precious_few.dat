500|$|Though {{the crafts}} move {{at very high}} straight-line speeds, Wipeout takes its {{inspiration}} from Formula 1 breakthroughs by aspiring for even greater turning speeds. Using the Formula 1 parallel, rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force. Just moving a craft left or right alone is very responsive, but by applying an air-brake {{in the direction of}} movement, players zip around very tight turns at near top speed, including those greater than 90 degrees. By applying an air-brake, the turn starts out gradually but as it continues, change in direction increases sharply. Where necessary, the player may also use dual air-brakes for rapid deceleration, typically used if the pilot has flown off the racing line in tight corners and needs to steady. The player can also take on damage from enemy fire and be blown up, but the ship can be [...] "recharged" [...] to health at the pit stop in exchange for a <b>precious</b> <b>few</b> seconds of the race.|$|E

500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. <b>Precious</b> <b>few</b> film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{affiliation}} to {{the avant-garde}} {{came with a}} sharp critique of Romanian culture, accused by Fondane of promoting imitation and parochialism. During a period which ended with his 1923 departure, the young poet sparked polemic {{with a series of}} statements in which, reviewing the impact of local Francophilia, he equated Romania with a colony of France. This theory proposed a difference between Westernization and [...] "parasitism": [...] "If a foreign intellectual direction is always useful, an alien soul is always a danger." [...] He did not cease to promote foreign culture at home, but stated a complex argument about the need to recognize differences in culture: his global conclusion about civilizations, which he viewed as equal but not identical, built on Gourmont's theory about an [...] "intellectual constancy" [...] throughout human history, as well as on philosopher Henri Bergson's critique of mechanism. In parallel, Fondane criticized the cultural setting of Greater Romania, noting that it was so Bucharest-focused that Transylvanian authors only became widely known by attending the capital's Casa Capșa restaurant. In his retrospective interpretation of Romanian literature, the avant-garde essayist stated that there were <b>precious</b> <b>few</b> authors who could be considered original, primarily citing Ion Creangă, the peasant writer, as a model of authenticity. While stating this point in his Imagini și cărți din Franța, Fondane cited in his favor a traditionalist culture critic, historian Nicolae Iorga.|$|E
