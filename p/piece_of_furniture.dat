5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

25|$|Hitchcock {{shot for}} periods lasting up to 10 minutes (the {{length of a}} film camera magazine), {{continuously}} panning from actor to actor, though most shots in the film wound up being shorter. Every other segment ends by panning against or tracking into an object—a man's jacket blocking the entire screen, or {{the back of a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> for example. In this way, Hitchcock effectively masked half the cuts in the film.|$|E
25|$|As a rule, {{cabinets}} of the 15th {{century were}} rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria {{the lower part}} was often enclosed, {{as well as the}} upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> A very pretty instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 27, Macleod {{was already}} {{considered}} somewhat {{too old to be}} a platoon commander. Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941 a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot at his door until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing down the door with a heavy <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.|$|E

25|$|A {{chair is}} a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> with a raised surface {{supported}} by legs, {{commonly used to}} seat a single person. Chairs are supported most often by four legs and have a back; however, a chair can have three legs or can have a different shape. Chairs are made {{of a wide variety}} of materials, ranging from wood to metal to synthetic material (e.g. plastic), and they may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics, either just on the seat (as with some dining room chairs) or on the entire chair. Chairs are used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces.|$|E
25|$|Until the 19th century, Catholicism {{had been}} the main {{inspiration}} for Breton artists. The region has {{a great number of}} baroque retables, made between the 17th and the 19th century. Breton sculptors were also famous for their ship models that served as ex-votos and for their richly decorated furniture, which features naïve Breton characters and traditional patterns. The box-bed is the most famous Breton <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> The Breton style had a strong revival between 1900 and the Second World War and it was used by the Seiz Breur movement. The Seiz Breur artists also tried to invent a modern Breton art by rejecting French standards and mixing traditional techniques with new materials. The leading artists of that period were the designer René-Yves Creston, the illustrators Jeanne Malivel and Xavier Haas, and the sculptors Raffig Tullou, Francis Renaud, Georges Robin, Joseph Savina, Jules-Charles Le Bozec and Jean Fréour.|$|E
25|$|The {{chest was}} a very {{important}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E

500|$|The room is circular, {{with the}} window embrasures forming a {{sequence}} of arches around the outside. It is richly decorated, with love as the theme, displaying carved monkeys, nesting birds and pomegranates, images taken from 15th-century manuscripts. Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately [...] "lascivious". Above the fireplace is a winged statue of Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul, carrying a heart-shaped shield which displays {{the arms of the}} Bute family. The washbasin, designed by John Chapple, has cisterns for hot and cold water, covered with crenellated towers. The Marchioness's scarlet and gold bed is the most notable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in the room, modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet-le-Duc. Crook described the bed as being [...] "medieval to the point of acute discomfort".|$|E
500|$|The NES {{version was}} {{included}} as a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in Animal Crossing for the GameCube, {{along with many other}} NES games, though this one required the use of a Nintendo e-Reader, a Game Boy Advance accessory, and a North America-exclusive Animal Crossing e-Card. This version was later re-released in the second series of NES e-Cards, and was even re-released through the Famicom Mini series in Japan. An improved port called [...] was released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System, with added features and revisions to gameplay. It also featured cutscenes and even advertisements, being sponsored by the food company Nagatanien. Kaette Kita is very rare since it was only available as a Disk Writer promotion. A later NES port was released exclusively in Europe in 1993, called Mario Bros. (Classic Series); this version had a more refined control and stage intermissions closer to the original arcade version.|$|E
500|$|This myth {{was derived}} from two misconceptions: First, that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction, and second, that debris from a {{structure}} will be carried away {{in the direction of}} the tornado's propagation, leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado's approach unharmed. The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house {{in the direction of the}} tornado's approach is actually the [...] safe. Additionally, many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly, including the Jarrell Tornado (F5 on the Fujita scale), which moved south-southwesterly. Because determining a tornado's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter, official advice is to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building, under a staircase, I-beam, or sturdy <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> if possible.|$|E

500|$|On {{the last}} few days on set, the {{conditions}} had become so poor that the crew began burning furniture to stay warm. Since only exterior shots needed to be filmed at that point, they burned nearly every <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> left. Several actors went days without showering, and because of the freezing conditions, several caught colds and other illnesses. Campbell later described the filming process as nearly [...] "twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony", though he allowed that he did manage to have fun while on set. On January 23, 1980, filming was finished and almost every crew member left the set to return home, with Campbell staying with Raimi. While looking over the footage that had been shot, Raimi discovered that a few pick-ups were required to fill in missing shots. Four days of re-shoots were then done to complete the film. The final moment involved Campbell having [...] "monster-guts" [...] splattered on him in the basement.|$|E
500|$|Since {{infrasonic}} bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike {{a typical}} subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations {{that are designed}} to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously [...] "bass shakers", [...] "butt shakers" [...] and [...] "throne shakers". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool ("throne") or gamer's chair, car seat or home theater seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear {{in a manner similar to}} bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, it was owing {{in great}} measure to the Renaissance that the chair {{ceased to be}} a mark of high office, and became the {{customary}} companion of whoever could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. [...] We find almost at once began to reflect the fashions of the hour. No <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women’s dress but of men’s also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a “conversation chair” was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.|$|E
