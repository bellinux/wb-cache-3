In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzodioxin,</b> studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E

The catalysts were characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and FTIR. The performance of these catalysts toward the decomposition of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) was evaluated in a closed system. The spinel-type catalyst with mesoporous structure demonstrated high catalytic activity for the hydrodechlorination of polychlorinated aromatic compounds.

Breast milk samples from Bien Hoa City, where residents live very close to the air base, showed high levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), with 18 % of the samples containing >. 5. pg.

In Da Nang, TCDD levels in mothers from Thanh Khe (close to the air base, n. =. 43) were significantly higher than those in mothers from Son Tra (far from the air base, n. =. 26), but not other PCDD and PCDF (PCDD/F) congeners. Although TCDD levels in Bien Hoa were the highest among these hotspots, levels of other PCDD/F congeners as well as the geometric mean concentration of total PCDD/F level in Bien Hoa (9. 3. pg toxic equivalents [TEQ]/g lipid) were significantly lower than the level observed in Phu Cat (14. 1. pg.

40|$|In January 1999, 500 tons of feed {{contaminated}} with approximately 50 kg of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1 g of dioxins {{were distributed to}} animal farms in Belgium, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the Netherlands, France, and Germany. This study was based on 20, 491 samples collected in the database of the Belgian federal ministries from animal feed, cattle, pork, poultry, eggs, milk, and various fat-containing food items analyzed for their PCB and/or dioxin content. Dioxin measurements showed a clear predominance of polychlorinated dibenzofuran over <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzodioxin</b> congeners, a dioxin/PCB ratio of approximately 1 : 50, 000 and a PCB fingerprint resembling that of an Aroclor mixture, thus confirming contamination by transformer oil rather than by other environmental sources. In this case the PCBs contribute significantly more to toxic equivalents (TEQ) than dioxins. The respective means +/- SDs and the maximum concentrations of dioxin (expressed in TEQ) and PCB observed per gram of fat in contaminated food were 170. 3 +/- 487. 7 pg, 2613. 4 pg, 240. 7 +/- 2036. 9 ng, and 51059. 0 ng in chicken; 1. 9 +/- 0. 8 pg, 4. 3 pg, 34. 2 +/- 30. 5 ng, and 314. 0 ng in milk; and 32. 0 +/- 104. 4 pg, 713. 3 pg, 392. 7 +/- 2883. 5 ng, and 46000. 0 ng in eggs. Assuming that as a consequence of this incident between 10 and 15 kg PCBs and from 200 to 300 mg dioxins were ingested by 10 million Belgians, the mean intake per kilogram of body weight is calculated to maximally 25, 000 ng PCBs and 500 pg international TEQ dioxins. Estimates of the total number of cancers resulting from this incident range between 40 and 8, 000. Neurotoxic and behavioral effects in neonates are also to be expected but cannot be quantified. Because food items differed widely (more than 50 -fold) in the ratio of PCBs to dioxins, other significant sources of contamination and a high background contamination are likely to contribute substantially to the exposure of the Belgian population. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPolychlorinated <b>dibenzodioxins</b> (PCDDs) and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofuranes (PCDFs) are {{types of}} {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) {{with a wide range}} of toxic responses and carcinogenic properties.

The aim of this paper is to assess the <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzodioxins</b> and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofuranes emissions from steelmaking in the electric arc furnace in order to improve the gaseous emissions management. The analyses of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzodioxins</b> and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofuranes was performed using a high resolution gas chromatograph/high resolution mass spectrometer (HRGC/HRMS). After evaluating the pollution levels of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzodioxins</b> and dibenzofuranes during steelmaking it results that: the total PCDDs and PCDFs concentrations in the stack flue gases was 0. 9886 ng/Nm 3; in the composition of flue gases predominates the following compounds: tetrachloro dibenzofuran (TCDF) 40. 55 %, pentachloro dibenzofuran (PeCDF) 19. 4 %, tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 12. 5 %, pentachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD) 10. 7 % and hexachloro dibenzofuran (HxCDF) 10. 5 %; the calculated total value of Toxic Equivalent Quantity (Total TEQ) is 0. 326482 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3; the level of PCDD and PCDF concentrations depends on the plastic (such as polyvinylchloride) content of material input.
