40|$|This article {{considers}} from an Australian perspective the impediments that {{copyright law}} {{places in the}} path of those who seek to use <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> and non-patent prior art documents in ways that are necessary to the proper functioning of the patent system. Until recently, copyright law in Australia had limited the uses to which members of the public could put <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> in that country. Those impediments have been removed {{as a result of an}} important legislative change to the way in which copyright in <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> can be enforced. The change gives the public a greater freedom to make use of <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> than it enjoyed before, and removes unwarranted restrictions upon the ways in which the public can reuse valuable information. However, what the amendment does not address is the impediments copyright imposes on using non-patent prior art documents in ways that advance the public interes...|$|R
5000|$|A patent {{application}} is a request pending at a patent {{office for the}} {{grant of a patent}} for the invention described and claimed by that application. An application consists of a description of the invention (the <b>patent</b> <b>specification),</b> together with official forms and correspondence relating to the application. The term {{patent application}} is also used to refer to the process of applying for a patent, or to the <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> itself (i.e. the content of the document filed with a view to initiating the process of applying for a patent [...] ).|$|E
50|$|In Canada, every patent {{application}} must include the “specification”. The <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> has three parts: the disclosure, the claims, and the abstract. The {{contents of the}} specification are crucial in patent litigation.|$|E
50|$|The Frost Airship Glider was an {{aircraft}} designed and constructed in Wales during the mid-1890s by William (Bill) Frost. According to the <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> 1894-20431 issued in London, the craft was simply called 'A Flying Machine'.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{information}} density. According to the <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> {{the spot}} diameter is around 10 micrometres. Thus, the areal information density is, {{according to the}} <b>patent</b> <b>specifications,</b> around a factor hundred {{less than that of}} a regular CD. This amounts to a capacity of 5 Mbytes for a disc of 12 cm diameter. The inevitable downside to this is that Russell’s disc offers playing time less than one minute of digital CD sound. In case we have digital video at 30 Mbit/s, as claimed above, Russell’s disc would be read in less than two seconds. How such extremely fast scanning could be implemented was not disclosed.|$|R

40|$|Patent corpus {{processing}} {{should be}} cen-tered around patent claim processing be-cause claims {{are the most}} important part in <b>patent</b> <b>specifications.</b> It is common that claims written in Japanese are described in one sentence with peculiar style and word-ing and are difficult to understand for ordi-nary people. The peculiarity is caused by structural complexity of the sentences and many difficult terms used in the descrip-tion. We have already proposed a frame-work to represent the structure of patent claims and a method to automatically an-alyze it. We are currently investigating a method to clarify terms in patent claims and to find the explanatory portions from the detailed description part of the <b>patent</b> <b>specifications.</b> Through both approaches, we believe we can improve readability of patent claims. ...|$|R

Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1332 (2006). The principal question in that case was {{the extent to which a}} court should resort to the <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> in seeking to ascertain the proper scope of its claims. The conclusion was that claims should definitely be read in the context of the specification. In passing, the court cited Bates v Coe 98 US 31, 38 (1878), but otherwise does not focus on the intent of a Patentee, as discernible from a <b>patent</b> <b>specification.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{reviews the}} history of the {{development}} of the Patent Information Network in the U. K. Free distribution of <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> and other <b>patent</b> publications to libraries, Mechanics Institute and learned societies was begun by the Patent Office in 1854 and the service was greatly improved by the distribution of abridgments of British <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> starting in 1883. After the formation of the British Library in 1974 it took over the distribution of patent literature to public libraries, and in 1980 established the Patents Information Network (PIN) comprising the Science Reference Library as the hub and 26 provincial public libraries. This system was reviewed in 1985 - 1987, resulting in the elimination of seven smaller libraries from the network and the strengthening of the remaining smaller collections. ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are over}} 50 million <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> from 40 {{countries}} {{in a collection}} dating back to 1855.

This is available in hard copy and via online databases.|$|R
50|$|Chemical Abstracts is a {{periodical}} index that provides summaries and indexes of disclosures in recently published scientific documents. Approximately 8,000 journals, technical reports, dissertations, conference proceedings, and new books, {{in any of}} 50 languages, are monitored yearly, as are <b>patent</b> <b>specifications</b> from 27 countries and two international organizations. Chemical Abstracts ceased print publication on January 1, 2010.|$|R
50|$|The {{claims of}} a <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> define {{the scope of}} {{protection}} of a patent granted by the patent. The claims describe the invention in a specific legal style, setting out the essential features of the invention in a manner to clearly define what would infringe the patent. Claims are often amended during prosecution to narrow or expand their scope.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the patent}} {{law in the}} United States, the <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> must be {{complete}} enough so that a person of [...] "ordinary skill in the art" [...] of the invention can make and use the invention without “undue experimentation". There is no precise definition of [...] "undue experimentation". The standard is determined based {{on the art of}} the invention.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, if a {{claim is}} {{intended}} to cover products or processes which involve {{the use of technology}} unknown at the time the claim was drafted, then the <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> and claims based thereon should be drafted so that a person skilled in the art would understand the description in a way which was sufficiently general to include the new technology.|$|E
50|$|Zincography was a planographic {{printing}} process that used zinc plates. Alois Senefelder first mentioned zinc's lithographic {{use as a}} substitute for Bavarian limestone in his 1801 English <b>patent</b> <b>specifications.</b> In 1834, Federico Lacelli patented a zincographic printing process, producing large maps called géoramas.

5000|$|My Lords, a <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> is a {{unilateral}} {{statement by the}} patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those {{likely to have a}} practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. [...] "skilled in the art"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is called [...] "pith and marrow" [...] of the claim. A <b>patent</b> <b>specification</b> should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.|$|E
50|$|To {{obtain the}} grant of a patent, a person, either legal or natural, must file an {{application}} at a patent office with the jurisdiction to grant a patent in the geographic area over which coverage is required.
