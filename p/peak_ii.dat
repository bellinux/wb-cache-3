[3 H]Cytochalasin B-bound proteins were further isolated by using Sephadex G- 50 chromatography. The amount of [3 H]cytochalasin B associated with the membrane proteins was approximately 10 % of the total radioactivity in the octyl glucoside extract. The solubilized photoaffinity-labeled D-glucose transporter was isolated and found to consist of two major peaks by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The radioactivity of <b>peak</b> <b>II</b> was considerably {{greater than that of}} peak I. The incorporation of [3 H]cytochalasin B into both peaks was blocked by the presence of D-glucose during photolysis. With preparative NaDod-SO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the radioactivity of peak I could be released, but that of <b>peak</b> <b>II</b> remained with the D-glucose transporter.

After {{gel filtration}} of the extract on Sepharose CL- 6 B, two insulin-binding species (peak I and peak li) were obtained. The structure and binding properties of both peaks were characterized. Gel filtration yielded Stokes radii of 9. 2 nm (peak I) and 8. 0 nm (peak Il). Both peaks were glycoproteins. At 4 °C peak 1 showed optimal insulin binding at pH 8. 0 and high ionic strength. In contrast, peak li bad its binding optimum at pH 7. 0 and low ionic strength, where peak I bindingwas minimal. For peak I {{the change in}} insulin binding under different conditions of pH and ionic strength was due {{to a change in}} receptor affinity only. For peak 11 an additional change in receptor number was found. Both peaks yielded non-linear Scatchard plots under most of the buffer conditions examined. At their binding optima at 4 oc the high affinity dissociation constants were 0. 50 nM (peak I) and 0. 55 nM (<b>peak</b> <b>II).</b> Sodium dodecyl sulfatejpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of peak I revealed five receptor bands with Mr 400000, 365000, 320000, 290000, and 245000 under non-reducing conditions.

DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the cytosol of pachytene spermatocytes and round sperma-tids demonstrated the presence of two isoenzymcs of protein kinase eluting at 35 mM KCI (Peak I) and 170 mM KCI (<b>Peak</b> <b>II).</b> A selective decrease in the amount of Peak I could be observed with the progress of spermatid development, and <b>Peak</b> <b>II</b> was the major form present in elongating spermatids. <b>Peak</b> <b>II</b> isoenzyme was the most abundant form of protein kinase also in the soluble fraction of epididymal spermatozoa.
