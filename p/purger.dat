2500|$|Peter V. Verigin's son, Peter P. Verigin, {{who arrived}} from the Soviet Union in 1928, succeeded his father {{as leader of the}} Community Doukhobors. He became known as Peter the <b>Purger,</b> and worked to smooth the {{relations}} between the Community Doukhobors and the larger Canadian society. The governments in Ottawa and the western provinces decided he was the closet leader of the Sons of Freedom and was perhaps a dangerous Bolshevik. The decision was to try to deport him, a strategy to use the justice system to impose conformity to Canadian values among the Doukhobors and force them to abide by Canadian law and repudiate the un-Canadian practices. The deportation effort failed in 1933. [...] However Verigin's [...] policies were repudiated by the Sons of Freedom as ungodly and assimilationist. They escalated their protests. The Sons of Freedom would burn the Community Doukhobors' property, and organize more nude parades. The Canadian Parliament responded in 1932 by criminalizing public nudity. Over the years, over 300 radical Doukhobor men and women were arrested for this offense, which typically carried a three-year prison sentence.|$|E

50|$|Anti-Purgers, {{introduced}} in Anarchy and also shown in Election Year, oppose the Purge. They oppose the Purge {{on the night}} itself by sabotaging auctions by wealthy <b>Purgers</b> and murdering them and/or holding makeshift hospitals where they treat both <b>Purgers</b> and Purge victims, regardless of their crime and behavior. They also send out EMTs in ambulance vans to help injured <b>Purgers.</b> It is shown that many hospital workers volunteer in such makeshift hospitals (since emergency services are inactive during Purge Night).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Purgers</b> are {{the type}} of people who openly go {{on the streets and}} Purge.

5000|$|One {{year after}} the events of The Purge, in the year 2023, Dwayne is now the partner of Carmelo Johns, {{the leader of a}} {{successful}} anti-Purge resistance fighter group. He appears during one of the film's climaxes, wherein he and Carmelo lead the anti-Purge gang in storming a Purge arena to rescue the film's protagonists from wealthy <b>purgers</b> and their security forces. When Liz chooses to stay behind to avenge her husband Shane's death from the hands of the wealthy <b>Purgers</b> rather than join the group in their escape, Dwayne and Carmelo aid her while their team continues to eliminate the other wealthy <b>purgers</b> and their security group. Dwayne is first referred to as [...] "Dwayne" [...] during the events of The Purge: Anarchy.|$|R
50|$|As such, {{society is}} divided {{about the idea}} of The Purge. While some support The Purge purely for {{economic}} reasons and are not <b>Purgers</b> themselves, there is significant support from <b>Purgers,</b> who use the opportunity as much as they can. Beyond those who do not actively support the Purge for ethical reasons, there are also hardline activists who oppose the Purge and are vocal about it. This was shown in Anarchy and Election Year.|$|R
50|$|It {{is shown}} that {{the leaders of the}} NFFA {{government}} are <b>Purgers</b> themselves who kidnap people from their homes and Purge them in their own private area (Election Year). Wealthy people are seen to arrange contracts with victims before the Purge, agreeing to compensate the victim's family in return for a controlled kill. Other wealthy individuals have auctions, collaborating with hunting groups who kidnap people from the streets for money and bring them to a private area where wealthy <b>Purgers</b> hunt them in a private hunting ground.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Purgers</b> {{pursuing}} him descend {{upon the}} house. Their leader compliments {{the family for}} the support of the annual carnage but sadistically warns James that they would murder everyone in the household should they fail to surrender Dwayne. After James admits to his wife, Mary, that their security system only acts as a deterrent for invaders and will not totally protect them against a heavy invasion force, he and Mary try to find Dwayne, who has taken their daughter, Zoey, hostage out of fear. They overpower Dwayne, tie him up, and aggravate his injuries. After seeing James with Zoey, Dwayne sadly tells James to take him outside, to which the latter hesitates after he and his family realize they are becoming essentially no different from the <b>purgers</b> outside. The Sandins instead spare Dwayne, leaving him bound, and prepare to defend themselves from the gang. After the gang breaks into the household, the Sandins fight them. James is mortally wounded by the gang leader, who is then killed by Zoey while the Sandins' neighbors, the Ferrins arrive to eliminate the other <b>purgers.</b> During the invasion, Dwayne frees himself of his bonds and decides to help the Sandins.|$|R

50|$|<b>Purger</b> & Co. was a German {{printing}} house, {{based at}} Mozartstraße 13, Munich, Germany. The {{founder of the}} company was most probably named Adolf <b>Purger.</b> The company was known for the coloured postcards it produced {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. The postcards were printed in three colour chromolithography, a system called photochrome, with the indication Photochromiekarte. The company was printing not only postcards for their own account, but also for other companies, as was probably the case of the colour postcards of the Krikelli's series of Tinos, Greece.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{inform the}} {{classification}} of bulimic-type eating disorders, the correlates of purging and non-purging methods of weight control were examined in a large community sample of young adult women reporting recurrent episodes of binge eating. Method: Scores on self-report measures of eating disorder psychopathology, functional impairment and health-service utilization were compared among individuals who reported (recurrent episodes of binge eating and) the use of either purging (self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic misuse; n = 41) or non-purging (extreme dietary restriction, excessive exercise, or use of diet pills; n = 62) methods of weight control. Individuals who reported recurrent binge eating {{in the absence of}} extreme weight control behaviours (n = 442) were also included in the analysis. Results: Non-purgers tended to be younger and heavier and have higher levels of eating disorder psychopathology and functional impairment than <b>purgers</b> and non-compensating binge eaters, however these differences were not statistically significant. <b>Purgers</b> were more likely than non-purgers to have sought treatment specifically for a problem with eating, however this difference was no longer significant after age and body mass index were statistically controlled. In multivariate analysis, frequency of extreme dietary restriction was the best predictor of functional impairment. Conclusions: These findings call into question the validity of subtyping of bulimia nervosa into purging and non-purging forms as outlined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders...|$|R

The current investigation combined two areas of research literature, restrained eating and body image distortion. The restraint paradigm {{used in the present study}} involved examining the effects of a milkshake preload upon body image distortion. Sixty subjects were selected from a pool of 1017 female introductory college students on the basis of their scores on Smith and Thelen's 1984 Bulimia Test and assigned to one of four experimental conditions: <b>Purgers,</b> non-purgers, at-risk, and comparison subjects. Subjects participated in two experimental sessions. Body image distortion was measured during each session using Ruff and Barrios' 1986 body image detection device. Subjects were asked to estimate the width of five body regions: face, chest, waist, hips, and thighs. Subjects were asked to drink a 293 -gm chocolate milkshake prior to assessment of body image during the second session. It was hypothesized that body image would become more distorted following the ingestion of the milkshake, especially for the more symptomatic subjects. The results of this study did not support the hypothesized relationship between body image distortion and bulimic symptomatology. There were no significant differences among the groups in their ability to estimate any of the five body widths. All groups overestimated body width. In addition, body image distortion was reduced following ingestion of the milkshake, with all groups becoming more accurate from session one to session two, although this difference was not significant for the <b>purgers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|After {{the events}} of Closer, Colonel Bismarck, deprogrammed by an {{explosion}} during {{the attack on the}} Bank of England, decides to help defeat the Styx, and joins Will and Drake at Parry's estate. Drake introduces Will and Chester to three retired commandos living at Parry's estate: [...] "Sparks" [...] Sweeney, who was surgically altered to have enhanced senses and faster reaction times, Danforth, a genius who worked in defense electronics, and Jiggs, who is very good at hiding. Will also meets Parry's gardener, Old Wilkie, and his granddaughter Stephanie. The people of the estate watch for Styx presence, and eliminate the Dark Light conditioning {{with the help of a}} device known as the <b>Purger,</b> invented by Danforth. The <b>Purger</b> causes a Darklit person to repeat part of their programming, and Elliott, who is able to speak Styx, finds that Chester has been programmed to call the Styx and report their location. Bartleby and Colly, the Hunters, are engaged in a hunt near the estate, when they encounter two of the Styx soldiers called Limiters spying on the manor. The Limiters wound Colly, and kill Bartleby. Will and the group decide to leave when Mrs. Burrows detects Limiters entering the estate. They escape, only to be cornered by Eddie the Styx, who reveals that the Limiters, rogues like him, are under his control, he was the one Chester was reporting to, and that he saved Emily Rawls, Chester's mother, from being used as a terrorist by the Styx. After much hesitation and discussion he decides he must tell them of the Phase. Meanwhile, in the Colony, the Second Officer begins to worry, as the Styx are neglecting the Colonists to focus on their Topsoil plans. Many people have been moved to an unruly and violent shantytown in the North Cavern to make room for the New Germanian army, and people are disappearing. Topsoil, various terrorist attacks are made by Darklit people who have had bombs surgically implanted within them, and these [...] "human bombs" [...] kill foreign politicians to stir up hatred of Britain. At a factory bought by the Old Styx, the Rebecca Twins have brought several hundred humans and Darklit them to render them brain-dead, perfect hosts for the Phase. They have also brought the Styx's females, who are undergoing part of the Styx's life cycle called the Phase. The Styx are revealed to be an insect species with a unique trait: at infrequent intervals (hundreds or thousands of years apart), the Styx women grow a pair of insect limbs and a mosquito-like ovipositor, used to insert egg sacs into human hosts. From each egg sac, thirty Styx larvae hatch and eat the host from the inside, also absorbing the host's genetic code, explaining why the Styx so closely mimic humans. Styx females who haven't gone through puberty, such as the Rebecca Twins, only experience back pain and minor bleeding where the insect limbs would grow if they were old enough to join in the Phase. Eddie also reveals that in the event the Warrior Class was killed, the Armagi would be released. The Armagi are capable of adapting to all environments, with three legs on land, fins and gills for water, or wings for air. The most horrifying aspect is that they can regenerate their entire body from just a single cell, making them nearly impossible to kill. Upon learning this, Drake and them decide they must take action. They set up headquarters in a military base known as the Complex, bomb shelter for the UK High Command dating back to the Great War. As a newscast reveals, strong anger has arisen worldwide over the human bomb attacks originating from Britain, and the United States and other countries cut off their connections to Britain, which closes its borders and puts itself under martial law. Underground, the Styx abandon the Colony and seal the exits after evacuating the people of the shantytown to use as hosts for the Phase.
