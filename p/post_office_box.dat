25|$|Official {{addressing}} protocol is for {{the address}} to be in block letters, using a fixed-pitch typeface (such as Courier). The first line(s) of the address contain(s) the personal name and internal address of the recipient.

The last line consists of the legal place name, a single space, the two-letter province abbreviation, two full spaces, and then the postal code.

25|$|From 1987 to 1993 Robinson was incarcerated, {{first in}} Kansas (1987–91) on {{multiple}} fraud convictions and thereafter in Missouri for another fraud conviction and parole violations. At Western Missouri Correctional Facility he met 49-year-old Beverly Bonner, the prison librarian, who upon his release left {{her husband and}} moved to Kansas to work for him. After Robinson arranged for Bonner's alimony checks to be forwarded to a Kansas <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box,</b> her family never heard from her again. For several years Bonner's mother continued forwarding her alimony checks, and Robinson continued cashing them.|$|E
25|$|Gabrion is {{a suspect}} in the disappearances of several other people. The house where he was living when Rachel's body was found was owned by a man named Robert Allen. Allen was a mentally {{disabled}} transient and had been receiving social security when he went missing in 1995. Gabrion cashed Allen's checks and lived in his home until 1997. His impersonation of Allen led authorities to him following Rachel's murder when he opened a <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box</b> in Allen's name and directed that his social security check be sent there. Gabrion was convicted of social security fraud in July 1998 for his use of Allen's checks and sentenced to five years in federal prison.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{story is}} that Sir Charles Moses, General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and {{personal}} friend of Bradman asked that Bradman's Test batting average be immortalised as the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box</b> number of the ABC. The ABC's mailing address in every capital city of Australia is PO Box 9994. There is some debate about whether the story is true, but ABC sports host Karen Tighe confirms that the number was in fact chosen in honour of Bradman, and the claim is also supported by Alan Eason in his book The A–Z of Bradman. However, the broadcaster was not assigned the box number until after Moses's successor, Sir Talbot Duckmanton, had retired. The ABC's national toll-free telephone number is 13 9994.|$|E

50|$|Some {{customers}} {{choose to}} use <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>boxes</b> for an additional fee, for privacy or convenience.

Customers in less densely populated areas where there is no city delivery and who do not qualify for rural delivery may receive mail only through <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>boxes.</b> High-volume business customers can also arrange for special pick-up.|$|R
25|$|First of all, {{a letter}} was {{leaked to the}} press which was signed by the Supreme Patriarch (head of the Thai monastic community). This implied that Luang Por Dhammajayo had to disrobe because he had not {{transferred}} donated land back to the temple. A warning had preceded this letter, which government officials said {{had not yet been}} forwarded to the Sangha Council and Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The statement had a great impact. In response, the Religious Affairs Department pressed criminal charges of embezzlement against the abbot and a close aide. The temple stated that, being subject to a criminal lawsuit, the abbot would no longer transfer the land, because this might be interpreted as acceptance of guilt. Wat Phra Dhammakaya and the Sangha Council requested the department to wait until the monastic trials were finished first, but it continued the lawsuit anyway. Moreover, the department set up a public help-desk and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box</b> to receive complaints about the temple. With the resulting witness accounts, more charges were laid against Luang Por Dhammajayo. In the process of these investigations, the main politicians responsible, that is the Minister and Deputy Minister of Education, were both replaced, with the new Minister Somsak Prissanananthakul assuming {{a key role in the}} judicial processes against the abbot.|$|E

500|$|Keynsham rose to fame {{during the}} late 1950s and early 1960s when it {{featured}} in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw betting system. To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box,</b> and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning [...] "Keynsham– spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M– Keynsham, Bristol".

500|$|A {{series of}} ticket-related scandals plagued the {{organizing}} committee as the Games approached, resulting in widespread public anger. Demand for tickets was high, {{particularly for the}} premier events which had sold out a year in advance. [...] Residents had been promised that only 10 percent of tickets would go to [...] "Olympic insiders", IOC officials and sponsors, but OCO'88 was later forced to admit that up to 50 percent of seats to top events had gone to insiders. The organizing committee, which was subsequently chastised by mayor Klein for running a [...] "closed shop", admitted that it had failed to properly communicate the obligations it had to supply IOC officials and sponsors with priority tickets. [...] These events were preceded by OCO'88's ticketing manager being charged with theft and fraud after he sent modified ticket request forms to Americans that asked them to pay in United States funds rather than Canadian and to return them to his company's <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box</b> rather {{than that of the}} organizing committee.|$|E
500|$|After obtaining guns {{the conspirators}} {{returned}} to Portland, Oregon. They rented out {{an apartment in}} Portland to serve as their base {{of operations for the}} assassination of Turner. Rajneesh follower Carol Matthews (Ma Prem Samadhi) attempted to obtain the home address of Charles Turner, as she was doing research on him and his work in order to find another way of relating to his animosity toward the commune. According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college yearbook of Turner's, and learned his car's license plate number and his parking location. Court records state that Matthews and an unindicted co-conspirator told officials they were conducting [...] "a voter survey", in order to obtain Turner's route number and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>box</b> number. The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service, but the postal officials did not give them Turner's address. They then drove around Turner's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said [...] "Turner". Matthews had pictures of Turner's residence developed; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during an investigation of the Rajneesh commune, and verified after being shown to Turner. The whole process was done in order to try and meet with him to interview and determine what his concerns were, as he refused to meet with anyone at his office.|$|E
