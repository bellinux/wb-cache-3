40|$|Research PaperThe optimal {{management}} of many common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> (CPRs) requires {{the establishment of}} optimal aggregate extraction rates {{as well as the}} spatial distribution of those extraction rates. The importance of these two components is readily evident in fisheries management where the spatial behavior of other agents often affects another agent's return in a different location, thereby inducing a spatial externality. This research experimentally investigates the behavior of agents within such an environment to determine how the structure of the spatial externality influences subject, as well as group, behavior in a spatially linked common <b>pool</b> <b>resource.</b> This research expands the traditional common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> (CPR) game popularized by the work of Walker et al. (1990) to incorporate spatial structure with two spatially linked common <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> Subjects participated in a 5 -player common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> game, under three alternative spatial structures (non-spatial, bidirectional and unidirectional linkages), within the experiment. Results indicate that behavior in the unidirectional common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> game yielded the highest average net yields {{as a percentage of the}} social optimum return, whereas those in the bidirectional and non-spatial game yielded comparable returns. However, the investment patterns in the unidirectional game were not proportionally linked to the spatial structure present. Investments in the sink CPR were proportionally lower than those in the source, relative to the social optimum. This highlights the importance of understanding the spatial structure present within our natural resources...|$|R

This article, through a preliminary literature review, contemplates to explore and compare the management regimes of the common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> at different scale, i. e. those under the “common heritage of mankind” and those under the domestic “common pool resources” management regime.

40|$|Common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> such as rangeland, forests, fallow fields, {{and ponds}} provide {{an array of}} social and {{economic}} benefits {{for a wide variety of}} users in semi-arid West Africa. However, poor definition and enforcement of the institutional arrangements governing the use of these resources sometimes lead to social conflicts and resource degradation. This problem arises partly due to the multiple functions and temporal variability of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> and partly due to the heterogeneity and overlapping rights of users. These features and increasing concerns about the future productive capacity of the natural resource base raise important questions concerning the choice of institutions most likely to promote sustainable management of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> This paper presents evidence from field studies on the current status, use and management of multi-product, common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> in semi-arid West Africa. The evidence suggests that the large number of heterogenous users and the multiple functions of these resources permit an intensive use of land and serve to minimize production risk.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> through collective action {{is dependent upon}} {{the efforts of the}} resources users to establish an identity that is held collectively. It is widely accepted that the term common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> implies a resource that is common to a ‘pool’ of people, the resource users. Their interests in the resource connect users and potential users, and we propose that the more strongly they identify with the resources and commit to act collectively, the stronger the collective action. Achieving sustainable use of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> is thus determined by the interplay between collective identity and collective action. But collective identity as defined by the resource and its users is dynamic, making the identity vulnerable in directing the behaviour of users. In this paper, we draw on collective identity and resilience theories to develop a framework for exploring the role of collective identity in understanding collective action in the {{management of}} common <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> We suggest that two key attributes of collective identity – identification and affective commitment, provide the premise for interpreting, tracking and directing change in collective identity. We interpret how the interactions between the two attributes contribute to resilience of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> as complex social-ecological systems. </span...|$|R

We examine one of the few globally important fisheries that is held to be sustainable, the Peruvian anchovy fishery, and considers the extent to which the institutional characteristics of the fishery conform to design principles that are considered prerequisites for long-term, successful, community-based common <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> Results showed that greater conformity to the principles was found in the sustainable phase of the fishery, compared to its unsustainable phase. For this case study, the conditions that supported the transition towards sustainability were: clearly defined resource boundaries, monitoring of rule enforcement, and conflict resolution mechanisms among users and management authorities. On the other hand, clearly defined user boundaries, collective choice arrangements, and nested enterprises were not required to achieve sustainability. The study concludes that the design principles are a valuable tool for analysis and understanding of large-scale common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> systems. At the same time it suggests that the application of the principles to a wider range of systems can generate new insights into what is required for successful management of common <b>pool</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R

The social dilemma that is considered, is the so called Common <b>Pool</b> <b>Resource</b> (CPR) game, in which individuals make investment decisions which have negative externalities. After each investment decision, subjects have two rounds in which they can reward each other. We find that adding two stages of rewarding promotes cooperation in the common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> only marginally. The addition of two stages of rewards triggers beliefs about the evolution of the game. These beliefs are then reinforced by the rewarding behavior. Subjects use the investment stage as a way to seek group members which whom they will exchange reward tokens in both stage 2 and stage 3. The influence of stage 1 on stage 2 is significant and prevalent. However, the influence of stage 1 on stage 3 is much smaller. Stage 3 rewards are mainly influenced by stage 2 rewards.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} and {{illustrates the}} potential of intelligent agent based modeling and simulation {{as a tool for}} understanding individual action and group performance in common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> dilemmas. Three groups of models were developed, based on previously documented common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experiments, and simulated using the Swarm multi-agent simulation environment.

The three groups of models are differentiated by the capabilities of the appropriator agents and address; preassigned fixed strategies with no communication, a simple induction based approach to selecting amongst alternative strategies with no communication, and the induction based approach with two simple communication routines. Simulations of these three groups of models rendered observations of some potential relationships between individual action and group performance in common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experimental situations. In particular, simulations of agents employing the induction based approach with no-communication generated group level behavior with similar performance characteristics to groups in actual experiments.
