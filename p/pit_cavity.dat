40|$|It {{has been}} claimed by many {{investigators}} {{that there is}} protoplasmic continuity between adjacent ceils in certain botanical forms (3). Characteristic of the organisms which have been claimed to exhibit such connections is the red marine alga C-riffithsia globulifera.

Other authors have suggested that the intercellular <b>pit</b> <b>cavities</b> are closed by a delicate membrane which permits an easier passage of substances from cell to cell, but that unbroken connections are not to be found (2). All such previous studies have been entirely of a morphological nature and were based on microscopic and histological findings.

30|$|Dredging {{granular}} soils is also {{a source}} of subsidence, specifically around Qods (i.e. northern parts of both plains). Similar to the clay <b>pits,</b> <b>cavities</b> generated by dredging affect aqueduct recharge pattern, lower water table, and eventually lead to ground subsidence. Dredging gravel and sand from rivers {{in the area for}} use in construction has resulted in removing the permeable layer and consequently lower water penetration and aquifer recharge. Thus, aquifer recharge from Kan River has reduced significantly causing lower groundwater elevation. These extractions often continue upon total removal of granular layers and reaching clay layers. Groundwater changes maps reveal that Kan and Karaj rivers have experienced relative water rise, while water table drop was measured in surrounding lands. This reduction proves the decline in aquifer recharge from these rivers.|$|R

40|$|Summary. This {{histological}} {{study of}} the human ductus epididymidis in autopsy or surgical specimens revealed the presence of multiple intra-epithelial <b>cavities</b> or <b>pits</b> showing a variable degree of development. In their origin, cavities were surrounded by cells with the same staining affinity and ultrastructural features as the principal cells, except for the cavity basal surfaces that were supported by lower cells. The latter cells, although otherwise like the basal cells of the ductus epididymidis, displayed short micro-villi in the cavity lumen. When the cavities expanded the basal cells became principal cells, while the principal cells located {{at the top of}} the <b>cavities</b> degenerated, creating <b>pits</b> that opened into the lumen of the ductus epididymidis. The surface occupied by the pitted areas increased progressively between the end portion of the caput epididymidis and the corpus=n-, where it decreased abruptly. This pitted pattern was observed in all the normal adult men studied and in the children with precocious puberty but not in the normal children or in the adult men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.

X. hydrophilus closely resembles X. pilipes, from which it can be distinguished by the absence of fringes of setae on the second to fifth pairs of pereiopods (walking legs). Other key identification features are that the second to fourthth pairs of antero-lateral lobes are separated from each other by an inward pointing, wide and shallow depression, the postero-lateral margins of the carapace are bristly and the inner surfaces of the propodus has a broad, longitudinal <b>pitted</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|R

40|$|Pits form a major pathway for liquid fl ow in wood. In conifers, such as radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), pits between axial tracheids {{are highly}} {{specialised}} structures, with cell walls overarching a membrane. The membrane {{consists of a}} central impervious torus, which is suspended in the <b>pit</b> <b>cavity</b> by a highly porous margo. The bordered pits in radiata pine become aspirated during drying of timber, a condition where the torus becomes lodged against the pit aperture and seals it, thus infl uencing timber permeability / penetrability. To enhance timber treatability we have employed an environmentally compatible biological process to remove pit membranes, thus facilitating greater fl ow of applied wood property enhancing solutions through pits. The biological modifi cation process we employed involved placing freshly sawn radiata pine boards in water in plastic troughs in a glasshouse, and keeping them submerged for periods suffi cient for the natural bacterial microfl ora to colonise wood and destroy pit membranes. The boards {{were removed from the}} troughs after 2 - 12 weeks and examined by a range of microscopy techniques, including fl uorescence confocal microscopy, fi eld emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which provided evidence of bacterial colonisation of pit membranes and pit membrane destruction.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} pressure difference (DeltaP) on intervessel pit membrane porosity was studied in two angiosperm tree species with differing pit architecture. Fraxinus americana L. possesses typical angiosperm bordered pit structure while Sophora japonica L. exhibits well-developed vestures in intervessel pit chambers. It was hypothesized (a) that large DeltaP across intervessel pits {{would cause the}} deflection of pit membranes in the stems of F. americana resulting in significant increases in porosity and thus lower cavitation thresholds, and (b) {{that the presence of}} vestures would prevent the deflection of pit membranes in S. japonica. To determine if the porosity of pit membranes increased under mechanical stress, suspensions of colloidal gold, 5 nm and 20 nm in diameter, were perfused across intervessel pit membranes at DeltaP ranging from 0. 25 MPa to 6. 0 MPa. The effect of increasing DeltaP on membrane porosity was also tested by comparing air seeding thresholds (P-a) in stems perfused with water or a solution with lower surface tension. Air seeding and colloidal gold experiments indicated that pit membrane porosity increased significantly with DeltaP in F. americana. In S. japonica, increases in permeability to colloidal gold with DeltaP were small and maximum pore diameters predicted from P-a were independent of DeltaP, suggesting that vestures limited {{the degree to which the}} membrane can be deflected from the centre of the <b>pit</b> <b>cavity.</b> This provides the first experimental evidence that vestures reduce the probability of air seeding through pit membranes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Pit {{propagation}} in {{stainless steels}} under electrochemical control was investigated using in situ synchrotron X-ray microtomography, {{which was used}} {{to confirm that the}} lacy covers commonly found for pits in stainless steels grow through perforation of the metal surface by upward growth of rapidly dissolving lobes from the main pit. In situ synchrotron X-ray radiography has been used to observe the evolution of 2 D pits growing at the edge of stainless steel foils under electrochemical control in chloride solutions. Pit growth shape, kinetics and stability under current and potential control at various bulk chloride concentrations have been studied. It was found that the pit depth tends to grow under diffusion control, whereas lateral development is influenced by solution conductivity. The impact of the perforated cover on the pit growth and stability was examined and its formation was found to be similar to the observations from 3 D by X-ray microtomography. A method for extracting the key dissolution kinetic parameters from radiographs has been developed. The local anodic current density along the boundary of a pit was directly measured from the rate of advance of the pit into the metal. Then the local metal ion concentration and potential drop inside the <b>pit</b> <b>cavity</b> was back-calculated using transport equations and the requirement to maintain charge neutrality, establishing the relationship between local current density, interfacial potential and metal ion concentration in the solution.

Results of these tests indicate that pMMA does not influence, especially reduce, the hydrophyllic nature of the cell wall substantially. The considerable reduction of swelling in radial and tangential direction of solid wood-plastic test pieces must be ascribed to mechanical hindrance by the polymer, in which the presence of non-aspirated bordered pit pairs must play a very important role.

Alternative {{materials such}} as Nb 3 Sn and MgB 2 are predicted to have significant higher fields and are very interesting for next generation srf cavities. A high field and high sensitivity sample host cavity will be an ideal tool for studying various field-dependent loss phenomena and to explore the ultimate performance of these new types of rf superconductors. In this thesis, I will present my developments of two TE-type sample host niobium cavity systems which recently have reached among the highest magnetic field ever achieved (~ 60 mT) on the sample surface with nΩ sensitivity in rf surface resistance. The rf design, fabrication, surface treatments, input coupler development and rf testing results both with baseline niobium and with a Nb 3 Sn sample plate will be presented in detail.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Further {{details of this}} conference can be found at: [URL] of the ways of damping {{resonant}} vibrations of engineering structures or their components is to reduce reflections of bending waves from their free edges. A new efficient method of reducing edge reflections proposed by the present author is based on using specially designed plates or bars of variable thickness in combination with strips of thin absorbing layers placed at the edges. Such plates or bars utilise gradual change in their thickness from the value corresponding to {{the thickness of the}} basic plate or bar to almost zero. If to use some specific power-law profiles for these plates or bars then they would ideally provide zero reflection of bending waves from their sharp edges {{even in the absence of}} the absorbing layers at the edges, thus materialising the so-called ‘acoustic black holes’ for bending waves. In the present paper, this effect is considered for one-dimensional and two-dimensional acoustic black holes. In the latter case black holes are materialised by cylindrically symmetrical <b>pits</b> (<b>cavities)</b> of powerlaw profile nearly protruding through the bottom of the plate. Geometrical acoustics (ray tracing) theory for plate bending wave propagation in the vicinity of one- and two-dimensional acoustic black holes is considered, including definition of ray trajectories and calculation of the reflection coefficients. Finally, we discuss possible practical applications of the abovementioned one- and two-dimensional black holes for damping structural vibrations...|$|R

Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all fiber-tracheids with <b>pit</b> <b>cavities</b> 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial parenchyma vasicentric scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in uniseriate rays and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; vasicentric tracheids transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays.

There were many similarities in colonization by all pathogens. Hyphae were normally {{in close proximity to}} vessel walls and aligned approximately parallel to the long axes ofvessels. Vessel to vessel colonization was uncommon but occasionally occurred by penetration of intertracheary pit membranes. Pit penetration was achieved by constricted hyphae and localized membrane degradation. Penetration of xylem parenchyma pit membranes was not observed in either host but colonization of xylem parenchyma cells occurred early in disease development in pea but only when the host plant was moribund in tomato. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and V. albo-atrum caused extensive erosion of tomato vessel secondary walls, both where hyphae were in direct contact with walls and in areas remote from invading hyphae. Penetration of secondary walls was common but its extent was limited by the primary wall/middle lamella. There was little secondary wall erosion in pea although the primary wall/middle lamella of pit fields was often extensively degraded. Many vessel and xylem parenchyma cell secondary walls in both species contained, irregular electron-opaque areas. Vessel walls and colonizing hyphae were often coated in an amorphous electron-opaque material. The material occluded intertracheary and xylem parenchyma <b>pit</b> <b>cavities</b> and encrusted intertracheary pit membranes. Its appearance varied from smooth to rough and “bubbly”. A distinctive fibrillar coating was found much less frequently. Infection was accompanied by the gradual death of xylem parenchyma cells throughout infected plants. Xylem parenchyma cells adjacent to infected vessels often contained well developed “protective” layers. Some also contained wall appositions but their role was unclear. In young infected tomato plants xylem parenchyma cells apparently underwent uncontrolled division resulting in “whorls” of cells and crushing of vessels.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of pure copper, zinc {{and aluminum}} in selected commercial beverages was studied. Experiments were also {{conducted in the}} presence of citric and phosphoric acid to investigate their role in the corrosion process in these beverages. Two experimental approaches were used to investigate the corrosion behavior: a chemical method in which the dissolved metal concentration was measured after immersion of a sample in a beverage and an electrochemical method using the Tafel extrapolation technique. The metal surfaces were also examined by SEM/EDX after the immersion tests and electrochemical polarization. Among the important conclusions from this research are that the order in which the various beverages affect the corrosion rate as evaluated by Tafel extrapolation of the polarization curves did not agree with the order based on measurement of the dissolved metal concentration as determined by the immersion tests except when a 1 - day immersion test was used for Al. The dissolved Al, Zn and Cu concentrations obtained from short-term immersion tests differed from those measured in long-term tests, although the same ranking of the corrosiveness of the seven soft drinks was obtained after 1 - and 3 - day immersion tests. These discrepancies likely stem from the complicated dynamics of the corrosion of these metals and the various physical, chemical and electrochemical processes that take place in these beverages. No simple correlation was found between the beverage properties and composition and the dissolved copper, zinc and aluminum concentrations after immersion, whether based on short-term or long-term tests. However, the corrosion rate of copper in the 7 soft drinks as determined by the Tafel extrapolation method was found to depend on the pH. Uniform corrosion was observed in all iv cases except for Al immersed in Gatorade. <b>Pitting</b> <b>cavities</b> were observed on the surface of Al after both the 5 -day immersion test and Tafel polarization measurements.

50|$|Vesicular texture is a {{volcanic}} rock texture {{characterized by a}} rock being <b>pitted</b> with many <b>cavities</b> (known as vesicles) at its surface and inside. This texture is common in aphanitic, or glassy, igneous rocks {{that have come to}} the surface of the earth, a process known as extrusion. As magma rises to the surface the pressure on it decreases. When this happens gasses dissolved in the magma are able to come out of solution, forming gas bubbles (the cavities) inside it. When the magma finally reaches the surface as lava and cools, the rock solidifies around the gas bubbles and traps them inside, preserving them as holes filled with gas called vesicles.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{excavations}} {{carried out}} in Area HH at Tell Mardikh/Ebla identified a huge sacred area in use {{from the middle of}} the 3 rd millennium BC until the final destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city. The first building erected in this area in the Early Bronze IVA (2400 - 2300 BC) was the monumental Temple of the Rock, which was ritually sealed and abandoned at the beginning of the Early Bronze IVB (around 2300 - 2250 BC). Two of the <b>pits</b> inside the <b>cavity</b> in the cella of the Temple were found to have been filled with a large quantity of fine vessels, as part of a purification ritual carried out before their definitive sealing with superimposed courses of mud-brick. These provide the first coherent ceramic pottery assemblage for the initial stage of the EB IVB Period, and accordingly shed new light on the ceramic horizon of North-West Inner Syria during the last third of the 3 rd millennium BC...|$|R
