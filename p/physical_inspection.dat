5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a <b>physical</b> <b>inspection.</b> The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{attributed the}} C5's failure to problems with Sinclair's marketing strategy; {{only a year}} after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the Globe and Mail newspaper called it [...] "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry". Andrew P. Marks of Paisley College of Technology criticises Sinclair's marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a suburban road, and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be [...] "trying to grasp at two different markets" [...] but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks' view, as it meant that no <b>physical</b> <b>inspection</b> of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{practice}} that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was {{the practice of}} “wife-sharing”. [...] In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives. [...] Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man’s wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer. For this reason many considered Spartan women polygamous or polyandrous. [...] This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could. [...] The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss {{of the men in}} battle and the intense <b>physical</b> <b>inspection</b> of newborns.|$|E
40|$|Security {{concerns}} {{in a context}} of increasingly segmented supply chains have led to stricter border control measures, which may potentially negatively affect international trade. Customs around the world have therefore implemented security-motivated certification programs to facilitate licit trade. These programs offer trustworthy trading firms, i. e., Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs), several advantages in the administrative processing of their shipments including less frequent <b>physical</b> <b>inspections</b> and expedited customs clearance. In this study we focus on Mexico's AEO Program NEEC. In particular, we evaluate the impact of this program by primarily carrying out differences-in-differences estimations on highly disaggregated firm-level data that cover the entire universe of export and import transactions of the country over the period 2009 - 2014. Estimation results suggest that NEEC has been associated with less <b>physical</b> <b>inspections</b> and shorter clearance times and has thereby favored increased firms' exports. Effects seem to be stronger on the frequency of shipments and on consumer goods, industrial inputs, and capital goods...|$|R
40|$|Under {{spending}} {{for the maintenance}} of public facilities and infrastructure is a well-known issue. At least part of the problem can be attributed to our poor understanding of precisely what funding is required. Methodological limitations diminish the credibility of budget estimates that, for many agencies, are based on ad hoc approximations or historical trends. Estimates based on <b>physical</b> <b>inspections</b> are more defensible, but are expensive and more useful for defining remedial projects than estimating future budget requirements. Carefully defining facility restoration and modernization (R&M) requirements yields a collection of determinants—including obsolescence, changing uses, and extraordinary damage—closely related to the concept of economic depreciation. Once this link is made, the methods of economic capital theory are available for understanding R&M needs. More specifically, R&M costs can be estimated using depreciation rates, an approach useful for any large organization requiring credible R&M cost estimates, but unable to bear the costs of frequent <b>physical</b> <b>inspections...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Eunuch {{comes from}} the Greek word eunoukhos, first attested in a {{fragment}} of Hipponax, the 6th century BC comic poet and prolific inventor of compound words. The acerbic poet describes a certain lover of fine food having [...] "consumed his estate dining lavishly and at leisure every day on tuna and garlic-honey cheese paté like a Lampsacene eunoukhos". In ancient classical literature from the early 5th century BC onward, the word generally designates some incapacity for or abstention from procreation, whether due to natural constitution or to physical mutilation. For instance, Lucian suggests two methods to determine whether someone is a eunuch: <b>physical</b> <b>inspection</b> of the body, or scrutiny {{of his ability to}} perform sexually with females (Lucian, Eunuchus 12).|$|E
2500|$|Mutant Vehicles, often motorized, are {{purpose-built}} or creatively altered {{cars and}} trucks. Participants {{who wish to}} bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or [...] "Department of Mutant Vehicles" [...] for approval and for <b>physical</b> <b>inspection</b> {{at the time of}} the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted. The event organizers, and in turn the DMV, have set the bar higher for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and rejected. One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is [...] "can you recognize the base vehicle". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, it is considered to be [...] "decorated not mutated" [...] and is less likely to be approved. This criterion led to the exclusion of some [...] "Art Cars", [...] which historically have been a staple of the event. There were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2010.|$|E

40|$|ACME Wind Turbine Corporation has {{contacted}} our {{dynamic analysis}} firm regarding structural health monitoring of their wind turbine blades. ACME has had several failures in previous years. Examples {{are shown in}} Figure 1. These failures have resulted in economic loss for the company due to down time of the turbines (lost revenue) and repair costs. Blade failures can occur in several modes, which may depend {{on the type of}} construction and load history. Cracking and delamination are some typical modes of blade failure. ACME warranties its turbines and wishes to decrease the number of blade failures they have to repair and replace. The company wishes to implement a real time structural health monitoring system in order to better understand when blade replacement is necessary. Because of warranty costs incurred to date, ACME is interested in either changing the warranty period for the blades in question or predicting imminent failure before it occurs. ACME's current practice is {{to increase the number of}} <b>physical</b> <b>inspections</b> when blades are approaching the end of their fatigue lives. Implementation of an in situ monitoring system would eliminate or greatly reduce the need for such <b>physical</b> <b>inspections.</b> Another benefit of such a monitoring system is that the life of any given component could be extended since real conditions would be monitored. The SHM system designed for ACME must be able to operate while the wind turbine is in service. This means that wireless communication options will likely be implemented. Because blade failures occur due to cyclic stresses in the blade material, the sensing system will focus on monitoring strain at various points...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Regulation {{based on}} Continuous Control Monitoring {{could reduce the}} {{administrative}} burden for companies. Often, companies already have elaborate internal control and quality management systems. Instead of periodic <b>physical</b> <b>inspections,</b> regulatory supervision can partly be automated and performed on a continuous basis. The regulator gets access to a validated copy of key data elements from the company‟s internal information systems, which serve as indicator of compliance to specific control objectives. In this paper we describe an information architecture for continuous control monitoring, and show {{how it can be}} applied to supervision of regulatory compliance. The approach is illustrated by a pilot project in the Netherlands of applying continuous control monitoring to food safety regulations in the meat processing industry. Participants concluded that the approach is technically feasible but requires a different mindset towards regulation, and a clear business case...|$|R

Under REAC's sampling procedure, buildings and units do not always have the same chance of being included in the inspection sample. REAC officials told GAO that they were introducing new sampling procedures that would nearly equalize the chance that each property's dwelling units would be selected. The actions that HUD is proposing should address that. GAO's concerns about HUD's sampling procedures. ...|$|R
