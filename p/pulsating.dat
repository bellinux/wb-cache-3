5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by <b>pulsating</b> variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a <b>pulsating</b> appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. <b>Pulsating</b> stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases {{where they can}} become <b>pulsating</b> {{variable}}s. <b>Pulsating</b> variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E

50|$|Mira {{variables}} are mostly fundamental mode pulsators, while the semiregular and irregular variables on the asymptotic giant branch <b>pulsate</b> in the first, second, or third overtone. Many {{of the less}} regular LPVs <b>pulsate</b> {{in more than one}} mode.|$|R
5000|$|A small {{proportion}} of Cepheid variables have been observed to <b>pulsate</b> in two modes at the same time, usually the fundamental and first overtone, occasionally the second overtone.

5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are <b>pulsating</b> in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of irregularity. It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are <b>pulsating</b> red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group. Celtic played Inter Milan {{in the last}} 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3–3 at Parkhead from an early 0–2 deficit in a <b>pulsating</b> encounter, then losing 1–0 in Milan {{to go out on}} aggregate despite a highly credible performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} of this rare class is V361 Hydrae, a 15th magnitude subdwarf B star. They <b>pulsate</b> with periods {{of a few}} minutes and may simultaneous <b>pulsate</b> with multiple periods. They have amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude and are given the GCVS acronym RPHS. They are p-mode pulsators.|$|R
5000|$|TT Aql is a yellow-white supergiant {{around five}} {{thousand}} times {{brighter than the}} sun.

5|$|Pavo {{contains}} several {{variable stars}} of note. Lambda Pavonis {{is a bright}} irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the unaided eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or shell star, it is of spectral type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. Kappa Pavonis is a W Virginis variable—a subclass of Type II Cepheid. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white supergiant <b>pulsating</b> between spectral classes F5I-II and G5I-II. NU and V Pavonis are <b>pulsating</b> semiregular variable red giant stars. NU has a spectral type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a carbon star of spectral type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium in the Solar System {{was created}} through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (≈72%), {{but also by}} the r-process (≈28%). The r-process {{consists}} of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside <b>pulsating</b> red giant stars.|$|E
5|$|Early {{calculations}} {{suggested that}} there might be white dwarfs whose luminosity varied with a period of around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this., § 7.1.1; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, like that of the other <b>pulsating</b> variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial gravity wave pulsations., § 7. Known types of <b>pulsating</b> white dwarf include the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, including HL Tau 76, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA;, pp.891, 895 DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB;, p.3525 and GW Vir stars (sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars), with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs, but are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.|$|E

5000|$|SV Vulpeculae is {{a yellow}} bright supergiant around twenty {{thousand}} times as luminous as the sun, with a spectral type that varies from late F to early K.

5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by <b>pulsating</b> variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
5|$|Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of {{spectral}} type F1V {{and magnitude}} 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic {{changes in its}} spectrum over a three-day period, which suggests it is either a spectroscopic binary or (more likely) a <b>pulsating</b> Gamma Doradus-type variable. If the latter is the case, it {{is estimated to be}} 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer's atlas, it lies above the bird's beak.|$|E
5|$|New styles {{such as the}} Maguindanao’s kagungudan and the Maranao’s bago, are {{considered}} fast, rhythmic and showy. Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos {{with an emphasis on}} power and speed, are highly rhythmic and <b>pulsating,</b> and are highly improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used with old patterns. “Young” musicians, specifically young men, gravitate toward this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one’s individualism. Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.|$|E

5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a <b>pulsating</b> change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. <b>Pulsating</b> between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating <b>pulsating</b> beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

The {{following}} year, a fourth-placed league finish gave the club a berth in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The UEFA Cup had replaced the Fairs Cup in 1971, when control of the competition transferred to UEFA. City's debut in the competition was a short one. Drawn against a Valencia side managed by Alfredo Di Stéfano, City were bounced out in the 2nd leg at the Mestalla 3-2,despite producing a <b>pulsating</b> 2–2 draw at Maine Road in the 1st leg.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of <b>pulsating</b> white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|Close to Gamma Corvi {{and visible}} in the same {{binocular}} field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) variable star. It ranges in brightness from a magnitude of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) <b>pulsating</b> stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.|$|E
