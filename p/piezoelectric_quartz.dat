50|$|A {{stepper motor}} can turn an {{electrical}} impulse in angular movement. This {{type of engine}} is very common in all devices where it is desirable to control the speed or position in open loop, usually in positioning systems. The invention of Lavet is enshrined in French Patent FR823395 and was instrumental, among other applications, {{for the development of}} watches with quartz mechanism, using the principle known as the <b>piezoelectric.</b> <b>Quartz</b> watches are today largely predominate in the world for its low price and its high precision, coming to have a negligible deviation for comuns citizens.|$|E
50|$|In 1880, Pierre and {{his older}} brother Jacques (1856-1941) {{demonstrated}} that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed, i.e. piezoelectricity. To provide accurate measurements needed for their work, Pierre created a highly sensitive instrument called the Curie scale. He used weights, microscopic meter readers, and pneumatic dampeners to create the scale. Also, to aid their work, they invented the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>quartz</b> electrometer. Shortly afterwards, in 1881, they demonstrated the reverse effect: that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field. Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this in the form of crystal oscillators.|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{experimental}} {{data in the}} literature concerning a viscosity difference for normal and equilibrium liquid hydrogen {{may be attributed to}} the limited reproducibility of "oscillating disk" measurements in a liquid-hydrogen environment.

30|$|Due to {{its high}} {{fundamental}} frequencies, high Q property and excellent <b>piezoelectric</b> behaviour, <b>quartz</b> {{has been widely}} used to produce sensors in micro/nano electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), such as accelerometer, pressure sensor, gyro sensor, crystal oscillator and tuning fork biosensor, etc. [1 – 5]. Moreover, quartz is also an ideal substrate material for MEMS/NEMS because of its well-known electrical insulation and chemical stability [6]. As the scale-down of device dimensions continues, {{it is essential to}} explore new nanofabrication methods, especially for nanoscale quartz devices.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, professors Derr and Persinger {{proposed}} that some ignis fatuus may be geologic in origin, piezoelectrically generated under tectonic strain. The strains that move faults would also heat up the rocks, vaporizing {{the water in}} them. Rock or soil containing something <b>piezoelectric,</b> like <b>quartz,</b> silicon, or arsenic, may also produce electricity, channeled {{up to the surface}} through the soil via a column of vaporized water, there somehow appearing as earth lights. This would explain why the lights appear electrical, erratic, or even intelligent in their behavior.|$|R
5000|$|At first, {{electromagnets}} {{controlled by}} analogue resistor/capacitor timers {{were used to}} govern {{the release of the}} second shutter curtain (though still operated by spring power). In 1979, the Yashica Contax 139 Quartz (Japan) introduced more precise digital <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>quartz</b> (shortly followed by ceramic) oscillator circuits (ultimately under digital microprocessor control) to time and sequence its entire exposure cycle - including its vertical FP shutter. Electric [...] "coreless" [...] micromotors, with near instantaneous on/off capability and very high power for their size, would drive both curtains (and other camera systems), replacing springs altogether, in the late 1980s. Minimizing mechanical moving parts also helped to prevent inertial shock vibration problems.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before leaving}} the role of preparer, Bourbouze noticed a young student, Pierre Curie who was {{preparing}} his Bachelor of Science degree in the Faculty of Science. He then took him as assistant to the preparation of François Leroux's physics course at the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie de Paris. Bourbouze also met Jacques Curie who succeeded him at the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie de Paris. In 1886, Bourbouze was the builder of an electrometer and an apparatus {{for the study of}} the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>quartz</b> invited by the Curie brothers.

5000|$|Gravimetric biosensors use {{the basic}} {{principle}} {{of a response}} to a change in mass. Most gravimetric biosensors use thin <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>quartz</b> crystals, either as resonating crystals (QCM), or as bulk/surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. In the majority of these the mass response is inversely proportional to the crystal thickness. Thin polymer films are also used in which biomolecules can be added to the surface with known surface mass. Acoustic waves can be projected to the thin film to produce an oscillatory device, which then follows an equation that is nearly identical to the Sauerbrey equation used in the QCM method. [...] Biomolecules, such as proteins or antibodies can bind and its change in mass gives a measureable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample.|$|E

50|$|Piezoelectricity is {{the ability}} of {{crystals}} to generate a voltage in response to an applied mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect is reversible in that piezoelectric crystals, when subjected to an externally applied voltage, can change shape by a small amount. Polymer materials like rubber, wool, hair, wood fiber, and silk often behave as electrets. For example, the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) exhibits a piezoelectric response several times larger than the traditional <b>piezoelectric</b> material <b>quartz</b> (crystalline SiO2). The deformation (~0.1%) lends itself to useful technical applications such as high-voltage sources, loudspeakers, lasers, as well as chemical, biological, and acousto-optic sensors and/or transducers.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury {{was used}} because the {{acoustic}} impedance of mercury is {{almost exactly the}} same as that of the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>quartz</b> crystals; this minimized the energy loss and the echoes when the signal was transmitted from crystal to medium and back again. The high speed of sound in mercury (1450 m/s) meant that the time needed to wait for a pulse to arrive at the receiving end was less than it would have been with a slower medium, such as air (343.2 m/s), but it also meant that the total number of pulses that could be stored in any reasonably sized column of mercury was limited. Other technical drawbacks of mercury included its weight, its cost, and its toxicity. Moreover, to get the acoustic impedances to match as closely as possible, the mercury had to be kept at a constant temperature. The system heated the mercury to a uniform above-room temperature setting of 40 °C (104 °F), which made servicing the tubes hot and uncomfortable work. (Alan Turing proposed the use of gin as an ultrasonic delay medium, claiming that it had the necessary acoustic properties.) ...|$|E
5000|$|SAAMI {{pressure}} testing protocol uses a conformal <b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>Quartz</b> Transducer for {{pressure testing}} of centerfire pistol and revolver, centerfire rifle, and rimfire cartridges. The {{primary source of}} the conformal transducers is the US company PCB Piezotronics. The SAAMI pressure testing protocol uses test barrels that have a hole located in the chamber at a location specific to the cartridge. The SAAMI conformal transducer is fitted into a hole that penetrates the test barrel chamber {{in such a way}} that the transducer's face, precision machined to match curvature of the chamber wall at the mounting location a specific distance from the breech face, functions as part of the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired the gas pressure causes the cartridge case to expand, contacting the chamber walls. The portion of the cartridge case in contact with the face of the conformal transducer exerts a pressure on the transducer which in turn generates a minute electronic impulse that is amplified and results in a reading in pounds per square inch (psi). The SAAMI conformal transducer has the benefit of not requiring a drilled cartridge case and the corresponding challenges of inserting and alignment required of drilled cartridge case. Instead it requires a simple pressure test of a sample case from the lot of cartridge cases being used in the test ammunition. This pressure test determines the gas pressure required to cause the case to expand and come in contact with the face of the conformal transducer upon firing. This measurement is referred to as the [...] "offset" [...] and makes allowance for the [...] "loss" [...] of that gas pressure prior to the cartridge case coming in contact with the transducer and generating the impulse. The offset is added to the pressure reading to arrive at the peak pressure reading. Other benefits of the SAAMI conformal transducer are: very adaptive to the high volume quality control testing demands of commercial and law enforcement ammunition production; protection of the transducer from direct exposure to the high temperature combustion gases and hence a comparatively long service life; [...] maximum working pressure. Cartridges with the same chamber wall diameter at the mounting point of the transducer and which operate within specific chamber pressure limits may use the same transducer interchangeably reducing instrumentation costs.|$|E
