40|$|The {{insurance}} premiums which constitute the <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> taker {{in the insurance}} fund accumulated by insurance company should be differentiated according {{to the degree of}} risk and the size of possible damage. The average {{insurance premiums}} lead to the disadvantageous selection of risks, namely to the elimination of lesser risks by the heavier ones. Moreover, the average insurance risk does not show any preventive qualities, as it does not contain any incentives inducing to improvements or risks. The differentiation of risks must have, however, some defined limits. Too much differentiation leads to the creation of too small risk classes, which in turn complicate the correct calculation <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> risks.

40|$|Insurance {{offices are}} {{directly}} interested in {{reduction of the}} number and extend of haphazard damages because they have influence on the financial results <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> business. Therefore insurers apply different technical insurance measures to counteract haphazard damages. The offices carry on also preventive activities connected with certain financial expenditure. As a rule the state puts them under obligation to do so because insurance activities are kept under state control. Imposing obligation of preventive activity on insurance offices the state is positive that insurers who liquidate damages and investigate their causes are particularly predestinated {{to take part in}} effective preventing losses. Another reason for the <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> offices in preventive activity is the conviction that to some extent insurance protection affects unfavourably the preventive attitudes of the insurants and may add to the so called subjective risks.

This trend can not be stopped, because we are able to identify more and more risks every day and their identification, processing and management is more challenging.

The foundation of portfolio investment is allocation of investment money between various groups of assets, since it is impossible to predict fulfillment of two conditions at the same time: high reliability and maximum yield. Markowitz model implies standard portfolios, i. e. portfolios that consist only of bought stocks. The first condition may be drawn from the above: all securities must have positive shares, the second condition is the sum of securities shares equal to 1. In order to avoid excess risk, investors will struggle to minimize the yield standard deviation by diversifying the capital between different objects of investment.

In 1947, Kurt Levin {{who was the first}} scientist paid attention to survey the effective factors of productivity based on analysis of force field. The purpose of present study was to conduct a survey on effective factors on hospital services (analytical approaches of impellent and preventive power on hospital services). The survey was conducted based on quantitative analysis of cross-sectional studies in terms of time in series design in several groups. The survey was carried out among groups of physician, nurses and supportive services in Imam Khomeini hospital (Sari, Iran). Data were analyzed with ANOVA, t-Test and correlation coefficients. The average age of groups was 36. 63. There was significant correlation between education, monthly wages and relationship with subordinates. The averages of the advantages as impellent and preventive factors were (p< 0. 001), (p< 0. 02), (p< 0. 0), respectively. In addition, there was significant correlation between job set and the average of advantage as impellent factors. Finally, the power of impellent factors in the medical group is more than preventive. The power of preventive factors is also more than impellent factors in nursing services groups and support services (p= 0. 00, p< 0. 001). The obtained results had indicate that the power of prevent factors is more than impellent factors in nursing services and support services.

However, after almost three years of the implementation of this reform, the system is even further away from accomplishing these objectives. Current statistics show that many Peruvian citizens do not have a health insurance, and that the new Private-Public framework is not wide enough to cover the majority of the population, specially the poorest people. Private insurance companies (EPSs) seem to be oriented to insure large companies rather than small ones (the majority in Peru) while the public insurance would cover the low-income population. Other characteristics of the Peruvian reform are the scarce <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> these private <b>insurance</b> companies in the provinces and its minimum participation in voluntary insurance.

40|$|Die Commenda diente im Mittelalter zur Finanzierung von Seehandelsreisen typischerweise rund um das Mittelmeer. Sie gilt als die Vorgängerin der Kommanditgesellschaft. Wesentliche Merkmale der Commenda waren ihre auf eine Handelsreise begrenzte Dauer, die Haftungsfreistellung des – redlichen – reisenden Kaufmannes und seine Gewinnbeteiligung von meist einem Viertel. Die Ursprünge der Institution scheinen im arabischen Karawanenhandel zu liegen, auch bei jüdischen Händlern, im byzantinischen Reich, ja sogar im alten Babylon lassen sich Vorgänger festmachen. Am Beispiel Venedig wird gezeigt, wie zwischen dem 11. und 13. Jahrhundert die Voraussetzungen für das Aufblühen der Collegantia, der venezianischen Variante der Commenda, geschaffen wurden. Wesentliche Faktoren waren in Venedig u. a. die dominierende Kaufmannsoligarchie, die öffentliche Regulierung und Förderung der Handelsschifffahrt und die enge Beziehung zu Byzanz. Auf Basis umfangreicher Primärquellen, besonders der vielen aus dieser Zeit erhaltenen Notariatsakte, lässt sich ganz spezifisch zeigen, wie sich das günstige Umfeld auf die Formwahl der Marktteilnehmer auswirkte. Die Commenda war ein wesentliches Element der als „Kommerzielle Revolution“ bezeichneten Wachstumsphase des Hochmittelalters. Die moderne Private Equity Industrie gilt als Motor wirtschaftlichen Wachstums. Es wird gezeigt, dass sie die soeben erwähnten wesentlichen Merkmale mit der Commenda teilt. Der überwiegende Anteil der Private Equity Gesellschaften ist als Limited Partnership strukturiert, die einer Kommanditgesellschaft entspricht. Beide Institutionen sind typische Risikogeschäfte mit ausgeprägter Informationsasymmetrie. Der historische Ansatz der Neuen Institutionenökonomie liefert eine Methode, um die Übereinstimmung der beiden Institutionen zu vergleichen. Es kann so erklärt werden, wie analoge Problemstellungen auch in ganz anderem historischen Kontext zu analogen Lösungen führten. Ein Schlüssel ist hierbei die Prinzipal-Agent Theorie, die Transaktionskostentheorie und die neoinstitutionelle Vertragstheorie. Es lässt sich so ein historisches Forschungslabor konstruieren, in dem die Kausalität der besonderen Merkmale von Private Equity Gesellschaften beleuchtet werden kann. Commenda {{was used}} to finance medieval trading voyages {{typically}} across the Mediterranean. Commendae are predecessors of limited partnerships – in German “Kommanditgesellschaften”. Significant attributes were their term, limited by {{the duration of the}} voyage, the limited liability of the honest merchant and his <b>profit</b> <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> mostly a quarter. The roots of this institution are probably {{to be found in the}} Arabian caravan trade. Jewish, Byzantine, and even Babylonian traders used different forms of predecessors. Venice in the period between the 11 th and 13 th century is shown as an example how a favourable environment was created for the Collegantia, the Venetian form of the Commenda. Important factors were among others the dominating merchant oligarchy, public regulation and promotion of merchant shipping and the close relations to Constantinople. Based on an abundance of primary sources, specifically notary acts, it can be shown how this beneficial environment influenced the contract selection of market participants. The Commenda was an important driver of the “Commercial Revolution” as the period of growth during the High Middle Ages is called. Modern Private Equity is regarded as an engine of economic growth. It is demonstrated that Private Equity shares significant attributes with the Commenda. The vast majority of Private Equity projects are structured as limited partnerships. Both institutions are typical risk transactions with a marked information asymmetry. The historical approach of New Institutional Economics offers a method to compare the similarities of these two institutions. It can be shown how similar problems lead to analogues solutions despite a different historical context. The principal agent-, transaction cost- and contract-theories are central to this analysis. Thus an historical laboratory can be constructed, shining light on the contractual particularities of modern Private Equity. ...|$|R
