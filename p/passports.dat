5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all <b>passports</b> to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the <b>passports,</b> disposing of any American <b>passports</b> by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats.

40|$|The {{prominent}} {{problem in}} <b>passport</b> authentication is to authenticate the <b>passport</b> document for its owner. The critical factor of this authentication procedure {{is to establish}} a correspondence between <b>Passport's</b> photo and its owner. A <b>passport</b> document contains holder details in supplement to the holder’s signature. We propose an authentication scheme by extracting some details of the holder including <b>passport</b> number, converting them into a watermark and digesting them in a form by applying some techniques that can be hidden in the <b>passport's</b> photo. The computers have revolutionized the <b>passport</b> authentication process by using the computer in fixing the <b>passport</b> photo on the <b>passport</b> document during the issuing of <b>passport</b> and also verifying the <b>passport</b> at checkpoint by scanning. During the issue of <b>passport,</b> a watermark can be created based on the details of the holder full name and <b>passport</b> number and it can be hidden in the <b>passport</b> photo using watermarking technique. With the help of this technique, during the <b>passport</b> verification process at the checkpoint, computer can be used in scanning the <b>passport</b> photo to check whether the <b>passport</b> photo has been replaced by comparing the invisible watermark hidden in the <b>passport</b> photo with the holder’s details including the full name and <b>passport</b> number...|$|R
