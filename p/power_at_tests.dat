40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{numerical}} simulation and control optimization of あ wave energy converter to estimate the <b>power</b> <b>at</b> a <b>test</b> site in the Izu Islands. In Japan, ocean energy is once again being seriously considered; however, since there are many inherent problems due to severe conditions such as the strong swells and large waves, estimations are important when designing such devices. The numerical simulation method in this study combines the wave interaction analysis software WAMIT and an in-house time-domain simulation code using the Newmark-β method, and introduces approximate complex-conjugate control into the code. The optimized parameters were assessed for a regular sine wave and an irregular wave with a typical wave spectrum. With the optimized parameters, average and maximum output power were estimated for the observed wave data <b>at</b> the <b>test</b> site. The results show a more than 100 kW average power output and a several times larger maximum power output. ...|$|R

The daily maximums of such test statistics admit an asymptotic generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with a strictly positive shape parameter, as opposed to the limiting Gumbel distribution with a shape parameter zero for i. i. d.
