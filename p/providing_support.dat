5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of defenses south of the capital city, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I, IX, and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces on 25 January, Operation Thunderbolt. The three corps advanced north with IX Corps {{at the center of}} the line, on both sides of the Han River. The corps were to advance steadily northward, protected by heavy artillery and close air support, until they captured Seoul. IX Corps was tasked with capturing Chipyong-ni, southeast of Seoul while <b>providing</b> <b>support</b> to the other two corps. However, it encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces dug into the hilly country around Chipyong-ni and was still bogged down in combat by 2 February.

5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, <b>providing</b> <b>support</b> for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
