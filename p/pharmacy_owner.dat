40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} Finnish {{community pharmacy}} owners' {{requirements for the}} next generation of software systems. Design: Descriptive, nonexperimental, cross-sectional study. Setting: Finland during December 2006. Participants: 308 independent <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners.</b> Intervention: Survey listing 126 features that could potentially be included in the new information technology (IT) system. The list was grouped into five categories: (1) drug information and patient counseling, (2) medication safety, (3) interprofessional collaboration, (4) pharmacy services, and (5) pharmacy internal processes. Main outcome measure: Perceived value of potential features for a new IT system. Results: The survey was mailed to all independent <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> in Finland (n = 580; response rate 53 % [n = 308]). Respondents gave priority to logistical functions and functions related to drug information and patient care. The highest rated individual features were tracking product expiry (rated as very or quite important by 100 % of respondents), computerized drug-drug interaction screening (99 %), an electronic version of the national pharmaceutical reference book (97 %), and a checklist-type drug information database to assist patient counseling (95 %). Conclusion: In addition to the high ranking for logistical features, Finnish <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> put a priority on support for cognitive pharmaceutical services in the next IT system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Every {{activity}} of a pharmacy is related {{in some measure}} to the financial results of the business. The need for sound financial management permeates almost every phase of pharmacy operations. Pharmacy bankruptcies were at a 20 -year high in 1961. The lack of specific literature on pharmacy financial management, especially at the state level, was instrumental in provoking this study. The failure record of pharmacies, the lack of published literature, and the decreasing profit margin indicates {{a need for more}} study in this aspect of management. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent and by what methods Oregon <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> plan and control their financial operations. A secondary purpose was to determine what effect, if any, sales volume, form of ownership, and type of store have upon their financial management and operating results. Finally, this study was conducted to determine the depth and breadth of academic background preparation of the <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> and their opinions on its adequacy in preparing them for the role of a business manager.

40|$|The {{retail sector}} {{has been at}} the center of recent policy debates {{concerning}} its role in malaria control programs in Africa. This article closely examines the perspectives of owners and managers of retail pharmacies and drug shops in Dar es Salaam, toward the dominant public health discourse and practices surrounding the deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a way forward in malaria control. Drawing on fieldwork conducted between May-August 2007, and July-August 2009, involving in-depth interviews and participant observation in pharmacies and drug shops in Dar es Salaam, the article describes the social realities facing people who manage retail pharmacies, the nature of their interactions with customers, the kinds of antimalarials they sell, and their perspective on how the new malaria treatment guidelines have affected their business. Findings suggest that for most <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> and managers, it is 'business as usual' concerning the sale of conventional antimalarials, with a majority reporting that the introduction of ACT in public health facilities had not negatively affected their business. Implications of the research findings are examined in the context of proposed interventions to make <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> and managers more socially responsible and adhere to government health regulations. The article makes a case for actively involving <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> and managers in decision making processes surrounding the implementation of new treatment guidelines, and training programs that have an impact on their business, social responsibility, and community health. In considering regulatory interventions, health planners must explicitly address the concern that retail pharmacies fill an important role in the country's health care system, and that the complex nexus that drives the global pharmaceutical market often governs their operations at the local level.

40|$|Objective - The {{objective}} of the research was to examine to what extent community pharmacists in Great Britain believed that their job was concerned with local public health issues. Methods - The project (Pharmacy and Public Health) received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Life and Health Sciences at Aston University. After piloting, in August 2006 a self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to practicing community pharmacists in Great Britain (n= 1998), with a follow-up to non-responders 4 weeks later. A final response rate of 51 % (n= 1023 / 1998) was achieved. Results - Respondents {{were asked to indicate}} their answer to the question “to what extent is your present job concerned with local public health issues?” on a three-point scale – “highly”, “slightly” or “not at all” concerned with public health. They were also asked to indicate whether they were <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners,</b> employee pharmacists or self-employed locum pharmacists. Less than half (43 %,n= 384 / 898) of respondents answering both questions believed that their job was highly concerned with public health. A relationship was observed between employment status and the level to which a respondent believed that their job was concerned with public health (chi-square test with P= 0. 001). Over half of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> (51 %, n= 68 / 134) considered that their job was highly concerned with public health compared to 44 % (n= 193 / 443) of employee pharmacists and 38 % (n= 123 / 321) of locum pharmacists. Conclusion - This research suggests that community pharmacists in Great Britain are not ‘fully engaged’ with public health. <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>owners</b> may feel more enfranchised in the public health movement than their employees and locums. Indeed, one-in-ten locums reported that their job was not at all concerned with public health which, as locum pharmacists constitute over a third of actively employed community pharmacists, could be limiting factor in any drive to strengthen the public health function of community pharmacists...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{essay is}} a fictional short {{story about an}} independent <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owner</b> in rural America. The illustration is intended to draw the reader {{into the life of}} this pharmacist-protagonist and the legacy of his pharmacist father [...] provoking thoughts about the potential one dedicated pharmacist may have on a community. I attempt to illustrate the depth and breadth of relationships that may develop in rural communities, the innovations in service, and the opportunities that rural community pharmacists have to work in conjunction with physicians, other health care providers, and patients themselves to provide needed care to community members. The number of independently owned community pharmacies in the United States declined 35 % between the years of 1990 and 1998 (NACDS, 1999). A recent analysis of the availability of community pharmacies reveals a trend of fewer community pharmacies in rural areas (Doucette, Brooks, Sorofman & Wong, 1999). This suggests potential problems with access to pharmacy services among those people living in rural areas, and in particular, those who earn less than the poverty level. With these trends in mind, {{it is my hope that}} the reader may gain a greater understanding of the plight of, and th...|$|E

In 2006, the Medical Act releasing NRT from pharmacy only to general sales was amended. This study assesses the Finnish pharmacy owners' and staff pharmacists' perceptions of NRT products' role and usage patterns {{about a year after}} the deregulation. Methods A nationwide survey was conducted, targeting every second Finnish <b>pharmacy</b> <b>owner</b> and staff pharmacist (nÂ =Â  2291), working in community pharmacies. Response rate 54 % (nÂ =Â  1190). Results According to respondents, inappropriate usage of NRT, like possible addiction, products' misuse or use in harm reduction purposes, exists in Finland. NRT sales have decreased at pharmacies and clients obtain only the counselling for NRT at pharmacy but buy the products elsewhere. The motivation to counsel NRT customers has diminished among 30 % of pharmacy owners and 17 % of staff pharmacists. Still the respondents found that it is pharmacists' duty to offer SC counselling and NRT important in SC. Conclusions Despite NRT products' sales at pharmacies having decreased and especially pharmacy owners' motivation to counsel NRT usage having diminished, pharmacists still see it as their duty to guide and support SC.
