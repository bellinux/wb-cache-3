40|$|Purpose: Network {{design of}} the supply chain is an {{important}} and strategic aspect of logistics management. In this paper, we address the network design problem specific to <b>packaged</b> <b>gases</b> (cylinder) supply chain. We propose an integrated framework that allows for {{the determination of the}} optimal facility locations, the filling plant production capacities, the inventory at plants and hubs, and the number of packages to be routed in primary and secondary transportation. Design/methodology/approach: We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program and then develop a decomposition approach to solve it. We illustrate the proposed framework with numerical examples from real-life <b>packaged</b> <b>gases</b> supply chain. The results show that the decomposition approach is effective in solving a broad range of problem sizes. Findings: The main finding of this paper is that decomposing the network design problem into two sub-problems is very effective to tackle the real-life large scale network design problems occurring in cylinder gas distribution by optimizing strategic and tactical decisions and approximating the operational decisions. We also benchmark the results from the decomposition approach by solving the complete <b>packaged</b> <b>gases</b> network design model for smaller test cases.

Types of food benefits included protection against oxidation; controlled release of encapsulated ingredients (moisture or pH); test disguising; delivery of nanoencapsulated nutrient substances, vitamins, and flavors; pathogen detection in food systems; food safety; and quality analysis. Some food packaging applications included improved <b>packaging</b> (<b>gas</b> and moisture barriers, tensile strength); shelf-life extension via active packaging, nanoadditives, intelligent packaging, nutraceutical delivery, and controlled release; antibacterial effects of self-cleaning packaging; and product condition monitoring during transportation.

These applications include intelligent packaging, which is able to interact with the food product.

In this work, we present a wireless gas sensor node in which a widely used Wheatstone sensing circuit based on two sensors is exchanged with a single sensor circuit, {{as well as the}} associate gas measurement procedure. The core of the measurement procedure is the four-stage heating profile, which enables low power consumption of sensing circuit and thermo compensation adjustment. A thermo compensation algorithm is capable of avoiding the effect of the environmental temperature on the measurements by keeping stable zero-offset within ± 1 mV and ensuring low absolute error within 0. 1 % vol.

Then the model was applied to predict the RH in MAP of fresh Lentinula edodes (one kind of Chinese mushroom).

In general, the model predictions agreed well with the experimental data, except that the model predictions were slightly high in the initial period. The effect of the initial gas composition on the RH in packages was notable. In MAP of lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide concentrations, the ascending rate of the RH was reduced, and the RH inside packages was saturated slowly during storage.
